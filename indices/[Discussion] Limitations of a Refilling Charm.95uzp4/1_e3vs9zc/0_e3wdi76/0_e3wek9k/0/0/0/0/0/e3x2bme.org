  So how do you duplicate food because as you said you can't create it from nothing.
#+end_quote

I'm not quite sure what you mean. You duplicate food if you have food in the first place.

  In this case if you invoke something do you need to know from where?
#+end_quote

From itself. It's like cells duplicating. A cell won't be created out of nothing, but it can be from another cell. It's the same in this case. You can turn an apple into two apples, but you can't turn a rock into an apple. But rather than energy/nutritions fueling the duplication of these cells/apples, it's magic.
