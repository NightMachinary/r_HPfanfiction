Indeed you can't. So how do you duplicate food because as you said you can't create it from nothing. A wine is food. Liquid yes but it's (most likely) processed aged grape juice.

I don't argue to be annoying and all (even if I'm probably am) but with the lack of proper rules and some that are cannon (can't transfigure/conjure food... or maybe you can but it won't be actual useful food) the duplication, refilling in this case, of food shouldn't work except if you invoke from somewhere else.

In this case if you invoke something do you need to know from where? Because if not it might not work or worse you might randomly steal someone without knowing. Does Harry knows where to take this wine from?

Ugh JKR magical system is just so headaches inducting.
