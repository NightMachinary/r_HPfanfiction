No it doesn't. Transfiguration in and of itself is creating matter out of nothing, regardless of if it's food or not.

I look at it like creating an adult out of a baby. You can't create an adult out of nothing, but give it enough time and the baby will become an adult. In this case, replace /time/ with /magic./
