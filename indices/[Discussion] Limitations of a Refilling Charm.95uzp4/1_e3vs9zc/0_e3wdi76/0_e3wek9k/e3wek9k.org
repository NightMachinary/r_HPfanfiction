But what is duplication? Getting more of what exist already yes but if you have one apple you have the physical material for one apple. So You duplicate it to two apples. Where does this second apple comes from? You gain more matter from where, from what? This has to come from somewhere. I think duplication is a form of conjuration which takes a model as patron and makes it easier to make complex objects or reduce the thought process needed but in the end duplication still is creating matter.

So from what? Will it be everlasting? Does it revert or disappear after a time? This only spell goes against what we know about conjuration and transfiguration.
