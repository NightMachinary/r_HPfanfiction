Yup. The potions the gang drinks to get to the Philosopher's Stone are mentioned to be in "auto-refilling flasks." However, it's explicitly stated that these flasks just summon more potion from somewhere else.

It was a nice touch I thought to explaining how Quirrel can get to the stone, but then Harry also needs to drink the same potion later.
