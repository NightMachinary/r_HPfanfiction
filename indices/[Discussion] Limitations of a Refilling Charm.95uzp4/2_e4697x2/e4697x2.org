"Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration" --Hermione Granger, DH

Logically, money should be another Principal Exception, otherwise everyone would be super rich/magical economy wouldn't even matter. Remember the coins from the World Cup? I'd guess duplicating food works something like that, the copy food would just disappear after a while, not giving you the nutrients you need.

The Refilling Charm, in my understanding, works more like a Summoning Charm, so more of the liquid would already have to exist somewhere and would only be transferred into the cup or whatever. Otherewise, who would ever even need to pay for Butterbeer, if you could just buy one and share it with 1000 people?

Magic, just like characters, should not be OP, even if it sometimes feel like it is.

(I remember a discussion about whether you could eat a cake, then summon it from your stomach and eat it again, since you can't actually magically create the cake XD)
