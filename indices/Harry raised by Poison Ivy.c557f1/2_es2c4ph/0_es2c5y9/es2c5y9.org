#+begin_quote
  Lily and James weren't Harry's parents. They were his aunt and uncle. Petunia decides she shouldn't have to raise her nephew when his mother is perfectly capable of doing it herself. She tracks down her wayward sister who enjoys attacking people with giant plants, and quickly washes her hands of the entire situation. Now, Gotham and Batman have a new young villain to deal with.
