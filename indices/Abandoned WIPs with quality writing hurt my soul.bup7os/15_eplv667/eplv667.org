The amount of whining entitlement on this thread is incredible. You're being given something for free. Free as in beer. If an author doesn't finish a story for whatever reason, the correct response is to say "Thank you" for what they wrote and then move on.

Saying [it] "hurt my soul" is pathetic. Saying "It's one of the worst things in the world." is idiotic. Saying "I refuse to read WIPs anymore." is disrespectful.

It's always disappointing when a good story isn't finished but that's fanfiction for you. Live with it or go read proper books instead.
