Nah, I really don't feel bad about this post. I was irked when I finished reading an abandoned WIP. That's perfectly acceptable.

Now I don't find myself agreeing with certain comments like that “WIP authors aren't real writers” or “No one should ever delete their work”, etc.

The whole point about FanFiction is the freedom to create content. That means while you may not like it, people will have opinions about what, how and why certain content is created the way it is.
