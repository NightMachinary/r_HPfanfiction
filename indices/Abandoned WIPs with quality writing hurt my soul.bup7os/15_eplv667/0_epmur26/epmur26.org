I always laugh at, "I wont read any WIPs!" coming from "Good stories are never finished!"

You know a way to try to make it so they are? Interact with the writers, talk to them about them, and make them excited to write. Writing is hard. Fanfiction writing is incredibly unfulfilling. There ARE times where I spend a month writing a chapter and it gets 8 reviews in two weeks and I think, "well that was a waste of my time."

Then the very same people who wont read a WIP, or ever leave a damn review that matters, are the ones then calling me entitled for deciding that I have better things to do with my life than spend ninety hours writing a chapter that 900 people read.
