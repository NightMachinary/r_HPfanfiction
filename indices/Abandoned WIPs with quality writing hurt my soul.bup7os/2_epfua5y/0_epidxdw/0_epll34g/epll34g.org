Sure thing, I wont add them all theres too many but heres some: linkffn(Ex Sanguis by Aytheria) She rewrote this but both stories are WIP linkffn(Harry Potter and the Demon Knights by Potter-Pikachu) Her style of writing is amazing, brings a smile to my face everytime I read it linkffn(Harry Potter and the Godfather that Lived by Kappalota) This has a sequel which has been WIP dead since 2014 linkffn(Ectomancer by RustyRed) A bit crazy but interesting linkffn(Safety by hairnorhide) Kind of angsty linkffn(Undead Secrets by BitterIcing) A wild ride linkffn(Of Titans and Dreams by threelade) Such a different concept just wish it wasn't abandoned linkffn(Three Lives Relived: Time Turners & Unforgivables by Jordina) linkao3(The Twelfth Self by AuraWhiteFox) This is a Dr. Who crossover but it's good so I added it
