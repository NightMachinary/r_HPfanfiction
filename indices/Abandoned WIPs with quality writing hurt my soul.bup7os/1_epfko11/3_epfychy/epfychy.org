Or the last chapter is quickly stitched together by turning the story to the premature completion. I would really love to read truly complete “Terms of Matrimony” by Galad Estel (see [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][my post]] about where to find it, it is a bit more complicated; there are spoilers there, but I really don't think there is much mystery there, quality of writing is more important). To quote the Queen of Hearts “Off with their heads for spoiling such stories!”
