That's why I refuse to read WIPs anymore. (Sorry to any fantastic authors who post WIPs, I get why, but I'll wait til you're finished until I read.)

Occasionally you'll get a fic that isn't finished but the author marked it as finished just because "well I'm not going to update it anymore" and that's even /more/ frustrating :)
