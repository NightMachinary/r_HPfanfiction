It's the cycle of fandom.

You discover a new, young writer who isn't amazing but shows potential: you stick with the bad writing and cliches for the interesting ideas underneath and the slowly developing ability to characterise. As you keep reading and following, they improve in leaps and bounds! Soon, their writing is legitimately good, and you want to tell everyone, but! The updates start to slow down. Life starts to take over, as they grow up and take on responsibilities. Also, they've lost the unselfconscious flow they used to have, as they now know enough to judge themselves.

Finally, they go on to use their fandom-honed writing skills to make some actual money, out in the real world, and you can't begrudge them it, really. But they leave their old account behind. Maybe, if you're very unlucky, they delete it all as old-shame or so they can rework it as original fic.

Unless you're finding fully-grown authors who've started late and write entirely as a hobby around their already established (and stable) lives, this is just how it always has to go.
