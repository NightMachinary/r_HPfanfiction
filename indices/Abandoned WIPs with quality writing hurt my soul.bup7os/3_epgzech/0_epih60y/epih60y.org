Hahahahahaha this describes me so well. Since uni began I've written maybe 10k words (so in threeish years). Responsibilities and having to finance your own life suddenly become more important than writing up story.... actually, I've been thinking about deleting most of my stories that I wrote 5ish years ago (that's the shame)
