In the context of interrupted works, I would draw a distinction between "great cake" and "great baking". A cake that was never iced or decorated in any way would be expected to win no contests, yet it may be an excellent specimen of a cake as far as it goes - in texture, color, flavor, etc - thus making the inability to finish all the more disappointing.
