But you can't really judge a story until it's completed. For example, while I don't necessarily agree with the opinion, a number of people consider Delenda Est's quality to have taken a nose dive in its second half. And I remember a story completely ruined by the last chapter with a cheap "dramatic twist".

Ultimately, it's like baking a cake. I don't judge your dough - I only judge your cake. And if you never finish baking it, it's not a great cake.
