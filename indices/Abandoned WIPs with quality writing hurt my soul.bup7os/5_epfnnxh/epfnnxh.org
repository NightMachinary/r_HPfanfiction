It's never bothered me that much - for me, it's all about how much /content/ a fic has, not whether it has an ending or not. It's not even about length, given the tendency of fanfic authors to write lots of filler which is copy/pasted from other fanfics (e.g. the indy!Harry Gringotts routine, the Sirius Black trial routine, the OTT abused Harry rescued from the Dursleys routine).

It's entirely possible for a 20k word abandoned WIP to have more /content/ than a 200k word completed fic.

At its root, this comes back to the fact that I view fanfiction as a sandbox more than anything else. I read fics to see interesting and novel ideas which I can then discuss with other fans rather than stories /per se/. The original books will always be the "true story" of the HP world.
