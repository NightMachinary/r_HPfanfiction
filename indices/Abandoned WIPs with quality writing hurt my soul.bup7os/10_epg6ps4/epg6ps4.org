Yeah, it's frustrating. Especially if the author did something to make you think that it is a complete story - i.e. you find a fic marked as complete, and then it goes to some point (i.e. end of year 2 of Hogwarts), author says he will continue in another fic... and there's been no continuation whatsoever even though it's been like 3 years since that announcment.

Or if you find a fairly new one, with only a chapter or two, read it, and then there it falls silent forever. Especially when it's posted on some forum and not ffnet - some discussions up the page-count really hard only for you to find there is like 15k words worth of content.
