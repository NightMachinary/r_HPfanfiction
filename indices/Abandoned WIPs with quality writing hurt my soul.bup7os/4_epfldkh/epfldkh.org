As someone who reads fics from multiple fandoms, including some miniscule, fairly inactive ones, a dead, quality WIP is the absolute worst. At least with the big fandoms there's a chance that someone somewhere will right something good enough to scratch that itch. With small fandoms, someone might not even write a similar idea, let alone finding a fic with quality writing over 5k words. And then the fandoms that require in-depth technical knowledge and genuine passion about the subject, not just the characters, and suddenly you have maybe 10 fics that are good that aren't about romance.

That's how I'd describe my current feelings towards the Hikaru no Go fandom. Maybe about 3k, 4k at best fics in existence, most of them no longer than 3k words, with the vast majority of them romance, particularly slash, which I'm not very into. I'd rather read about the main focus of the manga, which is Go, and barely anyone writes that. And of those who do, hardly anyone knows anything about the game. It's frustrating.

Sorry. \end rant
