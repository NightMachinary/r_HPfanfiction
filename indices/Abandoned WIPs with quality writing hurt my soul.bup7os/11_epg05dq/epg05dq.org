Nope! I just rationalize that if it was a good story, they end up overcoming their problems and defeating Voldemort or whatever else. All happy endings are the same, really, and they don't make /me/ happy because it means the end of a good story.

So... I hate when a good story ends, whether it's tied off neatly or not! I'd rather read a 100k+ well-written story that's unfinished than a 40k well-written story that's marked "complete", simply because there is /more/ of the longer story. And I will always read WIPs or abandoneds because I'd much rather have read half of a great story than none of it at all.

The one thing that does hurt is running out of story unexpectedly, I have learned to watch the number of chapters and wind down my expectations as I near the end of that count.
