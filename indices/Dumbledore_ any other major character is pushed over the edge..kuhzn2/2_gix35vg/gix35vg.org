I've thought that Dumbledore going apeshit would be a damn good story. I always imagined him meeting Voldemort in the Ministry after Sirius is killed and instead of back-and-forth banter and then the duel he just ups and goes for the kill. I mean the man has the Death Stick so the only real reason Voldemort got away was that Dumbledore stopped fighting him.

Killing Voldemort just as the ministry workers show up so they all see Voldemort's soul talking shit before it flees and Dumbledore just floats his corpse behind him while he orders the minister and his flunkies around.

Dumbledore gets fed up and figures that if Voldemort can't be killed permanently, well he can die. Over and over until Harry is ready to finish the prophecy or Voldemort just gets so tired of being eviserated that he decides to hide out until everyone alive has died so he doesn't have to get turned inside out and constantly murdered.
