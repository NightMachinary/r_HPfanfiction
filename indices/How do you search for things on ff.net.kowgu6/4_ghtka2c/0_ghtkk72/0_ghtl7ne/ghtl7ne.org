I tended to find quality was worse on ff.net but maybe that's because I was able to search more specifically on ao3, and the quality is about the same on each site. I think a lot of current writers are posting on both sites or on ao3 only, maybe it is worth having another go on ao3? Albeit my ff.net account dated back to my tweens and I had the cringiest 13 year old profile page ever, I have since immortalised it on my pc. You can't get beautiful nostalgic travesties like that on ao3 for sure
