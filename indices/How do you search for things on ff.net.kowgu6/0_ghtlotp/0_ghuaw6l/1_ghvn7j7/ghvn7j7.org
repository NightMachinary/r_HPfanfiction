It doesn't work half the time. Every once in a while, I go on ao3 to search for death eater Harry fics, as I'm pretty certain I've read all the decent ones on FFN. I try to filter out HP/LV fics as I don't like the concept of Harry joining the death eaters because he fell in love. I start out just crossing out HP/LV, then HP/TMR, then increasingly more related tags, eventually just completely excluding M/M. It still pops up like five HP/LV fics in the first page of results.
