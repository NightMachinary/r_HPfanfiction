I tend to just filter by favorites and then skip a few pages to filter out the ones I've certainly read lol, or go in with a genre in mind. Or characters you want to see as a pairing. Just take one aspect you want to see and then go from there I guess.

Sorry if I've missed the point slightly but hope it helps.
