You know what /I/ do when I see a prompt I don't like? I move on. I don't reply to it, I might not read it all, or I might not even open it to begin with. I just say "Not for me" and go to the next one.

Also, on two of the "reasons" you gave...

#+begin_quote
  They are unrealistic
#+end_quote

Not really a problem for a good writer. A good enough writer can take /any/ prompt, no matter how silly or "unrealistic", and make it work.

#+begin_quote
  wizards aren't stupid
#+end_quote

Depends on what metric we're using to define "stupid".
