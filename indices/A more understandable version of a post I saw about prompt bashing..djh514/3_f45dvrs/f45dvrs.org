I haven't seen any bashing so far but that might be due to ne next t clicking on eg super unrealistic prompts. I do however sometimes comment if there is a problem with the basis of the prompt - eg “instead of x the mc does y” and I'm like “but no one in canon did x”

I think some people use the prompt flair incorrectly and they actually have a request and not a prompt. A prompt should spark something inside of you. It should be an interesting premise and open for interpretation. If it is like in the example someone else here gave (the person posting a prompt several time) - it's too specific. “What if one of Voldemort's Horcruxes developed a life of its own” it would be a nice prompt and I have plenty of ideas on how to realize it. But then saying “he has a dark lordship and is barman Tom” is like the whole story already and someone just wants someone else to write exactly their idea.

Other than that, I agree that a good writer can make the most unrealistic prompts work. They are written so well you start to wonder why the weird crack idea wasn't canon as it makes so much sense.
