Mods, in case you're reading this a day later and are thinking of taking action.

For what it's worth I strongly disagree with this idea, as I do more generally with rule 9. But particularly the spreading of this idea of /only/ non-contradictory digitzed thought being acceptable.

The examples of "bashing" do not fit any definition of bashing that I would agree to (particularly of a personal kind). Traditionally the inverse, if anything, would be bashing. ie. "Wizards(/Muggles/Weasleys) /are/ stupid"

What if I post as part of the prompt "Hermione is stupid" or 'Harry devours the Dursleys in a cannibalistic magical ritual' Is it bashing to say "Hermione isn't stupid"? That she got Outstanding grades? or that "[Harry] would never do that"? Can you even be sure if I'm dead serious or if this is crack (I've read things that come close), and thus what is an appropriate response? You can call them at a stroke unwanted, complaining, and unhelpful, but they should NOT be against the rules.

A public post should expect and accept comments, and there can be nothing so mild as cannot be opined on or disagreed about (or, it seems, labelled as bashing). I agree with taure that discussion, albeit taken different form, is the name of the game even in 'prompt' threads.

Basically if the rule spreads then you will have little sandboxes where only those willing to play to the dictates of a given poster are allowed. Children need to learn to play together, I don't think it is asking too much for adults (or teens) to either.

To take it further, what is the purpose of a Prompt? Is it an open post to the community at large to engage with an idea, or a form to be filled by card carrying members of a particular club?

/Good/ prompt threads to me seem to be an amusing idea/plot bunny that is there to be shared, and the best would include their own, be reciprocated, and have feedback and discussion.

But there is a bad. Its selfish, revealed in the desire not to share, discuss, and amuse one another but to have done what I am unwilling to do, to fulfill my desires, in the way I want, without (counter or even somewhat differing) opinion or discussion.

A spirit of understanding is required on all sides. To take the 'Harry devours the Dursleys in a cannibalisitc magical ritual' example, to respond with a 'Eww' 'nope' or "[Harry] would never do that" is natural and should be expected. So should a response of 'I know, but go with me'.

But what if someone responds with 'thats absolutely disgusting, what's wrong with you'? They may have a strong sensory imagination and found to be reasonable when further engaged. Or, they may very well be a bad actor, in either case I trust the common community to recognize it as they do insightful, humurous, malicious, and pointless comments, and (down)vote or (dis)agree in turn.

As in life there are unwanted, unhelpful, and hurtful comments. I don't think we have an excess of the latter, and they should not be misconstrued with the former. Please allow discussion by allowing for judgement (generally first and foremost by the community) to naturally occur on a comment by comment and thread by thread basis. Thank you.
