Let's be honest: no prompt thread has ever resulted in a person going away and writing a fic. They are in effect discussion threads under a different name. At best someone might write some very short drabble which is little more than a discussion post in narrative rather than analytical prose.

The only reason why prompt threads have any value to the community is because they sometimes generate interesting discussion. If we get rid of that, we might as well get rid of prompt threads altogether.
