Is it bashing to suggest OP's make an attempt to write their own prompts, if no one has responded? We have had problems with users reposting the same prompts again and again, because there wasn't anyone interested in it, except for the OP.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bvjj88/prompt_a_horcrux_accidentally_got_most_of/epppuax/][And example is one prompt that was reposted three times]]. For some reason, people were outraged at the idea of the OP writing their own plot bunnies. I don't understand why, because the entire situation of asking for unpaid volunteers to write your story idea is basically [[/r/choosingbeggars][r/choosingbeggars]] with extra steps.
