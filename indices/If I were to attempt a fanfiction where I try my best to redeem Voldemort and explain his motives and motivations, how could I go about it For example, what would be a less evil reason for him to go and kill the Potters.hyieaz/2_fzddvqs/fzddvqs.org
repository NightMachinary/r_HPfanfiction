Honestly for him to be redeemable he needs to be fighting for a different cause, because his canon one is pretty much wizard Nazis and as we all know there's no excusing or redeeming them.

I'd pick a morally sound goal, but keep similar methods (mostly just ditch the torture), he'd still have masked and mostly anonymous followers and still kill those who stand in his way, still leave the dark mark over their homes as a calling card etc.

It's really up to you whether horcruxes are ok here, murdering an innocent to prolong your own life is pretty evil, but whether you can keep them and be redeemed is hard to say (remember that canonically they don't negatively affect the creator).

Honestly you can keep his reasons for attacking the Potters the same, they're fighting against him and their child is apparently the only one who could ever beat him, simple self preservation says they have to go and a fear of death should still be part of his character.
