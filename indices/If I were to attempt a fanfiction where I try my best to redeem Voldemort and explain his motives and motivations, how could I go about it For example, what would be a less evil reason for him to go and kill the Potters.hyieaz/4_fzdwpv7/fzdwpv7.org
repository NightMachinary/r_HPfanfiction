you could make it seem as though they have been perceived all wrong. The potter killings could have been due to an Imperio etc. I also think that maybe explaining motives would be a good way to go about it. For example, instead of hating muggle-borns and muggles he just wants to integrate them earlier with classes that teach them about wizarding traditions. We can see that Halloween and Christmas replace Yule and Samhain, so we could say that Riddle just wants to ensure that the wizarding world keeps its traditions.

​

Another thing you could do is do some Dumbledore bashing. I know that not everyone is on with this so just skip this paragraph if so. However, I think this is also a really good way to go about it. Dumbledore is extremely respected within the magical community, so no one would go against him. This means he can say something, and the daily prophet would report it as truth. We can say that Ddumbledoor twisted the media into perceiving Riddle as a new dark lord and twisting his views and ideals. We all know that Riddle was a student when Dumbledore was there, so maybe Dumbledor deliberately tried to confound him or plant ideas in his head.

​

A third thing is to maybe explain to readers what the splitting of souls does to the mind. By the time he killed Harry's parents he had already made a lot of Horcruxes, so you could say that with each split of his soul, it drove him further into insanity and away from his original motivations. Instead of being fully in control of his mind and actions he does thing on impulse and makes rash decisions. It would be easier for his views to be swayed towards more murder because that's what Horcruxes need to be made. You could also say that through the destruction of the Horcruxes, those would pieces returned to Ridddle and so he gained more and more of his sanity back and then finally realizing that what he did was wrong and completely change the way he is handling things. Go the political route instead of violent, making plans instead of acting rashly, going back to his former beliefs and ideals such as integrating muggle-borns a lot earlier so that they can be accepted into society.

I think the last one is the best but these are just a few options! :)
