Voldemort and Death Eaters, as depicted in canon, are beyond redemption, just as Hitler and his Nazi war criminals cannot redeemed.

If I want to make them redeemable, I would attempt a major rewrite of their motivations and actions, such as:

This Voldemort would be nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul.

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies who were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books often fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership.

Potters, despite their young age, were rather efficient fighters and killers. They became such a thorn to his side, that Voldemort decided to take them out personally. He succeeded, but was severely wounded in the process. Harry himself never had anything to do with his defeat, but Dumbledore saw this as an opportunity to smear him as a baby killer and cook up that "Boy Who Lived" legend. Please keep in mind that realistic politics are always dirty.

The other option I see is to activate Diary Riddle. Instead of killing Ginny, he merged with her, fixing his own soul in the process, and became appalled at what his older self had done. He/she then tried to fix things as much as possible.
