The first option reminds me a little of The Pureblood Pretense, except that that one never actually had a war. Riddle does turn out to have an intriguing motivation for his actions once you read book 4.

Option 2 is similar to The Imposter Complex (except that that one didn't actually kill Ginny, just used its stolen soul reserves to survive the Diary's destruction long enough to flee and possess someone else).
