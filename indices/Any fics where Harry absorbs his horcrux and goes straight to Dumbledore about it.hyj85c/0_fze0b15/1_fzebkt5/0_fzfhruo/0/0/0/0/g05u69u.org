Sorry for the late answer, fell asleep and forgot to check reddit afterwards. Here it is (if it's still relevant):

He merges with each subsequent horcrux he encounters, with each giving him more power, but also changing him slightly. The change may or may not be placebo as characters are convinced he is still very much himself, but his behaviour suggests otherwise. It's debatable.

The side-effects of merging are actually immediate too, it's just that not all of them are obvious right away.

He also messes up his own mind slightly by unskillfully using Legilimency, which produces a similar effect to how Rand became incapable of hurting women due to Lews Therin's experiences. Riddle is also a very capable villain and other adults are generally more capable than fifteen-year-olds.

Harry also puts a lot of effort into his interaction with girls and women, which sometimes makes him come across as a bit of a womanizer.

That's about it. If I told you more, I'd be retelling the entire story.
