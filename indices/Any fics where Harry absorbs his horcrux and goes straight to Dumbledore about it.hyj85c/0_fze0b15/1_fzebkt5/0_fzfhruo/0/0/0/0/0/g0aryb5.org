No worries, I don't expect a live conversation by any means.

  He merges with each subsequent horcrux he encounters, with each giving him more power, but also changing him slightly.

Huh. That's interesting. Somehow I hadn't considered that sort of thing before. I like it. I can only imagine how Voldemort would feel about that, as Harry consumes his soul piece by piece.

One more question. Roughly how far through the fic does Harry become, for lack of a better term, approximately Voldemort-level? If he gets there at all. Half way through? The very end? Etc.

Thanks.
