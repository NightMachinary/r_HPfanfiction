Power-wise, I think he at least equals him by the time updates stop, though I'm pretty sure this was never confirmed. In a confrontation somewhere half-way through, it is confirmed the Voldemort is more powerful, but Harry catches up afterwards.

Skill-wise, however, he remains Voldemort's inferior. Though this is also just my opinion.
