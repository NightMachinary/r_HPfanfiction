It is a cool concept. It's too bad I don't see it with a decent execution very often. I know that I've ran into several, problem is I didn't like most or find them memorable.

linkffn(What's a Little Death between friends? by kathryn518) - Post-canon. Harry/Tonks. Shortly after Voldemort is killed, Harry goes to walk through the veil of death and Tonks accidentally falls in with him. They end up in the middle of the first war against Voldemort.

Linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart) - I recommend /not/ reading this one, but it's one of the fics that fits that I remember.

There's a few with a vaguely similar concept but don't really fit.

Linkffn(Samsara by Countess Millarca) - Harry doesn't get all of Voldemort's memories and skills, but he becomes far more Voldemort-y.

IIRC, in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Harry is actually basically a clone of Voldemort's soul in Harry's body, the difference being that he was raised by loving parents .

In Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin it seems to be heavily implied that the horcrux is heavily influencing Harry, including giving him some knowledge, but nothing like the entirety of Voldemort's memories.
