I mean, you can't really expect everything to immediately be different. 99% of the time, events snowball from whatever changes are made - so the beginning will be roughly the same until something actually happens to /change/ things, and some things will still happen because the changes the fanfic makes had near-nothing to do with those events.

Chapter 3 is barely even post-Sorting-Ceremony - barely enough time for the snowball to start rolling.
