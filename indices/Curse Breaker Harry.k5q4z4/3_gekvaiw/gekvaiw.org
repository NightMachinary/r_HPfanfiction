linkffn(Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis by Starfox5) stars the Trio post-Hogwarts as magical archaeologists. The story is a fairly self-contained (as far as I can recall) sequel to linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider by Starfox5), which diverges from canon in that Petunia is a Lara Croft expy, who adopts and raises Harry.
