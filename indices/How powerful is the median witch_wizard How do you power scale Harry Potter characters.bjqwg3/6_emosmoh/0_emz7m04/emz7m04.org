Cho Chang couldn't perform a Stunning Spell or the Disarming Charm before Harry showed her how in the DA. This was during her 6th year. After she had passed her Defense O.W.L. with a high enough grade to get to N.E.W.T. Level classes. Granted instruction in DADA was particularly shitty but that is not a good sign.

It is also possible that Cho didn't pass her O.W.L. and might not have been a particularly good student who just wanted to learn more about Cedrics death and better her defense skills anyway, but she's never presented as abnormally weak or talentless, and she was probably studious as a Ravenclaw so that doesn't seem likely.

We know a spectrum exists with near-Squibs who take Kwikspell courses to learn basic magic as adults at the bottom, and demi-gods capable of mind bending feats like Dumbledore and Voldemort, and that the top tier outstrips the median substantially. Where the median lies between the extremes is hard to say.

All we know for certain is that the average adult wizard cannot cast a Corporal Patronus and might not be able to cast any type, that Mind Reading Powers are fleetingly rare, and Animagi are fleetingly rare. Beyond that it's anyone's game.
