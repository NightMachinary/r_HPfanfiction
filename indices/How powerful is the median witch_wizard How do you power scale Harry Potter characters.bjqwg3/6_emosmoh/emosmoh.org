In my opinion, a perfectly average fully-educated modern wizard /should/ be basically a demigod. It very much irks me in fics where writers seem to think the “average” wizard can barely conjure a tea cosy. People throw around “NEWT-level spell” a lot like that represents an extremely difficult spell, but really that's like saying “The shit they teach you in Year 11 and 12.”
