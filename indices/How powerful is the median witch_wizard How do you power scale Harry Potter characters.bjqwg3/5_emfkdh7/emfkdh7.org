In a non-war situation nobody except aurors and criminals needs combat skills. The "don't be there and let the aurors handle it" strategy of Umbridge actually makes somewhat sense if you honestly don't believe Voldemort is back. That's why 90% of the population can't get a proper shield charm up and don't resist the Voldemort regime. Only students who still remember DADA lessons and aurors, Order members or Death Eaters who frequently train are decent at combat.
