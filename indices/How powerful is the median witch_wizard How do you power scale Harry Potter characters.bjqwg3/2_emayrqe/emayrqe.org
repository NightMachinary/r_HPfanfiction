I don't really think that wizards have any sort of "power level" or the equivalent. Rather, the "power" of any given witch or wizard is dependent on a mixture of innate talent and hard work. It's much like being a good student or being gifted at a particular art-form or a sport. Most of it is hard work and dedication - which is why almost every wizard is theoretically capable of nearly all magics, but there will always be some who just seem to have a knack for some areas, like Harry and flying, which gives them a head-start.

The really powerful wizards, like Voldemort and Dumbledore, are those who were lucky enough be simply have a knack for a lots of types of magic, and much more importantly, had the willpower to work hard to develop their talents.

Most wizards are probably like people in the real world, if they're born gifted in an area, they tend to get lazy about it and never reach their full potential. Like the smart kid in high school who could coast by on little to no work but as a result never developed study habits and therefore never amounted to much.

The powerful wizards are the rare smart kids who also actually worked hard.
