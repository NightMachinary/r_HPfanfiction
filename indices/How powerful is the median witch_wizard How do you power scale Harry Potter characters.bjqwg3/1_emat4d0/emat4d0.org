I generally picture the median wizard as being comfortable with "household magic" which they use in day to day life, plus having a high level ability with a single spell (or set of closely related spells) which reflect their career choice. Pretty much everything else from Hogwarts would be forgotten (if they even successfully mastered it in the first place).
