Most are just powerful enough to get by in their day to day lives and do their job. The more "powerful" (as in skilled) ones are the ones who choose professions that require additional knowledge/training. I imagine wizards as essentially being like us, but with magic, and what I mean by this is that most people stop learning or bothering to acquire additional skills outside of what their jobs demand, even if that knowledge or those skills would help them a lot.
