And honestly, why would they need them? How often does Average Joe get into anything more than a drunken brawl? Even though there was a war, I still think most people wouldn't master combat spells because a) who expects to get in an actual battle, and b) the enemy's just going to use unforgivables anyway and there's not much one can do against them.
