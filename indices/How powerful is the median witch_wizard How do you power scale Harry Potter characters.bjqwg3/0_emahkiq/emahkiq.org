They have a lots of specialists:

- Madam Malkins knows how to make good clothes
- Tom the Bartender and Madam Rosmerta most likely cook well and mix good drinks
- The people at Quidditch Supply enchant brooms
- Mr Ollivander makes great wands
- Lockhart is a memory charm expert
- But according to the Twins, most of Ministry workers couldn't put a decent shield charm. So I think the greatest majority of British wizards suck at combat spells.
