I like Genius Fratris. In this fic, Harry is traumatized by Voldemort killing his mom in front of him and doesn't speak. He still makes noise and can occasionally talk if he feels comfortable, but generally doesn't say anything. It's a rare WBWL in that James survived the attack and is not abusive. Also, Harry and the brother genuinely love and care for each other.
