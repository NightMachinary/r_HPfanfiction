The main problem would be coming up with a primary antagonist that would be on par with the new Harry + Voldemort combo. I suppose you could borrow a little bit more from the Narutoverse and militarize Magical Britain. People would know that he's got the Dark Lord inside and he would be thus shunned by the magical community at large, the opposite situation from cannon. Since he's holding one of the largest threats to society and he's going to be mistreated by the wizards it wouldn't make sense for Dumbledore to send Harry to the Dursley's--after all Harry doesn't need grooming to sacrifice himself in book 7. Also Voldemort is very different from Kurama, you could hardly get away with making him a misunderstood character without some major OoC so a significant part of the story could be dedicated to finding a way of harnessing Voldemort's power/knowledge... I think the situation would play out similarly to the diary in book 2 unless some type of mechanics are implemented in the sealing. i would read it.
