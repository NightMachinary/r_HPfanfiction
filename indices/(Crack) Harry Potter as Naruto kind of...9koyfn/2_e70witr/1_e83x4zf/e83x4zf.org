Some ideas:

- Voldemort's main soul (now within Harry) starts to talk to him, telling him that he wants to rejoin the other soul fragments and mend his evil aways. Harry's innate good soul and innocence change him over the years. (The 7th Horcrux does this very well without even directly mentioning it). The rejoining is incredibly painful and comes with great sacrifice (on Voldie's part not Harry's).

- As a voice inside Harry's head that only occasionally takes the wheel in emergencies, he first steers Harry into outright cruelty and near evil, but over time his actions improve (but not his words). When in control around Hogwarts, he often tries to teach DADA classes to humorous or disastrous effect. He also tries to prank and insult Dumbledore.

- The other soul fragments somehow determine that he is trying to redeem himself (possibly a botched divination spell because Voldie doesn't respect divination?) and decide to work against him, start possessing people, and can move around by happenstance One Ring style. Unless they are found and destroyed (or consumed by the main soul) they will always find their way into some poor fool's possession and possess him/her in turn.

- The soul fragments vary in terms of power/ability, with the oldest one being the most sane and least evil but also least powerful. Harry faces escalating threat from the soul fragments, from moderately dangerous pranks to outright warfare and cunning betrayal. Some (maybe just the first one?) soul fragments willingly join after some persuasion, while most must be defeated.

- The final soul fragment obtains a twisted body of it's own, and attempts to destroy both Harry and the healing main soul within. Death Eaters rally around this final and most insane soul fragment. I think a Return of the Jedi ending would be most satisfying, with Voldemort paying for the crimes he committed and dying, and Harry finding out the power was in him all along.
