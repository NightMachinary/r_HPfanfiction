I really enjoyed survival is a talent by ShanaStoryteller on ao3. It's a Draco/Harry soulmate au, but the focus is really not on the soulmate stuff at all. It's more of an excuse to explore the idea of what would happen if Draco and Harry had a reason to try to put aside their enmity starting in second year, and how the story would change as a result. The characters are amazing and the writing is really good. It's currently unfinished but still updating fairly regularly.
