It's probably worth mentioning which ones you already know. I'm guessing you've come across Innocent? It's my top recommendation for that kind of divergence.

The Accidental Animagus is pretty decent, too. It seems at first like a fix-fic, making everything better, but once Voldemort properly hits his stride, it turns out he's been level-grinding too.
