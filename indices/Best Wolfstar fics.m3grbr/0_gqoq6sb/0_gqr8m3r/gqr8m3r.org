This is an excellent list! I second trying all of these, and I'll chime in on Blends. It's my favorite Wolfstar non-magical AU. Both of them are complicated and bad at things and sometimes annoying, but ultimately good and good for each other. It's a very realistic mutual pining scenario (told from one person's POV), and it's beautiful to watch them slowly figure each other out and come together. The other characters and their dynamics are really well done too. It's only NSFW near the very end. Blends also has a WIP sequel!

I'll add some others: two raising Harry WIPs, one very angsty fic (check the warnings), and two more non-magical AUs.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27300139/chapters/66700582][*that's the art of getting by*]] *by sarewolf:* “What do you want me to do?” Remus says, tiredly. All he wants is to curl up on his bed. Smoke a pack of cigarettes. Get drunk. He can't stop looking at Harry. “Remus...” Dumbledore is gentle. Remus hates when he has that tone. Hates that he knows it will hurt. “There is no one else left.” A bitter laugh escapes him. “So you'll curse the poor thing with a werewolf for a guardian?”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20059978/chapters/47507422][*chase the stars*]] *by Duskglass:* It's probably the most foolish, reckless, dangerous thing Sirius Black has ever done in a lifetime of foolish and reckless and dangerous things... but he takes one look at Harry and knows it's the only choice he can make.(Or: ‘Sirius escapes Azkaban early & accidentally kidnaps Harry' AU.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987973/chapters/1948502][*73 Aberdeen*]] *by Mici:* There are some things ungoverned by fate. If Sirius Black had gone the path of every Black before him, if he had been in Slytherin, he would have been a very different boy. It would have been a very different war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22331551/chapters/53344351][*Ever Thus*]] *by WrappedUp:* “Right, well I'd say it's about time to put an end to this nonsense, wouldn't you?” James nodded sagely. “You've obviously still got some things to chat through with him, but he will talk to you about it, Remus. He thinks the world of you, you know that. But the important thing is that you do talk because nothing's going to get sorted if you just sit cry-wanking in your room.” The world is excruciating and enthralling in equal measure. The gang try their hardest to navigate it as real, legitimate adults.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27679754][*Rourke*]] *by sreka:* When wildlife filmmaker Sirius Black arrives on a remote Antarctic island for a year-long assignment, he isn't phased by the freezing wind, the perpetual darkness, or the hostility he meets from some of the biologists at the research base. He is used to living an itinerant existence. He is comfortable with unforgiving conditions. He expects the world to treat him harshly. But he does not expect to fall in love.
