What have you read?

In order of my favourites:

The best is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]]. A canon look at Lupin from 1971 to OoTP. It just is the best one.

I love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239][Text Talk]] which is a texting fic but is just very cute.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13990401/chapters/32213229][Dress Up in You]] is also a muggleAU but its really well written and just very very good. Same author as ATYD above so you know they have the dynamic down.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]] is a wolfstar Raising Harry fic which is also wonderful. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473][The Dogfather]] is similar and again, just great.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1918284/chapters/4139571][Remain in Light]] is a wonderful Sirius Lives fic that is so well written. But has some very NSFW scenes so be warned.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12147474/chapters/27562521][Casting Moonshadows]] is a very piney fic with some VERY dark themes. Big warnings here for abuse and all the rest but its wolfstar and I don't know what you're into. All the other fics are angsty, this one is just sad.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/20750912/chapters/49305518][Sweater Weather]] is a hockey AU which again has some VERY NSFW scenes and a forced coming out. Its too smutty and fluffy for my tastes but I enjoyed learning a lot about Hockey and Canada. Other people seem to enjoy it though.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1319809][Electric Fizzing Whatevers]] is the most Kudosed oneshot about Wolfstar from what I can see and is very good.

I have not read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7869079/chapters/17970910][Blends]]. I don't know what it's about other than its an NSFW coffee shop AU. But people who like fluffy angsty wolfstar seem to like it. Though I can't vouch for it.

And tadaa, that's all the best wolfstar I have. I can expand on more if you have further questions.
