I think you pointed me a better direction where I can search. The rec list was on LJ and I specifically remember now that the op of the rec list didn't really know whether of not to put it in that section or Gen because it was weird. Like more of a weird, messed up character study in a weird, messed up situation. But I'll trawl through that later. Thank you. I was focusing on the body snatching part and character studies in my google searches. I'd put it in my head as nonshippy because of the context and detached tone. I'll try that. It was on someone's all time faves list. This is killing me. I feel like I'm navigating a labyrinth.
