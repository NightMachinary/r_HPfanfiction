This. That, and people who say something happens "on accident".

No.

That's not how that works. "On" is an indication of place or location and makes as much sense in this phrase as using "at" (that is, none at all).

The word to use is "by", which is an indicator of how the thing happened (in this case, because it can also mean "near", because English is a glorious fucking mess).

"On accident" makes me irrationally angry.
