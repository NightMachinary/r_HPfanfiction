This is a more obscure one for many writers tbh. On accident is a variant that's perfectly acceptable in spoken English, so a kid or teenager saying that in dialogue isn't really that unusual and it does mean the same thing. Unfortunately, it's regional to America and Canada so it's a Britpicking fail.

(It likely came about as the opposite of "on purpose".)
