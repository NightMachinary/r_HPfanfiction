I find "on accident" strange - it /sounds/ correct in some pretty odd sentances where using "by" doesn't really work. Like... "That was on accident (on purpose)." Substituting the more correct "by" would make it incorrect because it should be "an accident" or "accidental" instead.

You're absolutely correct that it's wrong every single time in writing no matter what. But spoken? It's fine. And that unfortunately translates into written form.

My pet peeve is punctuation around dialogue, tbh: that's my irrational anger lol. And it's /distracting!/

  "Stop that," she said!

  "What's that," he asked?

That's the latest abomination I've seen, and I had to drop a perfectly good story because I just kept getting more and more annoyed every time I saw it lol.
