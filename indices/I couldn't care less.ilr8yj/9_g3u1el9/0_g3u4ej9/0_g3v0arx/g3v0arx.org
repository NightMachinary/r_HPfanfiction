Ha! To be honest it bugs me just as much when I hear it in person. But then again, I'm very much a grammar snob, which is entirely on me, but I do try to avoid being a dick and correcting people, because even if it's 'bad grammar', it's still perfectly understandable. Doesn't stop it being a pet peeve.

I hadn't considered the correlation with "on purpose", that's an excellent point! At least no one says "by purpose", my head might explode.
