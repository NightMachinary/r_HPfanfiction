I find it funny in sarcastic way, like "It would be possible for me to care less than I do, but I really don't care very much". But I'm kind of into the trope of "character who speaks with way more detail/honesty than anyone cares about" so that's probably why. It reminds me of the figurative/literally thing, in Archer they made fun of it by switching to "figuratively" where people normally use "literally" in hyperbole ("I'm literally going to kill him" changed to "I'm figuratively going to kill him"). I see it as similar to "couldn't care less" because that phrase is probably also being used as a hyperbole, like they probably potentially could care less if they thought about it.
