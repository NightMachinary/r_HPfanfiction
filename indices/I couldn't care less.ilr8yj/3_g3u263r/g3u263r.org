To be fair, it can be valid (if irksome) to use malapropisms in dialogue, to indicate that they're the character's mistake and not the author's. (Well, I guess it depends: never have a character say "should of", even if they'd get it wrong in writing, since what they're /uttering/ is still "should've".)
