I'd note that it's used frequently in real life in the US - it's a common Americanism, but one that usually majorly irks British people because /it doesn't make sense/. Importantly, though, it's an American phrase - unless it's an American character, I would not say it's acceptable for most Harry Potter characters to use in dialogue. A story following on from Fantastic Beasts - no problem. Something about Harry, in the UK in the 90s? Less okay.
