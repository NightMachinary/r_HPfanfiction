Not really anything terribly similar. It's kind of a 'unique gem' of a fic. I know there's been stuff where single and occasionally two elements are similar (fics where Harry is a parent, fics where Harry is a sad widower, fics where Harry falls for a muggle, fics with sappy 'getting to know you' romance, etc etc.), but not fics with a lot of similarities. Too many to adequately list, really, and I've only been here a few months so I wouldn't know that many by name myself anyway.

If you want to find some, I'd recommend doing a sub search. If you check around your screen (I'm not sure what device you're on or whether you're on old or new reddit, but you're looking for the same thing regardless), you should find a search bar (it helpfully says 'search' in it). If you type what you're looking for in there, then click the tickbox to limit your search to this sub, you'll find a lot of the posts other people have made on whatever you're looking for. That'll get you a whole bunch of posts with, quite likely, a whole bunch of fics.

Otherwise, just make another post yourself and ask for fics similar to this Grow Young With Me. :)
