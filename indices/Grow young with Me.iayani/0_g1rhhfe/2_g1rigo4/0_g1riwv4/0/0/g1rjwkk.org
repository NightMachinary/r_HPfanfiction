Per chapter - they update as each chapter is completed, I believe. And if you check the author's page on FFNet, they apparently have a Tumblr that they post updates on.

And well, yeah. I know that feeling, wanting more chapters when you find a good unfinished fic. It sucks when stories update slowly, but sometimes the authors have lives that demand a lot of them - too much for them to spend a lot of time writing. Sad, but it is how it is. :)
