I understand fully, you want to know if there's a sequel or something - which I just said, the fic is still ongoing.

Yes, it was /published/ back in 2015 - that means the /first chapter/ went up then. The latest chapter went up on the 15th of June, 2020 - as seen by "Updated".

It's at chapter 28 and leaves a lot open, which means if it's going to continue it'll be in the same story.

TL;DR there's no sequel, but Chapter 29 is coming at some point (though I have no idea when).
