As someone else said, it's a bit weird but definitely original and worth checking out. Just a heads up, the author is not an English native and it shows. Some mistake and turn of phrases that can be slightly odd, I've seen much worse and even someone as pick as me was not put off by this, however.

I say it's worth checking out
