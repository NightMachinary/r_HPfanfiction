Blackboards and Broomsticks: Harry becomes DADA professor. He's quite invested in the well-being of the kids at Hogwarts (and his own young children). Canon compliant up to the epilogue, Harry is married to Ginny.

Put Your Guns Away, It's Tea Time: Harry is a proud dad, and a good one. Or, at least, he's trying to be the latter. Cursed Child compliant, part 1 of many.
