It's worth noting that Harry/Gabrielle doesn't actually happen /at all/ in the fic until the very last chapter, even even then, it's barely anything. The author inserted an OC for Gabrielle to date for pretty the whole thing. As such, the story is 24 chapters of essentially quidditch league filler, but even so, I still found it decent.
