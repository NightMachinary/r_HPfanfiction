Could you elaborate on the Judeo Christian mythology. Because i really liked the Denarian series of harry potter fanfiction, as well as other stuff like the Lucifer comic series, which include things like angels and demons and stuff. Because i think i remember stopping this fic after a few chapters when hermione was wearing harry's wand as a necklace and didnt care too much to continue.
