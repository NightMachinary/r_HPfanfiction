I have two that I can offer.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=319086][Marked]] follows Draco from the night of the Battle in the Department of Mysteries through the meeting with Voldemort where he receives his Dark Mark and his mission to kill Dumbledore.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=320684][Detox]] begins about three months after Voldemort's death and tells the story of Draco's courtship of Astoria Greengrass.

Detox is truly novel-length while Marked is borderline between novella and novel.
