One way I like to do this is by leaving really detailed reviews that encourage the author and leave me breadcrumbs. I'll say things like "I like [this very specific thing in the fic that only happened in this fic and in nothing else]. Can't wait for an update."

Then I can look back through my reviews to see what I've commented on and if it's still ongoing.
