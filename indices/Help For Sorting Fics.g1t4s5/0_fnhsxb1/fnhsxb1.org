If you use AO3, I've seen people add tags to things they bookmark. Not very useful for [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], though. Making a document/spreadsheet can help, especially if you organize by tropes/pairings/aus/etc. so you can find something you want to get to. If you do it in Google drive, you can bookmark it for easy access.
