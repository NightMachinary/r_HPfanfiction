I don't use the in-site system, personally. I just bookmark them in my browser and sort them in folders by whatever the most prominent element of the fic is - if it's Lord Potter-Black-I-Write-Sins-Not-Tragedies-Ambrosius-Gryffindor-Slytherin with his feckless anime side-wenches, then I'd file it under Lord Potter. If it was a fourth year fic, I'd likely end up filing it under Triwizard, unless whatever ship it was was more prominent in the story than the tournament.

I have a 'to-sort' folder where I put the bookmarks of the fics I've finished so I know which ones need sorting, then another 'to-read' folder with occasional subfolders there if I get a lot of recs for a specific request.
