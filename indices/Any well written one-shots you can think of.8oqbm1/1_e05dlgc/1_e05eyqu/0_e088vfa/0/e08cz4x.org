For the most part, I'd agree (even though by "do not own" most authors mean the original characters, but not their own interpretation of them and the actual text). Sadly, the competition rules require to get this author's "blessing", or at very least do anything possible to get it, i.e. by sending the request and waiting couple weeks before starting translation to verify they at least aren't active and/or don't care enough.
