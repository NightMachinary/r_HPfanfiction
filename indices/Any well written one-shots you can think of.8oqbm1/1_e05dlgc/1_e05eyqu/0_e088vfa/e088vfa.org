At the very beginning of a story every fanfiction author says something like 'I do not own...' That's the gist of it. They do not own this stuff and can't stop people from using it for any purpose. It might seem ethical or moral to have blessings (yes, I said blessings, not permission - because they do not have right to give permission - it's not their's to give) but it's really not.

It's immoral and unethical to prevent people from using fanficiton. They do not own legal rights anyway.
