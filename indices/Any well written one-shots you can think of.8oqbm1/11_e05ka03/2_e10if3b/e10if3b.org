Hello again! So here's the result of my efforts to translate your work: [[https://pastebin.com/PHvXgBwr]] - it's temporary link just to show you, the actual work will be published in a couple days. But I thought I better link it before then, and in case you have any objections or corrections, etc, I can still change it slightly (tho it's not quite easy since it's already sent to the competition's verification team). I don't expect you'd understand much there, but you don't need to anyway. Most visible differences you might see at a glance are due to language differences. E.g. separators replaced by *** because no one would really understand what's that over there, most quotes replaced by "---" or phrases slightly shuffled around just because that's the way it's expressed in Russian grammar. I tried to not mess up any meanings, though added a few purely cosmetic refinements (mostly adjectives) for the sake of phrases flowing better in the translated version (as it's less forgiving to omitting words than English). Hope you don't mind.

Anyway, thanks, it's been a pleasure to translate you work :)
