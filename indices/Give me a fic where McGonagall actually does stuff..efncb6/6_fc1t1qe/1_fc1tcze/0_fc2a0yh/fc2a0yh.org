Yes, I am not a big fan of Harmony myself, and especially in this story Harry/Hermione relationship is probably the worst part of the story (they are so perfect, I want to vomit), but still more peripheral characters (like McGonagall and Snape, or Percy Weasley!) are very well written. There is no soul bond, and the marriage law is just to get Harry & Grangers out of the country, otherwise it doesn't play large role in the story.
