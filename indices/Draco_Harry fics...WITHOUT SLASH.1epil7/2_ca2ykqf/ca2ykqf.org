I have never read any dramonie since I generally don't like reading about the amazing bouncing ferret, so obviously I can't recommend anything with that pairing.

However, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][Growing up Black]] is a great story, that I would heartely recommend. It is currently a WIP.
