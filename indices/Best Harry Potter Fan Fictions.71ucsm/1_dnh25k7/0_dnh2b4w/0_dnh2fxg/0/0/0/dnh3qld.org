[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/new][I made this intro like two years ago, you can find suggestions here]]

Other than that my go to is this:

Read about, oh, i don't know, the first hundred pages or so? That should be a nice starter.

Everything by Robst is garbage, but openly defines a lot of the tropes that should be avoided, so by reading one you're really reading a couple thousand at minimum.

The ending of Unsung Heroes is almost universally reviled, but really good otherwise. Like Robst it's pretty much a defining example of Twin-who-lived.

Read all of Rorschach's Blot's fics. They're not great but they include contributions from many many other authors, some of whom take great care in their adherence to canon, while others abuse the shit out of it.

Some other must read authors (for better or for worse): Nonjon, Northumbrian, Enembee, little0bird, jbern, BarbLP, White Squirrel, Old Crow, Chem Prof, Matt Silver, Bobmin.

Go through their userpages and look for their favorited stories and read those.

Check the subreddit for all the other 'top fics' threads.

You have so much ahead of you, but don't freak out there's some good shit in there.
