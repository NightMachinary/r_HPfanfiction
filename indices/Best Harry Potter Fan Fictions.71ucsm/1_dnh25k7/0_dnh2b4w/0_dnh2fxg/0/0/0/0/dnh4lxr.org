Thank you so much the ones I hate the most aren't the terrible ones but the ones that are really close to being good but aren't.

My least favourite is Harry McGanagle where Harry is raised in America by Minirva's family. I feel as though the Author hated things about the book and changed them. Like Harry has a wand when he is 5 and there is a magic version of McDonalds

At the point I realised that it was just McDonalds I gave up.
