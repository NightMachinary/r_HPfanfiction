Seconding this. I know it's all the rage these days to squawk about gatekeeping, but 20 fics? That's like watching the Phillies beat the Braves today and declaring them the best team in the history of baseball. You can't even begin to understand how incorrect that statement is by watching one game. You gotta at least try to experience the fandom before you pass judgement.

Even assuming OP isn't just a troll, their opinion has as little value as one anyway simply because saying one fic is better than nineteen other fics has zero value when there's literally over one freaking million more to compare it to.
