I've seen somewhere a variation on the usual "Seer Luna" cliche where she was not a seeress, but merely had the power of unbiased observation. Where normal people rely on their knowledge base to draw conclusions and might try to match to a known pattern, that Luna basically used a Fourth Wall as a mirror to view the universe with.
