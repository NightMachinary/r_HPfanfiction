Not necessarily. See, it's a difference between active and passive power.

The Death Eaters and their master are attempting a conquest, so they have to actively exert power.

Harry and his friends just wanted to enjoy a Hogsmeade weekend. The DE's matter only as long as they are an obstacle towards that goal. The DA do not have a motive to throw their weight around beyond that.

The end result would be shifting the conflict away from Voldemort (a good thing since the whole "Prophecy is be all, end all. It must happen " is overdone...) and towards those supremely powerful teenagers growing up and looking for their place in life. For Harry "Just Harry" Potter, this would be especially hard. Boy-Who-Lived-To-Put-Merlin-To-Shame would be something he'd never live down.

At least, that's my approach, [[/u/aidan6am]]
