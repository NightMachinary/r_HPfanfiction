Top Secret: Merlin class clearance: Preliminary recruitment report_ From the files of the Unspeakables:

Subject: Potter, Harry. Apropos: (The Chosen One, future designation; Agent Reaper)

Potter is rather headstrong, and while some may call his battle tactics stupid, others would say no planning is needed. While not the most knowledgeable in spells or battlefield movement Potter has shown a trifecta of skills that make even seasoned Aurors jealous. With incredible power behind each spell cast, rivaling even Dumbledore, Potter is capable of sending targets into low orbit in seconds with a wingardium leviosa, his Bombardas are equivalent to muggle battleship rounds, and I have personally seen him dismember a man with a simple Expelliarmus. Other documented examples of Potter's phenomenal power levels include surviving the effects of Basilisk venom for minutes at the age of twelve, where it would normally be near instantly fatal, and casting a patronous charm so powerful it banished over 100 dementors, actually burning a few into dust. Secondly Potter's draw speed is near supernatural, and has been timed at mere milliseconds. This is not limited to simple casting however, Potter's reaction speed and spatial awareness are truly incredible. Dodging spell fire beyond his vision range, predicting hit locations and moving before impact, tracking and capturing disarmed wands in mid battle and reflecting multiple spells with a single cast simultaneously. Agent Chameleon, a member on the Auror force apprenticed to "Madeye" Moody has stated that her mentor has complained "that if he had more Aurors with half of Potter's talent that Voldemort would have never risen the first time." Finally Potter's acucuacy is unrivaled by any on the force. He has been documented to be capable of jinxing the wings off a fly from over six hundred meters.

Recruitment recommended, field agent likey, task force Alpha; high risk situations, squadron support and heavy hitter, possible leader material with some more training. Pending final review before approval.

Subject: Granger, Hermione. Apropos: (Know It All, future designation; Agent Athena)

Please keep in mind this witch has yet to graduate her seventh year of Hogwarts, and yet she is able to verbally recite as well as perform at minimum acceptable levels (near perfect pronouciation, wand movement, average power levels behind cast) a documented 793 spells, most of which are not taught as standard or even advanced Hogwarts curriculum. Project Horoscope is a result of an incident in Granger's second year, where she brewed what was thought of as a textbook perfect example of Polyjuice (NEWT level potion), further review shows subtle differences in standard make-up, and may be the reason she was so easily returned to her original form after accidentally ingesting a sample contaminated with feline hair (though she has been observed displaying feline traits, including night vision, increased reflexes and more acute hearing, and an a tendency for her hair to puff up when upset.) We are currently trying to reverse engineer her version of the potion and are researching applications in animal transformations. While Granger's power levels and casting speed are on par with witches her age, her affluence in creating paragraph long spell chains with cascading and intertwined effects that simply drown out or bypass opponents spell work is astounding. We have yet to figure out how she has been able to summon a bound God as a familiar (see Subject Nabu), nor how she seemingly left a self sustaining black hole inside of Malfoy manor after her escape that lasted for an estimated 7 hours and consumed the manor and 76% of the surrounding grounds.

Recruitment recommended, research and development department, subject shows aptitude for field research as well. With enough experience she may come to lead that department. Pending final review before approval.

Subject: Weasley, Ronald. Apropos: (Weasel King future designation; Agent Checkmate)

One could call this young wizard a savant genius. While he displays a lack of intelligence or efforts in anything not related to eating, Quidditch, or chess, from even his first year at Hogwarts he has been observed to be capable of concocting multistage modular plans at merely a few seconds of observation. Given more time he can plan out an estimated 10,000 outcomes to a single action, capable of directing a battles outcome to his optimal goals. He was observed to have solved the Tri-wizard tournaments third task hedge maze before the second contestant had made it in. He later reveled he had Granger charm a parchment with the protean charm to match one Potter had and easily directed him through the maze. this of course led Potter to the cup a hour ahead of any other contestant, even though potter was simple walking at an average pace and entered last. (Potter later stated he would have rather gon with plan A: blast a hole through the entire maze, but thankfully Granger talked him out of it.) With enough motivation Weasley is capable of great things, therefore we have tasked Jr. Agent Glamorous; our information broker currently attending Hogwarts to begin grooming him by using the one thing a male teenager could never resist, female attention, so far results look promising.

Recruitment recommended, tactics and management department, subject shows aptitude as squad leader. Flag for fast track to eventually lead The Department. Pending final review before approval.
