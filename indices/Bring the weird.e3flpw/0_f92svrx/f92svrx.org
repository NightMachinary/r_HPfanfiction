For something that sounds pretty weird, but somehow manages to actually be one of the best stories I read in the last years: Linkao3(12805206)

And well, Linkffn(12076771) is really fuckin weird.

And else, well there are plenty of weird and "just why?" fics simply for the pairings used. Just think up the weirdest ship you can think of and you will find something on AO3. Harry/Lily? Hermione/Molly? Ginny/Crabbe/Goyle? Harry/Hedwig? Rule34 and AO3 has you covered.
