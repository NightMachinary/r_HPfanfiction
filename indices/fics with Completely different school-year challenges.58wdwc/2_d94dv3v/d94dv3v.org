[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindewald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. There was no Voldemorts' rise so the standard plot is thrown out of the window. Ongoing, regular updates.

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. The first year is similar to canon one, but then it diverges wildly. Ongoing, with currently iregular updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Covered the third year that was completely different from canon one. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ww8zey6s8igoghx/AAAW0Cgm8AGQl2amQOwRat_5a?dl=0&preview=Alexandra+Potter+Original+(Revised][Alexandra Potter]].html) - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. The first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned. The covered plot had nothing to do with canon one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. Again, very different from canon in terms of plot. And another dead fic.
