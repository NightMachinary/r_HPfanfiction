Unfortunately those are the only two really good AUs with that much alt world building that i can remember. There's this fic , fighting the green, where neville is chosen as the boy who lived and Harry's parents live to raise him and see him sorted into slytherin. It follows cannon kind of closely but skips over alot of stuff that you've read about a million times and just discusses it after the fact. It is probably the best example of children in fanfiction actually behaving like children. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1955451]] . BTW if you ever come across any fics like Reign of the Serpent of Prince of the dark kingdom id love a rec : ) .
