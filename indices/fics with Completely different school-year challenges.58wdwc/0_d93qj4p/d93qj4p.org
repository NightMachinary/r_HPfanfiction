Well, when it comes to for want of a nail fics that lead to fairly drastically different things happening, the big one is linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb) which partly has to do with aging Harry up a year, and Dumbledore kinda being exiled from Wizarding Britain.

For an AU that so far is holding /generally/ to the canon plotline yet isn't rehash, there is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man), though it is similar enough to canon that you probably wouldn't want to read it.

Sadly, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) does fit this request.

For fullblown AUs we have the sadly abandoned linkffn(Wit of the Raven) and the criminally underrated linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) by [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]].

Out of all of these, the one that fits your request the best would probably be Untitled Tome followed by What You Leave Behind.
