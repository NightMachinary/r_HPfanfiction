It might take you a while to get through, but I would recommend trying these search terms: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&lan=1&r=10&len=10&s=2][Sort - Reviews, Language - English, Length - >10k, Status - Complete]] and then maybe add/subtract whichever characters (I usually go +Harry -Draco -Snape). Then just scroll through those til you find something you haven't read yet. After that, try looking up some of the favorites on the bigger name profiles, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Earedhair][ARedHair]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eoldcrow][Old Crow]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7ESarah1281][Sarah1281]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1298529/Clell65619][Clell65619]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eatruwriter][atruwriter]]. I have ton on my personal page as well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Enedryos][here]].

The alternate host sites such as [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/index.php][Adult Fan Fiction]], [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/][Harry Potter Fan Fiction Archive]], the [[http://fictionalley.blogspot.com/][Fiction Alley]] group of sites (listed on the right sidebar of that page), or any of the other archives listed [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/][here]] don't often get recced here, so maybe try one of them too.

Sorry you're having such a shitty day, and I hope it gets better =).

edit: I'd recommend going through some of the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=flair%3A%22request%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on][request threads]] here on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] Someone recommended using the [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net][DLP Scryer]]. I don't use it often, but my usual search is +this+.

edit: I just realized that search terms link didn't work, so I'll just tell you what they were:

edit2: Some of the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=flair%3A%22suggestion%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on][suggestion flair'd]] posts are worth looking at as well.
