These are all Drarry fics.

I just recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9771843/1/Kitty-Kitty][Kitty, Kitty]] and loved it so much I started looking for similar stories. Haven't found anything written quite that well yet, however.

I've recommended it before, but if you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5401510/1/Talk-to-Me][Talk to Me]] it's worth checking out. I reread it rather often.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2721089/1/Draco-s-Boy][Draco's Boy]] is full of angst, one of those abusive!Dursley fics. But it's written very well; I couldn't stop reading once I started.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2186498/1/Yorkshire-Puddings][Yorkshire Puddings,]] and [[http://thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3848][A Labour of Love.]]
