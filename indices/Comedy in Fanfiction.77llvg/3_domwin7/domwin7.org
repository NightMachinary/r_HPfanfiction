I think names like "Moldy Shorts" are a great way to poke fun of the almost reverence that magical britain treats Voldemort with by calling him "You-Know-Who". That name gives him way to much mystique and power.

It's a great way to rob him of his power: Hey, you are to afraid to even call him by his moniker? Well, guess what, I'll go 10 steps further and blatantly insult him every time I refer to him, you babies!
