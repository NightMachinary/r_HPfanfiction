True, and that's a bonus, muggleborns and raised will get a giggle out of it, and no one would tell Voldy since, you know, you'd have to admit you know a bit too much about muggles for comfort.

Hell, it doesn't even have to be chrome dome, that was just an example, I think I'd like to see a fic call him Elmer Fudd throughout the book and have a moment where Voldemort finally learns just what the hell an Elmer Fudd was and why all those muggles/muggleborns were laughing at him.

Or something that doesn't need muggle knowledge, like saying whoa there, Voldemort, your head is blindingly bright, you think before we duel we could switch spots so your head's not in the sun?

Or in response to Voldemort saying something like "Your parents begged for mercy.." say "Well, at least I'm not bald, in fact I'm quite Harry"

Or something wizardized, "Bludger head" has a nice ring to it and sounds insulting even without the bald aspect.

Or a werewolf pretending his head is the full moon and screaming in agony pretending he's transforming, only to say "Wait, that's not the full moon." Maybe from a Lupin that isn't a beaten down has-been.
