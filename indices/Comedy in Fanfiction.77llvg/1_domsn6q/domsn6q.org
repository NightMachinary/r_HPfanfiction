It's meant to be funny? Thought it was more to be insulting towards ole flight from death, defiant towards him.

By the way, Voldy Moldy started in canon, Peeves says "We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter's the one, and Voldy's gone mouldy, so now let's have fun!" after Voldemort dies, and Voldy's gone moldy is at least mildly amusing in that context I think.

Though I am surprised how few bald jokes they use- you'd think someone would have the balls to call Voldemort chrome dome or something.
