  Well, I consider "You-Know-Who" as a stupid nickname myself, and avoid it, no matter how canon it is. It's not even insulting, just stupid.

But the Wizarding World /is/ very stupid on occasion. My headcanon was always that the "You-Know-Who" nickname started in the columns of the /Daily Prophet/ and was invented by some Fudge-like journalist, and its use in the sole news outlet of Wizarding Britain was so overwhelming that people began using it no matter how stupid it really was. (After all, when the headlines keep saying things like YOU-KNOW-WHO SLAUGHTERS ENTIRE VILLAGE - NO SURVIVORS, after a while, people will stop seeing the humor in the name.)
