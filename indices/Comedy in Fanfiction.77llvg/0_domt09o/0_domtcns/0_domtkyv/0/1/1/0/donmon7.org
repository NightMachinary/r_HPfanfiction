I doubt it started out as the title, "You Know Who." People probably just didn't want to say his name out of fear and used the common phrase "you-know-who." Eventually, it mutated into a title they called him. The power behind the title comes from the fear that people have of him. Obviously it sounds silly to us, but if you consider the mindset of the people in the story it makes sense, especially if it was a gradual change from a reference to a title. Also, isn't the term Dark Lord only used by his followers?
