My apologies, Starfox, I didn't mean to imply the use of stupid nicknames is inherently for young authors - there are immature adults who include the same, of course! :)

But I would say the context is rather different. Nicknames for Hitler make complete sense - you see them in songs, on posters... Effectively, in propaganda.

The Weasley Twins used U-No-Poo, but the level of fear in the wizarding world is enough that we don't really see /any/ propaganda against Voldemort, like. No one even says his actual name out of fear, so I can't exactly see them using an insulting epithet instead.
