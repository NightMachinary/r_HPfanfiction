Yeah, stupid nicknames for villains or offensive epithets are very likely to make one roll their eyes at least. What one has to remember, I suppose, is that many of those writing these fanfictions are quite young (12-14) or have been in very similar communities since they /were/ very young, you know?

In the same way that "lol so random" humour doesn't really carry past the age of sixteen, the use of twee nicknames for war criminals and mass murderers makes most want to just close the tab, even if the protagonists ARE children.
