Luna doesn't actually talk about Nargles particularly often. I think the only time is when she and Harry are under a batch of mistletoe, and Luna mentions that it's likely infested with them.

The movie has Luna mention Nargles more frequently, but that's likely because "Nargle" is a funny word that's still easy to pronounce. It'd be a lot less funny if Movie Luna blamed "Bithering Humbdingers" for stealing her shoes.

While it's true that Luna never misses an opportunity to mention what's in the Quibbler, it's usually at least somewhat context-sensitive: She mentions Fudge's army of heliopaths at the first meeting of the DA; Luna compares believing Harry's testimony to that of eyewitnesses of Crumple-horned Snorkakcs; Zacharias Smith struggles at Quidditch and she thinks he's suffering from Loser's Lurgy.
