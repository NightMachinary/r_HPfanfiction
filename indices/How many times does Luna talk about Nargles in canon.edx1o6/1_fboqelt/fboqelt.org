Fun fact: in the books, /Harry/ talks about Nargles more times than Luna. Luna only mentions them once, as [[/u/CryptidGrimnoir]] notes:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Mistletoe,' said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head. He jumped out from under it. ‘Good thinking,' said Luna very seriously. ‘It's often infested with Nargles.'

  Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles were by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.

Harry mentions them on two occasions. One comes shortly after:

  ‘Mistletoe,' said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.

  ‘Yeah,' said Harry. His mouth was very dry. ‘It's probably full of Nargles, though.'

  ‘What are Nargles?'

The other is in DH, of all places, when the trio is speculating about what happened to Luna:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Then she'll be in Azkaban, I expect,' said Ron. ‘Whether she survives the place, though ... loads don't ...'

  ‘She will,' said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. ‘She's tough, Luna, much tougher than you'd think. She's probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.'
