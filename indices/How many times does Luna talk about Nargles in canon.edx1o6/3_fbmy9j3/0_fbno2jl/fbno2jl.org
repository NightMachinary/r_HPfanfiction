A lot of people haven't read the books for a long time, but read fanfics that follow the stations of canon, so they are under the impression that they do remember the books, even though they really dont remember them at all, like I had to explain extremely basic stuff multiple times, but got downvoted because it contradicted what commonly happened in fanfics.
