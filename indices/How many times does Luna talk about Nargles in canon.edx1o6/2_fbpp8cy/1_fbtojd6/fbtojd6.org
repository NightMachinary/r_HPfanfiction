I'm getting tired of the Fred and George Weasley twin talk, like they might do it occasionally, but not every time they show up.

I'm also tired of the "Be serious!" "I am Sirius!" Joke, it was funny at first, but so old.

Whenever I use Fred and George I hardly use twin speak with them, and when I write Sirius, I don't use the but I am Sirius joke, because I'm so tired of it.
