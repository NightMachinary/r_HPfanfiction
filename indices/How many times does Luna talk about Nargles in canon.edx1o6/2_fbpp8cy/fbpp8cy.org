There's a lot of this nonsense in fanfiction.

Moody (?) /once/ mentions "Merlin" in conjunction with swearing, and so everyone start any and all exclamations with "Merlin,...", even muggle born or muggle raised. It's ridiculous. Harry or Hermione, having been immersed in muggle culture for 11 years, unaware of magic, immediately uses "Merlin" in exclamations after joining the magical world. After 11-12 years of muggle-style swearing, it takes /years/ to acclimatize to wizard-style swearing, if at all. It's like the author needs to remind us that it's a magical world. Even Draco uses "God" as an exlamation the first time he shows up on the train.

Then there's Hedwig, being fed bacon at all times, even though owls don't eat bacon and apparently cooked food makes them sick (or just dead).

And I'm getting /really/ tired of Lupin's "furry little problem".
