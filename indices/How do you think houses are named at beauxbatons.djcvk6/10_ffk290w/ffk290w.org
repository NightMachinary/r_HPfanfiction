In the real world, boarding schools are the only ones that really have "Houses", and generally that's only in Europe. Beauxbatons, if my memory is correct, I don't think Beauxbatons is a boarding school. Although, I've been unable to find any proof, so if it is a boarding school, I'd advise looking up some french boarding schools for examples. When in doubt, generate some French surnames and attach them to famous people. Or, look up some famous French wizards. For example: Nicholas Flamel, Pierre Bonaccord, and Lisette de Lapin.
