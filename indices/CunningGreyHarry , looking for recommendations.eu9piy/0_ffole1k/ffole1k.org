I [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11602420/1/Call-Me-Moriarty]]

My personal favourite of these types of fics. Essentially, Hermione and Harry are Sherlock and Moriarty-types. There's another one about where Harry does a lot more crime stuff, but I can't find it or remember the title right now. I'll get back to you if I find it.
