The other day, I heard a rumor that one of my favorite fanfic authors might quit the game. I started to get worried she'd go so far as to delete her fanfic from fanfiction.net, so I began to ask around for the best way to save fics. Someone pointed me toward [[http://www.flagfic.com/][flagfic]], and I have to say, it's working really well so far. It supports many major fanfiction sites, and will convert stories into PDF or into Nook and Kindle-friendly formats. I thought the denizens of [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] could make good use of it.
