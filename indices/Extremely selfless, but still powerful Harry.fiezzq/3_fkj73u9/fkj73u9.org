Two fics in a series, 2nd is incomplete as of yet but pretty regularly updated.

1: Other People's Choices

2: Wolf's Choice

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13011659/1/]]

Both fics are also on AO3 I believe

EDIT: Uhh there is bashing but it doesn't really effect the story negatively imo. It's only one character, and it's not Ron or Hermione, they are wonderful and loyal friends throughout the whole story
