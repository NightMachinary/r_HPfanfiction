Actually... The fidelius hides the secret from the moment it is cast until someone tells you the secret. It does not, as some here seem to be thinking, make you forget it as you exit the hidden area. That means that everytime a new prisoner arrives ihe inverted version would have to be recast. Still doable, just really inefficient.
