Most of the stuff with Ron and his harem and the DE's wasn't actually written by Rorschach's Blot (that's part of why a lot of it feels kind of disconnected from the main story). RB has a Yahoo group that shares his stories with and a lot of that fic was “written by committee”. Also I don't think any of it was done maliciously but more trying to come across as a 80's sex comedy, and if you try to watch most of those anymore they don't tend to hold up well.

I am curious though as to what you found misogynistic or homophobic in his other works like say Reunion?
