I always feel like I'd like Rorschach's Blot's fics better if they were written by anybody else. Coz there's all this super fun plotting but then it's peppered with try-too-hard misogyny and homophobia and just so much cringe! Like, I get that it's dated, but I don't much like being inundated with feelings of 'ugh!' just when I'm starting to have fun.
