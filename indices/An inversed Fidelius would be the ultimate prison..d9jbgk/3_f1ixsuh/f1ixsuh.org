It really depends on how the Fidelius works, exactly:

If it removes and conceals the information itself - If it can apply to /anything/, even the very concept of "escaping from this prison" might be hidden from the prisoner. If only information of the form "Location X exists", hide the existence of the prison from the prisoner, or, failing that, the existence of the walls or the grounds around it (So as far they can think, they are floating in a pocket universe or something).

For that matter, perhaps one could Fidelius the prisoner's knowledge of how to use language, or walk, or the existence of their arms or legs, or of magic itself.

â€‹

The weaker alternative is that the initial casting removes the information from everyone but the Secret-Keeper, and locks away the location in a pocket dimension, with the information of the existence of the location being the 'password' for entering, with the ongoing Fidelius effect, simply preventing others from speaking it.

Much in-universe experimentation would be needed.
