It's not really the same point. The point being made is that (in HP) a secret isn't just a piece of information that few people know; it's an independently existing entity. Something either is or isn't a secret; if it is a secret, then it exists in a person's soul. The Fidelius acts by taking that secret and hiding it in someone else's soul.

So to cast the Fidelius, first you need someone who "owns" a secret.
