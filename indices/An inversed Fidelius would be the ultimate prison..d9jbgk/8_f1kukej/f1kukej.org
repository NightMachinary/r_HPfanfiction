There was a fic I read where someone did that to Bellatrix Lestrange, they petrified her and put her on top of Ravenclaw tower locked in a contained Fidelius of some kind. They gave her two secret keepers because it would've been cruel if her first one died and she would've essentially been stuck there, unseeing and unhearing and unknowing until she died.
