I mean, it's only bright and fanciful due to the tone of the earlier books. It already is a dystopian setting before you even throw a Dark Lord into the mix.

- The sole prison is a hellhole where prisoners are malnourished and guarded by nightmares that literally suck all the happiness out of them and torment them with their worst memories constantly.

- The government is hilariously corrupt, with wealthy families able to obtain influence fairly easily (case in point: Malfoy, despite being an (acquitted) terrorist, became one of the Minister for Magic's most trusted advisors in a decade.

- The justice system is a joke, especially when they have such powerful tools as legilimency and veritaserum available to determine the truth. Granted, clever enough wizards could find ways around them but there could also be clever enough wizards on the prosecuting side to ensure that they don't.

- Also, they chucked an innocent man in their hellhole prison for over a decade before he broke himself out, and never actually declared him innocent. Granted, it was wartime but even that is no excuse for almost a decade and a half of complacency after the war ended - that is covered by the previous point of the justice system being shit. Not to mention, once he re-entered the public eye, not a single person thought to go over his case files? Not a single person went through them to try and determine what he was up to, and discovered the lack of a trial? In fact, maybe someone did discover that, but were hushed up by the rampant bribery and corruption in the Ministry.

I could probably name more things but all of these points do not paint a very good image of the Wizarding World as a society - I could also talk about the rampant 'No-Maj' segregation and bigotry in Wizarding America, but the only evidence for that was a long time before the series began and times could have changed (not to mention the films not being canon Harry Potter books), so things could be different in the present-day wizarding America.
