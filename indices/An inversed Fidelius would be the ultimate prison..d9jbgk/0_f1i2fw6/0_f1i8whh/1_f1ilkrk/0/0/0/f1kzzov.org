ObL was a foreign adversary. Lucius Malfoy happens all the time after civil wars, which the First Wizarding War was. For instance, many high-ranking military officers in the American Civil War went on to become (or rather, stay) prominent regional politicians. More recently, the same thing happened in Northern Ireland and many former IRA leaders became high-ranking officials as part of the peace process. As with Malfoy, most of them have at least some plausible deniability.
