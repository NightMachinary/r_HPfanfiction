This is preposterous.

First of all, while we naturally do have some issues with corruption and the like in the real world, they are by no means anywhere near the scale of the HP world. As another commenter mentioned, it's like if Osama Bin Laden had paid off the US to rule him innocent, despite everyone being fully aware that he was never innocent, and he then took up a position as Head Advisor to George Bush.

Second of all, the vast bulk of the corruption and similar in the real world exists in large part because of things that magic can easily fix. Criminal justice failings happen because we can't prove truth or a lie, we can't see other people's memories and we can't compel people to follow the law - veritaserum, penseives, unbreakable vows, legillimency etc all fix that. Corruption and bribery and the general evils of the monetary world all come down to scarcity, a concept that makes far less sense in the HP world. Etc etc. This means that not only is there more corruption and the like in the HP world than the real world, but it makes less sense and could be much more easily defeated if someone bothered to try.

This is like saying 1984 is indistinguishable from the real state of Britain because we have lots of security cameras. Nonsense
