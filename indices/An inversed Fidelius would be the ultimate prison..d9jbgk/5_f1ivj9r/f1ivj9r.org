sounds about right, not only that but it wouldn't be too hard to accomplish. the secret keeper (likely the prison warden) would probably have to remain inside the fidelius due to both the inverted nature of the charm (and also for convenience sake regarding prison transfers, intake and release of prisoners, etc). it works with both prevailing theories of the charms function as well. if it works via altering individuals perception reality then any one inside the ward would be affected in the desired manner, and if it functions via spatial manipulation and pocket dimensions then it most likely be mechanically identical to a normal fidelius (likely also taking an identical amount of magical power to cast as well), merely checking for knowledge of the secret to exit instead of to enter.

it would also be immune to external forces breaking out prisoners as all would be jailbreaker's would be unable to escape as soon as they entered.
