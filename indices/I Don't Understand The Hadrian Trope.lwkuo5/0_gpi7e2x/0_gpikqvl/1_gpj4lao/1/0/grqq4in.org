I can /maybe/ get behind Jimmy. But why use Bill instead of Will? Where does the „T“ in Ted come from? You could just use „Ed“. It doesn't make sense. There should be a law that Nicknames either start with the same letter as the actual name or aren't in any way related to the actual name (like with the marauders).
