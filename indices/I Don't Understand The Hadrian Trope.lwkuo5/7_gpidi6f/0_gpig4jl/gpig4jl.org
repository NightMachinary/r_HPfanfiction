The "nasty, common name" thing is a deliberate joke on JKRs part designed to show up the Dursleys as social climbers who don't actually have a clue.

Harry is, in the UK at least, a relatively posh name. It's technically a nickname for Henry- which is the name of eight of our previous kings, a good number of whom are actually referred to as "Harry" in historical documents such as letters from friends/family. Prince Harry is undeniably posh and the best known owner of the name. Of course, he's a Henry too on his birth certificate. It's much more common now as traditional names have had a bit of a resurgence, but at the time PS was being written (early 90s) if you met a bloke called Harry, there's a high chance he was privately educated. It was, and still is, a posh name, either on its own or short for Henry.

Dudley, on the other hand, is very much /not/ a posh given name. It's /unusual,/ but unusual is not the same as posh. It screams of parents who are trying too hard. It's actually /Petunia/ who gave her son a "nasty, common name," and even young readers in the UK got the joke when the book came out, because how can Harry be a common name when it's the princes name?!

That tiny throwaway line established Petunia's character. She's desperate to be something she's not, which is exactly where all her canon issues spring from.
