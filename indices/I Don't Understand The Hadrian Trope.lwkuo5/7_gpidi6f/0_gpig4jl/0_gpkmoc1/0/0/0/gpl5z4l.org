Yeah, there were three Elizabeth's in mine, but like, it's still the queen's name so it's a posh name, even if lots of "regular" people are also called it. Traditional names have definitely come round again in the past 20 years though. Loads of kids getting called Harry and George these days, whereas when I was a child (and I'm about Harry's age) they were definitely the posh names.

My point is, "Harry" is a traditional name as used by royalty. (As is James actually). "Dudley" is the more "common", as in "lower class" of the two names, even if Harry is more /usual/ and /widespread./

Petunia's comment of it being a "nasty common" name doesn't mean "loads of people are called Harry." It means "I think this name is synonymous with being lower class," when it's actually a version of the most popular boys name in the monarchy so by definition cannot be inherently lower class, no matter how many "common" people use it.
