I don't really have a problem with Hadrian, though I've seen some people say they'll stop reading a story about it.

However, in canon Petunia complained that Harry was "a nasty, common name." This indicates that his actual given name was Harry. (I once knew a man whose given name was Bob --- not Robert: his birth certificate said Bob.)

I have a full set of notes from research I did for if I was ever going to write a fic in which Harry goes on the run and changes his name. *Hardwin* was already mentioned, as being the name of an ancestor, and means "courageous friend". I also liked *Harfang*, which is another name for a snowy owl. /(Of course, if you were really on the run and disguising your name, it should be something that is not at all connected or similar to your real name.)/
