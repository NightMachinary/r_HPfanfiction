If I see the name Hadrian, I stop reading. I just cannot stand it. His name is Harry. HARRY. Some fics try to build at least a bit of plot around it, while others just slap it on there for no reason.

To me, Harry's name, hair colour, and the colour of his eyes are things you should never touch. They're too intrical to who he is.
