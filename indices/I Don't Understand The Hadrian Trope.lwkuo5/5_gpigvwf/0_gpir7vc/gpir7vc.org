I read stories on my kindle, and name-checking is step two after deleting author notes: search for the weird variants, and replace with Henry or Harry depending on how I feel that day. I've only ever came across one that had an actual reason for changing his name and it was a reasonably thought out reason even if the end result was awful (time travel, Sirius blood adoption shenanigans made him look more like a black, star name.... ended up with Hydrus of all fucking things. Tbh it was entertaining to read him justify the name while talking about snake constellations and crap when his name was still Harry lol).

You can also use the word changer addon available to most browsers to get rid of the common ones, if you read that way. Then, you too can see a snotnose kid introducing himself as Harry "Harry" Potter and giggle uncontrollably.
