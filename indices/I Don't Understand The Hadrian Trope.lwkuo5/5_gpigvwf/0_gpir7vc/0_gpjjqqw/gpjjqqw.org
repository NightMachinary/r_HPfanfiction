Some people take things waaay too far.

I can't remember the name of it, but I once came upon a fic where, by the end of the first chapter, Harry's name had changed to Lord Hadrian Potter-Peverell-Black, etc.

His hair was long and light brown, his eyes were blue, and he was a bit of an edgelord.

Oh, and obviously a cool bloke like that couldn't be seen with an owl, so good bye Hedwig, and hello falcon-whose-name-is-not-important.

That character is not Harry Potter. This is an OC, and a terrible one, at that. Needless to say, that first chapter was enough for me to nope out. It was awful.
