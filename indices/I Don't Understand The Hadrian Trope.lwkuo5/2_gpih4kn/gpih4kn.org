Ermithecow's response to JennaSayquah here nails it right on the head. It's people not quite understanding the name Harry. Possibly cultural differences - maybe it is a common name in the US? - but yeah. Here, Harry is a relatively posh name, people don't understand that and think it needs a bit more Societal Ooomph, so they riff on it awhile before coming up with Hadrian. Dude was an Emperor, he had a wall, it's Roman, that's perfect for the Wizarding World!

But yeah, more Royals have had names like George, Harry, and James than Fitzgerald or Montague. I think the poshest UK Royal Name I remember from the last century is Victoria. Prior to that, probably Isabella for Queens and Charles for Kings.
