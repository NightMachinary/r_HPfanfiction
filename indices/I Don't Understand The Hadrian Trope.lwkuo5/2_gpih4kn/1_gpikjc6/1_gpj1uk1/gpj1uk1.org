  I find your point about the â€˜poshest' royal name to be a bit hilarious.

What was Orwell's phrase? We're all equals, but some are more equal than others. Regnal names are posh, sure, but some are posher-sounding than others. :)

But no. I don't actually know if that cultural facet extends outside the UK, so I was attempting to be comparative. A lot of people seem to think that 'posh' names have to sound like Byzantine Emperors, all 'Dominus Noster Flavius Theodosius Augustus' and similar. So, by that metric 'Harry' is generic, but 'Victoria' or 'Isabella' or 'Charles' might be regarded as more posh. I was attempting (perhaps poorly) to connect it back to the Fitzgerald and Montague thing - the very 'Downton Abbey' perception of posh that seems most visible outside the UK.

I do agree that they're all posh sounding to us, though. Harry always evoked an image of a vaguely roguish lad from Oxford, and Charles is a real 'old boys club' sort of name.
