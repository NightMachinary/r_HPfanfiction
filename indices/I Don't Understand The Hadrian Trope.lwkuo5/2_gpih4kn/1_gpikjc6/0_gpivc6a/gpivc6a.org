It also used to be you had a strong self-selection, so you wouldn't find a servant girl called Victoria. (Well, and if you did, she was going to be called Jane regardless when in service.)

I think historically, this is very simple: The lower class is behind the curve. In Victorian times, maids might be Mary and footmen might be James and John. It takes time to filter through society -- or it did, anyway. It's obviously a lot more fluid since the 20th century.
