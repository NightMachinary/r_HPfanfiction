I think it goes a bit further than that culturally. There seems to be a trend these days, particularly coming from the States, where traditional surnames and Patronymics are used as first names notably in a unisex way. The argument about Harrison, for instance is a bit dead because Harrison is now a ‘royal' name because of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor but is at least used in its proper context.

I find your point about the ‘poshest' royal name to be a bit hilarious. Surely by virtue of it being a regnal name it is posh, having entered the upper stratosphere of the upper class.

Ironically regnal names become common, because they are used by the royals. It used to be that when the name of a royal birth was announced, there would be a spike in popularity among the rest of us.
