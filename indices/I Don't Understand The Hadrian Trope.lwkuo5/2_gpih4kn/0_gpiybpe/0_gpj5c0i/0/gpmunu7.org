Fitz- is a patronymic that exists in Norman French, from Latin ‘Filius' meaning son. As Anglo-Norman French was the prestige language of the nobility for several centuries, it evolved. Hence why Royal Bastards were termed ‘Fitzroy', son of the king. IIRC that trend continued into the noble bastards, hence why we see sometimes FitzJames, FitzAlan, FitzGerald, FitzWilliam.

The Regency iirc correctly was a time of change for the nobility, that's when they start to become somewhat irrelevant, the beginnings of the industrial revolution changed everything and their sort of last hurrah as it will came with the advent of the Great War.
