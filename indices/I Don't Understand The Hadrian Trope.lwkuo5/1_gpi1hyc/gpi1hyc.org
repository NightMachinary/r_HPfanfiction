A lot of the wizarding society names are Roman emperor names: Severus (Snape), Marcus (Flint), Tiberius (Ogden), Lucius (Malfoy)

or just Roman/Greek names from Mythology: Cassandra and Sybil (Trelawny), Argus (Filch), Minerva (McGonagall), Pomona (Sprout), Remus (Lupin), Aurora (Sinastra), Alastor (Moody), Merope (Gaunt), Andromeda, Nymphadora, Quirinus (Quirrell), Alecto and Amycus (Carrow), Dedalus (Diggle), Luna (Lovegood), Hermione, Mulciber, etc.

It just makes sense that Harry's name might be Hadrian to fit into the Roman emperor names. Harry is his name when he thinks he's ordinary. Harry finds out that he's a wizard, it makes sense he would have an extraordinary name. But he longs to be normal and still goes by Harry--in a firm juxtaposition to Tom Riddle, who hated having an ordinary name and goes to great lengths to be extraordinary.
