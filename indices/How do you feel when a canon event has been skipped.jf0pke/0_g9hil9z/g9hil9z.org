I started my first year fic on the train to Hogwarts simply because I was tired of reading the opening at the Dursleys and the trip to Diagon Alley over and over. Unless something is changed in those parts, really changed, then I don't really feel the need to read it or write it. Same with most canon scenes for me - either I change something or I find another way to present the information.
