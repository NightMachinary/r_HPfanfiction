I kinda feel like authors dont need to write about any shopping experiences unless it's vitally important to the plot. I don't need to know that Harry has 15 pairs of gray jeans and one pair of greeen pants etc, I just need to know that when he went to (insert store) he met such and such character and that character advanced to plot somehow. I don't even really need to know that Harry went to all the other stores in Diagon alley besides a line that says. After that conversation Harry finished his shopping and went home. On the same thread, I don't care for gringotts bank rides and the whole you are the heir of all the lordships either. I think gringotts has its time and place but it becomes repetitive over a multitude of fanfics. The most needed should be Harry went to gringotts and withdrew some money.
