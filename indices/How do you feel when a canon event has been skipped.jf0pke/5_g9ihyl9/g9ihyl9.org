One of my biggest peeves when reading fanfiction is authors lifting dialogue or chunks of text straight out of a canon scene just to rush through it. If it's not important enough to the story to rewrite in your own words, just mention it in a transition or something.

The other thing I super hate is when there is an OC or crossover character in a canon scene, and the Same. Exact. Dialogue. is lifted from the original text with a few original lines written for the OC. Or worse, a few lines of the lifted text is reassigned to the OC.

Like if your character is not interesting enough to influence the original dialogue in a canon scene, why am I spending time reading a fic about them?
