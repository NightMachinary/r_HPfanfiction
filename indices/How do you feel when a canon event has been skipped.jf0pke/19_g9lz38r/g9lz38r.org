Depends on context. If Harry ditches the creepy old man to follow booty shorts & fishnets over /Jimmy Kiddel's Wonderful Wands/ for his wand, by all means tell us about what happens there. Or any of the other points of departure into the story.

If nothing much changes prior to Hogwarts you can probably just start with him on the way to his house table and fill us in on minor details later.
