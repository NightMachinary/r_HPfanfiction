By all means, skip large swathes of canon if you like. I made a comment on this a while back but my belief is that there is no reason to rehash canon if you don't want to and it isn't absolutely necessary to advance the plot.

For example, if you think nothing important happens during the trip to Diagonal Alley then by all means skip it. Hell, if something important /does/ happen but you'll address it later or it wouldn't register as important to Harry at the time, feel free to skip it! I think a lot of fics would be improved by this thought process. So many fics that went nowhere because the author wanted to rehash canon for the sake of it and never got to the meat of the story.

It is perfectly okay to cut things out. You wouldn't detail Harry's breakfast every day of the year, so why would you detail an otherwise uneventful shopping trip? A single paragraph ought to do.
