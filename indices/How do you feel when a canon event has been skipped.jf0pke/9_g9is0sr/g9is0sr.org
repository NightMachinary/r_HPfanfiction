Yes and no. Yes, you should skip anything that is not NECESSARY for your story, including (and especially) anything which was important in the books. Whenever (and it is painfully often) I read Professor McGonagall's speech about four houses at Hogwarts I have the strongest urge to close the story and run away. And no, repeating is not only unimportant, it is altogether harmful.
