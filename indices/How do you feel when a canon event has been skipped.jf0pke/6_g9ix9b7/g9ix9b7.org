I would prefer you include a commentary like retelling of the events...

  The shopping trip to the strangely magical back alley of a surprisingly dingy and dirty pub was quite magical.\\
  Harry got swarmed by adults, he really didn't expect to be a celebrity, met /Goblins/ who were bankers, learned that he had a fortune in gold, bought all that was on the list provided with his Hogwarts acceptance letter but the highlight he decided was getting his wand... it felt like he found a missing part of himself.

  Coming home to Privet Drive in contrast was as normal as always, Vernon threatened him Dursley got in a hit with his Smeltings stick Petunia even had some dishes for him to do... really he was glad he had the trip back to himself so he could prepare himself mentally.

this way the reader can assume stuff is like canon, while you can also highlight stuff that you'll use to tell the story. (you could always just start the fic after the trip)
