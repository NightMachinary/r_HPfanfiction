I mean, in essence, writing is all about building a mental image in someone else's head. At the end of the day, everything in every book is in service to creating that image, in one way or another. If rehashing the canon basics helps build that image you want, then add it in, if not, then don't. There are still plenty of ways to reword, rework, and otherwise redo canon events in more novel and interesting fashions, so with sufficient thought put into it, repetition isn't too much of a bother to fix.

Twelve people can write the same 'going to Ollivanders to pick up the wand' scene, but each of those twelve could write a completely different conversation around picking up the wand while the scene is happening - perhaps different people are involved, or perhaps a change in the setting history, or whatever else that would lead to different commentary on the standard Holly wand.

It's not what you do, it's what you do with it that counts. Also how you do it, but that had less of a rhythm to it. Even lazy writing is in the hows rather than the whats.
