My view on this comes in two parts:

1. Stories should be able to stand on their own feet. Firstly because it's good writing and practice for original fiction, where you don't have the luxury of readers already knowing things. Secondly because it avoids the ambiguity of readers not knowing whether or not something from canon has occurred.

2. If a scene is so similar to canon that you're worried about readers being bored by the story covering the same events as canon, then your story isn't original enough.

Stories absolutely should not be rehashing canon. But the way to achieve this is by telling an original story, not by just skipping chunks of the narrative.
