I mean it's only lazy writing if it's lazy writing. If you're not going to diverge from canon in any scene I think skipping is far superior to either quoting large swathes of the book or writing the whole thing out in your own voice.

There also seems to be a lot of people on here talking about how annoying it is when fics just visit the stations of canon with slight differences. In my book, only include what is pertinent to the story/strengthens the whole story, much like a goblin made weapon.
