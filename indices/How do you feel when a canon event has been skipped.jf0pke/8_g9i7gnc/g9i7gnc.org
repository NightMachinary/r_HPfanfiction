I think it's pointless to re-write a scene from the books unless the perspective is shifted to another character who thinks very differently from Harry or the events turn out significantly different from the original series. That's why I lately started avoiding fics in which the action occurs during the series unless they are written from the perspective of a character who doesn't frequently appear in the story.
