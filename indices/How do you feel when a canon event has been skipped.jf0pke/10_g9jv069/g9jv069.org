depends. Did you change something? Still meeting Draco in the robe shop? Or someone else? Or maybe his parents are with him? Same wand? Hagrid still pic out Hedwig or was there something else?\\
If you changed something, then yeah write that out a bit. If not, a glossover's fine.\\
And 'fer cryin out loud most of us can repeat the First Year Sorting Song backwards, so maybe skip that too (unless, of course, you rewrote it).
