Ah, Schnoogle. Every time I forget that exists, I find out about it again and laugh at the funny sounding name. Schnoooogle. Heh.

I can understand that. It's like listening to a football match for me, personally - I sort of vaguely understand that some people enjoy this, but I'm really quite bored and it's just a lot of back and forth while people shout odd things and can I go do something else now? :D
