I thought that PotterCast used to do some episodes where they would read out fanfic, but maybe I am misremembering. Though my googling did turn up Fangasm, which has voice actors read out HP erotica, among others: [[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-potterotica-podcast/id1195467221?mt=2]]

I always thought it would be awesome to have more fanfic as audiobooks to make them more accessible.
