Hmm. Magnus Archives might not be your thing, then. Still worth a try, because the humour is delicious, but it is a horror thing so there is a dash of bleakness. I guess it depends on what you see as Grimdark.

Since you've given me yet more links - immensely grateful for that, thank you, and boy do nearly all of the podcasts linked look interesting - if you like music with your story, there's a semi-audiobook experience called The Mechanisms that you might also enjoy. They're more burlesque, story-telling album than actual podcast or audiobook, but they still tell a story set to music and you can find lyrics on most of the generic 'lyrics dot com' type sites. I recommend giving each of their albums a try, if you're interested - they're all quite different in style, but they're all sci-fi steampunk re-imaginings of old myths and tales (One is on Greek Myths, one on Norse, one on Fairy Tales, and one on Arthurian Legend).

Cool, good to know. I'll keep an ear on the music and an eye on the humour. :)

Space is great though. Gotta love space. Space. Spaaaaace. I think most of us in the Nerdy Spheres would probably want to go at least once. :)
