Well, I am still early on in both podcasts (I listen slowly and read the transcripts - I am a visual person not auditory, so it's hard to listen without the words.). The music for Marsfall is original, and it might not be to your tastes. I think it's fine. Girl in Space is more appealing to me (maybe because I am a girl who would love to go to space - where is the TARDIS?!). It's got more humor than Marsfall, which I like. I'm not so much into grimdark, especially these days. Yeah, sort of reminds one of The Martian in terms of ordinary people put in extraordinary circumstances.
