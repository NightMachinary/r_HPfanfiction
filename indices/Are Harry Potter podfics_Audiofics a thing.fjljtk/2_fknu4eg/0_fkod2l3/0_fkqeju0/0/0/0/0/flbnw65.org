Enjoy. Critical Role is a bunch of Voice Actors playing D&D (there's nearly 200 episodes of the visual stuff and it's about 450 hours of runtime total) and Magnus Archives is a cranky dude doing the archives filing for a Lovecraft-XFiles type group.

There's also a thing called The Leviathan Chronicles that I'm semi-listening to, but I have no idea if I like that yet. It started off like Dan Brown wrote Highlander after playing Bioshock and watching extreme fishing documentaries for a week and now it's getting more like H.G Wells writes weird government conspiracy theories.

Oooh. Girl in Space looks very cool. Kind of reminds me of a game I played recently called Deliver Us The Moon. Probably a dash of The Martian in there too, only featuring Quirky!Clara from the Asylum of the Daleks episode of Doctor Who instead of Matt Damon. Marsfall does sound like someone wrote their Surviving Mars game into an audioplay and I am totally down for that. Any particular thoughts on either of your recs that you think might be nice to know before starting them?
