Thanks for the additional rec. (Part of why I love WtNV is the music.) To me, grimdark is more about torturing the characters than the story. I need a thread of hope for the characters I like. I'm a re-reader, and if a story is super depressing, I can't re-read it. Basically, I get emotional when I read or watch media, and the effects linger in real-life. Hence my not being able to read shallow, poorly written romance or pairings I hate, because I can't identify.
