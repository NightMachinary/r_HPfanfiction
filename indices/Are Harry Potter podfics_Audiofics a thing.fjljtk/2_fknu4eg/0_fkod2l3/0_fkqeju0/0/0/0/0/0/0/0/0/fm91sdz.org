Sure. And yeah, the Weather Reports are almost always great songs I immediately add to my playlists. Though I am quite far behind - I lost some of my motivation to catch up after they started reducing the everyday-ness of the weird stuff. It wasn't a "A giant meteor landed on John Peters' (you know, the farmer?) car today - must've been illegally parked, as that is the Sheriff's Secret Police's way of letting you know that you have a ticket!" kind of tone anymore. Are you still keeping up with it?

Hmm. I think Magnus Archives might be somewhat interesting to you, then. The entire premise is that this cranky guy is recording statements made by people who ran into supernatural weirdness and they vary from 'a thing tried to eat me in a dark basement and then I ran away and convinced myself I imagined it' to 'things went thud in the night and it was scary and I had nightmares for the rest of my life'. The first episode is fifteen minutes long and pretty representative of the bulk of the series (though the length of later episodes does vary), so you won't have to waste much time deciding whether you like it or not. The main character's voice actor is actually the lead singer of The Mechanisms.

And The Mechanisms definitely isn't Grimdark. It's often more... bittersweet, I suppose? Like the Lemony Snicket series. The good guys win, but they lose something at the same time. It's very Film Noir, Steampunky in that way. I'd recommend giving Ulysses dies at Dawn a go to see if you like it (that's the Greek myth Album). The music is stellar, though.

Ah, fair. I'm similar - though I process those emotions quite quickly. I'm not an overly big fan of that sort of Grimdark either - though it's mostly just pointless edginess being really uninteresting to me. I've only had about a half dozen fics really get to me like that where the feeling lasts for awhile afterwards.
