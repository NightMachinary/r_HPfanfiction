Really? Huh. I expected it was more of an intermittent thing done on occasion than an actual phenomenon. That's pretty cool. A friend is in voice acting and I'm mildly obsessed with Critical Role, The Magnus Archives, and Nightvale, so I'm well aware that VO is both harder and easier than most might expect. I'm very glad it's a thing - we need more audio stuff in our lives.
