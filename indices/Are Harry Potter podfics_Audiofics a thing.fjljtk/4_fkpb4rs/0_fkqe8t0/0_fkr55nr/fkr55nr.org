Yea it does seem a bit odd. I'm not really sure of the legalities myself, but from what I know the author has actually been in contact with Rowling in the past, and has written a number of original novels, so assume its most likely all above board.

Regardless of whether you listen to the audio books, I'd still definitely recommend reading them. Here's a [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqf0psninyc98ee/James%20Potter%20PRINT%20files.zip?dl=0][link]] to print quality pdfs of the stories. The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/45293-james-potter][Goodreads page]] has all the info on the order etc...
