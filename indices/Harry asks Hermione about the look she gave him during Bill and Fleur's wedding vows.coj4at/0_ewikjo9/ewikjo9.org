Hermione probably beamed at other people too, we don't know. She turned specifically to Harry because he's one of her best friends and she was witnessing a very pretty moment with him, like how sometimes something hilarious happens in front of you and your group of friends, and you all look at each other laughing as if saying "isn't this great?"; Hermione was probably thinking something along those lines too.

I will say though, I loved the way the author of /Hermione Granger Is Stupid/ changed this scene to fit his story, it was very sweet.
