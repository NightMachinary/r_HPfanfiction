There's similar stories but I don't think I've read one with that exact plot and I've read A LOT of dramione fics probably in the 100s So unless someone else has read it And can send a linkðŸ¤”

I think your story idea seems really interesting so if you plan on writing it can you please update with the site and link you will be posting it on

As I said there is similar ones with hermione being pregnant and not telling anyone who the father is (draco) Until its safe And one where she gets pregnant and has a miscarriage during bellatrix' torture with draco not knowing about the baby until after that event has happened those are the only two I can think of where they're together in school..gets pregnant During the war... And being together ever after
