Okay time to dive right into that can of worms.

IMHO there's a bunch of problems with that. First and foremost: Why didn't she just tell him? Is there any sensible reason why she had to be so circumspect about it? Why didn't she dissuade him from getting the stone, she had to know it's a fake. Couldn't she have warned Ginny to hide her broomstick better? Would have been nice... As I've said in the first post, it opens up the possibility for so many plotholes.

Also does that mean there's a whole other time line (that we didn't get to see - ugh) in which Harry failed and then Fate decided to send Luna back in order to save his ass? That's just... No. Honestly there's little reason that Harry should be the protagonist is that's the case.

Everything you mentioned as evidence could just as well be quirky Luna-traits that make her interesting - having her as a time traveler makes her boring. Been there done that. You can't just throw a new time traveler at every big problem on order to solve it (and it really doesn't add anything to the story). It lowers the stakes. I guess if Luna fucks up too there can be another time traveler who fixes her mistakes? I'd expect LeadVonE to be a better writer than this.
