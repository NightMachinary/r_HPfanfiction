Long rambling counter argument time! I'll be assuming Luna's a time traveler for my points.

The reason why she doesn't tell him is admittedly the weakest part of the theory, but there can be any number of reasons. As I said in my other post, it could be that she thought having the big events play out as they did in her timeline (at least at the outset) was beneficial for some reason. Unfortunately we can't know if that's a good reason since we don't know the future events of the story. Though don't misunderstand me and think I'm saying Luna's on a "preserving the timeline" kick like John. She's still training Ginny and Alex in a way that definitely wouldn't have occurred in her timeline.

As for the problem with multiple time travelers lowering the stakes...yeah, sure. But that's the entire premise of the story! It was established at the outset that Fate could do do-overs when she sent Harry back after John, and there's nothing in the first chapter that implies she can't do it again. That flaw has always been there, so I see it as a damned if you do, damned if you don't kind of thing. That said, I don't think it's a negative to show that Harry can still fail. He really comes across as too overconfident a lot of the time.

Finally, the issue with this somehow making Luna boring. I'll be honest: so far, I don't like Luna's characterization in this story. Like in so many other harem fics, Luna is portrayed as a flawless, eccentric Mary Sue. She's perfectly sociable despite her weirdness, she's vastly more skilled than the other girls even though we've never seen her training with Harry, and she somehow has an intimate knowledge of ritual magic for no apparent reason. Personally, I think having Luna be a time traveler would temporarily excuse these problems, and leave some room for a deeper character than we've seen so far depending on how it's handled. Either way, I hope second year will flesh her out more.
