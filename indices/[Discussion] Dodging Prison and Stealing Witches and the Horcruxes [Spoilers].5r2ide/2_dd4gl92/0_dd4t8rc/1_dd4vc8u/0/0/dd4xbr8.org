Yeah, the potential death of Tracey is a big risk to take, even with reasonably accurate foreknowledge.

Given my theory, I'd obviously say that the lack of a "this is your last chance" moment backs my position, though that's such weak evidence that it's not even worth bringing up.

  Oh by the way, Luna seemed genuinely excited and surprised when she learned about the switching spell. Did she fake that excitement if she is a time traveler?

No, actually! I think this moment plays perfectly into Luna being a time traveler. Ginny learned the switching spell after asking Harry for advice on how to beat Luna. Assuming Luna was much weaker in her original timeline, she wouldn't have been able to push Ginny to that extent, and that spell would've never been invented/brought up.
