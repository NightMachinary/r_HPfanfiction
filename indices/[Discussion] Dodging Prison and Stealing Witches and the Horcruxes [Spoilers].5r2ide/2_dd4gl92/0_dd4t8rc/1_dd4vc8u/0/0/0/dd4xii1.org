  Given my theory, I'd obviously say that the lack of a "this is your last chance" moment backs my position, though that's such weak evidence that it's not even worth bringing up.

Oh yeah, definitely. Wasn't trying to dispute that.

  No, actually! I think this moment plays perfectly into Luna being a time traveler. Ginny learned the switching spell after asking Harry for advice on how to beat Luna. Assuming Luna was much weaker in her original timeline, she wouldn't have been able to push Ginny to that extent, and that spell would've never been invented/brought up.

Okay, yeah, that actually makes sense. Thanks. But this also plays into why I don't think that Luna is a Mary Sue. She's not really pushing the boundaries, Ginny is. If the back-and-forth between them didn't exist and Ginny just had someone else to challenge her she would vastly outperform Luna. Luna is just offering a challenge. Ginny is doing all the work. Luna is just some sort of magic-savant who picks it up easily (which is great and incredibly useful I'm sure, but not mary-sue-ish).
