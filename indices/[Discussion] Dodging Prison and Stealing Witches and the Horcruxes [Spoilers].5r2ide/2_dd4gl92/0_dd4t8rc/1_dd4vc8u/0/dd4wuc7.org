  Unfortunately we can't know if that's a good reason since we don't know the future events of the story.

What about Tracey? She could have died? Was that part of Luna's plan too? I think the fact that Harry gave up the Horcruxes and *couldn't* sacrifice Tracey even though it seemed like the right thing to do to him (he almost seemed to have some kind of physical reaction preventing him) might be his subconscious or a part of his 'trigger' for this exact circumstance.

  As for the problem with multiple time travelers lowering the stakes...yeah, sure. But that's the entire premise of the story!

Okay, this might be a little subjective, but there's a sort of understanding in this kind of story between reader and author. A sort of implied contract... that there's not going to be any more divine intervention (in order to solve problems). You're of course technically correct that there will be nothing preventing Death and Fate from intervening again, but the idea of it ruins any dramatic climax of the story, because there could be no scenario in which Harry would lose anymore. All stories that violate this understanding are almost all bad and you can find a bunch of them in low-brow fanfiction (Harry constantly talking with a divine entityt and getting rescued by Deus Ex Machina pulled out of someone's ass).

Other good stories like this often pre-emptively close the door on this by having the divine entity say something like "This is your last chance!" or "I won't intervene again", the fact that this is missing in DPSW opens up the possibility, but still would make it a bad idea story-telling wise.

  she's vastly more skilled than the other girls even though we've never seen her training with Harry

I disagree. I think Ginny is much more skilled than Luna, Luna is just more powerful and has a more 'intuitive' understanding of magic. If they weren't allies and Ginny didn't tell Luna about all the new things she has learned Luna wouldn't stand a chance in a real conflict. Oh by the way, Luna seemed genuinely excited and surprised when she learned about the switching spell. Did she fake that excitement if she is a time traveler?

The fact that we haven't seen what Harry has been teaching her is troubling, but we already know that he treats all of them very differently. I'm expecting some kind of 'reveal' about Luna (especially because we haven't had a POV from here), so I agree with you there.
