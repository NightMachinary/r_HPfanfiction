I'm going to counter your point with pretty much speculation, so be wary.

First off, I have no idea how Luna would've time traveled and it would be pretty dumb if it was fate. At this moment, I'd like to believe that it was some plan made up by the Harry in Luna's original timeline.

Second off, I think it would be a pretty unique twist that has some cool set up. It would certainly be the first time I've read of a separate time traveler arriving to help the protagonist time traveler without their knowledge, and it would be set up by the fact that Harry is already shown to be a second time traveler fixing the mistakes of the first, so why not a third? Also, I do believe that Luna is the only girl of the harem to have not had her own POV chapter, but that's off memory so I could be wrong. If I'm not, then a good reason for that would be to hide her as a time traveler.

And finally, as for the not telling Harry about it, it could be because Luna saw two different time travelers fail, one by doing nothing and the other by fucking with the world so much he stopped being able to predict when something went wrong (albeit a knowing decision on Harry's part). It's possible that Luna took a sort of middle ground, trying to not change anything important until a certain point, potentially Voldemort obtaining the Horcruxes, while making little improvements that ultimately wouldn't change the overall path of the timeline, as in the stuff I mentioned earlier.

Either way, I love the explanation, and I think it fits the story just fine.
