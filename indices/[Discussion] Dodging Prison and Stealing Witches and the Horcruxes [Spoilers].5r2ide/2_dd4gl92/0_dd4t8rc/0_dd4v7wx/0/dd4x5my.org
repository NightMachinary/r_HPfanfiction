  First off, I have no idea how Luna would've time traveled and it would be pretty dumb if it was fate. At this moment, I'd like to believe that it was some plan made up by the Harry in Luna's original timeline.

Long-term time travel is notoriously difficult to the point of almost impossible (at least that's heavily implied in the story or Voldemort would have done it too... he had many years to figure it out).

The Deus Ex Machina is even worse if you use a unknown device. We already know one method for long term time travel (that is quite ridiuclous enough), but now because that might lead to plot-holes we need to invent a whole other secret technique? Sorry that's just a really bad idea.

  Second off, I think it would be a pretty unique twist that has some cool set up
#+end_quote

There's nothing unique about this. Ever seen Terminator? Anyway, it's a very lazy solution and it is only good if you make the whole story about it (again, Terminator). Since the first part of the story barely had Luna in it it would be pretty dumb to make her suddenly the solution to everything. Luna being there to help Harry from the future might be interesting, but it would be a very different story written very differently.

  but that's off memory so I could be wrong. If I'm not, then a good reason for that would be to hide her as a time traveler.

Or there's some other reveal concerning her. Harry has been specializing 'his' girls in very different kinds of training. I'm even willing to go as far as to speculate that Luna might be a prophet/seer, but it seems implausible to me that Harry never noticed something off when he taught her occlumency etc.
