I think the centaur's comment in chapter 28 makes it clear that this is the third timeline, and therefore there is /not/ another time traveler.

#+begin_quote
  "Jupiter shines bright tonight." "The last time around, it was pluto, and the time before that, was mars."
#+end_quote

So the original timeline (as in the books) had mars shine brightly; the second timeline when John came back had pluto shine brightly; and the current timeline where both John and Harry came back has Jupiter. If there was another time traveler, the centaur would have mentioned an additional timeline.
