I know you don't want Luna to be the time traveler, but if you reread all of her interactions with Harry, it points heavily in that direction. ie: Luna asking Harry to be her friend while he's trying to figure out how to make that happen, Luna convincing her father to marry Harry, Luna always being just a little bit better at dueling then Ginny and being genuinely surprised when Ginny wins once, then is immediately one step ahead of her again. This could all be explained as Luna being Luna but it could also be Luna being a time traveling Luna.
