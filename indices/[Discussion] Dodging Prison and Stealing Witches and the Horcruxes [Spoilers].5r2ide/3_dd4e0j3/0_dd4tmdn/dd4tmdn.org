Yeah. It also points in that direction because we never see them discussing protections for the Horcruxes. We already know Harry expected Voldy to take hostages at some point and that he obviously would demand his Horcruxes back in such a scenario. I can't fathom Harry, Hermione or Daphne not considering a contingency plan for that.
