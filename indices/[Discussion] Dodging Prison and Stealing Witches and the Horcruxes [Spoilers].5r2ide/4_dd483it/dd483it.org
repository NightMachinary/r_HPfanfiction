I don't really understand the aversion to 4. I feel like it's been *very* heavily foreshadowed, and it gives justification for Luna's power and smarts other than "lol Luna's the best."

From the beginning of chapter 8:

#+begin_quote
  Luna Lovegood had been a nervous, frightened child when he'd last been at Hogwarts, but Voldemort's memories showed her to be both loyal, and a competent duelist.

This just doesn't square with everything we've seen from her. My theory is that she's taking a sort of hybrid approach to Harry and John's timeline shenanigans. Her limited interaction with Harry during first year ensures that events involving him go mostly as she remembers them, while she's free to make much larger changes as it pertains to Ginny and Alex. If this is the case, I expect the reveal would happen fairly early in second year, since they'll all be together and the horcrux switch would be a major disruption to the events experienced originally by Luna.
