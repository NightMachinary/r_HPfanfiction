To answer the question in the title:

I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564799/1/A-Traveler-s-Guide-to-the-Multiverse-Earth-001][A Traveler's Guide to the Multiverse: Earth-001]] again. It's a Worm/Harry Potter crossover. It has its faults, but I enjoyed it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196345/1/A-New-Man][A New Man]] are my favorite HP/Avengers crossovers, but they aren't updating anymore.
