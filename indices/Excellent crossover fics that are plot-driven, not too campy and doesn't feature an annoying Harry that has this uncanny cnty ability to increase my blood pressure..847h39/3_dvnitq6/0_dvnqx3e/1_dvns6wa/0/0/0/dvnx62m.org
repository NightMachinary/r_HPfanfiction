I've felt a bigger problem with fusion stories is that they are done in order to try and include all characters from both universes. There's a reason why professional authors don't include everyone and their squirrel in the same story. You can't really develop them much, and it results in the reader (or atleast me) into not giving a fuck about what happens to half of the characters in a story.
