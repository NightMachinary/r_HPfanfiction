Harry Potter and Marvel characters exist in the same universe.

Generally, HP/Avengers fusions have such a shitty worldbuilding I don't even bother to read them. Admittedly, /Heroes Assemble!/ has done a relatively good job of explaining how the wizarding world and Marvel superheroes could coexist in the same universe.

I follow the story, but it just doesn't wow me the same way /Wand and Shield/ and /A New Man/ did. Not saying the story is bad, just personal preferences.
