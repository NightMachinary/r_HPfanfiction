I'm kinda working on a Harry Potter / Warframe crossover linkffn(Harry Potter and the War Within) and I'm basically not even including Occlumency as a specific thing he can do - he fell through the Veil after Sirius in the Ministry Battle. I'm working on finishing it but it's gonna be slow and infrequent.
