There's a fic but I don't remember the name. I'll describe what I remember, maybe someone knows it. The Order of the Flamb√©ed Chicken tries to summon a hero, they are lucky and not, but several come. They are all Harry variants dark, chaotic, etc. and light. Mr. Light is a healer with an attitude, really funny, wants to be paid for everything immediately refuses to fight because it violates the healer oath. It gives him a bit of background history, at the Dursleys he loses both legs and this arouses his interest in healing. He develops lifelike prostheses, they didnt notice at the beginning that he has no legs. Among his customers is Madeye, among others, both here and in his home Dimension. It gets really funny when he and his "twins" go shopping in Diagon-Allee and their side streets. There he is attacked and literally takes his attackers apart alive. The others wonder he said he did not fight , he said des but that he was defending himself and that a healer knew how to do it best and to keep the "patient" on it for as long as possible etc.
