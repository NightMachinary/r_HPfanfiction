That's a pretty cool idea, honestly - there's tons of Evil Light Lord Dumbledore, and Evil Dark Lord Harry, but not this particular combo...

Yeah, I can see something that has roughly:

1. Dark = Wild/Unrestrained/Chaotic, Light = Controlled/Defined/Order
2. Evil Dark Lords generally are basically Voldemort, they act on every whim, delighting in chaos and domination
3. Evil Light Lords delight in order and control.

Like, a Dark Lord might Crucio a failed follower and cackle, a Light Lord would have had the follower sign a magical contract that enforced a defined, fitting, orderly punishment for failure. They are equally /cruel,/ but they operate very differently.

I'd never be a Dark Lord, but I could very easily be an [evil] Light Lord...
