[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer is by far one of my favorite peices of fanfiction ever. I've read it multiple times. Technically a crossover with Disgaea, and some elements from Silent Hill and Narnia, but no knowledge of the three are necessary. I actually ended up playing Disgaea and watching Silent Hill because of this fic.

Summary as follows: After Cedric's death, Harry and company summon a demon to kill Lord Voldemort. Except, well, when the hell is summoning a demon ever turn out just the way you planned?

Harry becomes badass, as does everyone else, training is not overdone or too cliche, everyone is well characterized, and a pretty decent romance is in there.
