That sounds like the last fic in the Paradigm of Uncertainty trilogy, [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/HWATF.html][Hero With a Thousand Faces]], which is super old and super-AU. As a heads up, that fic's a sequel to a sequel. Start with [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/TPOU.html][this]] instead.
