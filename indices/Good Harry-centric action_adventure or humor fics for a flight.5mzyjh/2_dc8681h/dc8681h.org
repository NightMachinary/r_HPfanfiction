I'm not familiar with the non humour fics that you gave as examples so I'm can't recommend anything based on that, but I think linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is a good super long adventure type story with lots of humour and action. It has only minimal background romance and doesn't have any Lord Potter political stuff that I believe you are talking about.
