I mean part of why I mentioned muggleborns was more of the tone of how muggles are talked about in the books. It's not so much them cutting themselves off from their families, it's just that with how isolationist the magical world is, even just getting a job in the wizarding world or marrying into a wizarding family essentially cuts them off from knowing anyone in the muggle world outside of relatives. And there's also a level of callousness towards muggles that's just...uncomfortable. For example, we never see a muggleborn getting upset over memory wipes. I mean maybe there are a lot complaining but we don't get to see it in the books. Hermione essentially changes who her parents are by altering the last 17 years of their lives when she could have talked to them as adults and gotten their permission to hide them somewhere. The lack of magic is treated as a disability and the magical attitude is sort of the ablest equivalent. Muggles don't need to give consent or understand what's happening them, the magicals know best, and when someone with magic cares about a muggle it's their responsibility to protect them regardless of what the muggle wants. The way squibs get treated alone is enough to show the magical world's view on the non-magical.
