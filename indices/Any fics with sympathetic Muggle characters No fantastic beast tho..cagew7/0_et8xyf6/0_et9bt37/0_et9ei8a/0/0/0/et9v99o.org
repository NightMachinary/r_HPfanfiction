You're right that there's not much in canon. It's more than anything the offhand comments you see every once and a while and the general tone those comments set. Like the Ron "I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him." or the Mr. Finnigan being in for a "nasty shock."

And ohhhhh yeah I wish we knew more about Hermione's relationship with her parents. She loves them enough to be protective of them and not want to worry them but that's not much. What bothers me more is Harry and Ron's reaction to Hermione essentially rewriting her parents. Or the lack. These three are supposed to be our heroes, but living in the wizarding world seems to have desensitized them to socially acceptable things in the magical world like mind wipes. Or love potions. Fanon often has characters like Hermione or Harry calling it out as rape but in canon it's just a potion. Molly's tale of using it in Hogwarts is treated as sweet instead of horrifying. Romilda Vane's potion is annoying but not expulsion worthy or reputation ending.

It's just interesting to consider how being emerged at such a young age and isolated into the wizarding world might influence the morals of the characters. Because it's worrying when a character constantly concerned with the rights of house elves and other magical creatures doesn't bat an eye at the societal norms such as memory alterations.
