I think you are still mixing what's really canon and what are you deductions.

1. Concerning work in the magical world, I think there some compromises could be made. Northumbrian worked on that extensively, so for example linkao3(1623053;3068372) and MIT stories show that with some cover story (work for the Home Office covered under the Official Secrets Act) should make normal live among Muggles believable. Of course, when ones get closer (see Strangers at Drakeshaugh again), troubles happen.

2. Memory wipes are problematic, true. I don't think anybody would make much noise about one-time random event short memory wipes (like all those sunbathers in Wales who saw The Common Welsh Green Dragon in [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ilfracombe_Incident]]). It becomes awfully problematic when wipes are repeated and/or longer memory ones (e.g., what happens in Strangers at Drakeshaugh again). I don't think the canon directly addresses the latter, but yes it is very problematic (there is nothing written how well the Roberts family survived their repeated and frequent memory charms).

3. The case of memory charm on Hermione's parents is rather complicated. First of all, it seems to me that she used actually some non-standard (reversible?) memory charm, because she was carefully preparing for something, which was later mentioned (in the Luchino Caffe) that she “best in casting” of spell all of them (somehow) knew how to cast. Second the relationship between Hermione and her parents is shockingly little researched while in my opinion quite problematic in all relationships in books. I am writing about it a bit in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/hermiona_nonsearch_parents.html]] (very very unfinished, WIP). I think strangeness of that relationship is a way more interesting and important than just memory charming them. Third, I think it is truly one of the cases where JKR dropped her ball on justice, because Fate (or somebody) should punish Hermione for doing something wrong (a way worse, than stupid but understandable conjuring of birds on Ron), what was basically equivalent of Imperius Curse.
