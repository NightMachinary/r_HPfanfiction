I can sort of see muggleborns cutting off from the muggle world simply because they have to keep a MAJOR part of their life secret no matter how much they trust people. Or go to Azkaban for breaking the statute of secrecy. Can you imagine not being able to tell your friends where you go to school, what you do mine months out of the year, why there are no phones/computers, why you have quills/pet owl if they see your stuff and have to lie about it?
