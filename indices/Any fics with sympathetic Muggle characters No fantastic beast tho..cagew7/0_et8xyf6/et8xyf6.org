1. Cutting muggleborns from the Muggle world intentionally is a pure fanon. Yes, it is difficult to keep up with the muggle world, when you are seven years mostly isolated from it, but there is nothing in the canon suggesting it is routinely done. My headcanon was always that Hermione subscribed not only to The Daily Prophet, but also to The Guardian (because it must be The Guardian).
2. linkffn(Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89) and its prequel linkffn(What We Had by Litfreak89) are obviously very pro-Muggle (it ships Harry × the Muggle waitress from the start of HBP).
3. linkao3(17777138) ships Hermione × Dean Thomas, and it is very much balancing in between the Muggle and wizarding world.
4. All those “Harry gives up on magic” stories are per definition very pro-Muggle (e.g., linkffn(5866364) ... WARNING! There is Ginny-a-gobblin-warrior inside!).
5. There is plenty of “Muggle wanders into magical world” (e.g., linkffn(2053712) or linkffn(3743602)), which are obviously pro-Muggle.
6. All those “The Queen steps in and saves the situation” (e.g., linkffn(11500936) or a crackfic linkffn(11961978)).
7. I forgot another category. “Harry grew up in a muggle institution” (the best one is linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader), which despite the title sounding like a one of Marquis de Sade novels is a very sweet and lovely thing, unfortunately unfinished).
