In the process of reading, but I've noticed an issue with your dialogue tags (at least in the first chapter).

You write...

#+begin_quote
  "Hey, I love cake," *S*he said, sitting down.
#+end_quote

Should be...

#+begin_quote
  "Hey, I love cake," *s*he said, sitting down.
#+end_quote

The tags are fine in later sections, but just in case it escaped your notice they aren't fixed at the very beginning.
