You're going to lose people for the fact the Slytherin girl you chose isn't from the books but that other monstrosity. Personally I felt cheated by the whole life debt thing. You shouldn't be able to earn a life debt from simply not killing them. You'd have to save them from an otherwise certain death. Otherwise you could go around claiming life debts for not Avada Kedavaring people. It feels cheap. The rest of it, yeah what others have said with regards to your Slytherin girl, it feels like less of a story more you telling us how great she is and how'd you fix all the flaws in Harry Potter. You're bending things to make it happens and it cheapens a potentially interesting story. If you're enjoying it then keep going but bear in mind that some people will likely leave less than pleasant reviews for what we've said. Some might do that simply because they can though so take it with a grain of salt.
