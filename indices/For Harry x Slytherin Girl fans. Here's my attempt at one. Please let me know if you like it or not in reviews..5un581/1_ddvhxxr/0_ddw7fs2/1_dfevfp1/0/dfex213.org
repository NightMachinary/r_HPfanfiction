Holy necro batman!

But in canon, life debts aren't this magical compulsion that makes people slaves.

And Harry was showing Wormtail mercy by making someone else not kill him. He never threatened Wormtail.

The idea that you could hold a knife to someone's throat, pull it away, and somehow they're your magical slave is ludicrous.
