If you're still interested, please read from "fiery redhead spitfire" and on. The chief purpose of the fic is to place an ethical dilemma. Dumbledore's Greater Good without any of the benefits vs a reasonable peace plan at the loss of personal freedom.

Dumbledore sees Harry sacrificing himself as heroic and self-sacrificing. A more narcissistic personality, who still cares enough about Harry's wellbeing, would see such a thing as mental torture to force a young man into suicide.

Who is right?
