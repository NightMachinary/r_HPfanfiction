My argument would be this - Harry is as wealthy as necessary to serve the plot.

Yes, the unlimited funds can seem like a cheat. Yes, the convenient DO NOT PLACE HARRY WITH THE DURSLEYS GODDAMMIT line in the mysteriously un-read will is like a brick. Yes, the unusual journal written by Lily Potter (and it is ALWAYS Lily) that has her notes on some esoteric discipline of magic for which Harry remarkably has an affinity can be a crutch.

But if the plot benefits from those details, and they serve the story, then there's no problem.
