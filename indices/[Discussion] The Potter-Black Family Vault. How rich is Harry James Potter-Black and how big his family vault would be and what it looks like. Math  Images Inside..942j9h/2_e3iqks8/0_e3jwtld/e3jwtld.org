  Yes, the unusual journal written by Lily Potter (and it is ALWAYS Lily) that has her notes on some esoteric discipline of magic for which Harry remarkably has an affinity can be a crutch.

It's interesting that it's always Lily. Do we even have /any/ idea of what sorts of magic she would be excellent at? I seem to recall her being good at charms, but I've 0 idea if that was fanon or not. And I think Slughorn refers to her as 'one of the brightest I've ever taught'. That doesn't necessarily translate into any neat skills or particular affinities. Hermione is described similarly, and she's more or less just excellent at researching and studying.

Whereas James is, in canon, impressively good at transfiguration. And he has a pretty unique skill in being an animagus.

No idea why I've never read anything where James writes a 'guide to being an animagus' and Harry gets ahold of it somewhere. Unless the guide in question is just Sirius.

Sorry for the double ping you're likely to get- I accidentally posted this on my main account, not my ff one.
