Okay, so I'm unclear from your post on how much you realise this is all made-up fanon. You refer to these as "tropes" which would seem to indicate that you understand it's made up by fanfic writers, but then you describe matters as a "consensus" as if this has some kind of factual weight, rather than just a load of fanfic writers with little imagination copying each other.

So, a few canon reminders:

1. There's no such thing as the Potter "trust vault". The vault we see Harry access in canon is his one and only vault.

2. There's no particular evidence that the Black family were super rich. Moderately wealthy (the term Dumbledore uses in HBP is "a reasonable amount of gold"), yes, but not Malfoy-level by any means. Probably not as much as Harry already had from the Potter inheritance, since the Potter wealth is described by JKR on Pottermore as a "fortune", after which it was "quadrupled". That sounds more than a "reasonable amount" to me.

3. Bellatrix, once she is married, is a Lestrange, not a Black. Harry does not inherit her vault, nor is its size indicative of the size of the Black family wealth.

4. Harry is never referred to as the richest wizard in Britain, nor indeed is he even hinted to be even near the top. He's comfortably wealthy but again, not super rich. Indeed, in PoA it's noted that if he bought a Firebolt, it would mean that he'd struggle to pay for the remaining years of Hogwarts. This is probably an exaggeration but at the very least it shows that he's not rich enough to buy a Firebolt lightly.

Honestly, I would put Harry's wealth at maybe around 5000 galleons before the Black inheritance, and perhaps around 8000 galleons afterwards.

Recall that 1000 galleons was sufficient to start a business, including renting some prime real estate. Prices are different in the magical world - money goes a lot further (which makes sense, as so many basic needs can be supplied by magic). Which in turn makes the "comparison to Muggle wealth levels" analysis quite weak, I think -- even if you were going by the premise that Harry was the richest wizard in Britain.

To make some general points about the magical economy:

One must be careful in assuming that you can translate prices between wizarding and Muggle worlds using the official exchange rate, because purchasing power of currency can be different -- not to mention the host of other economic differences.

Some of those economic differences:

- The wizarding economy is small in absolute terms due to the low population.

- The wizarding economy does not have a banking sector in the sense of banks which create money as Muggle banks do, nor a central bank which prints money. It's true that you can get loans (see: Bagman) but given the nature of wizarding banking as essentially deposit boxes, it is likely that these loans do not expand the money supply because they probably are a literal transfer of cash rather than the crediting of an account with money that did not exist before (as in the Muggle world). It seems that the only way money is created is by the discovery of treasure (and, I suppose, mining). The money supply is therefore extremely stable, meaning there will not be a trend of inflation as in the Muggle world.

- The wizarding economy appears to still be on the gold standard.

- The wizarding economy does not have mass production and is not inclined towards it, given that you cannot automate the enchantment of objects. Innovation is common, but tends to stay on the scale of an individual craftsperson rather than becoming standardised (with a couple of notable exceptions, namely brooms and beauty products).

All these add up to a very stable economy with almost zero inflation and low growth, and a moderately fixed money supply, as well as no "wealth creators" of the kind who in the Muggle world create billions worth of economic value where before there was nothing.

In short, the wizarding economy does not have the capacity for billionaires - the money supply is simply too small. I doubt there's even a billion galleons in circulation. What extremely wealthy individuals it does possess will likely have their wealth tied up in illiquid assets like land. This fits with what we know of the Malfoy family, whose wealth derives from the gift of land given to them by William the Conqueror.

On the other hand, wizards can use magic to satisfy many of their basic needs for themselves. They have no gas or electric bills, no internet or phone bills, potentially no water bills. Because the population size is stable, many of them will inherit homes so they would have no rent or need to buy a house.

In short, the main expense on necessities for most wizards would be food and clothing, and rent for those who do not have a multi-generational home. Most everything else is a relative luxury. That means the majority of their wages will constitute disposable income. This allows wages to be quite low, relative to the Muggle world, while still allowing wizards a high standard of living. It also allows prices for most products to be quite high relative to incomes, because they are luxury goods rather than common necessities.
