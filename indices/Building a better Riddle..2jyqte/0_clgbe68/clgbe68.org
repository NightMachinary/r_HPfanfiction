I got the impression - and my memory of Book 2 is a bit hazy, so don't treat it as gospel - that the diary was "pre-programmed" by Voldemort to seduce/control a student into opening the Chamber and terrorizing the school. Though it does have a piece of Voldemort's soul in it, it's not /sentient/ the way Voldemort (at that time, nothing more than a spirit) is.

You do bring up an interesting point, though. Presumably Voldemort wouldn't want a piece of himself, having sapped the life from someone, running around with its own agency, so just what was diary-Riddle's endgame if Harry had never come along? Would he go into some kind of sleep mode or something?
