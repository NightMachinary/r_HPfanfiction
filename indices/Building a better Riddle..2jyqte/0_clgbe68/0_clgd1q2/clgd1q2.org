I agree with you that he was pre-programmed into opening the Chamber and terrorizing the school. But his whole plan changed, "months ago" according to the piece of Voldemort's soul. He had a new target: Harry Potter.

I always thought that his whole reason for the theatrics was to figure out what happened. As a piece of Voldemort's soul, it acts in a way that Voldemort's inner most person would act. In Voldemort's case, all he wants is to obtain immortality and invincibility. In order to do that, he can't just gulp down Ginny's soul and come back to life. He had to figure out how this stupid kid was able to defeat him. He had to understand how his track to immortality was sidetracked by a baby.

Then, after that he wants to kill Harry. As for why he called on the basilisk, perhaps because that was the only weapon at his disposal for killing Harry that he had. He could've come back to life to kill Harry himself, but maybe he did not want to risk coming back to life until the person that ended his first reign was killed. So, with really no other weapons to turn to than the basilisk he was originally designed to use to kill muggles, he tried to use it to kill Harry. One of Voldemort's major flaws through the books is his arrogance. Even if he knew basilisk venom could destroy a horcrux, he did not comprehend a situation where Harry kills the basilisk.

Assuming he had killed Harry, I believe he would've acted like a horcrux was designed to act, killed Ginny, and assumed life. As for what his endgame was if Harry had never come along, I have no idea. I believe all his actions were made in an attempt to lure Harry into the Chamber. Perhaps he would've just kept Ginny alive until Harry made it down there, or eventually he would have simply pursued Harry with the basilisk.

Voldemort's actions throughout the series defied logic in many instances. Some may see this as unrealistic writing. I like to think of it as Voldemort's blind desire for power and immortality led him to overlook details that he could not burden himself to notice. We know he wasn't an idiot: prefect, head boy, one of the most powerful wizards of all time. The only explanation for his mistakes is that so many of the qualities he lacked (the ability to love, empathy, friendship, etc...) led to holes in his ability to foresee the actions of others.
