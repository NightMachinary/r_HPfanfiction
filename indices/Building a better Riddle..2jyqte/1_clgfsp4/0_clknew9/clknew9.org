You're assuming that even if your "splitting theory" is correct (and this has never been how I saw horcruxes), the "master soul" doesn't have some qualitative difference that gives it dominance over horcruxes, regardless of quantity of soul possessed.

You also forget that Tom Riddle in the Diary is 16 years old and therefore not quite in a position to start any war. He's an extraordinarily talented 16 year old, sure, but Dumbledore would slap him around like a wet fish.
