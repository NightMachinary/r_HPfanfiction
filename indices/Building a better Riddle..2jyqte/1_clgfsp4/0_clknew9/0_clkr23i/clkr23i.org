  You're assuming that even if your "splitting theory" is correct (and this has never been how I saw horcruxes), the "master soul" doesn't have some qualitative difference that gives it dominance over horcruxes, regardless of quantity of soul possessed.

That is true. The splitting, though, needs to either be relatively small "shards" or something close to this pattern, though. It can't be split evenly /over all horcruxes/ every time the ritual is done. That doesn't make sense.

This relates to there being a master soul, or rather the lack of evidence for such a thing. In canon, Voldemort has absolutely no knowledge of what is happening to his soul fragments. Nor does he show any sort of ability to control or recognize them even when in their presence.

In fact, there is no evidence that there is a special "feel" to horcruxes at all -- one good excuse for no one knowing there was something wrong with Harry's scar.

The diary, diadem, and cup weren't said to feel odd and it is only the locket that attempts to corrupt people in that specific way in canon (something clearly ripped off from Lord of the Rings). The ring was boobytrapped, which is why Dumbledore's hand rotted. That wasn't a horcrux property. If there was something odd about horcruxes, it was a slow burn type of magic. Something as subtle as the locket's corruption effects. Certainly not something Voldemort ever tried to use actively.

  You also forget that Tom Riddle in the Diary is 16 years old and therefore not quite in a position to start any war. He's an extraordinarily talented 16 year old, sure, but Dumbledore would slap him around like a wet fish.

Just like he did the first time around in canon...?

Diary Tom was already inserted into Hogwarts by Malfoy the Elder. His network is in the same shape or better than at the end of GoF when Voldemort picked it up again. Nothing is preventing 16-year-old Tom from using Lucius to do something similar. If he already knows the basics of the Dark Mark (likely) or can figure it out, it doesn't matter what his form is (as was demonstrated by GoF's end). They will serve him.
