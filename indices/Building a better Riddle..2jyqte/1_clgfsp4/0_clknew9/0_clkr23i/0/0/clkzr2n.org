There is also the "soul regrows" scenario and the "soul shatters the first time and random bits fall into horcrux" scenario, and quite a few more that I didn't mention. But the ones I did mention, actually have positive support in canon.

Dumbledore seems to think that Voldemort has lost something through making horcruxes, and that making more than one (other than possibly Harry) is so absurdly insane that it doesn't seem to be accepted by him until after GoF.

As for personal /magical/ power (which canon doesn't support very strongly as even existing), Voldemort has never counted on personally defeating Dumbledore as part of his plans. Anything he would do after a diary resurrection would follow the same lines.

A successful Voldemort plan has Dumbledore out of Hogwarts, out of political power, and only able to circle the wagons around a few blood traitors as the rest of the magical world falls under Death Eater control. Tom doesn't /have/ to try and defeat someone he suspects of possessing the Death Stick in a straight-up duel. Which is good, as the Elder Wand's single ability is being unbeatable in a straight-up fight when possessed by the true owner.
