I feel like almost everything in your post contradicts canon. We have a Daily Prophet article in DH that has eyewitness statements to the effect that Dumbledore's duel with Grindelwald was the most spectacular magical fight in history. We have Dumbledore's notes to Tales of Beedle the Bard explaining that of course "Death" does not exist and the Hallows are simply powerful magical artefacts created by wizards. We have Dumbledore creating the Order of the Phoenix, an illegal vigilante group which works against the Ministry when necessary in order to combat Voldemort.
