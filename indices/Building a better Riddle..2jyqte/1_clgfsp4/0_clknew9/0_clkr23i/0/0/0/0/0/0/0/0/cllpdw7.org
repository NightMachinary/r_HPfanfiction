  I think you're getting the obituary confused with Rita Skeeter's book.
#+end_quote

You could be right. I've read that awful book only once, so details may escape me. But though that makes sense, but isn't more reliable.

In fact, that Rita would bring it up that way suggests there is a nugget of truth in it, as all of her stories were based on twisted facts. There is also the established canon fact that Grindelwald survived the "duel" relatively unharmed and was simply arrested after.

  Perhaps you are forgetting the fact that both Mad-Eye Moody and Dumbledore saw through Harry's invisibility cloak, demonstrating its fallibility.
#+end_quote

That isn't clear. Moody's eye could have seen any number of things, from Harry's shoes to the heat of his footprints on the floor around him to the air moving from his breathing. Dumbledore never said he could see Harry, only hinting that he had ways.

  the Resurrection stone only brings back the shades of the dead, not true resurrection, and the Elder wand's owners are continually defeated.
#+end_quote

But those are the weaknesses consistent with the folk tales. The cloak didn't have a weakness in the story. And the wand owner is never "defeated" in the tales, but attacked in their sleep or otherwise ambushed.

I don't see any evidence for a rewriting or weakening of the Deathly Hallows simply because they fit the original story and have weaknesses. That is consistent with them having the powers from the story, not the other way around.

  Except for that time in OotP when Dumbledore "shot" two "policemen", two civil servants and the Minister for Magic. And that other time in HBP when Dumbledore cursed Dawlish again.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore stunned one known Death Eater in self defense, and then did the same to his own man Kingsley, with a spell less severe than school children regularly used against each other.

He could have Mind Charmed the Toad and the Death Eater (as Kingsley apparently already had a schoolgirl) and no one would have known. Hell, he could have killed both of them and made the bodies disappear. No one could have proved anything and his foes would be gone.

In HBP, it was again a known Death Eater he hit in self defense. Hardly the bandana-wearing revolutionary.
