  Very trustworthy. I wonder if it was Gilderoy's parents reporting to Skeeter's mom in that story. As related, in a book after Dumbledore's death, by Rita.

I think you're getting the obituary confused with Rita Skeeter's book. It was Rita Skeeter's book which suggested your idea that the duel never happened, the Daily Prophet obituary - not written by Skeeter - that stated the accepted fact that Dumbledore and Grindelwald's duel was spectacular.

  Right. But what do they do? The cloak and stone seem to work at least as well as in the story. Why wouldn't the wand?

Perhaps you are forgetting the fact that both Mad-Eye Moody and Dumbledore saw through Harry's invisibility cloak, demonstrating its fallibility. Each of the Hallows is demonstrated to be fallible in this way. The cloak can be bypassed with magical detection, the Resurrection stone only brings back the shades of the dead, not true resurrection, and the Elder wand's owners are continually defeated.

  They never shot a policeman, in effect.

Except for that time in OotP when Dumbledore "shot" two "policemen", two civil servants and the Minister for Magic. And that other time in HBP when Dumbledore cursed Dawlish again.
