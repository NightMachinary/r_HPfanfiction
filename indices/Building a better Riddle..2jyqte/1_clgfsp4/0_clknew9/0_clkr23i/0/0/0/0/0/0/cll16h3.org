  We have a Daily Prophet article in DH that has eyewitness statements to the effect that Dumbledore's duel with Grindelwald was the most spectacular magical fight in history.

Very trustworthy. I wonder if it was Gilderoy's parents reporting to Skeeter's mom in that story. As related, in a book after Dumbledore's death, /by Rita/.

That also doesn't say /what actually happened/. The Deedle the Bard tale was just a tale, but the way the wand was passed along /in canon events/ fits. Except for that duel.

Right. But what do they do? The cloak and stone /seem/ to work at least as well as in the story. Why wouldn't the wand?

If Dumbledore beat the Death Stick in a straight-up fight, that seems very significant, but he never comments on that. He also never says /how/ he did it. You'd think the techniques he used would be very well studied and widely known, if there was a good series of witnesses to the fight. But we don't get that, just vague reports.

  We have Dumbledore creating the Order of the Phoenix, an illegal vigilante group which works against the Ministry when necessary in order to combat Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Which were almost entirely passive, except for watching a room that should have been guarded better anyway. They never shot a policeman, in effect. It isn't even clear that their group was illegal, until Voldemort took the Ministry. /After Dumbledore died/.
