It seems clear that Dumbledore didn't beat Grindelwald in a duel, or that Grindelwald gave up instead of being physically and magically defeated. The wand isn't merely "powerful", it was made by Death (whatever that means) to be undefeatable in a duel. It was only lost by true owners through deceit and trickery in non-combat situation, in folk tales and in canon.

My bet is, Dumbledore poisoned Grindelwald, tricked him into dropping the wand somehow, or emotionally berated him into making a serious non-magical tactical mistake.

If he said something like, "let's put down the wands and settle this like men," while taking off his shirt, I wouldn't be surprised.

  Any attempted coup before such time would undoubtedly had Dumbledore rushing to the Ministry's aid, and thus a duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore (or, if Voldemort wasn't there, then Dumbledore mopping up the Death Eaters single handedly).

If Dumbledore had lost political power earlier, this wouldn't have been the case. He never tried to storm the Ministry and replace the current government after Fudge's stooge tried to kill Harry, and then Fudge himself tried to magically castrate him, after all. Dumbledore worked within the system.

If he isn't part of the system, he doesn't seem like the sort of person to go /directly/ against established social constructs to do what he feels is right. That was his whole deal with his ex-boyfriend, after all. He clearly thinks those with personal power shouldn't just dictate to the people what is right.

I don't see Dumbledore as a private citizen attacking aurors in the Ministry like some magical Che Guevara after Death Eaters elect a pawn, even one mind-controlled. That would have been the endgame after removing Dumbledore from political office, and was what Diary Tom was attempting at Hogwarts. The other option was what he tried with Harry at the end of OotP, making Dumbledore lose or choose to sacrifice people one by one until he made a mistake. I don't think one-on-one was ever in the cards.

Dumbledore was, after all, the only person Voldemort ever feared. And Voldemort doesn't face his fears, he /flees/ from them.
