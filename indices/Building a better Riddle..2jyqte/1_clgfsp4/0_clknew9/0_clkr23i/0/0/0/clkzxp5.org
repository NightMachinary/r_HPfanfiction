You have no idea how ironic it is that you're trying to convince me that magical power doesn't exist XD I've spent 7 years and tens of thousands of words arguing exactly that point.

Regardless, Dumbledore is way out of 16-year-old Tom Riddle's league merely as a result of skill. You don't need any concept of power. Tom Riddle is still two or three years away from being able to hold his own against Dumbledore at this point, I reckon.

All of the above horcrux mechanics involve losing something by making horcruxes. The "half every time" approach just seems so unbelievably literal and mathematical that it feels completely at odds with the fairy tale nature of HP magic.

I disagree with about the Elder wand. Firstly, it's fallible, since Dumbledore beat Grindelwald while he had it. Secondly, given that Dumbledore beat Grindelwald while Grindelwald had the wand, and given that Dumbledore was only "a shade more skillful" than Grindelwald, it would seem that the Elder wand did not give Grindelwald much of a boost at all. The only way I can see to explain this is that the Elder wand modifies your spells to the level at which wizards like Dumbledore are already casting. So the more skilled you are, the greater the diminishing returns on Elder wand utility.

Finally, I do think that Voldemort's plan requires Dumbledore dead. There's a reason he didn't enact his Ministry coup until after Dumbledore was dead. Any attempted coup before such time would undoubtedly had Dumbledore rushing to the Ministry's aid, and thus a duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore (or, if Voldemort wasn't there, then Dumbledore mopping up the Death Eaters single handedly).
