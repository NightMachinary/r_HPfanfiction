There is actually very good evidence regarding there being a master soul. This is that the horcruxes don't anchor the soul fragments of other horcruxes to life. The only piece of soul anchored to life by horcruxes is the "master soul". If there was no difference between the pieces of soul in horcruxes and the "master soul", then you couldn't destroy a horcrux so long as another horcrux existed.

Indeed, if horcruxes and the piece of soul walking and talking were equivalent, then the "live" soul would act as a horcrux for the horcrux-soul, and the only way to ever kill the wizard would be to destroy all the soul pieces simultaneously.

You also miss a few possibilities regarding soul quantities. You posit two possibilities: horcruxes having tiny slivers of soul, or halving each time. You reject any kind of active redistribution of soul between horcruxes each time they're made, as do I.

But here's another possibility: a soul is infinite (compare: the natural numbers). You can split it but each part is also infinite (compare: into odd and even numbers).

And here's another possibility: the soul is quantifiable, but Voldemort planned in advanced for how many horcruxes he would make, and the wizard making the horcrux is able to determine how much soul goes into each, and therefore each horcrux is of equal soul quantity (until he accidentally makes one too many, unless he also planned redundancy).

I'm quite a fan of the infinite soul approach, but also like the "tiny slivers" approach.

  Diary Tom was already inserted into Hogwarts by Malfoy the Elder. His network is in the same shape or better than at the end of GoF when Voldemort picked it up again. Nothing is preventing 16-year-old Tom from using Lucius to do something similar. If he already knows the basics of the Dark Mark (likely) or can figure it out, it doesn't matter what his form is (as was demonstrated by GoF's end). They will serve him.

I wasn't making a point about 16-year-old Tom Riddle's ability to command the Death Eaters, which I consider more of a vanity project than anything else. We saw how useful the Death Eaters are without Voldemort at the end of the First War, when their entire organisation collapsed within days.

No, I was referring to Tom Riddle's personal power -- his ability to beat people in duels. At 16, he can't hope to beat Dumbledore in a duel. 16-year-old Riddle never duelled Dumbledore in canon, as he was a student, so I'm not sure what you're getting at there.
