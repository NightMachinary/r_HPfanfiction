I don't want a discussion of manipulative!Dumbledore. What I'm saying is that claiming that Dumbledore has any control over events in the GoF necessarily implies manipulative!Dumbledore.

If you take canon at face value - which we both do - I think it is clearly implied that Dumbledore has no control over events in either GoF or CoS. Given that, I don't understand your original claim that CoS is the only plot where "Dumbledore didn't have even a hint of how to solve".

Yes, in GoF Dumbledore knows that Harry is stuck in a dangerous Tournament. In the exact same way, in CoS Dumbledore knows that the "Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again" and a monster is petrifying people. In neither case does Dumbledore know how to use that knowledge to solve the plot. In neither case does that information appear to help Dumbledore do anything.

    Voldemort's basic goal in the GoF plot is to be resurrected using Harry's blood. Why?... Without those answers, this doesn't seem to be a failure on Dumbledore's part.

There are two ways of looking at this. Either Dumbledore knew this was the plan, and he failed to prevent it (which we both agree that canon doesn't suggest). Or Dumbledore didn't know that this was Voldemort's plan, in which case Dumbledore didn't know what Voldemort's real plan was, anymore than in CoS Dumbledore didn't know that the real risk was not the basilisk killing students but diary-Riddle's resurrection.

My point from the beginning is that if you accept canon, there's no reason to think that CoS is special. Dumbledore doesn't know what's going on in CoS, but he also doesn't know what's going on in GoF. In both cases he has some vague understanding of a plot, but doesn't know the real threat the plot poses and doesn't know how to prevent the bit of the plot that is obvious. He can't stop the basilisk and he can't protect Harry, and in both cases the real problem is something he appeared to be entirely unaware of beforehand.

  Dumbledore clearly hadn't returned yet, as Lockhart had claimed he knew the entrance and was trying to escape

At break-time, when Harry and Ron learn that Ginny is taken and the teachers get rid of Lockhart, Dumbledore hasn't returned. Many hours later, at sunset, when Harry and Ron go to Lockhart and then down to the Chamber, there is no reason for Dumbledore to have not returned. Lockhart is fleeing, but that is the obvious implication of the break-time meeting. There is no reason for Lockhart to know whether Dumbledore has returned or not and nothing Lockhart says implies either way.

Dumbledore could have returned anytime between the break-room meeting (which we assume is sometime around noon, but frankly could have been a break well before lunch - the latest time we have before the meeting is "mid-morning") and when Harry and Ron see him (which is presumably sometime around 11pm). But everything that Dumbledore says implies that once Ginny went missing he was promptly alerted and returned quickly, suggesting that he was back at Hogwarts in the early afternoon. Even if JK thought sunset in May was at 7pm, there is no reason to think that Dumbledore wasn't back well beforehand.

When Harry and Ron come back, Fawkes guides them to McGonagall's office. The Weasleys are not sitting around Dumbledore's office, there is no reason to believe that people were sitting around Dumbledore's office to see the Hat being taken. And there is no textual implication that Dumbledore had just arrived at that point.

Indeed, when Harry and Ron see him, Dumbledore already knows what is going on as far as anyone does and suggestively more. He is "beaming" but not shocked by Harry and Ron's appearance (perhaps Dumbledore did see Fawkes flash out, we have no knowledge either way, he just seems unsurprised compared to everyone else). Dumbledore immediately understands from Harry's story that Ginny was ensorcelled by Riddle while everyone else is stunned. He has already taken command, he knows that Pomfrey is still awake, knows that the mandrake juice is being given out.

So, no, I think that, if anything, the text suggests that Dumbledore had been at Hogwarts for quite a while before Harry and Ron returned and very likely from before they went down in the first place.

EDIT: For what it's worth, I also don't think the Weasleys just arrived. Their daughter went missing before noon and they only arrive after sunset? Regardless of whether that's 7pm or 10pm, that doesn't make any sense. Presumably McGonagall flooed them, they immediately came through and they've probably been worrying in McGonagall's office the whole afternoon. Certainly there is nothing in the text suggesting otherwise.
