  In CoS Dumbledore is unable to stop the petrifactions, unable to stop Malfoy from forcing him to leave, and unable to prevent diary-Riddle's resurrection.
#+end_quote

He didn't know why they were occurring. He didn't know about Voldemort /at all/, let alone the Diary Horcrux. That is all I'm trying to say. In GoF, he knew someone put Harry's name in the goblet, which is far, far more than he knew in CoS.

  To assume that Dumbledore "can solve" these problems but chooses not to is to assume some massive duplicity.
#+end_quote

That's not a logical assumption to make. You clearly want a discussion about ManipulativeDumbledore that I'm simply not interested in.

  Voldemort's basic goal in the GoF plot is to be resurrected using Harry's blood.
#+end_quote

Why? Says who? To what end? Why /that way/? Without those answers, this doesn't seem to be a failure on Dumbledore's part. With Harry forced into the tournament instead of, say, /not/ being in repeated danger, his death was clearly something Voldemort was prepared to deal with. Dumbledore wasn't incorrect about that part of the plot, or that there was a plotter at all who surely worked for Voldemort in one way or another.

But I do. That's what I said.

  McGonagall knows that Ginny was taken into the Chamber before Harry and Ron find out. Harry and Ron actually sit around in the Griffendor common room from mid-morning (when Ginny is taken) to sunset, before going to the Chamber. There is no reason to believe that Dumbledore is not on site by that time.
#+end_quote

This timeline is confused. Harry and Ron find out literally the second the rest of the teachers do, right around lunch. That is when the attack happened.

Lockhart was still packing to run when Harry and Ron cornered him -- at, as you say, sunset. I don't hold anything more for that, as JKR repeatedly shows she sucks at time and calendar issues. That she'd nail this one seems...unlikely.

Dumbledore clearly hadn't returned yet, as Lockhart had claimed he knew the entrance and was trying to escape before he was supposed to go after the monsters that night. A suggestion McGonagall used to get him out of the way, but one he still took as a serious threat. He'd have been up in Dumbledore's office or gone already.

Because when Harry got back, there were people in Dumbledore's office, where Fawkes and the Hat were kept. Surely they would have noticed Fawkes grabbing the Hat and flaming out if they'd been there. Dumbledore and the Weasleys had clearly had just recently arrived, and were still with McGonagall discussing what had happened.

What you're suggesting is that Dumbledore got back to Hogwarts before Harry and Ron went to see Lockhart, but the Headmaster then delayed talking to the Weasleys until /after/ he sent Fawkes to Harry. That is certainly possible, but seems to go against everything canon says about the situation. A great jumping off point for an Evil or Gray Dumbledore fic, but not a clear view of canon events.
