  the CoS plot was the only one that Dumbledore didn't have even a hint of how to solve.

  Can solve doesn't mean does solve. Of course Dumbledore know about the GoF plot, at least it's basic goals

Look, we either take canon at face value or we don't. If we take canon at face value, then Dumbledore didn't know how to solve the CoS plot, but he also doesn't know how to solve the GoF plot - and Dumbledore doesn't even know the basic goal of the GoF plot.

In GoF Dumbledore is unable to remove Harry from the Tournament, he is unable to stop Harry from being abducted, he is unable to prevent Voldemort's resurrection. In CoS Dumbledore is unable to stop the petrifactions, unable to stop Malfoy from forcing him to leave, and unable to prevent diary-Riddle's resurrection. The only difference is that in CoS Harry manages to do what Dumbledore could not, and in GoF the best Harry can do is manage to escape with his life.

To assume that Dumbledore "can solve" these problems but chooses not to is to assume some massive duplicity. The idea that Harry was somehow safe from harm because Dumbledore was watching him so closely has no canon evidence. Never does Dumbledore or any character appear to believe that Harry will be safe from actual harm in the Tournament. It is explicitly stated that teachers cannot interfere in the tournament. (EDIT: If anything, in the third task Harry is actually held and bit by an acromantula and the text pretty clearly states that it is only luck and Cedric's help that he manages to not die. If Dumbledore was ever going to intervene, he would have. done so then. In the second task, Dumbledore has to talk to the mermen before he even appears to know what was happening underwater. There really is no evidence that Dumbledore was secretly protecting Harry from actual harm in the Tournament.)

Voldemort's basic goal in the GoF plot is to be resurrected using Harry's blood. He is successful in that goal. There is no indication, even the subtlest implication, that Dumbledore thought that was the goal of entering Harry into the Tournament. Everyone either does not know why Harry was entered or assumes it is some sort of assassination attempt. Even if Dumbledore was protecting Harry from true harm in Gof (without that ever being indicated in the text), he still hasn't a hint of how to prevent the real goal of Voldemort's resurrection and indeed doesn't even appear to know that that is a goal.

--------------

If we don't take canon at face value, there is no reason to think that Dumbledore doesn't have complete control of the situation in CoS. McGonagall knows that Ginny was taken into the Chamber before Harry and Ron find out. Harry and Ron actually sit around in the Griffendor common room from mid-morning (when Ginny is taken) to sunset, before going to the Chamber. There is no reason to believe that Dumbledore is not on site by that time.

  In fact, it is strongly suggested that Dumbledore wasn't even in the castle when Fawkes acted.
#+end_quote

No it isn't. Actually, the opposite is true. Harry and Ron visit Hermoine in the "mid-morning" skivvying History and learn that the monster is a basilisk. Then they are waiting for "break" (lunch?) in the staff room to tell McGonagall when they learn Ginny has been taken. They don't go down to the Chamber until sunset. This is at the end of May in Scotland, so sunset is quite late (8pm? EDIT: Actually, 9:30pm). When they go down, they don't look for any professor apart from Lockhart. When they come back up, Dumbledore is already there, composed and surprisingly knowledgeable.

Once Ginny was taken, McGonagall immediately decided to send the students home the next day, so the Governors were presumably told in quick order, near noon. Dumbledore is sent a "hailstorm of owls" by the governors as soon as they learn Ginny has been taken demanding that he come back "at once". So there is no reason to think that when Harry and Ron actually go down to the Chamber Dumbledore isn't already back at Hogwarts. If anything, the text suggests that he is.
