That's one theory I've heard a lot. But it still doesn't make sense. Why not do the same thing in the lake. Or at literally any other time.

Mysterious death of savior doesn't equal Voldemort's back.

Having Moodly disappear at the same time would actually be /better/ and more convincing as a Death Eater plot. As we see, Harry being dead along with Cedric would have been even /more/ suspicious.
