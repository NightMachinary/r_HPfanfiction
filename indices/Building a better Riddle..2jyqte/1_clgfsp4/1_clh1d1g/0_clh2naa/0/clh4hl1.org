  Why couldn't Crouch Jr. just stun and carry Harry outside of Hogwarts, and then move him anywhere, using any method?

I assume because Voldie didn't intend for his resurrection to be known, and so having Crouch kidnap Harry would have brought up questions. With the portkey plot, Voldie could kill Harry and send his body back and have it appear that Harry merely died from something in the maze.
