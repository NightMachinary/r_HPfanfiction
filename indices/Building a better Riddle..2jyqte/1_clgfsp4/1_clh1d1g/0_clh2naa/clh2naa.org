  I don't see how you can possibly say that. The crazy canon plot in GoF succeeded afterall, so you'd have to assume some massive convoluted duplicity to believe that Dumbledore knew how to solve it and let that outcome happen.

This is not very coherent. /Can/ solve doesn't mean /does/ solve.

Of course Dumbledore know about the GoF plot, at least it's basic goals. It was clear someone was trying to kill Harry by entering him in the tournament. The way for Dumbledore to prevent that plot from working was to keep Harry as safe as he could, given the rules of the contest.

That at the end Voldemort also had it all wrapped up in some obscure resurrection thing to get around Harry's mother's protections was secondary, as he wanted to kill Harry too. Just in a weird, convoluted way.

Why would it matter if he defeated Harry's mother's protections so he could touch Harry if he planned on killing him in a "duel" the next minute? Would he have canceled the resurrection ritual if only Cedric had come over the portkey? Hell no. He'd have used his blood and gone without. That is why he was a "spare". But overall, it just doesn't make much sense.

As for the contests and how dangerous they were, it seems clear the contents of them were worked out ahead of time. And also that Harry was never in any real danger. Sure, dragons are very dangerous, and that was where his protections seem weakest. But remember that the movie version of that scene wasn't in the books. And Dumbledore was there with his wand watching the whole time. Harry's single injury wasn't even the most severe he'd ever had on a broom.

The lake was a joke and the maze was not instantly lethal at any point to someone with a wand. In fact, Dumbledore might have thought that Moody was sneaking around to /protect/ Harry, instead of messing with the other competitors. That would have kept Harry from being kill by giant spiders or such.

In the end, the portkey plot wouldn't have worked at all, except that Dumbledore had let /that specific/ portkey function inside Hogwarts grounds. That part of Voldemort's plot was really the oddest, and isn't ever explained in the books. Why couldn't Crouch Jr. just stun and /carry/ Harry outside of Hogwarts, and then move him anywhere, using any method?

Now I'm not saying Dumbledore /helped/ Voldemort's plot in GoF, only that he at least knew that there was a plot and what form it took.

That wasn't what I was saying at all. I'm not sure why this comes up every time with Dumbledore.

Of course Dumbledore didn't directly help Harry in the CoS. Sure, Fawkes gave him the tools he needed, but Dumbledore still didn't know the whole story until Harry explained. Dumbledore said Harry's devotion to the Headmaster was what drew Fawkes to him in the Chamber. This doesn't make Dumbledore a great manipulator or something.

In fact, it is strongly suggested that Dumbledore wasn't even in the castle when Fawkes acted. The Headmaster wasn't called back until they discovered that Ginny was missing and presumed killed. And even then, the governors had to write letters, travel time, etc. Fawkes acting alone based on some emotional connection to Harry is the only thing ever suggested in canon.

I'm not sure what the rest of that meant, but I hope that answered any issues you might have had with my take on canon events.
