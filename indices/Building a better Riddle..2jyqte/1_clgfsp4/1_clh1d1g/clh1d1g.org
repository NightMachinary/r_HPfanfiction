  the CoS plot was the only one that Dumbledore didn't have even a hint of how to solve

I don't see how you can possibly say that. The crazy canon plot in GoF succeeded afterall, so you'd have to assume some massive convoluted duplicity to believe that Dumbledore knew how to solve it and let that outcome happen.

And if you're going to assume massive convoluted duplicity, the oh-so-convenient appearance of Fawkes flashing into the Chamber - a bird that can carry Dumbledore - would seem better evidence of it. Afterall - let's be honest - Harry didn't kill the basilisk and diary-Riddle, Fawkes did. Fawkes blinded the snake, gave Harry the sword, cured Harry when he screwed up the job Fawkes gave him, figured out that the physical diary was Tom's weakpoint, gave it to Harry, and then carried everyone out. Harry was Fawke's sidekick.
