Canon Tom Riddle's Diary had a simple plan. To drive Dumbledore out of Hogwarts, then to get it closed down while he resurrected in the CoS by killing Ginny. It was hours away from working, too, and all without Dumbledore even knowing. With the school empty, he could have escaped riding his pet monster and no one would have been the wiser. Toss Ginny's body out of the CoS (or even intentionally reveal it by leaving it wide open) and various gambits could be run. It was a great play, /especially/ compared to the brain-dead GoF "plot".

I think that babymort wasn't running on all cylinders.

Based on the splitting theory of Horcruxes (1st Horcrux: 1/2 of his soul goes into it; 2nd: 1/2 of 1/2, or 1/4; etc) the Diary was basically stronger than the shade that was at that moment zipping around Albania. If it had come back, it /would have been/ Tom Riddle more than anyone or anything else. And the Voldemort shade would have had a fight on his hands. One it would have lost /bad/.

Regardless, this was Tom Riddle unmaimed by years living as a shade or crazy baby thing, and not killed once already or snakified by a weird resurrection ritual. He was old-school Voldemort and he had the only plot that Dumbledore wasn't ready for in the entire series. It would have been the 1950-60s all over again for him, except this time he had a Death Eaters network all ready to go.

Remember, the CoS plot was the only one that Dumbledore didn't have even a /hint/ of how to solve. Ginny would have died and Tom Riddle would have lived again if not for really random Harry Potter decisions, ones not directly influenced by Dumbledore for once. It was a great plan, and I don't think adult Voldemort had really expected it.

I think the Diary /itself/ told Lucius what to do. That's why he thought it would take over Ginny and make her just do some Dark magic on some Muggle-born or something, embarrassing her father and ruining the Muggle Protection act legislation (that last part is pure canon, btw). I don't think Lucius would have intentionally tried to bring back Voldemort. He certainly hadn't tried it up to that point, a subject Voldemort (the shade resurrected) made very pointedly to several people.
