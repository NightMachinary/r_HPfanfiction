Easiest explanation is that Voldemort didn't know the Horcrux could /come to life/ by being imbued with life force (from Ginny).

To me, the diary goes against the ethos of a Horcrux, where the active, main Voldemort /can't die/ because part of his soul is protected, thus the piece of soul residing within him is bound to earth in wraith-like state if his body is destroyed.
