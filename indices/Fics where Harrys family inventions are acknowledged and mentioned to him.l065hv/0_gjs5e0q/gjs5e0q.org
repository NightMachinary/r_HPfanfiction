One of the few I can think of is Harry Potter, Unexpected Animagus by DWDUCK where he is told about a very successful company that his grandmother started called Dorea's Closet the Wizarding Worlds number one adult product company.

Yule Ball Drama by FurySerenity (Vance McGill) mentions how harry's grandfather (fleamont) created Sleakeasy potion.

Be aware these are only minor parts of the story. I don't recall any story that I have read that spent that much time on the accomplishments of his ancestors.

The one story that spends the most time is a time travel story where Harry discovers that his ancestors were expert in warding and played "Robin Hood". The story is called Faery Heroes by Silently Watches
