Yeah, my sense of things (from lurking there for years) is that they're now rather hostile to the "Dark Harry for Dark Harry's sake" stories, preferring even stories with canon pairings that are done well over ones aligning with their namesake that aren't.

They even have a skin that puts up a classy "DLP Project" (Darklord Potter Literary Project) instead of "Dark Lord Potter," further testament to their coming of age as a community.
