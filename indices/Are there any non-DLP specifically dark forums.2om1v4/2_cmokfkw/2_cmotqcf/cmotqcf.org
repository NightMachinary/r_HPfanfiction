[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/page-160#post-15853244][Spacebattles]] maintains an active thread on Potter-specific fanfiction.

I didn't recommend it at first as they're more fanboy-ish than DLP on the balance of male/female commentary. Also a bit prudish about what they allow in discussions (ex.: linking to fics with smut will get you banned)
