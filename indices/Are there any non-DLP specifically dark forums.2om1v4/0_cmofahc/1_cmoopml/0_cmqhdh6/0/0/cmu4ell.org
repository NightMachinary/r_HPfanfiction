Your real life includes spontaneous sex? And I'm using harem to mean 'Harry hooks up with a long string of girls'. Not sure if that's the technical definition that is being generally accepted. Even if the most explicit thing mentioned is 'crotchless cat-suit', it's still rather.... Extremely off-putting. And sorry if I offended you by denying your femininity or something, it's not my intention. But I prefer my fics to stay far far away from naked women, nor do I enjoy reading about Harry blushing and stuttering around a girl, or staring at her arse or chest or writing poetry about her hair or whatever. If you say it's not male-oriented then fine, I'll retract that statement, and I'm sorry, just that personally I find it squick, that's all. I don't remember mentioning violence, now I have to go check .-.
