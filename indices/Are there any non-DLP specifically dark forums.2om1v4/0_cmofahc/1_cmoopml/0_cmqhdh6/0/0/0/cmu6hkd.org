I think it's fair to say that most people will have a few one night stands over the years, especially in their late teens. That's what I meant by spontaneous sex.

By harem I generally understand it to mean a polygamous relationship: Harry dating/having sex with multiple women simultaneously. Such fics are quite consistently [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=750364][mocked]] on DLP. This is distinguished from fics where Harry has several different romantic partners in succession. That's pretty normal - it's a rare person who ends up marrying their first sexual partner (and an even rarer one who doesn't divorce them).

Regarding heterosexuality, I wasn't making any point about whether the concept itself is masculine or feminine (for the record, I don't think concepts have gender). Rather, I was pointing out that sexual relationships between men and women (aka heterosexuality) are by far the most common form of relationship on the planet and, involving as it does a person from each sex, is not something predominately male or female. It's equally popular with both sexes.
