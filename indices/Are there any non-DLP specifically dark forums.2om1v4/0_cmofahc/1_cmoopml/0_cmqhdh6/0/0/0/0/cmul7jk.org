What I meant by spontaneous sex was the part with Luna, where there wasn't even an indication he liked her or was thinking about her like that before suddenly he was on his back on a table. And I don't think you should make the judgement of 'most people' without worldwide statistics. "Most people you know", maybe, because I don't know a single person who has burned through partners like that. And of course, in this society those 'most people' are men, because it's men who get high fived for getting as many girls as possible.

It's true that heterosexual relationships involve both a man and a woman, but I think they look at them differently and get different things out of it. That's why miscommunication is a thing. Looking at it from Harry's point of view, obviously the reader is going to get the male perspective.

I'm glad you enjoy fics like that and consider those things normal. I'm not commenting on whether or not they're normal for you. But to me, it seems like those cultural ideals are predominated by males, and honestly, I'm really tired of watching a movie or looking something up on DA and seeing naked or sexualised women. I don't need it in my fanfic too. If you think I'm mistaken, and that an equal proportion of men and women enjoy fics and images like that, then again, sorry for my mistake. I guess I just haven't been associated with the same people as you.
