I'm not quite sure how heterosexuality is a male idea... I mean, by its very nature it's about both sexes.

Re: harem fics, I can't remember a single harem fic that's been recommended by DLP, at least in the last three or four years.

As for sex and violence, yes, fics often feature sex. Sometimes that sex is spontaneous (though this is generally more for smut one shots than longer fics). In that sense the fics resemble real life.
