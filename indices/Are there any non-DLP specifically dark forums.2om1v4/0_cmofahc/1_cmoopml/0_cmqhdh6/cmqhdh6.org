Male-oriented because it's very het.... And harem-y. I was unfortunate enough to be reading one fic where Luna was just being Luna, and then all of a sudden she's kneeling over Harry's face. I was very shocked. There is no interest in romance, you're right, but there is a rather common occurrence of spontaneous sex... With random and numerous women.... It's something I never ever ever ever needed to read about in my life. It was very unfortunate.

Also, the way Harry is dark in some of their fics is very.... unsubtle. There's much more curb-stomping by Harry of both the Dark and the Light than there is Harry-corruption. And the death eaters often meet unfortunate ends. It's really just in general squick. Of course I understand that not every single fic can be like that, but I can't stomach sorting through them.
