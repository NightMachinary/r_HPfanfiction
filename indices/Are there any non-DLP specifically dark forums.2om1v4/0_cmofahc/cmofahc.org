There's nothing close to DLP in terms of scale anymore, dark oriented or otherwise. Most of the old fandom forums are dead.

For something not so male oriented, my only advice would be to look around. Honestly, 8 years ago DLP was an island of men in what seemed like an ocean of female dominated HP fandom. I've heard that Mugglenet might still have some posters (though the site itself was rather horrible), that might be something to look for.
