Well I mean, almost /any/ forum you find that revolves around HP that is still alive (barring Reddit and DLP) should be pretty much female dominated. The fandom has always been composed mostly of women, especially the fanfiction fandom.

Really, DLP isn't a bad place for women. Most of the members have grown up and aren't teenage boys anymore, and we've always had a decent amount of female members. It just tends to be a bit brasher than your ordinary fandom forum.
