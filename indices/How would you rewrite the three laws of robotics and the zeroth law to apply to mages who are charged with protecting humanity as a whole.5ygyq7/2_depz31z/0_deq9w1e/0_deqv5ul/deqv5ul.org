I've unfortunately never read Asimov, so no idea what you'Re talking about with your comparison.

But I guess they'd be more the SHIELD type of organisation, to use another fandom. Rather indifferent about the single life, but constantly working to keep humanity as a whole alive and well.

What kind of fic did you think about? Harry joining them?

You wrote you're obsessed with writing "benevolent" fascism / totalitarianism lately. Would that organisation have governmental power?

Anyway, can you tell me more? I'm always interested in some worldbuilding.
