  The biggest issue I see right now is that if you just replace robots with wizards they would assume some kind of subservient role for Muggles which might or might not be what you want?

Well the whole point of the novels about the three laws was that even if they seem fool proof the wording can be subverted and twisted so as to defy the point so I doubt mages would end up truly subservient.
