The laws of robotics were written to be enforced over subservient beings who were not believe to actually have a conscience. Applying them to humanity would require a total rewrite. Of course the fact that the laws of robotics are subverted relatively easily becomes the whole point of them existing in the first place. The entire point of the three laws is that they do not work.

A more interesting question, perhaps, would be applying something like say, The Laws of Magic from The Dresden Files to the question rather than the laws of Robotics. Although it's probably a bit more of an esoteric question.
