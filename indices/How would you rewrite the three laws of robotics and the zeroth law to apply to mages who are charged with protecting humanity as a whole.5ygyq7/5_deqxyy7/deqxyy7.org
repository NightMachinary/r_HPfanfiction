A thing I've been wondering about with the Three Laws of Robotics (brought on by reading Bryon Nightshade's work) is, if robots are built by humans, and have the ability to see, hear, touch, smell, walk around, et-cetera...

The thing is, robots will observe the world around them, and use what they observe in their decision making. But their senses and mobility were built into them by humans, precisely so they could accomplish that decision making. Doesn't that mean that 'observe the world around you and make decisions based on what you observe' counts as a human order, under the 2nd law? In that case, what if a human order conflicts with a robot's decisions? Do they follow the most recent order given to them, or their first 'order' to observe and make choices?

If you applied the same thinking to mages, with the same laws, they'd probably hit the same thing too.

"Look, buddo, if you didn't want me having a brain and making my own decisions, maybe you should have asked my mother to not have kids."

...Anyway, yeah, if you want to write new ones, maybe go with what Dorgamund said, base them off the unforgivable curses? Although I'd probably base rules more off intelligence and/or emotional capability/value than just life, swatting flies or slaughtering cows for meat isn't the same thing as killing humans or centaurs or whatnot.
