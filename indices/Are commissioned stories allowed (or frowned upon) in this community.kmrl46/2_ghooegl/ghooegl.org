Not a legal expert, but if it's a personal commission (you dm the author requesting a specific fic say based on a prompt, then they send you the fic after you pay them) absolutely nothing will come of it for either party. I'd imagine posting a fic for commission is more of a grey area, but nevertheless it's unlikely a massive publishing corporation or the author themselves would find out or care enough to dedicate resources to punishing the author.
