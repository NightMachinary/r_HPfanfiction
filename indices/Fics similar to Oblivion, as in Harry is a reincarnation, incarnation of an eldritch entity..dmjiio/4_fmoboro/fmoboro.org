Actual summary: So, the major forces of the universe are personified as entities, and the entity,, fate? I believe? Asked Death to spare Harry Potter because she has Plans for him, but the reaper in charge of that messed up and put Harry's soul into the cycle again. So Death decides 'fuck it' and lives out the life of Harry Potter. There's some really interesting takes, such as dementors being basically Harry!Deaths children, and everyone freaking out. I know one thing is that all living creatures are attracted to Death, but non human beings, like centaurs, spiders, and goblins, are able to feel it more, and are aware of what Harry Is (the fic explains it pretty well). So basically Harry is constantly getting jumped by rando animals. There's even a Malfoy peacock that can be summoned by Harry unbuttoning his shirt. Its great.

Features a pretty neutral Harry, and its SnapeXHarry. Its also overall just very sexual. Good grammar and plot though. So.
