I rather like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16821571][*/The Gloriana Set/*]] . The War is won, and Hermione Granger is back at Hogwarts as an “Eighth Year”, feeling reckless and determined to shed her prim bookworm persona. She will do as she pleases, and anyone who doesn't like it will see the business end of her wand. Also returning is Draco Malfoy, universally hated but determined to restore his family's name.

It's updated regularly and I like the characterization a lot there. But it's a love story first, so not sure if that's what you're looking for.
