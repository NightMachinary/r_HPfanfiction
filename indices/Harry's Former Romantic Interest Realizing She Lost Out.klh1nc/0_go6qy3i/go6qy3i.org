linkffn(Casting Shadows; Surroundings; Blame it on me by Dorothea Greengrass; Novocaine; His angel);

Casting Shadows has what you asked for but it is a very small part of the fic

Surroundings is the fic that you mentioned with hermione

Blame it on me is part of a series that revolves around the exact premise that you asked for and I recommend that you check out the authors other works

Novocaine sort of has this but its more Ginny realizing that she doesn't want what being with Harry entails

His angel again sort of does what you asked for but it applies more towards Ron and Hermione's friendship with Harry though it is hinted at being a bit romantic in hermione's case

I would say that you should dive into haphne fics as they usually have some sort of jealous ex involved be it Harry's or Daphne's
