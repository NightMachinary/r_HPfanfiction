I'm reading 30 Minutes That Changed Everything by Radaslab. And it kinda has this. 160 year old Harry makes an avatar copy of himself and sends it back in time to young Harry. Its definitely AU. And there's a lot of explanation about how the Wizarding World works. I'd recommend it given what I've read so far.
