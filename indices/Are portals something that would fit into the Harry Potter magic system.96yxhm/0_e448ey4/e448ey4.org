I think just simply having a gateway type of thing wouldn't be whimsical enough for the HP universe.

I'm imagining something thats maybe... a waiting room. You go in from the Ministry of Magic in London and take a seat. After a while of checking out the latest Transfiguration Monthly, you get up and go out the same door, only to stand in Singapour.

Or maybe there is a pillar you need to circle as many times as there are timezones between you and your destination to get there.

In short: I think portals fit, if they aren't just... you know... portals.
