I don't see why not. Vanishing cabinets provide instant travel to another location. This would be another form.

One way I can see to do this with mirrors is to act as a long range switching spell. The mirror switches the position of two people who have their hand against the glass on either side. The mirrors come with an accessory, an enchanted mirror frame. If there isn't anyone else nearby that wants to switch places the frame can conjure a temporary copy of you on the other side to switch with.
