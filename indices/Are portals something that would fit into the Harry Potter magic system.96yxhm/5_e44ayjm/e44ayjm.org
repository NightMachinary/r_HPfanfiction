I'm thinking of writing a fic with dimensional portals actually. I was going to go with the idea that dimensional travel is genetic, and this has been transferred from Lily Evans' side of the family in a dormant form that doesn't kick in unless you have magic. It seems like it would fit into the idea of rare powers manifesting in those of “impure” blood, like Tonks. It would lead to multiple types of Harrys or his counterparts meeting each other. The only rule is that each dimension is running parallel at the same time, so the amount of time spent in another world is in real time with ones own and you'll phase into the same location equivalent in that dimension. I played around with the idea of controlling what dimension you end in with blood runes (which Harry would be reluctant to use since it's Dark Magic). It would lead to complications after Voldemort's resurrection since he would have Harry's blood, he could also gain the ability to phase through dimensions
