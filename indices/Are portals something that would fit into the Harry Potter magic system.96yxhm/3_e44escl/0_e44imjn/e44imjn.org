Have you never played /Portal/, the game? Did you not watch /Incredibles 2/? Short distance portals could add a lot to combat, nevermind the practicality of having a semi-permanent way of transporting large numbers of people/things between two places that doesn't involve violent motion, flame, or flying on a broom.
