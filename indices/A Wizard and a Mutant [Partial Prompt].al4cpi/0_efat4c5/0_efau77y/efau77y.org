It's the end of the first chapter, but for those familiar with Marvel it shouldn't be hard to figure out who Riddle is talking to, hehe. ;)

Sadly, it's not out yet. I have the unfortunate tendency to start a story after planning it out, but then lose interest in it. The only solution I could come up with was to mostly finish writing out the entire story first, or at least most of it. It'll make progress... Eventually. ðŸ˜­
