Linkao3(Tea with Mrs. Granger) fits your request. Draco has to undergo considerable changes before Hermione even considers a friendship with him. He apologizes to not just Hermione but everyone he has insulted over the years. Slow burn with the actual pairing in the sequel, after the redemption arc./Not Hogwarts/ unfortunately, but there are valid reasons for it.
