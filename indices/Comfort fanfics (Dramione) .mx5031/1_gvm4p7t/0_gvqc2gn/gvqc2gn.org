Uh. How could this be comforting? A relationship based on Stockholm and Reverse Stockholm syndrome where physical attraction overcomes prejudice for a specific individual rather than the other way around. Hermione in this one is either a Saint or some kind of masochist with how often she is hurt. Draco remains a nazi despite the Death Eaters gunning for him. Absolutely terrible.
