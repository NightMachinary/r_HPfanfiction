You're talking about the fanfic proposed in the comment or my post? Because if it's about my post you're reminding me I should add a point regarding Draco's character. I don't like Dramione fanfics based on pure physical and sexual attraction, I actually enjoy those where Draco's character changes and redempts himself before the romance begins. I thought the points about good writing and plausible plot already involved that but maybe I should add a specific one.
