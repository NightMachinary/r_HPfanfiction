Huh. The closest I've seen is a crossover with Naruto. Young Harry convinces himself he's a ninja after reading some comics in a library and basically converts entirety of his magic reserves (or so it seems at first) into chakra. He then uses his reference materials as a source of techniques. Lost it though.
