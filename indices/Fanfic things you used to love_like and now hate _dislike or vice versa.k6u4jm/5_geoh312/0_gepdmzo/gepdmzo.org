Ok I always wanted to know, Why was Harry/Ginny so big before ootp? It has been a while since I've read the the books but after book 2 and before 5 I don't really remember Ginny being a bigger character than like Lavender Parvati or Neville. Like reoccurring sure but not given than much focus. So it was weird to me finding out that the ship was big between books 4 and 5.
