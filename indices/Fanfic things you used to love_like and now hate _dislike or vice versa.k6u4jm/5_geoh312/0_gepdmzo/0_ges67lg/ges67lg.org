I think it was because we had enough background about her family to know something (she's a Gryffindor, got a good family and she's lovestruck) but not enough that we were able to treat her as a bit of a blank slate (unlike Hermione, who was pretty well defined). She often joined the trio to either replace or supplement Ron. She fulfilled the tomboyish girl-next-door and patiently-waiting-for-dense-male-to-notice-me stereotypes. This was also the era when soul bond fics were popular so the CoS episode was an easy way to tie into that. I also think fics in that era explored the possibility of Harry and Ginny bonding over their trauma (Ginny helping Harry get over Cedric nightmares in the Burrow / Gryff Common Room scenes were a dime a dozen) which canon and modern fics, in their hurry to follow the stations of canon, completely ignore.

Back then, remember, Ginny was also THE main alternative to Hermione so people who disliked Hermione flocked to her. Other characters like Tonks, Daphne and Luna hadn't been introduced. Cho had a bit of a following but not enough to be a real threat especially after Cedric died. She def had the third biggest following.
