I used to be super into crossovers. Like the reason I actually read Harry Potter was because it had the most crossover fics with series that I liked. Now crossovers are just sort of meh to me. Part of it is because it's so hard to find well written or original idea in fandoms that I actually want to see cross over.

For example, every Doctor Who crossover is either "The Doctor has landed at Hogwarts and is a professor now!" or "Harry was The Doctor all along!" or "Barty Crouch Jr. was the Tenth Doctor!" and the majority have very poor prose.
