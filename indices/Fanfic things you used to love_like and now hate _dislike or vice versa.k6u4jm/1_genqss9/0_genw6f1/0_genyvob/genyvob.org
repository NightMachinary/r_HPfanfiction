Absolutely. I was reminiscing about PJO the other day, and decided to try a crossover, and they're all either "Percy and X other characters are in Y house!" or "Look how much more competent Percy is than Harry!" the latter of which I happen to agree with, but that doesn't make for good reading when it's the core tenant of your story.
