I used to read more Harry Potter crossovers because it seemed like back then every fandom had a Harry Potter crossover it didn't matter if they had anything in common. Sometimes it meant you'd have to redefine magic to be like the combination of powers and magic from like way different stories. To be honest it was really an excuse to sort characters from diff shows into different hogwarts houses. But i really liked doing that. But often I didn't find very good crossovers it was harder to find decent crossovers than it was decent non crossover fics so I just stopped trying.
