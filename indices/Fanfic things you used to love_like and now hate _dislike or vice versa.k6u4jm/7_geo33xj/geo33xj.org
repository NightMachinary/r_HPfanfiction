I used to love Ravenclaw Harry stories or Hinny stories now I just cant get past a few chapters. I also use to read the crap out of X Readers (for any fandom I was in) and now I wouldn't read X Readers if you paid me to.

On the other hand I used to hate time travel stories now I actively look for them
