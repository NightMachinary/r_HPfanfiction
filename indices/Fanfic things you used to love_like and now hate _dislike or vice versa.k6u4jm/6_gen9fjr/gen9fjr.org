when I first got into fandom as a youngster, i was a huge sucker for Indy!harry ^{and} ^{^{also}} ^{^{^{snarry}}}

now, i still love me some Indy!harry, but i definitely have to be in the right mood, and i often read genfic. one of my favorite tropes now is slytherin!harry for reasons, though I'll accept Ravenclaw or hufflepuff harry if done well and I'm in the mood.
