I used to read:

Harry/Hermione and now I can only view them as brother and sister

Malfoy redemption stories but now I dont really like him to be friendly and all buddy with the trio or anyone not in Slytherin. I like seeing him as the antagonist

Crossovers. I dont really like them anymore and avoid them at all costs

Do overs are boring now

I used to have a couple female characters I liked but now I only liked a few select male characters lol

And while I still enjoy romance, now I more so want to see friendships because it almost feels like that barely happens anymore (well, maybe not /barely/ but you know what I mean)
