  Malfoy redemption stories but now I dont really like him to be friendly and all buddy with the trio or anyone not in Slytherin. I like seeing him as the antagonist

I actually had the exact opposite happenðŸ˜…

  And while I still enjoy romance, now I more so want to see friendships because it almost feels like that barely happens anymore (well, maybe not barely but you know what I mean)

I feel the same I'm more ok with romance if it emerges out of a friendship that gets explored alot before the romance for the most part. Especially if they are still in hogwarts. Like it just is weird to me seeing overly romantic 14 year olds.
