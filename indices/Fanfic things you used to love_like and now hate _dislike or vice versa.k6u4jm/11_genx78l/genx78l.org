I used to really like "do other" and Peggy Sue fics when I first started to read fanfics. Now most of them bore me to death (though I don't remember seeing much of them recently, maybe the trope kinda died?).

The MC (usually Harry) either completely ignore his future knowledge because "Must protect timeline", or deal with Voldemort in 2 chapters before spending the rest of the fics bashing Ron and having a creepy relationship with the mentaly much younger Love Interest (whoever that is in the fic). I'm also not a big fan of the "Manipulative Dumbledore" trope, which is pretty much always there in this kind of fic.
