When I first started reading fanfiction, I was barely a teenager. I liked stories where Harry was more powerful, doing cool stuff with magic, time travelling and fixing everything I didn't like in the series. Now, I'm out when I see the first signs the story will include overpowered characters or where Harry (or anyone else) gets some special skill or talent that makes him op.

I still like time travel, but I'm much pickier when it comes to fics with that trope, and I absolutely hate when Harry goes back in time to fix things, and it all goes swimmingly.

I used to like the nobility trope, but now, it seems rather ridiculous, and I laugh every time I see 11-year olds speaking like old politicians.

When I was younger, I also have a big problem with Dumbledore, so I often searched for fics with Dumbledore bashing. Now, I ran away when I see the word "bashing" in the tags or anything that would lead me to believe the story will contain bashing of any character.

Lately, I focus on more character-driven stories. Character characterisation is one of the most important things for me, and I love when authors give their characters flaws and make them human.
