Hermione centric, MarySue!Hermione, OP!Hermione, Hhr etc

That was when I was younger around early 2010. I had a crush on Emma Watson and very into the smart/nerdy girl archetype. I got away from HP fanfiction and covid brought me back because I have less things to do.

A lot of portrayal of Hermione remains the exact same.

Harry in another house: still best friends with Hermione

Harry is "gray": Hermione goes gray with him and they're together

Harry raised by someone else: No problem, he and Hermione hit it off.

Harry not the main character: It's Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Snape, Hermione/one of the Marauders.

Hermione in Slytherin: The girl who goes to the toilet and cry because of a mean off-hand comment somehow survives a place where she's treated like shit. The only reasonable outcome of canon Hermione being sorted in Slytherin is to beg her parents to transfer her to some other magical school after first year.

Hermione knows more magic than Voldemort and can outfox manipulative!Dumbledore despite being a schoolgirl. Hermione is the first muggleborn ever to think about "revolutionizing" the wizarding world. No one has ever tried. Hermione somehow becomes the most powerful politician after Hogwarts despite awful people skills and having no ability to compromise. Hermione becomes the sexiest witch even though she's only ever considered beautiful after putting in hours of work.
