Remus is my favourite too, but since I don't like Tonks in most fics, I'm trying to find something with Remus and an OC and have to say it's very difficult. I've just remembered there's a fic a solution more beautiful by darsynia. But it's an AU where the OC is a book fan who gets transported into the world of HP.
