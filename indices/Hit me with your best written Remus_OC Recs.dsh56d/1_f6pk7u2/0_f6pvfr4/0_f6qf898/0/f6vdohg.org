I am also not a Remus/Tonks fan. I find Remus/Sirius a really beautiful ship though. Check out [[/r/wolfstar][r/wolfstar]] if that sounds like something you'd be interested in. There are a ton of fics already recommended there and if you don't see what you're looking for, people will be happy to make recs.
