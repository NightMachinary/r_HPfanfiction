#+begin_quote
  Darcy Potter returns to Hogwarts for her final year at Hogwarts, overcome with fear at the idea that Sirius Black may have escaped Azkaban to come after her brother. Bitter at Harry's developing independence, he begins to push her away and distance himself. All the while, a new professor has arrived at Hogwarts with connections to her parents' past, and she keeps having strange dreams of a faceless man saving her from a scene of destruction... Her relationships become strained as Darcy feels increasing pressure to figure out who will come first in her life.
