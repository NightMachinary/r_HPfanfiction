Save files in a Kindle compatible format - MOBI, PDF, RTF work*. Log into your Amazon account, go to Manage Your Content and Devices, Settings. Make note of the e-mail address assigned to your device under Send-to-Kindle E-Mail Settings (if your device isn't registered, check Amazon help on doing that). Add an e-mail under Approved Personal Document E-mail List.

Once you have all the I's dotted, just mail your documents from your 'approved' e-mail to your 'send-to-kindle' e-mail as attachments. Max 25 documents, max... 20 MB message size? If something goes wrong with your submission Amazon will e-mail you a message describing the problem.

(*Sometimes a MOBI file is rejected, save as PDF or RTF and re-upload).
