It works with FFnet and AO3, I don't use any others, but don't think it should be a problem. It downloads all the info about the fic (author, source, word count, pairings, summary, tags etc), then you have a list of chapters (with hypertext links), then the rest of the fic. So it's like any normal multi-chapter ebook, really.
