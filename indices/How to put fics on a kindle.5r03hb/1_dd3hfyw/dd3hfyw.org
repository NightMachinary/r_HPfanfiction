If you don't have (or want) an Amazon account, like me:

1) Download and install [[https://calibre-ebook.com/download][Calibre]]

Calibre is a powerful e-reader management suite.

2) Go to [[http://ficsave.xyz/]]

3) Paste the url of the fic you want to save. The site will convert and prepare it for download in the format you choose - I use epub.

4) Connect your kindle to the computer and open calibre. The main screen will show your library.

5) Click add e-books button. Navigate to the folder you saved your fics from ficsave. After a bit they will be added to your library.

6)Simply right click on the newly added ebook fanfic in the main screen and click send to device. If it asks for an autoconvert, press yes.

Voila!
