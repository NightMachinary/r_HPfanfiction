Well I think a few would, but the problem would be having the evidence that is enough to persuade them to leave. They'd need some hard evidence and the balls to leave since they all considered it a death sentence. And as important as blood purity was, another important thing is power. Some still would've stuck with him even faced with the half-blood news because they feared Voldemort and believed him to be most powerful.

It would probably all hinge on what it was that Bellatrix discovered and would others believe her. Being crazy wouldn't help her case.
