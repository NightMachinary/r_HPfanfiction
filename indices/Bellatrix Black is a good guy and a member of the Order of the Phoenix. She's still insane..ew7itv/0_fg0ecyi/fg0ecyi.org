I love this idea. I think one of the easier ways for her loyalty to be broken in her early days is she somehow stumbles upon the truth of Voldemort's half-blood origins and considers it beneath herself to follow him. She fights against him not necessarily as a "good guy" but because she feels that purebloods should not have to bow to any half-blood.

Some ramifications:

- She'd never let Sirius get locked up the way he is. Guessing she'd hate Peter because she always saw him as weak and when stuff went down she'd out Peter as the traitor somehow, getting Sirius a fair trial.
- Perhaps having her AND Sirius on the side of the good could turn Regulus back to the good either before he gets killed or before he gets in too deep with the Death Eaters.
- The attack on the Longbottoms goes down differently. With the Lestranges and Crouch Jr doing it without Bellatrix, perhaps they are fended off completely or only one Longbottom is permanently damaged/killed.
- I can't decide if she'd be mortal enemies with Mad-Eye or they'd bond over their distrust of Snape.
- I think she'd be friends with Aberforth, grow to respect McGonagall, constantly be at odds with Dumbledore.
- Of course her and Sirius would butt heads over Lupin and being a werewolf. Probably some significant battle moment where Lupin helps save Bellatrix or someone she cares about would lead to her softening to him.

I like the constant crazy aspect though. Paranoia, recklessness, unable to follow orders would be her near-constant traits. I'm really not into the self-harm stuff but I could see that being an aspect. Maybe a bit too reliant on the firewhiskey. She'd also have a bit of a nasty streak with battle spells but never crosses over into the Unforgiveables.

Edit: Let's say she was unable to prove Sirius's innocence and Harry ends up with the Dursleys. If she found out about his mistreatment at the hands of muggles I imagine she'd do a lot worse than pigtails and ton-tongue toffee.
