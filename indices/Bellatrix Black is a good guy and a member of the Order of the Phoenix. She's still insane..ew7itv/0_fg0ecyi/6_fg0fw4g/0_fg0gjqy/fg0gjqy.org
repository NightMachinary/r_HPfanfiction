It sounds fun. I'm more of an ideas guy though. Putting pen to paper fiction-wise has never been my bag. Maybe some day. I've got like 4 different ideas that I'd love to write but just not confident I could actually follow through on them. Maybe this is idea No. 5.

I actually write a lot in my life as a lawyer, and I journal for myself personally, but never sat down and wrote extensive fiction. I once wrote a few thousand words of an original fiction about high school kids experiencing an apocalyptic event, think like Red Dawn meets War of the Worlds type stuff, but that fizzled out.
