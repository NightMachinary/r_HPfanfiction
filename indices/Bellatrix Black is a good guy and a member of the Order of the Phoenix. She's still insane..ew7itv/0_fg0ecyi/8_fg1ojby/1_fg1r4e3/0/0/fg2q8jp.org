Bellatrix discovers Toms heritage and is contemplating if she should abandon him or stick with his power. That is until she over here's Regulus and Kreature talking. The two share what they know and decide to defect and try to get Narcissa to com with them. Regulus wants to go for the Horcrux immediately but this time takes Bella and Narcissa with him instead. Narcissa is a potions genius on par with Snape amd has the Black library to study from. She identifies the potin and feed it to transfigured pig. Bellatrix deals with the inferi when the pig gets the water whilst kreature takes them out one by one.

Bellatrix kills her husband and leaves, Regulus jumps ship to a safe house he has in the south. Narcissa truly loved her husband and couldn't bring herself to abandon him and her son. Instead she stays and fakes a pregnancy to avoid Tom.

Lucius cannot help but brag about his accomplishments so when his recruit, Severus Snape, brings him a prophecy to pass forward he naturally tells his wife all about the rewards he would get and how doomed the Potters and Longbottoms are, such a joke that either boy could possibly be prophisised to defeat his lord. He also liked to tell about his other recruit, Peter Pettigrew, who revealed the Potters location.

When Harry survives the three see him as there way out, Regulus helps his brother and saves him before he is arrested or even spotted. Sadly Dumbledore still suspected Sirius and does not let him see Harry. Finally at Diagon Alley they all meet for the first time. Harry gains three competent adults to rely on, a fourth adult of questionable sanity who is fiercly protective of him and an ally in Narcissa's son draco, not a best friend but someone who can help him at school in this new world.

Of course it still takes untill after first year to completely trust them and Quirrell still is burnt at Harry's hand. Second year has everybody too terrified of Harry's aunt Bella to accuse him of anything that could upset him, despite her adoration of the idea that Harry is Slytherins heir. Third year brings Lupin into the equation who hid in america for the past twelve years and with some butting heads at first with Bellatrix strong opinions all is put to rest when the man proves useful when he protects Harry from a group of acrumantula that come after him when he crashes his broom into the forest playing quidditch (It really wasn't his fault considering they shot webs at him and knocked him off).

Fourth year brings the tournament amd Igor Karkaroff proves he never abandoned the dark lord and merely betrayed those who defected after his fall. Crouch was a small price to pay so he could search for his lord. He even killed Durmstrangs headmaster so he could take the place and come to England. As much as he would like Durmstrang to win his Lords wishes are more important so he enters the Potter boys name amd ensures he gets to the cup. Surprisingly it didn't take much effort to get him there and he only need stall the others.

The graveyard goes down the same with the devistating death of Diggory and Voldemorts ressurection with Peters hand. When Lucius returns to Toms side regardless of his wifes wishes that he doesn't. Narcissa takes Draco and leaves Malfoy Manor when he invites the dark lord to his home.

When Harry is attacked by dementors he goes to Number 2 Privet Drive where Remus and the Blacks live to be close to Harry and look out for him like they had since he turned eleven. Narcissa claims responsibility for the patronus charm and with her popularity in high society is proven that dementors were there and Dudley as Harry's cousin already knew of magic.

Alastor Moody had taken a liking to Harry and agreed to help him further in some defense training under the orders of Dumbledore as the Blacks refused to entrust Harry to him again after the Dursley wards failed to stop the dementors. At first Moody was at odds with the four Blacks, Bellatrix more than others. Bellatrix's care for Harry confused him but eventually they come to a mutual respect for each other in their quest to defeat Tom. (A similar relationship to Sirius and Snape)

Fifth year brings Fudges denial of Voldemorts return, that is until Bellatrix killed him fir his smear campaign against Harry. Similarly to the mysterious dissappearance of Rita Skeeter in January 1995. The new Minister of Magic Narcissa Black formerly Malfoy starts the war effort to keep the death eaters at bay and with the assistance of the press was able to spread the truth of his origins. The concrete proof they had gathered and revealed led to a huge slow in Voldemorts recruiting and even defected some of his current followers. None of the inner circle but still a large blow to his forces.

(((((Thats a start summary of what would be different or could be. The rest if the war could go in any direction and there are a lot of possibilities for it. I like the idea of Bellatrix spontaneously killing Fudge and Skeeter and frustrating Sirius and Remus for doing so. Naturally she is too skilled to be caught and is nver suspected. Narcissa being politically inclined as she is takes advantage if it and solves that problem. You can use my thoughts and shape the war how you like or just take bits of it. If you wanted to write it I would be happy to give some more ideas or thoughts.)))))
