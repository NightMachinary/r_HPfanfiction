Look at cause and effect. Regulus is dead before the prophecy is made. You can save him via Bellatrix's defection, but then she wouldn't know about the prophecy, the hunt on the Potters and Pettigrew's treason because there is nothing in her actions which would have that impact. If anything, Bellatrix defecting makes the war easier for the order, which would delay if not prevent Pettigrew from turning traitor.

Or you write an AU where you change everything as you need to, but then your divergence is no longer just "Bellatrix changes sides", but everything you need to alter in order to align Pettigrew, Regulus and and Pettigrew already as a traitor. Which means that you either change the timeline around the prophecy, Snape's part and, consequently, Harry's age, or you deage Regulus. But that would mean that he isn't the one sent to the cave, Kreacher isn't poisoned and so on.
