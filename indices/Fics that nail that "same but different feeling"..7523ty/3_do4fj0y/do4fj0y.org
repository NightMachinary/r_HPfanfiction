On the subject of Harry Crow (may it be purged from the internet) I actually found a 'Harry raised by Goblins' story that was quite good. The first half where he grows up with the goblins is every interesting and well fleshed out, and when he goes to Hogwarts the tone changes slightly and the fic captures the whimsy and wonder of the magical world in a manner reminiscent (but less serious even) than that of the first books.

linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)

It's written by the same guy who wrote the 'Lessons with Hagrid' story about Hagrid being the other Occlumens in the castle strong enough to keep Voldemort out, so you know it's gonna be good.
