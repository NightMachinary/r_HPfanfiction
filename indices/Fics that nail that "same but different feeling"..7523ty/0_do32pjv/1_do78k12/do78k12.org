eh, I'm sort of mixed on this - while it's certainly well written, and does capture the field of a large magical world, it doesn't do a good job of making the reader a part of it. it feels like the author is just making stuff up as they go along, and as the user there's no real way to anticipate anything that happens.

like, in my opinion, the best stories are the ones that establish the rules and mechanics early on, and then use them in interesting and creative ways later. untitled tome just feels like it just invents new things just moments before it uses them - I know it's not the most accurate description for it, but it has a sort of consistent deus ex machina feel to it.
