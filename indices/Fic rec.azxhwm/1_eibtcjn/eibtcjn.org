I remember I was really tempted to read this because of how much of it was complete even though I've never particularly been a fan of slash. I read up to around the third or fourth story (I don't quite remember) and I agree that there was a lot of nice world-building from what I recall. But (SPOILER) once Harry lost his hand, I just gave up because it seemed like every bad thing possible kept happening to Harry and it didn't seem like there would be an end to it. I'm a fan of angst but it became too much and too frustrating for me.
