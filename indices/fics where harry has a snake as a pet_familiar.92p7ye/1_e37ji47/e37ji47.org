I don't know in which book he acquires the snake, but Harry does get a snake as a pet somewhere in The Sacrifices Arc, which starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283][Saving Connor]], linkffn(2580283) IMHO it's the most well-written HP fanfic out there (well, the series, the first book isn't my favourite out of all seven books)
