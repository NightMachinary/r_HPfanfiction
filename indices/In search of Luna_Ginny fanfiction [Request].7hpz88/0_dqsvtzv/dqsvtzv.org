I linked a bunch on the wiki.

Girls' Own Adventure - linkffn(4579602) - Makes Luna some sort of strange being. The writing has an almost dream-like quality to it, which makes me recommend it.

Camelopard Dreams - linkffn(12217386) - Some sort of magical creature attacks Luna. Ginny investigates. Only multichapter among this lot.

Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow - linkao3(10231472) - Old age Ginny and Luna.

cor aut mors - linkao3(9084976) - soulmate!AU, which I generally don't read, but this one approaches the social issue of not having a bondmark in a world in which everyone has one in an interesting way.

stories we tell ourselves - linkao3(7763677) - World war II AU. Ginny's a soldier, fighting against her family's wishes. Ginny's characterisation is lovely.
