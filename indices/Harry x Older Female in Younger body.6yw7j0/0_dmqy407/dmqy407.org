Linkffn(Earl of the North)

It's Harry/Bellatrix. It's an okay fic, I guess.

There's also one where Tonks goes back in time at the end of Harry's 5th year and attends Hogwarts pretending to be a 15 year old. It's Harry/Tonks obviously. I forgot the name though.

Edit: It's linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in an Hourglass)
