#+begin_quote
  Harry is a single father trying to raise his godson, Teddy. Unable to ensure his son's safety in the wizarding world he goes into hiding in the muggle one. But one trip to London will undo all of his precautions. Thrown back to the past, Harry finds himself falling into the arms of a woman who once spared his life. No paradox, Light/Badass Harry. T/M rated. Update late Summer 2020.
