Not the same fic, but that reminds me of a very similar one where Dumbledore was manipulating Tom into being a sacrificial "Harry" to fight Grindlewald before he swooped in and saved the day. The girl was another Hogwarts student/graduate and Tom killed her after overhearing her ask Dumbledore how much longer she had to pretend.
