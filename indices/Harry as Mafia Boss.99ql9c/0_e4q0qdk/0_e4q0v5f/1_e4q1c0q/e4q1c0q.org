There is a Harry Diary!Tom ship but the other Horcruxes get axed. I don't know if thats acceptable or not? Also I've just realised that I meant to add [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][Business]] by esama instead of Moratorium - Moriarty, Moratorium, I get confused sometimes. Personally I liked Moratorium. I thought it did the approach to Diary!Tom very well. Both good - Business is better.
