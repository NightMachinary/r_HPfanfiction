Ooh, there's some good ones out there! I love criminal or Mafia Boss Harry. Here are some of my favourites. One of these is Harry becoming a Don, but the other two are just involve him as a criminal.

Moratorium- fem! Harry enters the wizarding world and sees a world of opportunities. Complete. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/][Moratorium]]

The Vahan Saga - Harry gets picked up by a street gang as a child and then starts organising crime. Very slowly updating. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/623810][The Vahan Saga]]

The entirety of the genius Harveste Addams series. Harry murders the Dursleys aged five and is adopted by the Addams' who have coincidentally shown up. Delightfully deadly and decadent. Tragically abandoned in the middle of the fifth book but still definitely worth a read; this is a series I always gravitate back to, and I have read an embarrassing amount of HP fanfics.
