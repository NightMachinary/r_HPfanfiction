I agree. I've gotten into fem-Harry fics recently, but it only works for me if she's called Harry. Once I'm reading about "Jasmine" or "Rose" I can't convince my brain that it's the same character.

There's a bunch of fics I need to download to do a search and replace, because they look really promising but I can't get past the name thing.

Even in Prince of Slytherin, when he's doing "Hadrian" thing, I need to remind myself, "he's acting! This is a role!" Mercifully those bits tend to be short.
