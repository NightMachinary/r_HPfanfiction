My fem!harry is called Hannah ðŸ˜¤

I actually have a bit of fun with the picking a female name thing in one of my earlier chapters.

I don't think there's anything wrong with Harriet, either.

I guess it could be seen as lazier because you don't need to change your headspace as much or can borrow more from canon sources, but I don't think that's why most people choose it.

Sometimes people do run off with certain themes a bit to far for names.

Orchid for example is rarely ever used as a flower name, Petunia and Lily are actually flowers and names, Violet or Rose would be a better option imo.

But yeah, like you story > names
