Realistically, most people, when choosing baby names, won't say something like "Harry if it's a boy, and Harriet if it's a girl." Instead, they'll have completely different lists for boys and girls, even when a name has a common counterpart for the other gender. There are plenty of exceptions, of course, and there's always the possibility that someone messed up the gender-reveal charm and they didn't have time to think up a new name. But as a general rule, it's probably more likely that Lily and James wouldn't have named their daughter Harriet.

But with all that being said, I like Harriet as a name more than most of the flower names people throw around. She is still just a female version of Harry, so Harriet fits as a name.
