For me, the whole point of Harry being named 'Harry' was in its simplicity and commonality. He was "just Harry." So I transfer that over to "Harriet." It's not overly pretty or unique, a bit old-fashioned, a name for someone who is "just Harriet."

I don't mind some of the simpler flower names, but stuff like Ianthe or Celadine or Amaranth kind of defeat the purpose of Harry not having a special, "epic" name.
