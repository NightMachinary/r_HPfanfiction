I enjoyed linkffn(In The Long Run by Spectrum24), though it's more about them fighting to /stay/ together than them starting a relationship in the first place.

Linkffn(Image Of You by angelic1hp) was dark as hell, involves cheating and a lot of angst, but I thought it was weirdly beautiful. Two people utterly destroy their comfortable, complacent lives in the name of a passion they can't contain, leaving them a little broken, inside and out, but ultimately together.

I wish I could think of more, but a lot of HG/GW stories I've read follow the same pattern of 'innocent love where everything goes well and the conflict comes from fighting Voldemort together', which is nice, but gets kinda old after a while. Hermione/Fleur is full of stories like that, too. The more I read romance, the more I feel that the truly interesting stories are the ones where there is conflict within the pairing, rather than a perfect relationship where the conflict comes from without. So if light fluff is more your thing, sorry, I'm not your guy.

Edit: Maybe give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Woman-s-Love-Femslash/90503/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][A Woman's Love]] a trawl for HG/GW stories? It's one of the larger HP femslash communities on FFnet.
