I... honestly don't really remember any specifically. Maybe it was hyperbole to say 'a lot', because there really aren't that many HGGW stories as a whole, but I definitely remember reading fics that bored the hell out of me with their lack of romantic tension. Problem is, when that happens, I tend to just delete them off my kindle and forget about it, so... I don't really have any recs, sorry. My memory is pretty awful, and after a while, it just sort of blends together and I end up re-reading the thing a year later by accident. If it wasn't good or bad enough to make me care, I really do tend to just forget about it after a while.

In fairness, my tendency to switch quickly between fandoms probably doesn't help matters. Searching is hard largely because femslash authors often don't seem to tag their pairings, only the characters involved. So odd pairings we might want to find get lost amidst a sea of other, more common pairings.
