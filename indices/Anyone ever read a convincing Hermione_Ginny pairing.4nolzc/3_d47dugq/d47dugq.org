I read an /awful/ one a while back. I remember being able to tolerate it when I first read through it, but upon attempting to re-read it a year ago or so, I realised it was horrendous. The plot was clunky, the dialogue was stilted, and there wasn't any overarching theme. It pretty much just turned me off on HG/GW since then, which is a real shame, as I'm a fan of both characters.
