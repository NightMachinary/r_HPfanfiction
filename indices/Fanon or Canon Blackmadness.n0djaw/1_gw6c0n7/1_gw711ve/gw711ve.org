Really, According to Plan was funny. But reading nearly a full chapter of Ron Weasley bashing, with Hermione being a total ass-hole to him and being applauded by Neville and Harry for it kind of takes the fun out of it. I hate it when stories, that have much promise, do that. So I stopped at chapter 7.
