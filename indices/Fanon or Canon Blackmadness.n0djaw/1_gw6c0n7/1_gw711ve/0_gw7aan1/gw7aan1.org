Totally understandable. For what's it worth you won't be seeing much of Ron in this fic, he drops out of Hogwarts at some point. I stayed for the worldbuilding really. The other rec is significantly more relevant to your request. Sirius after the werewolf incident in a fit of Black Madness somehow concludes that the best way to regain James' good grace is to turn himself into a girl. The gradual loss of SAN points is quite visible in the narration. Symptoms include Insomnia, general hyperactivity and a general lack of common sense.
