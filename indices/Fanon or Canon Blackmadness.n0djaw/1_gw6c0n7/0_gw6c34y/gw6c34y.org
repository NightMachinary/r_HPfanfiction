  Avalon is a place of dreams and stories: a land of of faerie queens and knights and ladies, a land of magic, outside of time, where everyone is free to do as they will, and the worthy never die. But the thing is, Avalon isn't real. It never was.To accept that there is no island of knights and faerie queens, and that magic is hardly mystical, is part of growing up.To believe that you can reach it is madness, impossible.But Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Black have never had much respect for the concept of impossibility (or sanity).This is the dream of the Knights of Walpurgis: to build a New Avalon, a Dark Utopia, a paradise of magic and freedom and wonder --- a post-capitalist anarchy where all beings are equals in the eyes of the law, its leaders devoted to their people and ideals, and followed freely, by choice.A journey to Avalon is never easy --- the way is lost in mist: it's easy to go astray.But then, it's just as easy to stumble back onto the path as it is to stumble off of it, and if you're noble and worthy --- and above all, lucky --- the gods will send a guide to help you find it again. They probably won't tell the guide, though. Gods can be arseholes like that.
