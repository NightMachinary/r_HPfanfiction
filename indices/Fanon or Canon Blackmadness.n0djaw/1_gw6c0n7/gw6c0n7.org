Fanon probably. Andromeda, Narcissa and Regulus are valid counterexamples. Not much is said about Dorea Potter , Lucretia Prewett or Alphard Black but no obvious sign of their insanity is present. Sirius himself was quite sane, if a bit hyperactive before Azkaban. Bellatrix is the only certifiably insane Black in the series.

There are several fanfics which turn Black Madness into an actual magical condition as a price of excess power. Best examples are linkao3(All According To Plan) or linkao3(The Lady Of (New) Avalon).
