It's fanon.

Not sure where you got the part about Orion's 'insanity', but Sirius and Bellatrix's instability could just as easily have come from years locked in Azkaban as from anything hereditary.

I do agree that Walburga was certainly not well at the point of her death (although imo her portrait is clearly a caricature of the witch she once was), I prefer to explain this by the grief and loss and loneliness she endured by the end of her life. I think it's more interesting to explain their 'madness' through their personalities/motives/actions rather than some sort of arbitrary 'Black curse', but it is a popular fanon interpretation.
