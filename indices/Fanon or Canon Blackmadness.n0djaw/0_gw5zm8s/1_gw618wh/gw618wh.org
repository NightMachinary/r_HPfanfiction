"/My father put every security measure known to/ /wizardkind/ /on it when he lived here./"- Sirius Black about his father. It's not outright stated - but it made the house so secure it was used as a HQ for the order and to housing Harry while Voldemort hunted him. That's security masures taken to the extreme. Being paranoid was my interpretation I give you that.

PS: I asked because I don't want to use it to "excuse" for their madness, but if it was canon, I would have felt obligated to include it because I try in my fanfic not to change canon without reason. So thank you for explanation.
