Orion was 9 when WWII started and 16 when it ended. While I give you that it was traumatising - it doesn't made him any less paranoid that he did those measures because we can be pretty sure he took them after the war ended.

And he was on the same side as Voldemort but not activly fighting, so that's not really an excuse either.
