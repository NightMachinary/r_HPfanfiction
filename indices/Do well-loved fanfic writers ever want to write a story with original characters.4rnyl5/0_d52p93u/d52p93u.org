Many of the more talented and known authors are actually published. Arsinoe de Blassenville, Silens Cursor, Cassandra Clare come to mind.

You can find original works on Amazon. They typically use their real name, but I've seen many promote their short story/novella/trilogy on their Fanfiction.Net profile or other forums like here and DLP with links to the stories.
