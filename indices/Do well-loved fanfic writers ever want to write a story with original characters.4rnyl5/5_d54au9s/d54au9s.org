  Do they ever write stories with original characters?

While I'm neither a writing genius nor well-loved, I'd say that several fanfiction writers do. I've published over twenty pieces of short fiction (a few of which are in "pro" markets) and I've a novel that I'm shopping around. I've also published more than one hundred scientific papers (which don't really count--while there's drama and tension, the characters are flat and uninspired).

  Also, where I can read the stories :)

Jbern published two anthologies of (original) short stories (his /Horror Humor and Heroes/ series) with fanfiction writers. DLP has also published five anthologies of short fiction by site members.
