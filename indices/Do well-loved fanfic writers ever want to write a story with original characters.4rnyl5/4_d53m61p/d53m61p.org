I may not exactly be a well-loved fanfic writer or anything (yet!), but I write original stories all the time. However, I do it for my own pleasure and I don't post them anywhere. They're probably not good enough for publication, but certainly the same or better quality as the fanfiction I write, so the idea of a forum is very interesting.

Creating my own worlds is very fun and actually easier in a way. I don't have to find ways around existing HP magic like I do in fanfiction. I'm free to define what magic can and can't do, if I decide to use it in a story.

It's not very active as far as I can tell, but if you want to read original stories (not necessarily by HP writers, but fic writers in general), check out [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Original%20Work/works][this]] which is the AO3 original works tag. Can't vouch for the quality though.
