Joe Ducie, who gave us The Hero Trilogy, the Time Duology and An Unfound Door, is published. He still updates his fan fiction work on DLP to boot.

One might assume that original work is an aspiration for most fanfic authors. I know that I want to get stuck into my graphic novel projects fairly soonish, but still have my fics to finish, too, so I don't intend on leaving the community until I'm long dead, haha.
