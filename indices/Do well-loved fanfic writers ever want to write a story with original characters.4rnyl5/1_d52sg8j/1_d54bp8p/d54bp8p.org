I've been thinking about the difference between published fiction and fan fiction. Published fiction is curated by the publishers so it limits the range and style of stories you can tell. On the other hand, fanfiction has more room and an audience. Finding an audience for your own fiction outside curated space may be tricky. So some may not want to write outside fanfic. What do you think?
