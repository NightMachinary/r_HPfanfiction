I feel unsatisfied. I feel like Kylo Ren who is screaming "MORE" over and over again. This story has so much potential, with a pretty unique prompt among the ocean of stories with similar tropes.

I loved that Harry is drawing the similarities between Delphini and his childhood. I was severely dissapointed with the Curse Child where Harry did not tried to reach out to Delphini, an orphan who has gone through a rough childhood like he has.

You seem to have a pretty good idea as to what you want the story to be and I am pretty excited to see where that direction is going to be.

Please continue to write this amazing story.
