Thanks? xD Yeah I've always loved the idea of Delphi at least, and what they could have done with contrasting her and Harry and whatnot, but they never did anything with it. So here I am giving it a go!

Good news is I hate bashing, so I'll never do that crap, and I hate magical cores and lordships - pretty much most fanon tropes actually - I tend to be someone who likes canon for want of a nails, I think they're called, where you just change one thing and see how it goes? But all the canon details and characterizations stay the same, so...that's what I've got here. Trying not to add extra stuff unless it's necessary or worldbuildy.

I do actually have a bare bones outline of where I want this story to go, yeah. Got it kind of mapped out here, so it should be pretty smooth sailing.

I'm definitely going to keep writing it!

Or maybe this is all just because I love dad!Harry fics... xD Whether it's babies or adopted kids! I just love it so muuuuch. Finally writing my own here!
