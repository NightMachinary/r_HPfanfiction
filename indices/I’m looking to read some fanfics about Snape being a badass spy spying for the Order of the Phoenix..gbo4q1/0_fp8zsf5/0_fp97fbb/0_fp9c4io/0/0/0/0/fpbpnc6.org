If you start the next story (Dandelions) Remus is in Azkaban and Severus is a badass spy and there are no physical relationships. Although he becomes even more badass in book 3 ( Geraniums) and relationships become a feature again. I didn't recommend skipping the first book though, because all Harry's actions in book 2 are based on his upbringing by Remus and Severus in book one.
