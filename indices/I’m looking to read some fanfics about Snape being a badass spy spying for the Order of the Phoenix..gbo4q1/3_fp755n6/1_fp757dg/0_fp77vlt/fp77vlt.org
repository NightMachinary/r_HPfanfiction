I like the story as whole, but the main pair of it (Harmony) is the weakest part of it. Particularly Snape/McGonagall (non-romantic, just friendly/professional camaraderie) & Percy/Audrey are really lovely substories, but Harry/Hermione are so incredibly perfect, and always perfect, and without any conflict, and did I mention how perfect they are?, that they drive me to sleep (that's problem for me in many Harmony stories).
