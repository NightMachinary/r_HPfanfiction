I've never pulled an entire chapter before, but I have gone back and edited two of them IIRC in response to reader criticism. One case was when there was a fight between major characters, and the reviewers correctly pointed out that they were acting out of character. I didn't remove the entire fight, but I changed it significantly. The second time was a battle in which Hermione was holding back for narrative reasons, and my readers correctly pointed out that it didn't make sense for her to do that at that point. So I rewrote the battle to remove her choice to let the enemy off easy.

However, while I have changed a couple of chapters, there have easily been have a dozen where I wrote and Author's Note defending my position against quite harsh criticism--and in many cases told the readers to just /be patient/ because the thing there were complaining about would be resolved later.

Readers do often give valid criticism, but you have to take it with a grain of salt.
