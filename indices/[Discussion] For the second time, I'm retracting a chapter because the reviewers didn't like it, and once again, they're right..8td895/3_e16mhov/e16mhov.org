I removed a large chunk (~1000 words) of a chapter after it was pointed out to me that reading through that kind of recollective dialogue with pretty much nothing happening (the two people just sit there and talk, it was an empty room on purpose) was rather tedious and I replaced it with two lines of in-media-res.

However, I had a pretty criticized scene where a couple of Hit Wizards, one who is from a Death Eater family, overstepped their boundaries when it looked like Harry broke the law. I mentioned Sirius' arrest by hit wizards at least three times, that Harry had already encountered Ministry "Justice" at the hands of Fudge and Umbridge and yet everyone just kept telling me that Hit Wizards were in fact not supposed to be bad, that it would not be good to break the law and so on. I kept that scene since it was one of the crucial scenes to get the whole plot going after a lot of fluff.

I also had some rather deep reaching disagreements with the guy I used to bounce ideas around with. Following Harry's arrest, him getting kicked while on the ground and Tonks coming to the rescue, there was a scene where they, both shaken by the whole mess and about a week into a romantic relationship (with a platonic one existing for some time), chose to have sex at a secure location. Was it the right call to shag instead of immediately writing a letter to Dumbledore? Of course not. But I try to write characters who are humans and not members of the SPARTAN-II project and I stand by that. I won't write PTSD angst-orgies, but the protagonists are more than just killing machines.
