I've never pulled a chapter or even edited it once it was posted. I read things over several times as I write and I go back and reread previous chapters to make sure my current chapter fits with the previous. My husband reads them before my beta and they're both very good at pointing what doesn't make sense. Is it possible you rushed this one out? It sounds like you made the right decision in the end, but it must have stung.
