I have never changed anything, but that's mainly because I have it all planned in advance. But I hsve been getting some really harsh reviews before. My story has been called propaganda. I've been called a fascist and a 'bleeding-heart libtard'. And no, I didn't change it, because my story was never meant for everyone. If you feel the critique was valid and you agreed something needed to be changed, good for you! That's what reviews are for! I applaud you for taking this in stride! But never, ever let somebody else write your story. Do you have a beta to bounce ideas off of?
