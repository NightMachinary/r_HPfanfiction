Yes Nygilu I have everything planned in advance too and that is why I have not ever changed things! :) It would be way too much effort to rework entire plotlines and character arcs just from one change! And yes that is what I said too, never let anyone else write your story! Else you are not even writing the story you want to tell to begin with.
