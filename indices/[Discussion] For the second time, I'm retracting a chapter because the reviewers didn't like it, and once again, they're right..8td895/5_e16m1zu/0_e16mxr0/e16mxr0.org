I get plenty of things wrong that I don't care if they don't like it and just steam forward.

Most of my works, in fact.

This was a case where the material coming out was funny or meaningful or cool in and of itself but their place in the story was a serious navigational error and change in theme. It's like 'well, we're gearing up to build a student insurrection, but let's go off into a bizarro rumination on the sad life of clowns beneath the makeup'. Maybe not that bad, but you get the idea.
