I rushed out the ending of one of my fics once-- I thought it was a reasonable ending at first, but it made for HORRIBLE storytelling, and was extremely boring.

I got a few disappointed reviews, so I went back and completely rewrote it-- because yeah, they were right in calling it a bad ending.

On the flip side, I've gotten a lot of complaints about details in my stories that were just the reader being dumb/wrong, and I've never felt the need to change anything in my story to accommodate that type of reviewer.
