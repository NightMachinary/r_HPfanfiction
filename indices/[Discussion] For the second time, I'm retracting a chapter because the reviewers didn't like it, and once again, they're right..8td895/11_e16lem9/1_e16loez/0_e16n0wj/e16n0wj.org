To be fair, I know that Alma also has a very tight structure, chapter by chapter, of what will happen in her story, all in advance. Changing a chapter in the middle of it would be throwing a wrench at the entire detailed outline, and thus I can see why she'd be unwilling to do that even though it makes perfect sense for many other writers (all regardless of her "I write for my own entertainment" stance).
