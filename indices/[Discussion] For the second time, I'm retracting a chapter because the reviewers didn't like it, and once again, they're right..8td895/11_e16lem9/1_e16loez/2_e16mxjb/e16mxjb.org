I do consider feedback about like grammar and pacing and spelling, sure, but I'll never change the actual STORY for anyone. Because I'm writing the story, I came up with it. At that point I wouldn't be writing the story I set out to write to begin with, I'd be writing someone else's story that THEY WANT ME TO WRITE.
