Sometimes people do have a point, and while I am writing for myself, I also have the urge to deliver the best story I can.

If I see what people mean, I absolutely do consider their feedback. It is important to remember not everyone that is critiquing you is hostile or dumb.

You writing your stories only for youself kind of does explain why they are such a jarring experience for me.
