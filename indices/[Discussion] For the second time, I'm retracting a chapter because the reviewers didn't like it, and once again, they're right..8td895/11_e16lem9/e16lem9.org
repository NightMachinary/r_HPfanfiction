No I have never done that. I do not think that is a good thing. I do not get reviews, but if I did I still would not do that because I am writing the story to my satisfaction and not to others. If people do not like it, they can yes read something else, I would not delete and change my own work from being exactly how I wanted it, to being /how other people wanted it./ Because they didn't write it, I did.
