Well Achille that is what I mean. :) I don't see a problem with fixing or bettering DETAILS, but to actually go and rewrite like an entire chapter because of what someone else said? :( Nooo! That would totally derail like the entire story I am writing and what I want to have happen in it! That is not EDITING, that is flat out changing the whole STORY, which is what I will never do for anyone. Because I am writing the story. But I will correct grammar or sentence structures, sure! That is what I mean Achille. :)
