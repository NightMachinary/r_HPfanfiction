Oh. I guess that makes sense for you who can afford to be more flexible? But I'm just not. I mean you don't see like Stephen King or the Game of Thrones person changing their stories because of what people say. They just write them and sell them completed, because it's their story. I just do not think changing the story for someone else is a writer thing to do. You tell the story you set out to tell, or you're writing someone else's story and what's the point then! But it is okay if other people do!
