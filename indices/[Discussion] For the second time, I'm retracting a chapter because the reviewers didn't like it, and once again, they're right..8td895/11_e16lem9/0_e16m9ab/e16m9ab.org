I see what you mean, Alma, but though you've never removed a chapter (because you had no cause to), you /have/ done some rewrites where I pointed out things you could have done better: Dragontongue/Draketongue, the abruptness of the Daphne Greengrass fight at the beginning. Now imagine a similar situation where you /realize/ (once someone has pointed it out) that you could have written something much better, better by your /own/ standards too. Except instead of a detail in a long chapter, it's the entire situation/timeline of events that needs changing.
