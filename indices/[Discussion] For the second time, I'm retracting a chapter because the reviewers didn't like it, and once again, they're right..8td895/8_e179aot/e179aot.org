No, I outline my fics before I even begin to write them, down to each chapter. So all the editing, formatting, story-plot-things that may be wrong, or not fit or anything get pulled and reworked before hand. If my reviewers don't like it that's their prerogative, they have a right to their opinion, however the chapter remains because it is my story, and it has a purpose and place in the story. I didn't enjoy Snape's death in Harry Potter, but I didn't write to JK to demand she re-write it either. There will always be parts people won't like. I don't like every single pairing JK did, but it is what it is. I refuse to change them based on people's dislike.
