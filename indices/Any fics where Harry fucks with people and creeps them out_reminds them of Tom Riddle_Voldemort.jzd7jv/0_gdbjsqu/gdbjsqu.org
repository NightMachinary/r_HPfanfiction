I just started but the entire point of the Fic is for Harry to remind people of Tom Riddle (especially since Tom Riddle is in Harry's head).

The idea is that pretty much Harry will have an alter ego(Tom Riddle) which is better at magic and smarter than him, but it only takes possession of Harry once he's unconscious or about to die
