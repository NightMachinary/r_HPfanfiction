linkffn(Through the Veil by darienqmk)

Harry and Ron go back in time to an alternate universe where they don't exist, meaning that Harry isn't The Boy Who Lived and Ron doesn't have his family. They integrate themselves as Third Year Hogwarts students and make plans to mess with everyone.

Their first target is Dumbledore. They pretend to be orphans wanting to enroll in Hogwarts and Harry fucks with him by (loosely) repeating what Tom Riddle said to Dumbledore the first time they met.
