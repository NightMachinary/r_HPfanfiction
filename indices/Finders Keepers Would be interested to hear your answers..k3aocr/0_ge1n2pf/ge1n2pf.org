Like for many in the fandom, the [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Draco_Trilogy][Draco Trilogy]] by Cassandra Claire was my first introduction back in 2001-2002. Was totally blown away by the insane quality and crativity of a fan written novel.

I don't go out of my way to tell people that I read fanfiction, but my partners over the years have always been aware. Same for my friends.
