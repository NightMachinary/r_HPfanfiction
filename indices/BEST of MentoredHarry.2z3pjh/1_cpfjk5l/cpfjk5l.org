I read a really good story based around the concept, it is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave behind]]. The story is still early on in its development yet all the concepts are believable and it gets me to care about the characters witch i find that may story's in this theme.

As stated there are several main divergences from cannon that have interesting consequences, that include;

1)Ariana survived the Grindelwald/Albus/Aberforth duel, and thus the history of Grindelwald's rise and fall is significantly different than canon.

2) Harry was born exactly one year earlier, and is thus one year ahead of his canon self - he's in the same year as Cho Chang and Katie Bell.

3) Sirius Black's trip to Azkaban was much shorter, as detailed in the prologue.

And all this is explored in exquisite detail it is also a Harry/Fleur story, but there is very little interaction so far and seems to be well paced and not an overriding theme in this story so far.

Overall the story is amazing so far and i would highly recommend it to anyone even if you are sick of these cliche's give this story a chance. the first chapter is a bit jarring but once you get past that it is just high quality writing from their on in.
