I am not a huge fan of Mentor!Dumbledore. Not enough conflict between Mentor and Mentee for my tastes. Mentor!Voldemort on the other hand........\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] : An AU in which Voldemort wins the first war. Amazing worldbuilding and characterizations. It has its flaws -- the work is unbetaed and the author keeps on adding subplots and extra characters that gets hard to keep to track of, but in the end its still one of the greatest pieces of fanfiction there is. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]] : Pettigrew kidnaps Harry instead of leading Voldemort to the Potters. Voldemort raises Harry as his Dark Prince. Probably showing its age by now, but I loved it when I read it the first time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9702269/1/Do-Androids-Dream-of-Electric-Sheep][Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10170838/1/The-Counterfeit-Cousin][The Counterfeit Cousin]] both have mentor!Tom Riddle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] has an OC necromancer mentor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/Escape-to-Darkness][Escape to Darkness]] has Grindelwald as Harry's Mentor. It is abandoned though.
