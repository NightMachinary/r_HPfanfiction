From what we've seen of it, the Unbreakable Vow involves a specific purpose with a finite time requirement. It also may require a lot of the promisee; Narcissa was willing to do anything for Snape to protect Draco, but her wording was sufficiently generalized that you'd think she was protecting herself by it. Perhaps a Vow that traps the promisor would reflect the punishment onto the promisee.

All of this is conjecture, but what we do know is that the Vow is sealed by the third party- someone trusted by both of the others to judge whether the Vow has been violated or fulfilled. Voldemort trusts NO ONE. This is the same reason he won't use a Fidelius Charm.
