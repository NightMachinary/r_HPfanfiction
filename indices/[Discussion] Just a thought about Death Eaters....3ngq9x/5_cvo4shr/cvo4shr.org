Unbreakable Vows are binding one's own magic to potentially work against them instead of helping them as it always does; basically the wizarding equivalent of installing a mini-bomb somewhere in your body that cannot be detected and explodes if you do /something/ out of line. Not a common thing and not really anything /anyone/ would agree to on purpose unless they were desperate.

Heck, even if you ignore the possibility of it possibly having a negative effect on one's body even without the whole “explodes and kills you” bit, and you have to admit that there is the possibility of it affecting one's magic negatively because it basically binds some of it to do /something/ that it was neither supposed to nor wants to do, having to make an Unbreakable Vow to prove one's loyalty is humiliating and degrading and I see pretty much every single Death Eater (outside of Bellatrix and others close to as fanatical as she is, and /their/ loyalty was never really in question) objecting very strongly on it and preferring to get crucioed rather than make one, not because they aren't loyal enough (or so they'd claim) but because of the degradation and humiliation and possibly the side-effects that they might know about but we don't. And I really doubt someone unwilling to make an Unbreakable Vow would even be able to make one; someone unknowing of it yet willing, sure, but not someone knowing and unwilling.

It's one of those things, just like veritaserum, that seems like a perfect solution to something in the series until you stop and actually think about it in-depth, which is when you discover that no, not really, it isn't and thought it has its uses ... maybe, it can't be used to solve everything. And before you ask, the problem with veritaserum is that it doesn't render you only capable of speaking the truth but instead makes it impossible for you to try to lie which means that if what you perceive as truth isn't actually true it won't stop you from speaking it out, and the other problem with veritaserum is it being an invasion of privacy that most people wouldn't agree to not because they “have something to hide” but rather because it's an invasion of privacy and a humiliating one at that and they have their pride.
