From what we have see unbreakable vows seems to be extremely rare and possibly dangerous. Despite what some fanfictions claim it's not a routine contract signature but an extreme measure. Remember Mr Weasley reaction to what the twins tried to do: "He went mental, only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum"

I doubt that even the most devout Death Eater would do it, even for the Dark Lord. For maybe it has lasting consequences on your health/psyche/soul. Also DE are all about loyalty and proving it, the only thing Voldemort would achieve by imposing it would be to show that he trust no one and that none is safe from his paranoia. Remember that Voldemort is all about PR and personal cult. The best dictator is the one love by his base.

It could be used to humiliate someone, sure. But as a security measure it's pointless, look at what he did with Wormtail and his magic hand: basically a PR move showing that he rewards loyalty.
