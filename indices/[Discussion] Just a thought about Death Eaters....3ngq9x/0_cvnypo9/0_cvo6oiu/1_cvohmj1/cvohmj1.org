I know the Rowling probably intended for that scene to convey that Pettigrew's disloyalty triggered the silver hand to kill him for it, but when I read it, I interpreted it as it being the life-debt in action.

Here was Peter, trying to /directly/ kill Harry, who he owed a life debt to, and the life-debt turned Peter's hand against him for it.
