But Wormy didn't know that (even if it was expected). My point was not that Voldemort was not assuring loyalty through magic, but that the unbreakable vow would have done way more harm than good (if any). By acting like he did with Pettigrew he send the message to all the Death Eater that even Wormtail, the lowest of them, was rewarded for his loyalty and somewhat trusted by him. An unbreakable vow would have send the opposite: "chop off your hand and get a deadly leash".
