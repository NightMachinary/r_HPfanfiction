Theres this brilliant fic where Harry gets a "domestic household spells" book and basically just turns them all into combat spells.

The slicing bread spell? Yep, just gonna slice up a person. Use the refilling charm on their lungs so they drown? A cleaning charm on their mouth so they suffocate and choke.

They go into how you really need to believe that that tree is a loaf of bread for it to work. So it takes a lot of effort and willpower and why it's difficult to do it in a battle but deadly if you can pull it off. Which Harry does at times to fucking deadly effects...

It's brilliant and very clever. linkao3(The Second String) if you're interested.
