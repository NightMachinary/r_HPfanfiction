My general response would be --> everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

You can try to Engorgio all you want, but it won't be as efficient as Expelliarmus, simply because you can't really practice Engorgio as well as you can Expelliarmus. You need to make sure you have a repeatable, reliable outcome.

Also: "Eat Slugs" --> which I realise now is a bit of a strange spell devoid of abhorrent dog latin. Is it just intent expressed in English resulting in the spell being cast? It resulted in the intended effect, in any case, just directed at the caster.

I'm starting to create a headcannon that all spells are incredibly dangerous and can all backfire spectacularly. The most dangerous wizard is the one who can reliably control the most powerful spells that would escape the control of more meagre wizards and consume them. No one wants to start a Wizards duel without rules because you'll end up hurting yourself more than others if you fail to apply your spell correctly (while under the stress of combat, and needing to defend yourself).

I wish more fics approached the "No magic in school corridors" with more severity. I.e. a stupid duel between two second years sees one of them in Saint Mungo's and the other is a hairs-breadth from being expelled. I want to see a fic where Harry engages in some Rocky Balboa style training montage but ends up nearly killing himself. Or perhaps the DA gets outed because kids keep getting injured in unexplained circumstances.
