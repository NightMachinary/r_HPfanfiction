One plot bunny in my head is that Ron has incredible magical skill and the first evidence of this is his being able to cast a powerful conjuration like that, without using the right words, with a broken wand and still making it last as long as it did...while he was a second year student.

By the time he faces Voldemort, he is capable of playing with magic like play-doh.
