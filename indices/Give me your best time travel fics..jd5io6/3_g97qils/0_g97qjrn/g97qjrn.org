  Hermione Granger thought that she could not possibly be surprised by anything anymore, but Theodore Nott arriving at the safe house with a perilous, last-ditch solution to the nearly-lost war against Voldemort isn't even the most unbelievable thing. The most unbelievable thing is that Theo is supposed to be dead. **The Order is losing the War. Most are dead and the ones remaining are sure to follow. Theodore Nott has a solution. Give up everything to win it all back. It's simply not the Slytherin way to run head-first at a problem, and Hermione is ready to try anything. His solution? A bit more cunning. It's one thing to run straight at the King and hope for the best, but perhaps the solution is to get rid of the pawns- one by one- first.
