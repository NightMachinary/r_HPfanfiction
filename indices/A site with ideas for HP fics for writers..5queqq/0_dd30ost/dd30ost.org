I'm not sure about a site - sporadically there are H.A.W.T threads and threads for the adoption of plot bunnies on the sub.

Alternatively, check out the subs IRC there is a group of core users (about a dozen of us) lurking there who are willing to help out. Pop in and say Hi. It might look empty when you arrive as you won't see any conversation that takes place prior to your entry, so don't be alarmed.
