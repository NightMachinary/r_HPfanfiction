[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13693477/1/Star-Granger-season-1][Here]] is a WIP HP/SG-1 crossover where Hermione encounters a Goa'uld and can, subsequently, operate their technology. Starts serious but is becoming wonderfully crackish as the story progresses. Not to Spaceballs levels yet, but I could see it getting there...
