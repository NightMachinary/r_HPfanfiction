The human did not seem very impressed.

"Yes, buuuut - don't you refine fuel? And then sell it?"

"Yes, but-"

"Splendid! I'll take one full tank, please."

"That's not... ugh, fine. That'll be 20 iotas of metallic hydrogen."

"No problem. Here you go!"

The human waved his stick, and a glass vial floated from his belt. The alien inspected the container. Ran it through the scanner twice, and then sighed deeply.
