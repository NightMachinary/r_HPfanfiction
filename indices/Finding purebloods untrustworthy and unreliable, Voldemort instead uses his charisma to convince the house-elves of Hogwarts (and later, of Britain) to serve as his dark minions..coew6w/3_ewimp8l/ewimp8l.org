"My good elves, when I came to you, many thought me crazy... Even some who stands with us today. But these last twenty days have proven just what a small highly motivated group can do. I came to you with a vision, The Great Work!"

"THE GREAT WORK!" chanted out hundreds of squeaky reverent voices.

"Yes my elven friends, I said that together we would stride across the lands, and destroy the old word that was rotting before us, that a house with mouldering foundations was no house at all, that it needed to be torn down so that it might be rebuilt!"

"Now some might dare to call anyone of us '/bad elves/,'" a susurration of hisses and much ear pulling spread through the horde, "that we are destroyers, murders and thieves!" The crowd was truly agitated now.

"But the are blind. We are best elves! For now our Great Work begins. It stars now and never stops. Together we rebuild the world!"
