"LEAVE HIM! HE IS MINE!!"\\
The formerly-house-elves, now Death Elves, nodded and huddled together as Voldemort duelled with Harry Potter.\\
"Master Voldymorty wants to fight Harry alone but he is losing."\\
"Darky is having an idea! More than one Voldymorty can fight Harry! Remember with the diary that mean Harry destroyed?"\\
There was a chorus of mms and aahs.\\
"Wicky, if you go to the Mummy building and grab Time Turners, we'll have time. Fouler, go grab Master Voldymorty's soul thingies! Baddie, take Kruel and Kreature but not Kreacher, and go grab some humans to offer to Voldymorty!"

What seemed like seconds later, but thanks to a time turner was in fact several hours of concentrated effort by a large segment of Voldemort's elven army, /another/ Voldemort stepped up and casually started flinging curses at Harry's back.\\
And then another Voldemort, this one younger and looking more human, entered the fray, and then a third, whilst a fourth clone stood back and munched on some hot fish and chips he had somehow gotten.\\
/"What did you do?!"/ the first Voldemort hissed in between throwing curses at Harry.\\
Darky cheerfully answered, "Only Master Voldymorty can defeat Harry, so we got more Voldymortys!"

Surprisingly, this went extraordinarily well at first. The five Voldemorts (once a stray curse that destroyed the fifth one's chips enraged him enough to join the duel) easily defeated Harry Potter, mercilessly killing him, killing him again when the first time didn't stick, tried transfiguring him into a frog when the second time didn't stick, before eventually giving up and having an elf pop him to who-knows-where in the Atlantic Ocean.

However, things soon fell apart after that, as no Voldemort could agree on whom should lead. The non-horcrux one felt he was the most mature and experienced, the Diadem-Voldemort questioned the real Voldemort's sanity and felt it was the next best one, the Locket-Voldemort felt that he had much more charisma than the snake-faces, and so forth.\\
Eventually, it escalated into a duel as each of the Voldemorts tried to dispose of their usurpers the hard way, and the Death Elves, sworn to serve Voldemort, had no choice but to try and keep each Voldemort from killing each other until they could reconcile...
