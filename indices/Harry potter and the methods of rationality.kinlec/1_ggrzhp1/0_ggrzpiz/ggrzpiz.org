I did find the smugness annoying. But if you can get past that is is quite a good read. Cause the author also believes anyone who reads it can guess at there points and while I wasn't trying very much I did get a gut feeling at times what would happen. So I highly recvomend finishing it, cause the ending is worth it, and I honestly believe the smugness was unintentionally done.
