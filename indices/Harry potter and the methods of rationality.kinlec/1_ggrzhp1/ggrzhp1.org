HPMOR was the first fanfic I ever read. I remember enjoying the first few chapters a lot, but apparently not enough to keep reading.

A few years later, I picked it back up on the recommendation of a friend. I got through another decent chunk of it, but I eventually gave up on it because it felt like the story's real purpose was for the author to smugly wank off on how smart he thought he was.

HPMOR is one of those really polarizing fics. I know a lot of people love it, and good for them. But a lot of people also find it unbearable.
