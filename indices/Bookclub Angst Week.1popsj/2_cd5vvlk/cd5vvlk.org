I read the whole story over a few days. I had to stop every now and then because it was so very, very, depressing. But so well written I needed to have closure.

I loved golem Harry and his characterization. I felt bad for him, having such a crappy life, only to realize you're not even human after all. What's the point. The other characters' reaction to him being a golem felt right too. It's not surprising that Hermione, Ginny and Dumbledore would support him. Just as it's not surprising that Ron would ditch him once more.

I didn't care for the Potter family though, they were all a bit too perfect. Living as they did in Avalon, I expected them to be a bit crazy.

And the ending... omg, that ending. I think I died a little inside, so I pretend it never happened and invent myself a happy life for Garry and his true friends.

Great story, I'm glad it was picked, and I'd totally recommend it, with a warning to bring tissues.
