I've read it, plus the alternate endings, a while ago so my memory of it is a bit hazy.

It was definitely a well-written story, and I think it showed the despair and hopelessness that Harry was feeling really well. I wanted to see Harry carve a place out for himself in the world, so the ending was a bit disappointing. But at least he went out on his own terms, and will be remembered fondly by (some) of the people that were closest to him.

Also, I wanted to see some Harry/Chloris because +I'm a dirty pevert+ it would have been awesome.
