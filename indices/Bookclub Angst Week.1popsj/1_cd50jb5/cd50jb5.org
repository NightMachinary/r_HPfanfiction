The worst thing with this story in my opinion was its ending.

I wouldn't mind the main character dying if it was done well enough. But here, it seemed like the author was just throwing everything towards it only for the sake of making one of his Awesome Ending Twists that he seemed to be rather proud of.

Aside from that, the story was quite good. Especially so because the notion of inherent potential conflict between one's true self and the perceived identity by others is interesting to me.
