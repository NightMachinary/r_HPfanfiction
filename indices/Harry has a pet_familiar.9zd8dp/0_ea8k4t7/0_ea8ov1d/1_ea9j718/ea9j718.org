But with that said, one thing a lot of fanfics do (something I think fanon almost always does better than canon, actually) is to treat Hedwig as a familiar -- it's /common/ for fanfics to have Harry talk with Hedwig and have her understand what he's saying in her own way. This doesn't happen (much) in canon. This is also something that seems to be specific to that particular bond -- I can't really think of any fics where /others/ talk to their owls or similar.
