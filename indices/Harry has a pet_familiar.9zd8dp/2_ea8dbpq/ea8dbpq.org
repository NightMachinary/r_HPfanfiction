oh and serpent tongue is pretty good. it features harry the summer before 5th year meeting a kinda rude snake in the garden. after it bites Dudley in defence of harry, he decides to bolt rather than deal w his aunt & uncle's reactions. it's not massively bleak and isn't edgy, which I appreciated. It's mostly about harry trying to deal w and heal from the events of gof while starting to bond w the snake while they both try and evade the people looking for them throughout London. linkao3(7103419)
