I was going to post this exact question today! I'd read tales where in medieval times, a witches' familiar was supposed to help in her spells, and in D&D, a wizard's familiar, you can have an empathetic bond and eventually scry on the familiars presence. And didn't Lavender Brown have a pet rabbit in the books she was worried about, but the rabbit was at home and not at school? (or maybe that was a fanfic I read a very very long time ago...) Anyway, to me that says there is a difference in pets and familiars as to which is allowed to bring to boarding school.

​

Owls, I understand; owl post. But that's all: besides Snape threatening Neville with feeding a bad potion to his toad, Trevor, if he messes up in class, there is no mention of WHY the school allows these animals in at all! Sounds like a headache on top of trying to wrangle students for teachers already overnight-babysitting for a year.

​

Hermione's Crookshanks' was supposedly helping Sirius in 3rd year, but that turns out all right in the end because he turned out to be Harry's DogFather. Sirius noted that, I think, at the end of the book in the Shrieking Shack scene. And, there's Mrs. Norris, a Squib's familiar? who helps to patrol the halls for Filch.

​

But: TLDR: yeah, would love to see more interpretations on the purpose and usefulness of the familiars in this magic world.
