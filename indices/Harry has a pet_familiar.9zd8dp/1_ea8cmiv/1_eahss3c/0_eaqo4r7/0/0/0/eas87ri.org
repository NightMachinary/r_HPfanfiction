No, it's bad writing. If you have established characters, you use them in New and interesting ways, and see how they react.

Having almost every male character be gay is stupid, unrealistic and boring. Unless you are into shitty storytelling.

You don't get to call me homophobic because I don't want to read about a gay relationship that makes no sense.

How about Remus? What the hell happened to him? And how is Harry gay? He is 12 when this becomes a thing.

I asked one of my friends who happened to be gay, and he said that he knew that he was gay when he was 15.

Also someone coming from an abusive household like Harry is in no place to even begin to be in a place to discover that kind of relationship.

So, no I'm not homophobic, just realistic
