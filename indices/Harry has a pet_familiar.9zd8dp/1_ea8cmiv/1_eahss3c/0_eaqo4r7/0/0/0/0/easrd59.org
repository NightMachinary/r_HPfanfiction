a little boy who talks to snakes going to wizard school to learn magic is perfectly reasonable, but multiple gay people existing within proximity to one another is 'bad writing' and unrealistic? not to shock you, but one of those happens in real life, and the other doesn't. the fact that you cry about it being unrealistic shows you're very ignorant and - wait for it - homophobic. people dancing around trying to make excuses for why they dont want to read about gay people are so boring. call a spade a spade. no one's buying it.

gay 12 year olds exist. gay babies exist bc being gay is an internal part of a person. it doesn't just suddenly 'happen' to you. unless you're screaming in rage at fics which have a 12 year old harry (surrounded by straight people) having an innocent crush on a girl as children do bc you think its 'sexual' and inappropriate, don't pretend there's any other reason for you to be mad than that it's gay people.

once again, its literally fanfiction. i doubt you sit and spam alternate dimension fics screaming about them being 'unrealistic'. get a grip
