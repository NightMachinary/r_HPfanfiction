So someone else mentioned deprived but I wanted to second that as well as add linkffn(the thief of hogwarts), and also mention this story that was recommended to me a little while ago when I requested Harry/Katie Bell, I believe it was linkffn(Harry potter and the unlocked knowledge) it was really cool but it ended at kind of a cliffhanger chapter and then nothing.
