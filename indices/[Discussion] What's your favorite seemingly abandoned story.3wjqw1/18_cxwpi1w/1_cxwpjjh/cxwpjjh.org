[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/][*/Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/980211/enembee][/enembee/]]

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
