  NMB started a sequel to Forests, titled "The Vaults of Valbone".

Very interesting. I looked that up and apparently he's also writing "The Luminaries" which is a rewrite of By the Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song, plus book three? All very exciting. My guess would be that he's taking the published author approach of writing the entire story before publishing it, which is fair since he IS a published author.

Thank you for telling me this. I had no idea.
