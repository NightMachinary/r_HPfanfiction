It's gotta be linkffn(In Atlantean Caves by obstacle1). It's not the best written story there is and it's not without flaws, but let me tell you, I discovered it near enough two years ago and it was essentially the spark that made me want to write my own stories.

I would also submit linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee), both amazing completed fics, for which a third installment was never made. Also by enembee, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ« by enembee), although it's only missing an epilogue.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time by joe6991), sequel to the infinitely weird and outlandish linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991), is also incomplete, though I count this as not so much of a bummer since I haven't actually read either of them, though I've heard good things about Wastelands and I liked the first couple chapters.

That's really it. Lots of great stories that were never completed...
