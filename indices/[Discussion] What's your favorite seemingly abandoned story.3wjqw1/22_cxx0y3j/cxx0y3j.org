I was gonna say HP & The Temporal Beacon but someone beat me to it so I'll just add these: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 by Sir Poley). This last updated at the end of February which doesn't necessarily mean it's abandoned but it just feels like it's been /forever/. And linkffn(A Saving People Thing by Aeshan). I'm a big Harry/Tonks fan and this was off to a good start.
