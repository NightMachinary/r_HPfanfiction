The premise of the fic was very unique and seriously well written. Long story short: Harry falls into a magical mirror. To him it seems like nothing happened and he lives his life. To everyone else he was sucked in and then spat back out. So this Harry that was spat back out has lived another ~20 years in an alternate universe but is now trapped in his "former" 15 year old body.

It was so amazing and guh. It still makes me sad it's incomplete. It got /maybe/ halfway through and then just stopped. So there's no ending to a fantastic story.

Warning: it is Snarry but if you're OK reading an incomplete fic I'd still recommend it even if you're not into slash. Just skim over those bits. The overall story is 100% worth it. Just be prepared for a crushing sense of incompleteness at the end.
