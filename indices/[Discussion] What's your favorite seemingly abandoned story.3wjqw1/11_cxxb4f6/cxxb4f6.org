The Resonance series by greengecko. I /think/ it's the only abandoned story I ever knowingly recommend here, I truly love it. Some of the ideas may not hold up over time, and it may be longer than it needs to be, but the overall story and journey and bounty of ideas? *Love*.

The first two stories are complete, the third and final didn't get finished, and I think there are an additional few chapters or so on the authors blog that didn't make it to FFN. It was winding down though, so you're not left completely hanging.
