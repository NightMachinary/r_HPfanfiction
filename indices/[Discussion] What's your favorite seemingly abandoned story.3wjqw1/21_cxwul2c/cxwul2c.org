Bonds of Blood and Magic: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050]]

H/G, DH rewrite, strong, but impeded Harry. I like the writing style (it's actually good!) and the pacing of the story. Last updated in may, I know nothing about the writer :(

linkffn(Harry Potter and Fate's Debt by Intromit)

Pretty much the ultimate H/G soul-bond story. Just when it gets interesting, it stops.
