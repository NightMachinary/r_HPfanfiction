I have quite a list. I didn't realize I had so many until I checked my favorites and wrote it all down. Shouldn't have surprised me though--most fics never get finished, sadly.

linkffn(A Study in Magic: The Application by Books of Change; Travel Secrets: Third by E4mj; The Serpent and the Crown by The Great Pumpkin; Stunning Shifts by mindcandy; No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim by Eternal Payne; Harry Potter and the Arcana by the Imagnizier; Resolution by GreenGecko; Harry Potter and the World that Waits by dellacouer)

Still hoping this one's kicking since it's so long that it seems a shame/unlikely (hopefully) that she would abandon it. linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama)
