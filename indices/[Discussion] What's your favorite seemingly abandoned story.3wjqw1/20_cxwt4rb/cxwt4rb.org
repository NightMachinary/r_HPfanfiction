Life Happens was my guilty pleasure fic that was abandoned a while back the author is still around on tumblr and whatnot but I don't think she had any desire to continue it.

I started it a few years after it started and stuck through the slow uploads and high school me really loved it so reading it now brings a nice wave of nostalgia. And at least they actually got together so there is that
