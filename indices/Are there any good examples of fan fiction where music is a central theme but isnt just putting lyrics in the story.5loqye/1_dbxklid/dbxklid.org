Music is a big part of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3634826/1/Volunteers][Volunteers and the sequel Ember to Ember]]. In this fic Harry's son (written pre-DH so no canon kids) is a music prodigy and Draco is a music teacher and choir director. Music is a large part of the story but doesn't drive the plot. It's really well done and a great fic. Linkffn(3634826)
