I'm not sure if there's much of anything, fanfiction or not, with music as a central /theme./ As a central element, yes, but as a theme, I'm not really aware of anything off the top of my head where the narrative was aimed at saying something about music, rather than using musical elements in the story to convey the themes of the story.

From the way you described your story idea, it seems you're after fanfiction that utilizes music as a central element, not theme, as such. One story off the top of my head that seemed to do so decently is Krahae's /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536939/1/Ganymede-Rising][Ganymede Rising]]/ | linkffn(5536939).

As the description suggests, it's a take on the indy!Harry genre of sorts, but Harry doesn't go out shopping at Diagon or meeting up with goblins or sticking it to Dumbledore or anything like that. Outwardly, a summer romance story between Harry and an OC who is a beginning and unsure musician. Intended to be a twoshot / threeshot, but the lone chapter that exists is fairly complete as it is, in terms of the narrative arc traced out by the story. Worth a read I think.
