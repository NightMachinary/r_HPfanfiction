If you do Slytherin, please please avoid the common tropes. So no eleven year old politicians, or schemes, or quirky, smirky, sneery scoffs. Suffice it to say that "cunning and ambition" doesn't equal being a snob or even stunting your emotions to a nonexistent level.

Cunning means just that. You need to think quick, be witty, and always see the best way out of a situation. It doesn't mean you shouldn't get into those situations in the first place! All it means is that you can, for instance, leverage some meatshield friends to check out the forbidden corridor with. Preferrably slower than you, of course.

Ambition, likewise, means just that. An ambition for something. It does not have to be political, or even monetary - it could be an ambition to be the most powerful of them all, or the smartest or just the best. It could be to open a coffee shop, and having the drive to achieve that.

For example, if you do a canon divergence where Harry doesn't say "not slytherin", then don't suddenly turn him into a tightly controlled caricature. I've yet to see a truly plausible slytherin!harry persona.
