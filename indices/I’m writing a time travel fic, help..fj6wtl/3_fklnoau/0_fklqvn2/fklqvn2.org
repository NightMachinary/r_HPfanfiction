I think it's hard to write a Slytherin!Harry in general - and the problem is canon!Slytherin, actually. Most of us who read fanfic are adults, and we criticize authors who write preteens as being super smart or political, but that's kind of what Slytherin /should/ be and isn't because really, how many in Harry's year are *actually* cunning or ambitious or clever? None of them deserve those accolades. And if someone wrote an 11-year-old Harry being /suuuuuuppper/ clever or cunning, it would feel weird...

Ambition is great though - a truly ambitious Harry would be lovely to see in fanfic...
