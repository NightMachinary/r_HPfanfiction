I agree with both points, I have decided on keeping him in Gryffindor, but i'm most definitely going to write a Slytherin!Harry fic in the future.

Slytherin!Harry is a trope that I love, except for the stupid tropes, I especially hate the ones where they make an 11 year old Harry be more powerful than a fully grown Voldemort, it's impractical and there is absolutely no character development.
