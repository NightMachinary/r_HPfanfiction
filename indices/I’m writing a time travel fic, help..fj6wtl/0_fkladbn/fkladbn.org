It depends on Harry's goals and motivations.

A Harry who time travelled somewhat recklessly, without much of a plan, but only a desire to "do better this time", who wants to keep his old connections, or who may be uncomfortable with sleeping in the same room as several children of Death Eaters and possible future Death Eaters would lean strongly towards Gryffindor.

A Harry who has lots of things planned out, who wants to change the future by befriending Slytherins and changing their paths or who does not mind manipulating everybody for a better world may skew towards Slytherin.
