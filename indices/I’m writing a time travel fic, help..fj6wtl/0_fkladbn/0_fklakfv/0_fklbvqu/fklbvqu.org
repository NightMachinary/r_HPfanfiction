Well, the talks about Slytherin that influence Harry's decision happen /before/ the sorting. So, you have to think about how Draco's changed behaviour may have influenced those talks and if that could lead to Harry's "not Slythetin" wish to the hat.

Also, while the hat considered Slytherin for Harry, would it be what he'd choose for "mostly canon Harry"? honestly, the hat only mentioned Slytherin to Harry as soon aa the kid thought "not Slytherin". Only then he said that that house could make him great...
