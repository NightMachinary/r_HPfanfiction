really, you wouldn't even need to change how Draco/Ron/Hagrid act- just have Harry visit Diagon Alley at a different day/time so he doesn't meet Draco, accompanied by someone other than Hagrid, and then have him join a full compartment on the train or otherwise end up in a position where Ron doesn't sit with him.
