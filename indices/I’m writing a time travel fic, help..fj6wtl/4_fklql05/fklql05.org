In canon, the only reason Harry didn't go to Slytherin was 1) he met Malfoy at Diagon Alley and he reminded him too much of Dudley; and 2) Ron and Hagrid - his first two friends - told him Slytherin was evil.

If you remove those components in your time travel fic - Draco being nice at Madam Malkins - would be enough to put doubt on Harry even if Ron sat with him. If Draco did a better impression on the train, Harry would likely go to Slytherin.

I have a(n incomplete) time-travel Draco, and despite him in Slytherin and Harry in Gryffindor - Draco's canon dialogue is strangely geared to be helpful toward Harry at times if you change the tone.

That said, really decide on Draco's goals. I always find Draco in Gryffindor a much more interesting idea, since it parallels Sirius' story but with parents who actually care about him and have to reconcile what they care more about: Voldemort's ideologies or their family. Also, Ron and Draco in the same house? Draco and Neville and Hermione in the same house? What about Draco's childhood friends in Theo, Pansy, Greg, and Vincent? How would they take it? There's so much to work with there - as opposed to another Harry in Slytherin story!
