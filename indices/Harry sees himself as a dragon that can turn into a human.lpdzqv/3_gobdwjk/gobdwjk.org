There's an abandoned short story that I think is the one you are looking for called The Dragon and the Sleeping Beauty by insanulux where Harry turns into a dragon, takes over an island that the creatures on it had taken it from the Goblins. Dumbledore had lost Harry years earlier and found where he was at when his Hogwarts letter was created.
