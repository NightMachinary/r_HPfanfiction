If playing up her snottiness and elitist personality can be considered bashing, then a fic like Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution is Hermione bashing. She's snotty, elitist and unlikeable, but it's presented as if those are good things, because it's Hermione and fits the muggleborn supremacy theme. Which, really, is doubly tragic and doubly hilarious.
