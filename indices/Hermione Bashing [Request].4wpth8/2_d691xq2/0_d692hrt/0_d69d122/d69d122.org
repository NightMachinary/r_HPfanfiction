The /idea/ of a strong leader has little to do with the fact that Hermione in that fic is snotty, elitist and unlikeable. If that was what Starfox was aiming for, the execution was bad.

I have nothing against a good revenge story, but the way Hermione goes about it is just cartoonishly ridiculous. It's absolutely possible to write about a cruel, elitist leader and make it good (good doesn't mean making the character likeable, mind).

Also, the entire victim vs perpetrator is a fairly baseless argument when it comes to that fic. The revolution starts right away, Hermione wasn't given an opportunity to be a victim. She cries rape literally from the first paragraph.
