Really? I thought she felt more like Octavian or Oliver Cromwell in that story, two highly respected leaders in history. Some of you people have a problem distinguish between perpetrators and victims, whenever victims fight back hard, you lot seem to find every reason to blame them, while trying to find every excuse for perpetrators.

Of course, she's not a likable or sympathetic character in that fic, because strong political leaders can never be.
