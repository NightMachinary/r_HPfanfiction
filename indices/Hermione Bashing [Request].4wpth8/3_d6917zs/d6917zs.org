Well, maybe linkffn(The Book of Dobby Reboot: Per Arcana ad Astra) qualifies? Not really bashing at all, but from Chapter 1:

  But Hermione wasn't in the mood to listen. She didn't have a whole lot of flaws, but her worst was that she was, frankly, an intellectual snob.

  "You really don't know what you're talking about, Dobby." She said.

  Dobby looked extremely put out.

  "Miss Grangy Ma'am is being rude!" He complained. "Dobby is being a house elf and Miss Grangy Ma'am is being a Bigger so how is Dobby not knows more about what it is being like to be being house elfses?"

  "Sometimes the truth isn't good manners, Dobby." Hermione told him. "The truth is, you're an escaped slave, and all of your people are slaves."

If you want some Hermione snobbery without actual bashing, that might do. It's also incomplete, and by far one of the oddest crackfics you'll ever read.
