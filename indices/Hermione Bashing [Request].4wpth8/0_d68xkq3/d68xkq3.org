Snotty? Yes. Elitist? Since when has Hermione been elitist?

In any case, I remember A Cadmean Victory, linkffn(11446957), plays up her pettiness and arrogance, while also significantly downplaying her positive personality traits, like canon Hermione's sense of loyalty and justice. That being said, there are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3hpf6o/a_cadmean_victory_by_darknessenthroned_gof_au/cu9cm0v][a lot of flaws with this fic]], even if you like Hermione bashing, so YMMV.
