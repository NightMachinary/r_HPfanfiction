I would call it "elitism" or "snobbery" if you try to impose your morals and world-view on other people/beings!

Not really - crushes should deflate in seconds (and vanish shortly afterwards) if you get to know the object of your desire and it's glaringly obvious that the object of your desires is a FRAUD! (come on we know Lockhart was a fraud at the very latest after his first lesson and we have Harry's POV and Harry isn't the sharpest tool in the shed - you could even argue that he's a rather dense idiot!)
