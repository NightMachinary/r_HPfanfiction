My interpretation would be that an alternate universe fic would be Harry moving to New York to fight with the Avengers or being adopted as an infant by Sirius and moving to Australia. Regular fics within the canon universe where Harry has blue hair or dates Susan instead of Ginny, or those that take place after the books end but don't change the previous story as told by JK, don't diverge enough from the canon universe to be 'AU'.
