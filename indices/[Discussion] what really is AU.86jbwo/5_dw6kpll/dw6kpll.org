AU to me usually means what it says, alternate universe. Like instead of Harry Potter universe it's actually in Narnia or California. I think the exceptions to that are different time periods (like the English wizarding world but Victorian) or where they're all muggles (since that's also technically another universe). Little altered details aren't really AU. Sometimes I see stuff like Professor!Harry AU but I don't really consider that an AU since it's plausible that could happen in the HPU (and arguably should have happened? But that's a convo for another time...).

Soooo no. Tl;Dr I don't think blue hair is AU.
