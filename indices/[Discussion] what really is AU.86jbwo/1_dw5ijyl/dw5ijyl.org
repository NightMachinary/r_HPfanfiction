Well, fanfiction is not canon but some stories try harder than others to stick to canon elements. It's useful to distinguish stories that are more different than others. You could call all fanfics AUs but it's more useful to describe stories that are only loosely related to canon as AU.

Even so, the term isn't always the clearest. You'll have some stories that claim things like canon-compliant up to book 4 and AU from then onwards - some people will take that to mean it diverges wildly while others will still accept a more subtle divergence.

Then there are other stories which will have (mostly) canon Harry accidentally travel to a world that is similar to his world but different, these dimension travelling stories give a different meaning to an AU again.
