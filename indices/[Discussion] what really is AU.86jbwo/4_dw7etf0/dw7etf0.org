AU is to be distinguished from a canon divergence.

Divergence: backstory is canon, events change after the fic begins. E.g. a 5th year divergence means that the story continues on from PS, CoS, PoA and GoF. The set-up of the world is the same, it's just that events diverge at some point.

AU: backstory is non-canon. The set-up of the universe is different from before the start of the fic.

This may sound like an arbitrary distinction, but it actually makes a huge difference to both reader and writer. When you are writing an AU, you have to explain a lot of things to the reader because they cannot assume their knowledge of the universe from canon. It bears more similarity to original fiction than other fanfic does, because you're having to do your own worldbuilding etc.

On the other hand, when writing a canon divergence, you can write as if you were JKR writing a later instalment of the series, with the reader able to assume everything up to your point of divergence.
