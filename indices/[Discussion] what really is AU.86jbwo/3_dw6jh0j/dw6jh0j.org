AU, for me at least, usually means the story is radically different then the books.. Eg. Crossovers, major deviances like gender flipping, change of house and the like.. as opposed to Harry starts dating Hermione instead of Cho/Ginny but still has to deal with canon stuff, like the GoF and TriWiz, Fudge's incompetence and Umbridge's presence at Hogwarts
