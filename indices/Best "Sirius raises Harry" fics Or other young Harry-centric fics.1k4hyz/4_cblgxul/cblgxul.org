A Life More Ordinary by obsidianembrace is very good. Note that it is not the same one one as lazyass123 recommended, they just have the same name. This one starts with a very young Harry, and shows Sirius and Remus gay together and raising Harry. It's very human, with all the characters being appropriately scared and regretful over the past. A very good story in my opinion.

Another Prisoner, Another Professor by Maurauder is also very good. It's a rewrite of the third book, with Sirius as the DADA teacher and Lupin as the escaped prisoner. Is has a different mystery than PoA too, with Lupin trying to prove his innocence through Regulus, not Pettigrew. Note that while timeline wise it diverts before Harry is even born, it doesn't really contradict the first two books. Harry is still raised by the dursleys and all the events of the first two books still happened.

Divergence by ness frost is also very good. It diverges from PoA at the end, with Pettigrew not escaping and Sirius being declared innocent. It showcases how hard it is just to start a family from scratch, and also features manipulations from the ministry that end up being a major road block for their relationship. How he writes fifth year in particular is great, since he deviates from the formula early and thus we end with a very different ministry attempt to silence Harry's cries of Voldemort being back.

Against the World by Balmorhea is also great. Sirius runs away with Harry the after his parents are killed, and he has to raise him on the run from the wizarding world.

Some one shots about Harry and Sirius also. None of these are disgustingly sappy, though some are so called family fics. Some are also incredibly dark.

Sticky situations by sailoranime just some small non-AU moments from the fifth book

Visions and Revisions by Chlorine Trifluoride. Depressing and utterly, utterly beautiful. The writing in this fic is breathtaking. It's a slightly AU fifth year, with all the major events still happening, but Harry and Sirius being sexually involved with each other. Very Dark, and very good. Lots of flashbacks and hallucinations about James and Lily and all that.

All these can be found on fanfiction.net. I would sincerely recommend giving all of these a read.
