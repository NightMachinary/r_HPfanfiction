- "Two escapees that the ministry would love to catch, kidnapping Harry Potter and hiding away out of sight. That, Moony, is the perfect way for us to raise Prongslet!" Sirius and Remus, running from the wizarding world, kidnap Harry and raise him in a house filled with love. How will this effect the Boy-who-Lived. How will their actions change the wizarding world?

Sirius and Remus raise Harry from age 4+, focuses more on the adults' development than Harry's

- AU Complete. Sirius is suffering in Azkaban with 4 yr. old Harry, but not for long. Harry needs to go to Hogwarts. What about the Dementors and house elves? What about Remus? Can certain secrets be kept? Can Harry be kept safe?

Odd one, Sirius raises Harry from within Azkaban.

- When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

I have not re-read this one in a while so I can't really remember everything. I think they leave England and try to make a new life for themselves but they are always forced to leave it behind and start again. eventually they are drawn back to England to fight in the war.

- What would life be like had Sirius been to fetch Wormtail on his way to Halloween at the Potters that night? A tale of how a life spent with his Godfather, and a life spent on the run from the law, affects the boy fated to change the world. Can the Wizarding world trust the boy who spent the last ten years on the run with Britain's most wanted criminal?

You don't hear too much about the pre-hogwarts era so this one may not interest you, focuses more on Harry's first year and his quest to get Sirius' freedom. It is on going and does not end when that task is completed.
