Just finished reading "The Wise One" trilogy. It was a pretty enjoyable series where the first story is mainly traveling the world, second story is 5th year and third is 6+7th. There were some nice twists from what happened in canon that kept things fresh and interesting both before Harry returns as well as after he arrives.
