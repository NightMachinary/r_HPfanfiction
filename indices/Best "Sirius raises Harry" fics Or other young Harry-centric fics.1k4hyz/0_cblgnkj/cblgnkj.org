I know you said no Severitus, but I'd submit that [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville is simply an outstanding bit of writing and in-character. McGonagall and Snape help Harry. 200k+ words, complete.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

There's a sequel that's 110k words and also complete.
