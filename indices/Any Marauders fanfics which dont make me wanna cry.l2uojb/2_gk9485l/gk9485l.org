Unfortunately canonical Marauders era stories are per definition tragic, because they end with the death of James and Lily.

To save them you have to go to AU:

- “A Better Man by Valandar” linkffn(2531438)
- “There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel” linkffn(13137899)

And we'll see how “Flowers by the Wayside by TalaRae” linkao3(23090008) ends.
