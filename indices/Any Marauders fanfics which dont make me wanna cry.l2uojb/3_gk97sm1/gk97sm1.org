I was reading All the Young Dudes and needed a break from all the death foreshadowing and despair...the same author who wrote that has another fic that I just started it's only 19 chapters it's a modern non magic AU which is not normally my thing but I love love love this so far. I'm 4 chapters in and I was told this is a happy ending. It's from Sirius POV. Sirius is a hairstylist and Remus is a bass player.

Linkao3(Dress up in You)

Also on tik tok ppl were recommending this fic to read if ATYD has just destroyed you. I haven't read it myself yet tho. Linkao3(Let Nothing You Dismay)
