That's kinda like saying that Gun Makers are responsible for school shootings. (BTW I *DO NOT* want to get political)

Unless you mean the student that made it(for OP example Ron) and accidentally drugged them both. Then you are completely right.

Please excuse any grammatical mistakes you might find, I'm sick and it kinda messes with my grammar.
