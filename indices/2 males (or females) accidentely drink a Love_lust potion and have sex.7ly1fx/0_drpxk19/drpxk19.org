Ah, yes. The rape/non-con hidden behind magic genre.

EDIT: To be clear, I have nothing against a non-con fetish, especially in fiction /writing/. No /real/ person is being hurt.

I just feel like we should call it what it is, lest we forget that forcing people to have sex via mind-altering substances are, well, rape.
