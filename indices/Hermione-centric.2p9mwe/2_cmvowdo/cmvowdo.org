There were two recent threads on the topic, to avoid rehashing:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2i1r8c/request_all_things_hermione_granger/]]
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/29uddz/hermiones_perspective/]]

Other than stories mentioned on those threads, there is a crossover, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/][Effloresco Secundus]], which has Hermione reincarnated as Sakura Haruno from /Naruto/.

An interesting new and frequently updating story is [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] by Diane Castle, which is a non-magic AU where +Hogwarts+ Harworts is basically a school for James Bond film characters. Don't let the lack of magic deter you.
