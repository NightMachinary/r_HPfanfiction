Seconding this. This is (in my opinion) lorien829's strongest story.

Some other ones worth reading:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] by Larry Huss.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/14/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Hermione Interlude]] by Perspicacity
- And, just to throw [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] for a (time)loop, I'll plug his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/7/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Witch Queen]] story here too. (While not to everyone's tastes, it's competent writing and though not Hermione's POV, it's nevertheless Hermione-centric.)
