Kicking Gotham - linkffn(13521865) - DC Comics crossover: An interesting story and its certainly well done.

Pack - linkffn(13391615) - Jurassic Park Crossover: Good story, I reccomend.

What's a Gungan? - linkffn(13569941) - Starwars Crossover: A story that is done well and I thought pretty unique.

Family - It's in the Blood - linkffn(13292346) - One of the more unique and interesting story idea I have come accross and one I enjoyed a lot.

Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - A story about Harry being into art. It's certainly unique.

The Assassin Wore White - linkffn(10071063) - An interesting take on the Healer's Oath.

Amicus Protectio Fortis - linkffn(11547735) - The only story I know like it, its well done and the only problem its incomplete.
