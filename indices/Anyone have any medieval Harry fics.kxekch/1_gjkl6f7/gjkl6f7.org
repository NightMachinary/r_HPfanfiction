A fair bit of linkffn(A Long Journey Home) is set in Arthurian times, with Jasmine Potter teaching Merlin and then avenging his death.

Note that it's technically unfinished, but it has an unusual structure that means it's never really incomplete. It starts by giving you the beginning and ending, then the rest of it is telling tales from along the way. So even if those tales are unfinished, the story as a whole is always complete.
