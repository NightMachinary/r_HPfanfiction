Do you have to have Harry there?

- “The Friar's Calling by Chthonia” linkao3(7460772) ... beautifully written story of The Fat Friar (and Sir Cadogan). You don't have Harry Potter, but you get the real historical figure, [[https://historyofphilosophy.net/grosseteste][Robert Grosseteste]].

- “Bloodstone by Northumbrian” linkao3(9445599) surprisingly for Northumbrian who otherwise writes rather realistic and down-to-earth stories (I have invented the term magicians realism exactly for him) wrote this historical story from the time of the unravelling of the Roman Empire and what was the true origin of Merlin. And it has surprising relationship to one of his next-gen stories.

- “[[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]]” is a story from really long time ago (yes, you will finally find out what happened 382 BC) about the origins of magic and wands. Slightly too long, but otherwise very well written.

- “[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil by celticbard]]” being a muggleborn is tough, but what about being the one in the Puritan New England exactly in time of Salem Witch Hunts?
