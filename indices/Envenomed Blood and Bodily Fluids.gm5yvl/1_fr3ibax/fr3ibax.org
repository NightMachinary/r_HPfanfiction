I never liked the case of them "cancelling" each other out. They are the extremes of light and dark, with magic involved them "cancelling out" would most likely be explosive or destructive. Nah, I like the thought that they are constantly circling each other, attracting and repelling. Like the Tai Chi symbol representing Ying and Yang.

I'm of the opinion that the fang went straight into the bone, into the marrow. The venom cleared out some marrow, and the tears replenished the marrow, sealing them both in. This causes his body to end up creating each of them.

Now he has context-sensitive bodily fluids. Is he surprised or pissed off? Venomous fluids. Concerned, love, etc? Healing fluids. Neutral? The fluid has both properties, keeping each other from working. This effect continues until they run out of energy and disspiate.
