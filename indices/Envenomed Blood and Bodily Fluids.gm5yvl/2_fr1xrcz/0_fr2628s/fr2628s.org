If ('cause dark magic being unpredictable) he/they can have kids, it could be unpredictable -- detrimental or beneficial.

Their kids could be as venomous, could have venom sacs in their mouths, could have the same colour-changing effect their parents have or just randomly shift between having green eyes, blue eyes and blond/blonde and black hair, like a limited metamorphmagus.

Possibilities are endless, really.

Nothing personal on Daphne. :)

She is a blank slate: while there's a common, fanon interpretation of her (blue eyed, blonde haired, for example), she could be a saint, a sinner, a mini-Death Eater or a "blood-traitor" outcast, green-eyed, hazel-eyed, a brunette or even a wizarding punkette with blue hair.

The most we know about her is that she's a Slytherin, in Harry's year, has a two-year younger sister called Astoria that married Malfoy, and IIRC hung around with Pansy's "gaggle of girls".

Her family is part of the "Sacred 28", IIRC.

Oh, and there's a blood-curse on their family which eventually kills Astoria, if Cursed Shite is taken as canon and not the worst of (canonized) fanfiction.net trash.

Now, extrapolating possibilities...

She might have the same views, or eventually come to have the same views, as her sister does, when she married Malfoy (apparently Astoria's views on muggles and muggleborns caused tension with Lucius and Narcissa).

She hung around with Pansy: she might be like her at that age, or just hang around the more popular girl/gravitate towards her, socially.

...I think that's it?
