You think it's believable a person sent to specifically follow Harry around for his safety couldn't see that Harry's demeanor and attire didn't fit with the suburban, middle class Dursleys? Edit: and Mrs. Figg was two streets away and routinely watched him. They allowed themselves to be talked down or outright ignored it.

And he wasn't punished for "endangering" Dudley, who had punched him in his ribs. He was punished for doing something he had no control over. And as no meals was used twice as a punishment I don't see why it's difficult to believe it was a routine thing.
