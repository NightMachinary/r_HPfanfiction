Firstly Diggle has no Idea about muggles, so he could easily miss the abuse, second we have no Idea that he followed Harry around.

And yes Figgs knew about the abuse, but how would that result in the Weasleys knowing.

Also Harry was totally punished for endangering Dudley, just because he did it accidentally doesn't mean he wasn't the cause, and again missing a meal occasionally doesn't make you underfed.
