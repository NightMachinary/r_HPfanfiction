He was smaller and thinner than he was supposed to be, which is a medical condition and therefore Harry was not healthy nor physically unharmed. Vernon hit Dudley in canon and Harry didn't bat an eye, which implies that physical violence wasn't uncommon. That definitely constitutes as physical harm, as does the Harry hunting. And Petunia's attempt to hit Harry with a frying pan could very well have lethal, hence the attempted manslaughter.
