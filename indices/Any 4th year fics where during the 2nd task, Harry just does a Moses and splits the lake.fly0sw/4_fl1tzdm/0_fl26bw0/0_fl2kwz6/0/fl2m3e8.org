Some knowledge of both is needed, but none of what is needed is in depth knowledge.

Some terms from the Nanoha side may confuse those unaware of the series or how they do things, but the two are actually close enough that you only really need to know the HP side outside of the series specific bits, like the Barrier Jackets and Devices from the Nanoha side.

Most of the Nanoha stuff is explained eventually, though this one puts the two on different levels of power. It's the later books in the series that you'd need a bit more crossover knowledge. Naruto in one. Slayers explains a bit in another, though the relevant points are explained.

If you need a basic primer, here it is:

This story essentially explains Nanoha-Style magic as High-Power Arithmancy Casting (Not exactly wrong, but an understatement), trading Versatility for Combat Power.

Devices, no matter the type, are Magical Foci, much like wands. That they are made of metal instead of wood is irrelevant. That some of them speak turns heads, but is otherwise ignored.

Most other points are explained as needed, aside from the Horcrux in the scar, taken care of by the Book of Darkness. Details are explained in story, and the Book of Darkness is actually a full story Arc in the Nanoha series.
