Well the fic made it clear pretty early on that Harry is not interested in Katie that way. The friendship between them i found fun. Personally i liked that it didn't follow the "You're female, we get along, lets be together forever and ever and make babies" trope.

Harry and Katie dated, didn't work out, Harry got involved with Fleur. There was angst in the story, but it wasn't really romance related.
