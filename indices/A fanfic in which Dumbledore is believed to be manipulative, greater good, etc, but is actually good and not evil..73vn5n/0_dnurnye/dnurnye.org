Just imagining Dumbledore wanting Harry to be more proactive and everything else he's tried hasn't worked.

"Ah, Rocktoe! I'm here to discuss the Potter trust. What I want to have happen is once a month to transfer 1000 galleons from that account into this one, and then transfer it all back into the original vault."

"Ron, I am glad to have caught you. I must ask that you spy on Harry for me." "Bleeding hell, Professor, What do you take me for, some slimey snake?" "Very well, you have refused and I accept that. 10 points to Gryffindor for protecting your friends secrets."

Months pass.

A very angry Harry Potter is glaring at Dumbledore from the other side of the desk. "Would you like a lemon sherbet, Harry?" "No! I don't want anything from you, you manipulative old geezer!" " Or maybe some orange juice? You're looking peaky. I know I get crabby when I haven't had enough sugar." "I want for you to give me my life back! I found out that you were taking money from my vault and you asked my friends to spy on me!"
