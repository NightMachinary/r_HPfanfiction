I've got a few.

*Avengers*: linkffn(8579890)

*Buffy the Vampire Slayer*: linkffn(11102515)

*Chronicles of Narnia*: linkffn(11500522) - incomplete but worth it.\\
Linkffn(10467443) - less words than you want, but complete and a good read.\\
Linkffn(7888194)

*Criminal Minds*: linkffn(6273862) + incomplete sequel

*Game of Thrones*: linkao3(13183980; 14889266) - this writer is awesome. They have a James/Hermione fic that I can't rec enough. I'm currently reading The Winter Witch, with the other fic on my to-read list. There are a few points where I have trouble with the GoT aspect, but that's easily remedied with a quick search, or I just wait a bit and it's explained.

*Lord of the Rings*: linkao3(7239202) - 73K words but worth it.

*Merlin*: linkffn(8260267) + sequel\\
Linkffn(8431028)

*Tudors*: linkffn(6560064)

Edit: finished adding fics
