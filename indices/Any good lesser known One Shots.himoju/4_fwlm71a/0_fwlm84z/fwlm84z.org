  “He was my childhood hero, didn't anyone think it strange that I fell in love with the same boy I wrote about in my diary for years before even meeting? Didn't anyone ask whether or not it was idol worship?” When Ginny goes to bed she's fifteen and her biggest concern is balancing quidditch and homework with enough time left over to snog her boyfriend. She wakes up in a home she has no memory of with a child she worries is being held hostage with her. The war is over. She's married to her brother's best friend. So why is it that everyone thinks she's crazy for being the one to question why everything feels a little too perfect?

  Between school, the war and its aftermath, Hermione hasn't had much time to connect with her family. A family wedding seemed a good of time as any to introduce her family to her boyfriend and her best friend. But when her parents invite her out for tea in the days that followed, Hermione is woefully unprepared for their opinions on who she's better suited for.

  Since Ron got a new owl, it's only fair that Ginny gets her own pet. She adopts a big black dog.
