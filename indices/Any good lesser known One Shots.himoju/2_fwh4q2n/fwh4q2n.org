[[https://kelsfics.livejournal.com/22545.html][Incarnation]] is one of my all-time favorite fics, one-shot or no. Published ages ago on Livejournal but it is amazing. Tom/Minerva, with Marlene McKinnon.

I also love [[http://lumos.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2598][The Two-Step of Death]], archived at the little-referenced Lumos site. Enjoy!
