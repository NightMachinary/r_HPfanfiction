It's great for me on Android. Open a story and go to the first chapter. You should see a pair of headphones in the top row of icons. If you don't see that row, scroll up and down a bit and it should reappear.

Once you see the headphone icon, tap and the app should start playing. You can change playback speed, voice type and so on in the settings - I usually have it speak at about 125% pace.

Sometimes the headphone icon is greyed out for no obvious reason. I find force-quitting the app and reloading fixes that most of the time.

I find the app is very prone to being swapped out when memory gets low, so don't try to run too many things at once while using it because it's *very* annoying.
