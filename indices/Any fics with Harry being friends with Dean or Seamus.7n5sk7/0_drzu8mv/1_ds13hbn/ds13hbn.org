Nothing wrong with Dean and Seamus being in a relationship, it's plausible. I like when Dean temporarily dates Luna but they both know it's not a forever thing, Dean works on magical portraits and Luna as a magizoologist. I can also see Seamus as a horrible flirt but as much as he flirts often and loudly, he prefers to be single because relationships are complicated and he just wants to enjoy the little things.
