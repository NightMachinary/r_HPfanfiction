So many possibilities! Many different ways it could go. I think there would be no break in to the school. Snape would probably kill Dumbledore on last day of school, in front of witnesses. Somewhere visible and where he can make his escape.

In my head I'd imagine that major, defining moments would still pan out in a similar fashion.

But it's an idea for a story, I'd be happy to see what someone might come up with!
