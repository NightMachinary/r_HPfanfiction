Yes, but killing Malfoy in a school might a bridge too far, even after the war. They have no real proof he was a death eater-Harry disposed of the body, it would have certainly rotted way to much to display any tattoo's- and he murdered him in a school. If that got out, he would likely face trial.

Would he get away with it? Maybe. Depends on a lot of factors that aren't certain any more with the amount of changes this would ripple.

Would he face trial for any of the other killings? Almost certainly not. Depending on how brutal/unnecessary they were, they might be used as circumstantial/character evidence in the trial for him killing Malfoy, but thats about it.
