I don't think he would get in any trouble for killing in the war.

Even before the fall of ministry, Order was killing Death Eaters. This is implied when Lupin chastises Harry for disarming in the Battle of 7 Potters instead of stunning and letting the death eaters plummet to their death.

He would probably keep the book too so as to not attract suspicion. He might actually kill Snape during the escape as Snape cannot read his mind and would be too surprised by Harry using Sceptemseptra to defend himself. That is assuming Snape killing Dumbledore happens close to canon. If death eaters invaded Hogwarts during this Harry would probably kill all of them as in canon he took down 4 out 6 non lethally.

So no ambush during extraction of Harry and they still have Mad Eye with them. The Order might actually be effective with Mad Eye and stop the takeover of Hogwarts and the Ministry with Harry putting down many Death Eaters. Rufus might actually give Harry the sword seeing as how he was such a effective and strong fight or when they realize they need Basilisk venom it would be a lot more accessible. No need for tenting in the middle of no where

Harry would not know he is Horcrux (or he might, he states in the movies that he has known for a while) so when he offs Voldemort everyone sees Voldemort's spirit escaping.

This would lead to a lot harsher treatment of death eaters and Hermione could actually push through some of her changes more easily with Harry's help.

Overall a lot fewer of Voldemort's supporters would be around and a lot more good guys will be there. Teddy would probably not become an orphan, Fred and Collin would probably would still be alive.

Overall it would be a better conclusion of the war.
