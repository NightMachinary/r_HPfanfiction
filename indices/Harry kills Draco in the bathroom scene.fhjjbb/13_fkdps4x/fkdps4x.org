He gets so good at the spell that he can cast it wandlessly and wordlessly.

He kills Voldy and claims his Parseltongue and followers through the Right of Conquest.

(He feels empty then. The Horcrux is gone and he misses it.

So, he goes back in time to join Voldemort and commit genocide. Or maybe he traps Voldemort's Spirit instead, forever keeping him safe and unable to return.)
