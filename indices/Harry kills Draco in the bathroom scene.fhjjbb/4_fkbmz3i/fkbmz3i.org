If someone other than Fudge was in office at time this happened Harry might get away without prison time, because Malfoy was casting the Cruciatus curse at him. The way the wizarding world is at the time Harry would end up in Azkaban so I think he did the right thing covering it up. The fact Harry got away with not killing in canon with an actual spell is bs and unrealistic. He killed Quirell at 11 but wouldn't kill at 15. Also there is a difference between murder and killing in a war.
