I tried looking on FFnet, but I could've *sworn* there was one, where Snape chases Harry out of the bathroom after he kills Draco, absolutely enraged, and Harry ends up in Flitwick's classroom where he's in the middle of an exam review or the like. Harry dives behind the professor, knowing he was a dueller when he was younger, and Flitwick - completely confused by not going to let Snape murder Harry (he does even begin saying "Avada--") duels Snape to keep Harry and the other students safe.

I honestly don't remember much more but I SWEAR I'm not making it up... I just can't find it. :/ IIRC, it was by a well-known author, in the early 2010s...?
