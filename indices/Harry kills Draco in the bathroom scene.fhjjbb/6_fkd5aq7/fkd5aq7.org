This arc would have been an enigmatic fiction story. Taking off and adding on from where you left off, we can be assured that Harry would have been mentally scarred after murdering Draco in cold blood and would have carried that secret with him with a heavy heart. This would have affected the Horcrux inside him, causing it to push Harry towards evil or immorality in his quest during HPATDH.

The whole of the seventh book would be completely different, with Harry taking all challenges head on, instead of a pragmatic approach. For example, Harry blasting his way through Gringotts, killing and maiming all around him, using Unforgivable Curses more openly. An interesting change in the arc would be Ron sticking with him through it all, while this time Hermione abandons them out of sheer disgust and mistrust.

Harry wrecking the Ministry of Magic, killing Umbridge and Yaxley, fighting all the same battles but in a more brutal manner, till he reaches Malfoy Manor, sees Narcissa and Lucius in a broken state: mourning for their missing son, and realizing that everything was his fault, opening up to them for the first time about Draco's death, asking for forgiveness and finally finding peace by owning up.

From here I would like the story to go in a different arc which is not just about defeating Voldemort, but a battle of good and evil within Harry himself (which is not merely the Horcrux). After killing Voldemort at Hogwarts, Harry would take over the Elder Wand as the rightful master and be at a crossroad: being good and vulnerable to emotions, or being evil but immensely powerful. That's where the love part of all his friends and family would play a role and show us that the reason Voldemort became what he was because he lacked pure love, thus engraving Rowling's deep driven message. (of course a lot can be added in between, feel free to add, delete, improve)
