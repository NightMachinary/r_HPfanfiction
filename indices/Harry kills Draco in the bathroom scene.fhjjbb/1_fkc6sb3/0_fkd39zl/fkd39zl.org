It is open to interpretation and woulds love to read what someone might imagine.

In my own head I'd see that major, defining events would still pan out in similar enough fashion. But it's just me not having enough imagination to go really wacky.

I think as long as Snape didn't knowingly neglect to protect Draco, he is fine. Timing when he has to kill Dumbledore is probably undefined. So as long as he doesn't actively sabotage that goal, he should be fine as well.

Also for a little while there would be uncertainty as to where Draco is. Is he alive, did he run away, did Voldemort recall him? Since there is no body, no evidence of his murder, it could easily take days, perhaps weeks to be certain of anything.

There would still be the question of the Eldar wand, if Snape does kill Dumbledore as mutually arranged, will he get the wand's loyalty? Harry could, perhaps during the battle, manage to disarm him so he can still face off Voldemort. Considering this Harry would certainly be stronger, more guarded than one in canon - I think he could be capable.

But then again, imaginative writer could take this premise and turn entire situation completely on its head. So many possibilities!
