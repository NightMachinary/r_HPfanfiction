The Elder Wand does make for interesting proposal, because assuming canon does proceed with few changes other than dead Draco and vicious Harry, then Snape will win the wand. Snape would then either have to lose to someone else in order to prevent it from falling into Voldemorts hands, or Voldemort would claim mastery when he kills Snape. Not good.

It's possible that Harry does catch Snape off guard with occlumency while Snape flees the castle and defeats and or kills him, making him the master of the wand. Vicious Harry would be more likely to insist on following the Hallows clues rather than the Horcrux clues and would possibly claim the wand before Voldemort.

If Snape dies to his Vow, Dumbledore will probably be panicking. If he dies to the withering curse, Voldemort gains mastery of the wand. If he dies to the potion or the inferi, Voldemort gains mastery of the wand. Honestly in that case if he was weaker ing without Snape, sure to die, and unsure that he could keep the wand from Voldemort he would probably have to tell Harry more. Not everything. But more. Enough to convince Harry to kill him out of mercy to end his suffering from the curse and potion and to keep the wand from Voldemort. Now that sounds like an interesting divergence to me. Harry enters the Hallows hunt having killed twice (not counting Quirrel, the basilisk, or diary tom) and holding all three Hallows.
