  Even with mastery of the Eldar wand, there is no way he could actually defeat Voldemort in a real duel

I mean, 40k Eldar tech is some pretty powerful shit, he probably could wreck a mon-keigh like voldy

But seriously ; The thing about having such vague and undefined "powerful" artifacts like the Elder wand is they are as powerful as necessary for the plot. It would not be against plot for the Wand to be enough. It would also not be against plot for it to not be enough.
