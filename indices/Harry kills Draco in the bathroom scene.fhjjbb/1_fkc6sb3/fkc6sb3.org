Interesting premise, with the big questions being how would Snape react and how would Harry react.

Honestly, on rereading the scene, all it would take for Draco to die would be the absence of Myrtle. Her screaming bloody murder was what brought Snape down on them, and Draco would have likely bled out in minutes or less given the sword like slashes all over his chest. Harry was frozen in shock and would have watched him die. Snape's nearly instantaneous arrival indicates that he was nearby, probably trying to watch over Draco according to his unbreakable vow.

Now, one of his vows was to protect Draco to the best of his ability. The question to ask is if the death of Draco would count as breaking the Vow, or if the Vow would consider Snape to have "protected him to the best of his ability" and allowed him to live.

If Snape lives, his vow will force him to kill Dumbledore, as vowed and as planned by Dumbledore. The question is in how much time he has before he is forced to take action, and if he would be able to hold off until the end of the year. Likely, after enough time had passed and/or spells cast to prove that Draco was dead, he would act and kill Dumbledore. There is no need for a break in, Snape could do it himself without issue, and the break in wasn't a requirement of Draco's task as evidenced by his other attempts. Though Snape might need to bring in witnesses to prove his loyalty to the Dark Lord. Most things would follow as you prompted. I'd imagine a rift between Harry and his friends though, as Hermione didn't approve of the Princes book and Harry could never tell that he had killed Draco.

​

More ripple effecting would be if Snape died for failing his vow. Without him to help slow the curse, Dumbledore would start deteriorating rapidly. I doubt that Albus would be able to convince anyone else to kill him. He'd have to rush with Harry to get the locket before he succumbed. I'd even imagine the possibility of him being too weak to survive the encounter, dying to save Harry. It would probably be preferable to the alternative of dying to the withering curse, which if it became public knowledge would clue Voldemort into the fact that Dumbledore had been after his Horcruxes. So either the Horcrux hunt goes far worse with Voldemort clued in, or Dumbledore dies in the cave with Harry, which would be hard to spin. No martyrs death, no symbol of resistance, just either a missing headmaster if he was pulled under by inferi, or another corpse brought back to Hogwarts by Harry Potter. Not good either way.

​

Without Snape, the rescue from Privet Drive would be done without Voldemort knowing before hand the date. Moody surviving as mentioned by others. Hogwarts however would be in the tender care of the Carrows, and that would not go well for the students.

​

All in all, darker futures for all if Harry kills Draco, though interesting to read I'm sure.
