Amid all the joy at the justice this new Gray!Harry is dispensing, don't forget that the other side has magic too and can adapt.

The Death Eater regime was self-assured, slow, bureaucratic. They would arrest known blood traitors and close associates of Harry Potter and then just let them go after a short interrogation. If a Muggleborn didn't resist, they would (in all evidence) contend themselves with just taking away their wand---and they don't appear to have pursued those who had gone into hiding very hard. They did nothing to secure the Ministry against infiltration. They allowed known close friends and associates of Harry Potter to continue attending Hogwarts, even allowing them to spread anti-Voldemort propaganda. They used someone's family as hostages exactly /once/ that we saw. Snatchers were downright lackadaisical. Voldemort wandered Europe looking for the Elder Wand, rather than hunting down the regime's enemies.

Now, suppose that Harry starts playing for keeps, so to speak. How quickly would these things change?

Semirelatedly, one day, I hope to write a fic that approaches the problem from a different direction: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/81txb3/discussion_never_written/dv5mx8i/][The Sequestration of Draco Malfoy, or "Why didn't JKR have Hermione help Harry investigate Draco in HBP?"]]
