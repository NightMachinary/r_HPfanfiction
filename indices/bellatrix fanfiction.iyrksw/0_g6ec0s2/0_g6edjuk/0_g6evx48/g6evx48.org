Hmm. Yeah, I think the essay the other person posted would be very much helpful here. That balance between 'madness' and affection would probably work quite well for that sort of story, and keeps it away from the 'soften the tsundere' cliche.

Also, on that note, if you respond to the bot, the person who posted the thing won't get notified of the message. You have to respond to the original comment for them to get an inbox notification.
