for the plot in mind i was thinking of a quiet but popular perhaps ravenclaw, believes in pureblood hierarchy to an extend, that is if i write teenager bellatrix. and they get assigned to a project together (basic but still useful for the plot) and eventually bellatrix takes a liking to her, very slowburn. then i have another idea of second war era bellatrix, once again thinking about the oc being a ravenclaw but rather opposite than bella in everything, the oc being soft and sympathy - obviously with the latter fanfic idea i have intends of making bellatrix being a profession at hogwarts to have everything to fall into place.
