I mean, you're right that it'd probably depend on what's best for your particular plot (or character relationship development/dynamic), but most of my favourite Bellatrixes have been one of two things.

The first, basically Fanon Cool!Guy Sirius, but with murder instead of pranks. A bit of swashbuckling swagger, a bit of hotheaded stupidity, and a plan to kill everything she encounters. Loves a good bar fight.

The second, is basically the Delenda Est Bellatrix. Cool, logical, a little mad, and not quite understanding how neurotypical folks work. Will approach every situation with the belief she can turn it to her advantage and at least a little idea of how she could do that.
