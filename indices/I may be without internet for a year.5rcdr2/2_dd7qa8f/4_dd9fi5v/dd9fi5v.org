Thanks, the first year or so will be tough, but once we are out from under this house things should be better. I have read "Seventh Horcrux" "Prince of Slytherin" and "On the Way to Greatness" but not the others. My laptop has a kindle app, one of the few things I like about windows 8. I have a bunch of "real book" files too. Even without the prospect of no internet, I feel like I should be saving fics again. It is so depressing to go looking for a favorite and see that the writer is MIA.
