Ok, seeing as no-one seems to be volunteering anything here goes:

The works of JBern, Shezza, nonjon, James Spookie, & kathryn518.

And linkffn(Whispers in the Night; The Art of Self-Fashioning; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches; Lesser Evils by Scott Press; Days to Come; Honour Thy Blood; Contractual Invalidation; Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path; Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly; Grow Young With Me; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; Muggle-Raised Champion; Seventh Horcrux; Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse; The Reluctant Champion; The Merging; The Pureblood Pretense; The Slytherin Subterfuge; The Ambiguous Artifice; On the Way to Greatness; Forging the Sword)

There are probably more if I could recall. I would seriously recommend getting a kindle though. I was in a similar situation a few years back and I downloaded a program that took website addresses of ffn.net stories and downloaded/converted the entire things to kindle format. Save them all in one folder, plug in kindle and copy/paste across and bam! hundreds of fics on a nice to read device and offline accessible (kindles have tons of storage space for books). Good luck with your move!
