I should have been more clear. I'm not sure that we will be able to budget it in because we will be paying the mortgage until the house here is sold and for the new place. This house needs some expensive repairs (like the roof) that are going to set us back. I had a kindle, but ended up giving it to my sister. I'm a speed reader, so I felt like I had to keep my hand up to tap the screen all the time. My laptop has a bigger screen, i'm pretty happy with it. My cell phones data plan is terrible, but my husbands is grandfathered into unlimited, I can use it as a hotspot when he is home. I'm just trying to prepare because I know it will be difficult not having internet any time I want it. If I am honest with myself, most of my internet use is reading fics or listening to audio books on youtube.
