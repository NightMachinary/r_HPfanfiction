I would suggest that you buy an Amazon Kindle (one of the models that give you an internet connection, so you can still keep yourself in the loop (unless there are no cell-towers where you are moving to), read fanfiction (if you want to) and also buy and read lots of other works of fiction (as e-books))

ps: May I ask where you are moving to that you will not have an internet connection (I mean even most poor countries have internet by now, even if it might only be hotspots at restaurants etc.)? I mean if I were to move that would be the first thing I'd do: Get an internet connection (that's - at least for me - more important than putting together the furniture (except for the bed maybe!))
