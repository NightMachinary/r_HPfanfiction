Oh, there is internet access, i'm just not sure i'll be able to afford it. I'm not sure how long it will take my house to sell, so until it does I will be paying the mortgage here and whatever the new place costs. My husbands cell has unlimited data, I can use it as a hotspot when he is home, but reading is how I spend most of my free time and I'm not sure that we will have the same schedules. It may turn out that we can budget it in, but I want to stockpile in case.
