linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27799261/chapters/68056189]]) How Fate Intended by hoboheartache is absolutely shameless and a fun read but I think it might turn plotty later, I'm only a few chapters in. The plot I saw when I skipped to the current chapters looked pretty damn cracky though.

The writer seems to have trawled for every single fanon trope they could get and has shoved them right in to see what will happen.
