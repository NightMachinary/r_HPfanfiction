  At the age of four, Harry Potter was left on the steps of an orphanage by the Dursleys. He would grow up experiencing the cruelty of children and learning that only the powerful will survive. At the same time, he hears, by chance, mentions a figure worthy of his respect: Tom Marvolo Riddle. Despite the frustratingly lacking information on the elusive ‘mudblood'-turned-‘King of Slytherin' from decades in the past, Harry is determined to follow in the steps of his role model.Disgusted with the restrictions the Ministry have placed on magical Britain, Harry vows to bring about change and leave his own legacy of magic. But for now, he will earn his rightful place in Hogwarts, even if he has to take the school by storm.
