One depiction of Flamel I always have in my head whenever he's in fic is that of of the one in Sanction's The Phoenix and the Serpent (linkffn(637123)) - a really unique and very crackpot Flamel, but one that fits in with the whimsy of Harry Potter. Be warned tho, it is one of my absolute favorite fics (and I would argue one of the better written out there) it is sadly incomplete, tho close enough to the end that you have a general idea of what it would be like. A good hero's journey type fic, very Odysseus-esque with some incredible OC's.
