I agree with you. Just because something bad didn't happen THIS time doesn't mean that something bad couldn't have. It could've been very offensive or inappropriate language put on the profiles of minors or just exposing them to it. It could've been a virus that went onto a person's computer and did its real damage there.

While this isn't a site where things like credit cards or bank numbers are floating around, for all we know this could've been a test before going to a bigger site.

Brushing theses sort of things off is what leads to bigger things happening. By acknowledging that it happened, and doing something to fix it, other instances can be prevented.

That isn't “fear-mongerig.” That's being cautious.
