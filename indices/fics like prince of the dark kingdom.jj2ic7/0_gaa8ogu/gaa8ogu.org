Children of the Revolution is a fairly interesting one bc like PoftDK, Voldemort is pretty sane and take a real interest in Harry.

Reign of the Serpent is also pretty close, it starts bc Slytherin himself beats the other 3 founders, and reigns immortal and supreme over (at least) Wizarding England.
