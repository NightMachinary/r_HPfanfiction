The code series by aduro The link is for the first one. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2750775/1/The-Code]]

Renascentia series This is the first one [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11914698/chapters/26923794]]

The code ends up being Draco/Ginny Renascentia ends up being Regulus/Emmeline Vance though its more in the sequel fic.

In both cases its much more heavily plot driven and there is a focus on platonic relationships just as much if not more than romantic ones.

Also Het Pairings I do like generally

Draco or Harry or Neville or Ron /Luna

Ron/ Pansy

James/Lilly

Percy/Hermione

George/ Tonks ( once they graduate school like when George is in his 20s shes got only like 5 years on him)

Hermione/ Krum

No shade to Romione i just like exploring non canon couples more
