No problem, but in the future, please PM the bot with your requests (it's actually why I implemented that!).

Also, downloads are currently having issues because of a bug in the downloader (not the bot itself); full stories are not really being downloaded properly.

Anyways, I'll remove this submission for now, to reduce spam and encourage PMs instead of threads like this. No hard feelings!
