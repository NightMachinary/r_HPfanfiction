lol love the bot. Has made this time without internet manageable. Thank you and these are some of the best I have every read. Teacherbev's story is actually the first fanfic I ever read. And I downloaded it off the internet thinking I was getting an advanced release of Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix. What a surprise when I read this and several months later that's not what is released but in the end I liked bev's version better than J.K. Rowling's
