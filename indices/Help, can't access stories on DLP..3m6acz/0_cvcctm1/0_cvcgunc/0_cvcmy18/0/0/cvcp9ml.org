I can't speak for Santi, I don't know why he didn't update his FF.net account. I will say though that OTTOMH, HP & TBWL is the only story with that issue. I would hold that most stories do end up posted on fanfiction archive sites eventually.

Look at the bright side: If the entire story is completed first, there'll be a polished version on FF.net with regular updates at some point. And if it's posted chapter by chapter, the delay is really neglible, so it's no issue to begin with.

And of course, everyone can always start posting and then leave comments in the WbA threads after reading. The purpose literally is "post your opinion", and everyone has an opinion. The author wants to hear that opinion, that's why he's posting the story.
