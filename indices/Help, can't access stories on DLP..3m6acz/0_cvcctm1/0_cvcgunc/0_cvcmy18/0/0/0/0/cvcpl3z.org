The WbA is a small portion, even though it's the most popular portion, of DLP. There are tons of other places to post, including hundreds of story threads where you can post your opinion about a fanfiction you've liked/hated, discussion threads, politics, gaming, and more. The post count you need isn't high, one person got to the necessary number by just inquiring as to why the change happened in a thread he made.
