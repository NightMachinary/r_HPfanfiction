This is good to know, you get several people recommending stories on the WBA section of DLP with no mention to review and offer constructive criticism. Often times linking directly to the story, so the sticky about forum rules never crosses their screen. Even when they do read the rules though, it only casually mentions the point of WBA and instead lists the hard rules, which only define what to do if you do post, not that you should.
