Work By Author is not a story-hosting section. Authors don't post stories to DLP to be hosted for general reading, there's FF.Net for that and it does a perfectly good job at it.

WBA is a betaing forum for authors who want assistance in writing and is designed to be a private forum where authors can refine their work prior to general publication. People who just want to read fics without giving feedback have no business having access to this forum. Further, the pre-publication nature of the forum is such that it requires greater protection from plagiarism.

If authors stop posting their work to DLP WBA in response to this, then they were using WBA incorrectly anyway.

But they won't, because the vast majority of users posting stories to WBA are active DLP members who /are/ using the forum correctly.
