You're missing my point I think. I like reading wba, so I can and will easily gain access to the forum again. I recognize FF authors don't like this, and I am not entitled to it. However it isn't going to stop me, because it is there and easy to access.

My point however is that the alleged reason for this change is to stop plagiarizing, except someone intent on doing so can gain access as easily as myself. So what is the point of the exercise?
