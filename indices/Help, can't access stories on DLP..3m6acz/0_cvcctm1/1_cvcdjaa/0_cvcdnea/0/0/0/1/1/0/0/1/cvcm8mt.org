I think that the concept is that DLP is an active forum for discussion. If you start posting, people will read what you say and respond. Posts generated solely to create postcount are readily detected as such and the membership takes venal joy in taunting new members to make certain they have something real to say.

If you're thinking you'll be able to put in a few reviews like 'story was good, wish it would update', and then get access to the WbA, you'll find that the local bouncers want to have a word with you.

It's sorta like Fight Club- to be a member, you have to fight.
