I'm a bit saddened by that remark. ;-;

Many people on DLP are a close knit group who have talked with each other for years and years, so looking in from the outside it might seem like they're being assholes and elitist, but we're still very accepting of new members. Hell, some members only lurk on the forums and only participate in IRC, so they're not very well known even though tons of regular members know them very well.

The only time DLP members are actually assholes is when people like Luke post stupid, spammy stuff. Otherwise, like I said, if you're genuine, no one cares if you're new or not, only that you contribute.
