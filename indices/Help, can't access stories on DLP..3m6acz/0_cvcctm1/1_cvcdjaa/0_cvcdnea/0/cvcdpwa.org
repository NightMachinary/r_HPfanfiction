I'm not talking about hurting the authors. It will hurt new writers potentially, but mostly it stops people from reading. And if this is in response to a bot copying stories I don't see why they think it will actually stop that. Either the restrictions are so severe it will stop the bot, or they're so lax that they will only inconvenience the more casual audience.
