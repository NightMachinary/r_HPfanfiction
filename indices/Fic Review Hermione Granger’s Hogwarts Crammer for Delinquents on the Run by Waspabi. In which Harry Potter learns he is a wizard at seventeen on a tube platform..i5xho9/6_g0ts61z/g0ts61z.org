I adore this one, but I still feel like it was either too long or too short. I didn't like the ending, I don't quite remember why as it's been a while since I read it, but I remember feeling like the last half builds up a lot towards nothing and it might as well not exist. I didn't want a repeat horcrux hunt either, but I felt kind of cheated from having a good emotional resolution.

That said, I still loved reading it, I remember it fondly, and I really reccomend it â™¡
