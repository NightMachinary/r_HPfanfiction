It's probably a matter of taste, but to be honest, I found it a bit underwhelming given the amount of praise I'd seen for it. It's not really satisfying on a plot level because of the way it cuts off, and what makes Harry/Draco interesting to me /is/ their existing canon tension, so without that, it's just sort of "teen finds out he's a magical chosen one, reacts warily, meets a boy he likes, the end." Harry's relationships with the adults from canon might have been interesting, but we don't really see that either, if I remember correctly. It's readable, but it didn't really do much for me.
