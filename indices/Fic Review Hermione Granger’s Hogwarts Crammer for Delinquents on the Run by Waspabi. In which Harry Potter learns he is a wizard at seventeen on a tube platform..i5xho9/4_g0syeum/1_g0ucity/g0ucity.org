I can certainly understand being unsatisfied with where it ends and the lack of resolution. I prefer closed-ended stories myself.

The Drarry canon tension is definitely one of the most fun things about the ship, so I can also understand its absence not being a point in the fic's favour, though it was surprisingly enjoyable to me nonetheless.

Thank you for your thoughts!
