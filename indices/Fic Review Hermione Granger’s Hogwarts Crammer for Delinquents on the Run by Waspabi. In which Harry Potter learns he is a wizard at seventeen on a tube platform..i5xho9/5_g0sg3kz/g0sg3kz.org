This has been on my to-read list for ever, so your review is def bumping it up the list now. I really enjoyed waspabi's other fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6239806/chapters/14295997]["Stately Homes of Wiltshire"]] but never got around to reading this one.

Good luck with The Man Who Lived, that is my favorite characterization of Draco. Would definitely love to hear your review on that fic since it is considered a Drarry Must Read.
