I'm curious that it's the only Drarry story you've read that doesn't have the baggage of their Hogwarts rivalry, because it means you haven't read the extremely comparable linkao3(Life skills outside the curriculum by Endrina), which has a similar premise (in fact I can never which is which). While this one, the Crammer, is better written in several ways, I think I do probably prefer the other, for reasons you've mentioned here. All the time spent idling in the forest, the fairly unnecessary extra characters who joined them, the way it stops before getting into much plot... I think it ultimately feels a bit unsatisfying
