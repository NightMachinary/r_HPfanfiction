It definitely does mean that I have not read Endrina's work, and if the premise is as similar as you say then it's possible that they were both inspired by the same prompt. If there's a version of this story which you feel wraps up even better I'd be happy to give that a go. Do you think it's worth adding to my review list? If not I'm happy to give it a read anyhow - thank you for the recommendation!
