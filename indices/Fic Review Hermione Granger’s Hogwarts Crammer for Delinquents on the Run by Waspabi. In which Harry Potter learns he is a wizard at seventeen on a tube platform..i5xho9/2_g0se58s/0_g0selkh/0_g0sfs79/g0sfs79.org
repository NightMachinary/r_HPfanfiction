Quite possibly the same prompt, since they were posted at pretty much the same time. Admittedly it doesn't wrap things up well per se; it ends in a similar way, actually, then has an explanatory epilogue. But I think the earlier part of Life Skills feels more like a complete story arc of Harry (and Draco) getting to that point, whereas the Crammer feels more like it is just the start of the story.

Definitely worth reading. I'm not sure if you'd like to review it or not
