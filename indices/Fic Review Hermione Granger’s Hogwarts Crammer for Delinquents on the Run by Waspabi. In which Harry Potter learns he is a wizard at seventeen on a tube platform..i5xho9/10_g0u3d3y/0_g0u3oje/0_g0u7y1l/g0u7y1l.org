That'd be a fun spin-off fic, where they start looking for the horcruxes and somehow realize she had that one all along.

By the way, I looked into this story but wasn't as drawn to it's beginning, but now I'm reading "Life skills outside the curriculum" which is based on the same premise, and enjoying it.
