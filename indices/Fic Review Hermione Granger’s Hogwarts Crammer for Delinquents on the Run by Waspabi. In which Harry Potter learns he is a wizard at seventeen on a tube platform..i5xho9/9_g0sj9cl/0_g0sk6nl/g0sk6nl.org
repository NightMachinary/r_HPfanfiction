Ah you've listened to it as a podcast? I started on it and like the sound of the narrator, but it seems to only be available as a single gigantic audio file which resets every time I close it on my phone's player, so not sure how to pace my listening of it. Would love to hear it through though.

Should I ask why The Man Who Lived made you grit your teeth? Or is that a spoiler?
