Not at all - it's a fair point to make. And strictly yes, I probably should just never mention that a fanfic author named Maya existed and certainly not link to work that she took down, but this is also the internet, as you said. Once it's out in the wild it's never truly inaccessible again, and you can no more eliminate the evidence of it than a published author could unpublish themselves. I guess I use that excuse somewhat because I think it's a real shame that her work had to come down at all.
