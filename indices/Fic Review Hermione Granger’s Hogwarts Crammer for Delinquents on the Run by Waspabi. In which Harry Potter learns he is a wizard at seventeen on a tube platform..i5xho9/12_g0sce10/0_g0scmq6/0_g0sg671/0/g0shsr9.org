Yeah, it's kind of what they have to say though? Cassandra Claire said something similar when she was about to wrap up her fandom presence and publish The Mortal Instruments series, but in both cases the authors actually compiled the PDFs of their works themselves and put them up publicly for a period of time first, for the express purpose of fans being able to download them and continue to read and enjoy them after they stopped being hosted under the author's pseudonyms.

For the sake of Maya's privacy though, I've deliberately not mentioned her real/published name, so as not to link her to her fanfiction and muddy those legal waters, which are the whole reason her fanfiction had to come down in the first place.
