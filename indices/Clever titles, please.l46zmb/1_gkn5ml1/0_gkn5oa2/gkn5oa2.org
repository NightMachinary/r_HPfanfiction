[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15889737][*/Remus Lupin, a Werewolf? Gasp! Who Knew?/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/LullabyKnell/pseuds/LullabyKnell][/LullabyKnell/]]

  The clues were there and they were not impossible to put together. A person didn't have to be breathtakingly clever and named Hermione Granger to realize that Professor Remus Lupin was a werewolf. The regular absences were covered up well and then explained away with the dismissive ease of someone who had been making these excuses all their life, but there were still students who could take a break from their own busy lives just long enough to make the necessary leap of logic. - Some snippets of realization with some random Hogwarts students.

  “What's carrying a bag of flour around all day for a term supposed to teach us about parenting, I ask you?”The one where the Marauders have to take care of flour babies - or at least, not completely destroy them. James is trying to impress Lily, Sirius has a problem with his backside, and Remus is, as always, trying not to flunk. And he's dreadfully in love with his best friend.

  Fred opened the book and began to write. He only got a few words down before the diary absorbed them, the ink vanishing without a trace, prompting George to lean in closer to observe.“Maybe this is some elaborate joke on Ginny's part to educate us on proper brotherly behaviour?” George mused, just as new words began to appear on the empty page. Well, that seemed a bit ambitious for a first year...‘Hello. To whom might I be writing?' Or: The Weasley twins are the ones to obtain Tom Riddle's diary.
