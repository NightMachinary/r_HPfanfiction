When a Veela Cries is a good one. Though you might not be a fan of the intro (it's quite unrealistically brutal), if you really don't like it, it's worth skipping ahead until the sections of the plot in France which provide the foundation for his time in Durmstrang. The intro is basically just used as an excuse to untether him from Hogwarts and all the stuff he knew before. The Durmstrang and France sections are really worth sticking with it though, IMO.
