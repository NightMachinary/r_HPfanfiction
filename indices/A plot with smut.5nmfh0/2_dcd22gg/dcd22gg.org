[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsT1FOTDc4YlBwX0k][Harry Potter and the Secret of the Golden Unicorn]]

The basic premise is Harry inheriting a brothel from his parents. This story is basically crack, although it may not appear as such at first glance. Don't take it too seriously, have a couple of drinks and just enjoy the ride. Some parts are fun, some parts are funny, most are full of action, sexual or otherwise. And it's complete, to boot.

My only gripe with it was the author's obsession with scenes of [[/spoiler][genital torture, usually performed by witches on males - though it mostly happened to death eater scum]]. It was kind of disturbing and I freely admit I skipped almost all of those scenes.
