All we knew was she was in the same year as Harry. Personally, I enjoy her. What makes characters like Daphne, Susan, Fleur, and others so enjoyable to me is that there is much more wiggle room with their characters than saym Hermione or Ginny. With Daphne, there are common Fanon facts about her and logical inferences that you can make based on the little you know. It establishes a really rough outline that then an author can take and develop how they see fit. As others have said, many characters are rather painfully underdeveloped which is where I feel Fanfiction is so great. People take characters like that, develop them, then have them affect the story.
