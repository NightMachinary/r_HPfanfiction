It has specificity goes for it.

As far as the fandom is concerned a Harry/Daphne fic is a Harry/Slytherin-Ice-Queen fic and nothing else. Harry/OC could be almost anything. Because of the sheer size of the Harry Potter fandom I imagine most people simply pass on fics they're unsure of; there's always another page of stories to peruse.

In much the same way as a good, specific, but non spoilery summary tells you everything about a fic without detracting from a story, simply placing 'Harry/Daphne' on the fic can almost be a substitute for any summary at all.

That's how homogeneous the Harry/Daphne space is. Those stories don't even need a summary because everyone already knows exactly what the outline of the story is.
