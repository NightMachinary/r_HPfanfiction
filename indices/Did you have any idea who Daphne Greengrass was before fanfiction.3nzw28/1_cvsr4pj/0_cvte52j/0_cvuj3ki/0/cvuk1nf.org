Exactly. Other characters talked /about/ her, but we never see her do much herself. What happened to "show, don't tell" in the writing?

I honestly think the biggest wasted opportunity re: Ginny is at (IIRC) the beginning of OotP when Harry gets to Grimmauld Place and is ranting to Hermione, Ron, /and Ginny/ about how no one else knows what it's like to have Voldemort in their head. Yeah, no one else knows...except the chick sitting right next to you who was possessed by him for a year. Sure, Harry.

This is where JKR should have started building their future romance: having Ginny call him on his bullshit and give them that connection via an experience literally no one else alive understands. When that scene passed without Ginny calling Harry out, I had to stop reading for a few minutes because I just couldn't believe she let that slide.
