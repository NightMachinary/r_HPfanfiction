THIS. Ginny's character development felt less like "development" and more like "flipping a lightswitch." Ginny's issue, for me, was that characters kept talking about how "powerful" and "popular" she was, but that was rarely reflected in the scenes in which she was present. We saw a few snippets about how she would work well with Harry, but it was never fully realized.
