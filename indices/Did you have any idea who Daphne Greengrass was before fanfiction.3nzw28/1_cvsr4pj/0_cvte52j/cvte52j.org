This is why I don't understand people who say movie Ginny is a shitty character, but book Ginny was awesome. No, they're both shitty, two-dimensional characters with basically no character development. It's also why I don't buy Ginny as Harry's love interest. If we, the readers, don't know anything about Ginny, then neither does Harry since the book is told from his perspective. The worst part is, she has such potential to be awesome, but it's never explored.
