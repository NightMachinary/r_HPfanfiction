  She is a pureblood - because don't we all secretly want to write a Jane Austen story?
#+end_quote

Sorry, but what the heck does being pureblood have to do with Jane Austen? Who did not, by the way, write about a stupid, cruel aristocracy persecuting others to protect the sanctity of their bloodlines. Middle class gentility and sharp-tongued comedies of manners are worlds away from HP fanfic. Nor are they Harlequin Regency romances.

(I can't help it - the kneejerk assumptions that abound about Austen exasperate me.)

Also, as HP names go, "Daphne" is pretty mild. It does have a mythological precedent, but it's also a fairly well-established girls' name. No cause for embarrassment there.

And this may be another subcultural divide, but in my usual HP corner I rarely encounter fics about Daphne. Astoria is a much more popular blank slate onto which writers project wizarding biases and the consequences of arranged marriages and complex infidelities.
