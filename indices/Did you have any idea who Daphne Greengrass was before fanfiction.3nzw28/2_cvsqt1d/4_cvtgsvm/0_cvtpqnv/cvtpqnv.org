Nor did I ever say she did. I, in jest I might add, made comment on the equivalency between the cultural divide often used by literature of that period and the one they wish to impose upon the Harry Potter universe.

Take Pride and Prejudce, arguably Austen's most famous story, with one of it's main narratives being that of Marriage and societal expectation placed upon people during this period.

Now can we find an equivalence within the fanfiction world of people getting married due to societal and familial expectation. What about marriage contracts, a huge mainstay in the Daphne Greengrass genre? Is there not an equivalence between the maritial expectations on the Bennet sisters and the maritial expectations so often put on characters like Daphne during stories of the 'pureblood' genre. It may not be an equality, but to say there is no overlap in genre is absurd.

Austen characterises Elizabeth as this beautiful and intelligent, yet prejudicing woman. How many times has there been a fanfiction which opened with Harry describing Daphne as the 'most beautiful girl he had ever seen' yet their first interaction shows her having a point of view developed from her prior judging of him because he's the Gryffindor saviour. Then the narrative furthers with him defying her expectations and her rethinking her policy of prejudce toward people.

Sure, Austen doesn't feature bloodline purity as a central focus. Nor, does she paint the aristocracy as stupid, I will agree. But really, manners isn't in the aristocratical aspect of fanficiton? What about all the times Harry learns he's a Pureblood heir and 'has to learn how to act like one'?

And to your last point, I think that's definitely subculture divide. There are masses of Daphne fics centred around what you personally have found in Astoria fics.
