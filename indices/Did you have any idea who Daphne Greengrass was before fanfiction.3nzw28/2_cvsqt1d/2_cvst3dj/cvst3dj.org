While I agree that she's a useful OC Stand-In, I really don't like the way (shitty) writers made her the fanon "Ice Queen of Slytherin", nor the way you talk of her as an "object for cliches". It's a character, no matter how little characterization she had in canon, once you decide to use her, especially as an MC, you have to give her /some/ depth. Unless you're a shitty writer.
