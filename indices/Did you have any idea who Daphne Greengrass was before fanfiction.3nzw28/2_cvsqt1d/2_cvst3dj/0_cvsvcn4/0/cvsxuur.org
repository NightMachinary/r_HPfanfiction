The difference is that we certainly had knowledge of canon!Hermione's personality (which is often discarded in fanfiction), while we know virtually nothing of Daphne Greengrass. There's a difference between fanon based on a minor character, and fanon based on someone we don't know anything about, personality wise. And the Ice Queen thing is just too cringe-inducing.
