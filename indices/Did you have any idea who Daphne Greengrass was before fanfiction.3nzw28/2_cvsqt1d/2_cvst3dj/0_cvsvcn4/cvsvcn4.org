I find that many writers just readily use the character that the collective conscience have built of her. Simply put, they expect you to come with the paradigms of her character. I feel that because her 'voice' is strong within fanon, people write her as if she is canon.

Imagine if Hermione wasn't a main character, yet people still wrote her as many do; condescending and overbearing. We, the readers, accept that because we know her value and her depth, yet if she wasn't a main character she would just be annoying. I feel that's what happened with Daphne. The community has read so much of her character as we see it now that many writers write her under the banner of assumed knowledge like you would a canonical character. This isn't good, it simply is.
