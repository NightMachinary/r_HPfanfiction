No, she faded into the background like all the other characters named for immersion.

She's the perfect object - I use the term as it feels as if she is just that, an object for the use of tired cliches rather than a person we can empathise with - for fanfiction. She is a pureblood - because don't we all secretly want to write a Jane Austen story? - she is in slytherin so we can give her all those ideas to manipulate the world at 11 and she has the mythology-based name we are too embarrased to call our OC's.

It's a match made in heaven.
