Basically its your peer support group/writers circle, in this case based upon interest or genre. You can choose to be randomly allocated a cabin though if you fancy.

You get a dedicated real time chat to brainstorm or have virtual write ins or just decompress if your brain overloads. The cabins also have word goals extrapolated from the goals set by individual "campers" so the whole cabin "Wins" or "Loses" together - motivating everyone to pull together and support one another.
