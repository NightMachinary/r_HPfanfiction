The whole "Cassiopeia Black or whoever has a book full of super useful blackmail that is totally not out of date at all, even years later" thing is a pretty common cliche when people try padding out the Black family with living members. I think it's one of those completely made up "fanon" things that sort of spread like mold to the point where everyone uses it.

Like certain characters who barely exist in canon being complete "ice queens" for example.
