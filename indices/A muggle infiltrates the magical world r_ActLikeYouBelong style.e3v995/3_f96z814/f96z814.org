The closest one I can think of is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][In The Bleak Midwinter]] by TheLoud. Hermione Granger travels back in time to give baby Voldemort to Tom Riddle Sr. so he can take care of him. She informs him of the wizarding world and he decides to use that knowledge to advance himself by pretending to be from an ancient pureblood family, much to Hermione's chagrin. It's fun!
