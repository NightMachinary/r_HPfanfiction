I have yet to check out P0ody-Files' FFnet to eBook downloader, will have to do it at home since for some reason it's blocked at work... I love FicSave though, and the new layout is great compared to the old via github one. And I like how I can add several stories to queue now. What's great about FicSave is that it's mobile friendly. If I find a long-ish story I like, I just convert it on my mobile browser, thus conserving my data.

I used to use [[https://www.flagfic.com/][flagfic]], but the developer had some issues in transferring hosts. Flagfic was great because it supported a *lot* of different sites and was also mobile-friendly.
