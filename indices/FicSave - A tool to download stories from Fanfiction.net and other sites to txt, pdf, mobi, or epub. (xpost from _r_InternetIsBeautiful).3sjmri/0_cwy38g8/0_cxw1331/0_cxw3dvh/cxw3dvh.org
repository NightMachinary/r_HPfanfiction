You can use the Calibra ebook organizer/syncer with the [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/FAQs][FanFicFare plugin]] but that will take some setting up if you don't have it already.

Alternatively, you can do

#+begin_example
    linkffn(<id>, <id>, etc)
#+end_example

and the bot will do it for you.
