  Is it piracy to download ff?
#+end_quote

I personally use a fanfic downloader so I can read my favorite stories on my tablet where there's no internet access. As long as you don't step on anyone's toes and try to redistribute the stories you download, I don't really see people having a problem with this. I've seen authors become upset when their stories are downloaded and redistributed in databases or other places, but I've never seen someone get upset for a story being downloaded for personal reading.

You're technically making an unauthorized copy if you download it without the author's permission, but it doesn't fall under the definition of piracy unless you try to distribute the copy for money or some other benefit. Unauthorized copies are like: if you buy a cd, and put the mp3s on your computer, and then copy the files to give to a friend. It's kind of a legal grey-space, but there's no way to enforce preventing it when it happens on a small scale between individuals. For things like fanfiction, it's not like anyone will come after you or anything, if you do something the author doesn't like they'll probably just tell you to stop.

Sites like AO3 have an option in-site to download pdf/ebook versions, so if an author uploads there they're kind of giving implicit permission to download their story, even if they don't specifically say anywhere that they're okay with people downloading their story. I know some people don't like their stories being downloaded, especially if the person who obtained a copy plans to redistribute it. I've seen authors delete all their work and ask fans not to spread it around if they have a copy.

When some user here(I forget who, or maybe it was on the general fanfiction subreddit) did a giant data grab of ffn net and offered to give a copy of the several terrabyte sized file to other people, I know some authors got upset.

But anyway, I don't actually see a problem with things like fanfiction downloaders. I know this is a pretty long post for a simple question like if downloading from ff is piracy, but I guess I had a lot more to say on the topic than I thought, lol. Also, IANAL(I am not a lawyer)
