I agree with you, I don't think it's piracy to download a fan fic because I dont plan on anyone other than myself reading the copy I downloaded.

They aren't getting paid (I don't believe) and I'm not selling it, so by me downloading it, they arent losing out on any money they might get if I were to read it on the site
