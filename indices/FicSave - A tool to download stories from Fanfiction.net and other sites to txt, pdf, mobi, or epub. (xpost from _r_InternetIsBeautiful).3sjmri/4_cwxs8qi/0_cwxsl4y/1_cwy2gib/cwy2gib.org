I agree with the other posters in this thread. I wouldn't consider it piracy so long as it's only for personal use. If someone deletes a fic, though, but it reemerges thanks to someone else's mobi or epub file... that's not very nice. The author could have good reason for deleting the story and it wouldn't be fair to go behind their back.
