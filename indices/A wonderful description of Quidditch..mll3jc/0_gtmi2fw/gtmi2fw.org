I'll give you that it's a interesting, even funny line. But....shudder. Accurate? Gonna be a hard no from me on accurate.

I mean, I love Quidditch...and I love Baseball.

They should not be in the same sentence. Much less compared. Even as an American that description makes me gag. The only real similarity to Baseball is that..some people have bats. Nothing about how the game is played, scored, or perceived comes remotely close. Baseball is far more methodical than Quidditch. The style of sport is completely different. It's akin to comparing hockey to baseball because players in both have access to wooden instruments and wear helmets.

Of course it Quiditch is Aerial Hockey and I'll fight anyone who thinks otherwise.
