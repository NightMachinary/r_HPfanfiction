Interesting. Yeah I also have wondered how Riddle got these early followers at school and I still don't 100% get Tom Riddle and his desire for muggle killing despite him being half blood, other than his father, hating what you hate about yourself, and thinking muggles are inferior for not being magical.

He is definitely a charming sociopath even in canon. The storyline you describes does sound like Tom...although if the story was in the late 90s, i wonder how sensational a story of a male student accusing a female teacher of rape would be. Interesting, although I usually avoid rape stories.
