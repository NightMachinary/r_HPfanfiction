My personal struggle is with Tom Riddle. I know he's characterized as a charming handsome guy who ruled his gang of bullies with an iron fist but I often find his characterizations quite unrealistic in fics. He is always depicted as this tyrant over his gang in front of whom the entire Slytherin gang cowers. I frankly doubt that an orphan of dubious origins would bring all those snobbish purebloods to his heel by being a piece of shit right from the start.

In fact we learn from the books that even fanatical blood purists from his generation, such as the Blacks (Walburga should have been in the same year as him according to the family tree), got scared of him once he revealed his true nature and we mostly see his followers being a generation younger than him. My thought is that he gained his Death Eaters through similar circumstances that Harry did gain the support of the DA (maybe he was a bit more confident)... assuming that he started his rise to power around the same time Nobby Leech was Minister for Magic, I like to think that he was the catalyst.

Anyways... my thoughts are that Tom Riddle was more of a charming sociopath and since I like to believe that most people are not like him, it's hard for most of us to get inside his head before he became the Voldemort we see in the series. Even Dumbledore is only able to make just some scarce assumptions about the way he was operating prior to that. On that note, I remember once reading a fic (can't remember the name) where he was exactly that. He was pleasant, loved and respected by everyone, purebloods, half-bloods and muggle-borns alike. He also seduces one of his teacher who is the wife of the first Muggle-born head of DMLE. Eventually he rapes her, plays the victim and blackmails her husband to reveal her 'indiscretion' if he doesn't resign. Now that's how I'd imagine Tom Riddle before he was Voldemort.
