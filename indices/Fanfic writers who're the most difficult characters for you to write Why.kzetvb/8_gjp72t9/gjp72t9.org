Dumbledore is a pain. Especially since I want him to be Dumbledore from the books and not, Evil!Manipulative! Dumbledore from fics.

Sirius is both easy and difficult. He's easy on the outside. Like you've said, he's impulsive and quick-tempered and handsome, but his internal thoughts are a little more complicated for me - I don't believe Sirius came to the world disagreeing with his family's beliefs. I have to balance what he learns from James, Remus and Peter and how it changes his views with everything he heard from his family and believed while he was a kid.
