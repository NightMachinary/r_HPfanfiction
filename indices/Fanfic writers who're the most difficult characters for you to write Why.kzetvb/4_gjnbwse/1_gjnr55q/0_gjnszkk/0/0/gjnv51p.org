Yeah totally. At least in canon it's a gradual build up of confidence. And it's sad in canon Book 2 he says, "They went for Filch first and everyone knows I'm almost a squib." I mean people criticize themselves but from someone with strong magical heritage I'm sure that was even more upsetting. But I digress.
