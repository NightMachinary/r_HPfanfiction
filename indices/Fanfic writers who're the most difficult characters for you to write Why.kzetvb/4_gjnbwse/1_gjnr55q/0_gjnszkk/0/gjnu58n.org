It's not the trope I have a problem with. But the way most authors write it is horrible and just makes me click off the fic. I mean sure, you can gain more confidence if you're surrounded by people that will put you up instead of putting you down, but that doesn't make him some self-assured, confident guy in two months that isn't terribly awkward socially and who can talk to girls he isn't familiar with already which he can't . Another thing I see is Neville become super-duper powerful when he gets a new wand despite us as readers being given no inclination of his power beforehand and his family literally thinking he was a squib until he was eight.
