Personal opinion here but I actually think blank slate characters that you can project whatever you want onto are easier than characters we know a bit about but not much e.g Ernie Macmillian, Seamus Finnegan the Patil twins etc. Because you can just imagine an oc and give them the name Is Harry a ravenclaw in your fic and you need a ravenclaw friend? Write the characterisation and call them Terry Boot or Anthony Goldstein or Michael Corner. Characters we have a little info for but not much are harder. But this is personal I accept other writers may see it differently.
