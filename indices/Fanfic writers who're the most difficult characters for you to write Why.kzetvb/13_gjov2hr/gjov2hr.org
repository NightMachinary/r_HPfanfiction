For me, Hermione. I love her to pieces, flaws and all, but it's so easy to get her tone wrong, and then suddenly she becomes too strident, or too adult, or too 'fanon'.

I think much of this stems from our general tendency as readers to fall into stereotyping more quickly with female characters. What is 'stern' with males easily reads as 'shrill' with females and so on, so I feel I have to take far more care to avoid mischaracterization with female characters, especially Hermione.
