Draco.

I've gotten so many comments about how I've done him wrong or some other shit like that. Remember, the books are told from Harry's perspective. We see what he thinks(ie. Hagrid's a brilliant teacher, Draco's evil, Dumbledore is an angle, etc.) and so anytime I try to write Draco differently...well, apparently I'm a blind bitch who sees everything through rose colored glasses and am an idiot for not wanting to hate a 16 year old kid. Direct quote there. Well, mostly.

I don't even pull a 'he was good all along'. I give him legit reasons; his mum is an alcoholic which leads him to do some other shit which moves the plot and his arc, the only person who was nice to him was a muggle born and they died gruesomely, he sees everything from Harry's perspective, etc. Even then I seldom give him full 'redemption'. After all, he does have some legit reasons to not like muggles and muggle borns.
