I love writing Luna. Seeing the world through her lens is very grounding to me. She's been through so much stuff, and staunchly refuses to not believe in something. So when people are mean to her, its the Nargles. Someone is acting stupid, head full of Wrackspurt. They probably don't exist but that just might be the Wrackspurt in my head.
