I read a lot of Remus/Tonks. The most successful Tonks characterization I've read has been Kerichi's Once in a Blue Moon series. The author gave Tonks more of a life than any other fic I've read. There's five big fics in this series, spanning GoF to HBP, plus an AU DH ending and one-shots. Funnily enough, I think the best in the series are the three that take place during GoF, because the author couldn't rely on canon to figure out what was happening in Tonks' life. As a result, the first ones are fun, lighthearted mysteries that give Tonks an extended family, friends, and a side job. I was sad when I finished the series because her characterization made me feel like I was saying goodbye to a friend. Anyway, when I write Tonks I try to write in that spirit. Since we don't know very much, I can make it up. The first fic in the Once in a Blue Moon Series linked: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2530576/1/Once-in-a-Blue-Moon]])
