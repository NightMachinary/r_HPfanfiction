Luna.

You really can't handle her character easily. It's very very difficult and delicate. She's just very out there as a character and there isn't enough about her to know her personality.

The trend with her character is that writer often make her character OP, can see the future and is always right, or a very frustrating person who knows the answers but insists on acting like a complete buffoon and not sharing them or she's a weird version of a pothead from the sixties.

This isn't counting the ones where she's a nymphomaniac or an exhibitionist.

When Luna as a character was introduced, I really liked her. But getting the tone just correct for her, the balance, it is very difficult.

Tonks

Tonks is equally difficult. She's a fun and likeable character but you can't spin a main plot around her, or atleast have her as a love interest and keep the story going in an addictive manner. It's been very difficult to do, and as far as I've read, it hasn't ever been done.

I believe the challenges of her age, the lack of depth in her personality in the books, and not enough information on her as a whole makes it difficult to set the tone for her.

The other characters you can generally set the tone for but yeah, tonks and Luna are very difficult to write.
