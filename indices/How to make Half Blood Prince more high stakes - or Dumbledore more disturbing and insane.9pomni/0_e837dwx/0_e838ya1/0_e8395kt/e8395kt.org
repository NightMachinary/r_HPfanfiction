Harry had only just lost Sirius, and it was enough to make him try an Unforgivable. Losing Ron to Malfoy would make him flip his shit to the point that "Wait outside Slytherin Dorm under Cloak. Reducto Malfoy to the face when he exits. Burn the body" wouldn't be a stretch. Losing Dumbledore, who he had been on the outs with, made him try and Crucio Snape as well. Punisher Harry isn't a big stretch if Malfoy's poison killed Ron and Katie.
