Didn't stop him trying. He didn't actively know how to cast it properly, and was knocked on his ass wordlessly every time he tried to hex Snape, even one of his spells was "Cruci" unless he's going to turn Snape into a Crossword by casting Cruciverbalist, then it's likely he was going to cast Crucio. Him being that much closer to Ron and Hermione... He'd have let Malfoy die, and actively attacked Snape to make sure Malfoy died, at the least.
