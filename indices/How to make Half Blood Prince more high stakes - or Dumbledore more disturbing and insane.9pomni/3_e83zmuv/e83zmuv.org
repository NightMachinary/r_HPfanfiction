If Dumbledore's attempts to save a racist scumbag like Draco resulted in the death of Ron or Katie, he'd have lost Harry's trust completely, I think - and the trust of McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout and probably Snape as well. Most of the Order - the Weasleys - for sure.

Protecting Draco was such a braindead decision, the risks so much greater than the meagre reward, that it alone would be enough to ruin the entire characterisation of Dumbledore.
