  McGonagall, Flitwick
#+end_quote

Not to go all McGonagall bashing, but the woman has shown an astonishing lack of indivdiual thought when it comes to Dumbledore. Not that a student death couldn't possibly shake her out of her stupor, but the huge number of near-deaths in preceding years didn't do it either.

And I figure your outlook on Flitwick is probably mostly fueled by the typical fanon characterization of him (some kind of guardian/revenge spirit protecting the students...)
