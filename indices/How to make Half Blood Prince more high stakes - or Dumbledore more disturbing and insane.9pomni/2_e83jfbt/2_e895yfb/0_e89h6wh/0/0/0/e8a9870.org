Oooh yes up until HBP I thought Dumbledore was epic, but I felt so betrayed after finishing it that I went completely off him, and then I started thinking and... Well, yeah.

I mean it was basically part of the thing that I loved Snape so much that I refused to believe that he was actually working for Voldemort, and my mind immediately went to 'Dumbledore made him do it' and...when you think about it that was really a bad, bad plan. Not even on a moral level, because I can understand the idea the good of the many, thank you Mr Spock, but the way the plan hinged on everything happening exactly right is... Well, that's not how you plan a war.

Plus you can make a definite argument that the original plan was to set Snape up as the owner of the Elder Wand, in order to give the ownership of the wand to Harry when he killed him. And setting up a kid who should still be in school to kill someone who he would later find out is innocent (and how would he find that out? How was Harry supposed to find out about the Horcrux in his scar when Snape was the only person who knew?) is triple plus ungood fucking squared.

I think Dumbledore wanted to be a better person than he was, which gets him points, but I'm pretty sure that Ron could have planned the war better if he'd had access to all the information Dumbledore had.
