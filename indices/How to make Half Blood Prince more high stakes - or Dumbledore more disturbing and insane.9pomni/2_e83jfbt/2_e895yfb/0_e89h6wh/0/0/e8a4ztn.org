Nonworries, it happens. See, the problem with Albus is that when it comes down to it, even though he is a powerful genius, he is also deeply flawed. It's what makes him a great character. It seems as though the readers who feel the most betrayed by him are those who looked up to him the most.

He does say multiple times to Harry that he is an imperfect man not worthy of such trust as is placed upon him, not through false humility, but because he actually believes it. His failure to protect his sister, and then Myrtle weigh heavily on him, and yiu can see it in his actions. One of his biggest flaws is to always see his former students as students still. Even as adults.
