No, both times somebody (Harry) was conveniently there and it had nothing to do with Dumbledore.

When Katie was affected by the necklace she was supposed to give Dumbledore, Harry ran to find help, found Hagrid on his way back from visiting Grawp, and Hagrid was able to get her to the castle and up to Pomfrey. Yes, Hagrid was present, but not placed there by Dumbledore, it was luck that Harry was able to find him. If Harry hadn't run to get help, or if it had happened earlier or later and Hagrid wasn't coincidentally there, there would be a body.

When Ron drank the poisoned mead, Harry and Ron visited Slughorn to get a love potion cure, something that could neither be foreseen nor controlled by Dumbledore. If Slughorn had chosen to drink that mead himself rather than share it with Harry and Ron, or if Harry had left, there would be a body.
