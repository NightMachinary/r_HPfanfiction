You seem to have forgotten that Slughorn was the one who possessed the poisoned mead and offered a drink to Ron and Harry. And he did nothing to save Ron when he was poisoned, Harry did.

And Hagrid wasn't there, Harry ran to find help and found him. And if you're suggesting that Hagrid lied about the reason he was out, I suggest that you remember which character we're talking about here.

And yes, they were very sloppy attempts that could never have killed Dumbledore. That's kinda the whole problem we're discussing here. Sloppy assassination attempts that nearly led to collateral damage.
