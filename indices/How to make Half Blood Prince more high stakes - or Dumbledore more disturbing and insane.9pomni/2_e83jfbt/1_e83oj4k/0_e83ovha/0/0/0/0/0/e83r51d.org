You seem to forget that Slughorn froze up and did nothing while Ron was literally dying in front of him. And of course Harry knew the common poison remedy (not a cureall, just a remedy for most common poisons), but that was, again, Harry preventing somebody from dying, not Dumbledore. I know it's easy to mix them up sometimes.

And it's a hell of a thing to say there was no collateral damage. Even regarding the lack of deaths which, again, prevented by Harry, not by Dumbledore, Katie Bell was hospitalized for an extended period of time, and would have died, regardless of who was present, if she hadn't been wearing gloves.
