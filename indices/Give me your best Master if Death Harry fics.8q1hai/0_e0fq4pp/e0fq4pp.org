For crack, probably On a Pale Horse linkffn(On a Pale Horse).

For a crossover, possibly The Shadow of Angmar linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar).

My personal favorite is Realignment linkffn(Realignment). MoD!Harry is not the focus of the story per say, but its easily the most interesting iteration of this that I have seen. Highly recommend.
