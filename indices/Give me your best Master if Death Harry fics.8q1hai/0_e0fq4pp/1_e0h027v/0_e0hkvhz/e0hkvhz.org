Its one of my favorite fics out there right now.

I have summarized the premise before like thus: what if the T-700 was sent back to kill John Connor, but he has the T-1000 protecting him. Replace Harry, Tom Riddle, and Dumbledore respectively, and that is the short of this fic. Bonus is that Grindelwald is the T-X in that fic.

This is easily some of the /best/ magic depictions in the fandom (my opinion) and some of the Tom/Dumbledore interactions are great, and Dumbledore is awesome in this fic. Here is one of my favorite quotes from him:

#+begin_quote
  "Like I said, you'll have to do better."
#+end_quote

He says this after roasting a basilisk with liquid flame and blasting Morfin Gaunt through a wall.

And Harry...is plain awesome. Here is a quote he says when fighting Grindelwald:

#+begin_quote
  "I've fought immortals before."
#+end_quote

One of the most badass lines you'll come across, even if it is bravado.
