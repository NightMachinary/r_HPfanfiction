Somewhat, is pretty much canon, and its during Eclipse, but its really on the background. The only major difference is that Rose never meets Emmet and focuses her interest on Edward, but is rebuffed. It causes a bunch of problems between the family until Rose leaves them after they get back from the Volturi. Then she meets Harry.

Honestly, its my favorite crossover HPxTwilight and probably also my favourite Twilight fanfic, including source. Its a bit angsty heavy, so if thats an issue, I'm sorry.
