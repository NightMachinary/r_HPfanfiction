linkao3(The Dogfather)

linkao3(Stealing Harry)

Both brilliant, where Sirius and Remus raise harry and run away. They're both adorable I don't know what else to say! The Dogfather makes me cry. It follows them up till Harry's first year.

Stealing Harry is a bit more dramatic and has an Evil Peter who is very very good!!

Edit:: Also linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) is kinda similar? Sirius doesn't die in OoTP and him and Remus take on running the Order and keeping an eye on Harry. It's really good and a great look into what the Order did while Harry was at Hogwarts. not as much of a "Sirius raises harry" as the other two but still something along that lines.

All these stories are Wolfstar btw. But they focus more on the plot that the pairing (I'm aro i avoid fluff and smut ðŸ˜‹). It's treated as a "Oh btw Sirius and Remus are married now, here's the story" but you should be aware of that.
