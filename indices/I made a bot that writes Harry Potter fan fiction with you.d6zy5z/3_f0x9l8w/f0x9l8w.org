Trying to fill the woeful gap of Katie Bell/Snape fanfic out there. I am extremely pleased. Thanks for writing this!

Katie Bell looked lovingly at Snape. “I'm going to have to ask you to leave, Severus, but I think I know what you need. I've been thinking about it for a while. And I think I can give it to you.I think I can persuade you to come back.”

“I don't want to come back!” said Snape, his eyes twinkling. “I'm sorry, I don't want to come back!”

“You do want to come back, Severus,” said Bell, “but it's not your fault. It's not your fault that Dumbledore left you a job.”

“Look, Bell, I don't deserve it!” said Snape, looking more furious than ever. “You know what I've been doing all this time? I've been working for you!"

“This is a matter of principle,” said Bell, “not principle in principle!”

“It's not principle!” repeated Snape, and Bell looked even more confused. “You thought you could get me to do anything, you little pervert!”

“It's not you, it's me, Bell,” said Bell, and she looked even more shocked than Snape.

(And so ends their torrid & extremely confusing relationship.)
