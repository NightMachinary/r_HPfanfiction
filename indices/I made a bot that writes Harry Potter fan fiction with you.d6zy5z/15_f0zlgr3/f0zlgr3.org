“A bathrobe?” said Hermione, looking astonished. “But I thought you were supposed to be a woman!”

“Well, I can't be both, can I?” said Harry. “I'm a boy.”

Hermione stared at him, then said, “But you're a wizard!”

“I'm a normal boy,” said Harry. “I've only ever been a girl once, and that was when I was transformed into a baby basilisk.” He looked at Hermione. “Why do you think you're the only one who can't get rid of me?”

“ Because you don't exist,” said Hermione. “You don't exist at all.” She stared at him, and her eyes seemed to burn. “You don't exist in the body you 've been dressing as me, Harry, and you don't exist in any of the bodies you've been pretending to be.”

“But how could I be you if I've never been, or pretended to be, anything?” said Harry. “How could I be you if I never had a name?” He looked at Hermione, and she smiled.

“I've been pretending to be you all my life,” she said. “I've had your face, your voice, your eyes. I've pretended to be you all over the place.” She took a deep breath. “I'm you, Harry Potter.”

“But I'm you, too, Hermione,” said Harry. “I've been pretending to be you ever since I was a little boy.”

“We're not pretending anymore, Harry,” said Hermione. “You've got to be honest with yourself, Harry. You can't pretend anymore. You're real.”

But Harry wasn't listening. He was suddenly angry at Hermione too. “I'm not real, she's not real, we're not pretending anymore,” he said loudly.

“We can't stop pretending, Harry,” she said, looking suddenly as though she was trying to decide whether or not to continue crying. “We're the only ones who are.”

He looked away, trying to ignore the look of horror on the faces around him. “You can't stop pretending, Hermione,” he repeated. “You've got to be honest with yourself. You can't pretend you don't exist, because then you'll be admitting you're real.”

She looked at him strangely. “Harry, I'm right, you're not real.”

He looked at the empty chair in front of him. It was empty. He looked around, and there was no sign of life in the room.

“What's the matter?” said Ron, who was sitting next to Harry, staring at the empty chair.

“I thought I was dead,” said Harry.

“But I'm not dead, are you ?” said Ron, his eyes widening.

“No,” said Harry, “I just realized it. I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I think I've realized it. I've figured it out.” He looked at Ron, who looked even more bewildered.

“Harry, you're not real, you can't be real, you're a figment of my mind, you can't be me, you're just a figment of my imagination, you can't be me, you're just a figment of my imagination, you're a figment of my imagination, you can't be me, you're just a figment of my imagination, you can't be me, you're just a figment of my imagination, you' re just a figment of my imagination, you're just a figment of my imagination, you can't be me, you're just a figment of my imagination, you're just a figment of my imagination, you're just a figment of my imagination, you're just a figment of my imagination, you're just a figment of my imagination, you're just a....“
