This is either a great character study of Harry's horcrux or Tomarry slash.

Voldemort was near. “I'm sorry,” he said, and his eyes glittered.

“You're not sorry,” said Harry.

“I'm not sorry!” said Voldemort, and for the first time, his eyes were glittering.

“I've been thinking about you, and I'm glad I did. You're a great wizard, Harry --- what more could I want ?”

“We're the same,” said Harry.

“We're both a little slow, a bit rough around the edges, but we've got loads to teach the Ministry, they 've never been taught anything ---”

“We are not the Ministry of Magic,” said Voldemort, and his eyes were gleaming again. “You see, Minister Scrimgeour, the Dark Mark had its origins in the Ministry of Magic. The Dark Lord himself was once a Ministry employee, and he was the one who first recognized the power of the Dark Arts.”

“The Dark Lord?” asked Harry.

“ I don't think so,” said Voldemort. “He was never one to shy away from the light, was he?”

“No,” said Harry, “he was never one to shy away from the light.”

“But you are,” said Voldemort. “You were the one who saw the power of the Dark Arts in the Ministry of Magic. You were the one who saw the potential of the boy.” He looked at Harry with a penetrating eye. “You saw the potential to do great and terrible things together. ... You became a teacher at an early age, you were given the responsibility of protecting the wizarding world from the Dark Arts, and you did it ... until you were forced to retire at sixteen. ...”

“You did it,” said Harry again. “You stopped the Dark Arts from going off the deep end. You stopped dementors and the like. You even saved my life once.”

“You saved my life once,” said Voldemort, his voice rising ominously. “ You saved my life. You saved my life, even when I was a young man, when I was in danger of being killed by you. You saved my life, even when you were determined to make the death of a Muggle-born a crime worthy of your kind. You saved my life.”

“But you were too young then,” said Harry.

“Too young,” said Voldemort, and his voice became a low cackle. “ I was ten at the time. I was not yet ready, not yet brave enough. And so it was that I was taken from you, and sent to live with my father. And I was the youngest of the four. I was the only one who was not protected.”

“You saved my life,” said Harry again, “and my father's too.”

Voldemort's voice became a roar of laughter.
