I'm aware of this and yes when I did think of my CS minors, it wasn't even with job in mind.I wanted to concentrate on my majors so ML being tough for someone from outside CS especially, made my decision. However, I checked out fast.io, a pretty cool site especially for someone really passionate about ML. If I do end up taking ML in future, I'll take your suggestions, thanks!
