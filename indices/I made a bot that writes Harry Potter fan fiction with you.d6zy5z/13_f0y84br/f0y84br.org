Harry Potter and the Death Eater: (1212 words)\\
"And behold, for I had heard that the Death Eaters were coming, and that they were making their way to the castle, and that it was my job to stop them, and that I would have to kill you, and the other Death Eaters, and Snape, and all those who were with you, and I would not be blamed, and I would be rewarded for my part in the plan!”\\
Harry looked at her. “You thought I'd do it?"\\
“I certainly did,” said Hermione. “I thought I knew what you were planning, and I was right to have suspicions, and I was right to think you might try to do something stupid, and I was right to think you might be trying to ---”\\
“You're not trying to do anything stupid,” said Harry. “You just think you might have been the one who tipped off Voldemort.”\\
Hermione looked horrified. “I thought he might have been the one who did it,” she said, “that he might have been the one who knew how to make the Killing Curse.”\\
“He didn't know how to make it,” said Harry. “He was only a year older than you were, I took the wand from you one night before you died. He was trying to make a new wand.”\\
"You tried to make a new wand,” said Hermione, “how did you know?”\\
“I saw you make a new wand,” said Harry. “I was the one who found the old one and put it in a box.”\\
“What old wand?”\\
“The one that was the one who killed you.”\\
“And what did you put in a box with it?"\\
“The Killing Curse.”\\
“What d'you mean, you've got the Killing Curse in a box?”\\
“I've been keeping it there for ages.” He showed her the box, and Hermione stared at it.\\
“The Killing Curse,” she said, “is the key to all our problems. It's how we killed you. The only key to your demise.”\\
“But ---” Harry was staring at her, “we didn't kill you, we made you do it.”\\
She shook her head. “We didn't do it.” She looked at him seriously. “I don't think it was a good idea to kill you, Harry.”\\
“But it was our ---” Harry looked at the Death Eater. “It was our fault, we didn't do anything. We were stupid. We were stupid enough to trust Muggles. We were stupid enough to trust them with our lives.”\\
“But you were right,” said the Death Eater, and Harry felt a twinge of anger. “You were right. We're all stupid."\\
“Yeah, but we're not all Muggles,” said Harry. “I'm not stupid. I'm not stupid. I know I was stupid.” He looked at the other two. The Death Eater's tone was one of respect. Harry wondered whether he understood the horror of what he had said. “You're not stupid,” he repeated.\\
“I know I was stupid.”\\
“You weren't talking about me, Harry,” said Hermione. “You were talking about the Ministry of Magic.”\\
“Yeah, but the Ministry of Magic didn't do anything, it was a matter of time before Weasleys came back and we were attacked, and they didn't care, because they knew they were protected by the protections of the office and the protection of the wizarding world,” said Harry.\\
“So it was them against the world.”\\
“Well, it was the world,” said Hermione, “but the world's a very dangerous place, Harry.”\\
“Yeah, and it is,” said Harry. “I mean, we're not going to fight about who did it, are we?”\\
“No,” said Ron, who was watching Harry with a kind of strained amusement, “we're not. We don't want to take sides.”\\
“We're not taking sides either,” said Hermione, “we're just saying who did it.”\\
“You're being a bit paranoid,” said Ron. “It was a car-to-car attack. It was only the Dursleys who were hurt.”\\
“It wasn't a car-to-car attack,” said Hermione, “it was a van-to-van attack. Harry, we' re not going to fight you, we can't.”\\
“But ---” Harry glanced at the others. They all looked horrified.\\
“But what?” said Ron. “You don 't want to fight, do you?”\\
“Yeah, but we've got to take the Dursleys' word for it,” said Hermione, “that's what we 're trying to do.”\\
“But it was a car-to-car attack!” said Ron. “We've got to believe it was the Dementors who attacked, it's the only way we're going to get the truth.”\\
“It's not about the truth,” said Hermione. “It's about stopping dementors getting into the Dursleys' s home.”\\
“But how are we going to do that?” said Ron. “We don't have the wits. We've never been in a car before.”\\
“No one can teach you how to drive,” said Hermione. “You've got to learn how to read the signs.”\\
“But Harry's never read a book before!” said Ron. “He's never been to a bookshop!”\\
“He's got a copy of How to Improvise a Possession Detonator in his bag,” said the Death Eater. “That's the kind of person who uses a wand.”\\
“But what if we're caught?” said Ron. “What if we get caught?”\\
“You'll be in Azkaban,” said the Death Eater. “The Ministry will take you away, but they'll leave you a chance. You'll never be able to hurt a human again.”\\
“But what if we're wrong?” said Ron.\\
“What if we're right?” The Death Eater looked at Hermione. “You don't believe in curses, do you?” he said. “You don't believe in magic? But you're dead.”\\
“I don't believe in death,” said Hermione, her voice quivering. “I'm with you on that one, Death Eater.” She looked at Harry. “You're going to kill me, aren't you?”\\
“ I ---”\\
“I'm going to kill you,” said Harry. “I'll show you what real death looks like.”\\
He pulled the Killing Curse from the pouch on his belt and aimed it at the top of the Death Eater's head. The Killing Curse bounced off the Death Eater's head and hit the ground, splattering blood all over the floor. The Death Eater fell over backward, his face in his hands, and Harry pulled the Killing Curse out of his body. The Killing Curse hit the Death Eater in the chest, the force of which made him scream. Harry pulled the Killing Curse out of his body and aimed it at the Death Eater 's right ear. The Killing Curse flew through the air and hit the Death Eater's head. The Killing Curse hit the Death Eater's body, and the Killing Curse exploded, sending a cloud of dust and dirt all the way back up to the ceiling.\\
“You did it!” said Harry, pointing the Killing Curse at the Death Eater's head. “You killed him!”\\
The Death Eater's body fell limp. Harry looked over his shoulder. The Death Eater's body fell limp. Harry looked over his shoulder again. The Death Eater's body fell limp again. ... He had to do it. ... He had to save everyone. ...\\
“And you'll understand why very soon.”\\
“You can't kill me,” said the Death Eater, and Harry saw the fear in his eyes. “You can't"\\
“I didn't kill him,” Harry whispered. “I've just seen you kill another one. ...”\\
“You have to see this, Harry,” said Hermione, “it's the only way.”\\
“You're going to kill me too,” Harry repeated, and he felt a surge of terrible rage that he had never felt before. “You've got to go and save everyone.”\\
“But I can't,” said the Death Eater, and Harry saw the desperation in his eyes. “I've got to protect Ron.”\\
“I can't let you do it.”
