This is actually fantastic.

Harry entered the classroom , and he was astonished to see that all the class were staring at him. “What's the matter?” asked Harry, who was still wearing his school robes.

“I'm fine,” said Ron, who was sitting in the back row. “I'm still trying to get used to the idea that I'm not supposed to be here.”

“You're not supposed to be here! You're not even supposed to be in the classroom!” said Lavender. “You're supposed to be in the hospital wing with the rest of the first years --- with the Death Eaters!”

“I don't think I'm with the Death Eaters anymore,” said Ron. “I think I might've joined the Order of the Phoenix a while back, but I� ve never mentioned it to them.”

“So you never joined the Order,” said Lavender. “You just thought you were.”

“No,” said Harry. “I was with you that night, and I saw what you were doing. I saw what you were trying to do. And I saw what you were trying to do with the rest of the Order of the Phoenix.”

“We never heard what you were trying to do with the rest of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron. “We thought you were trying to do what Dumbledore had done, and kill your parents.”
