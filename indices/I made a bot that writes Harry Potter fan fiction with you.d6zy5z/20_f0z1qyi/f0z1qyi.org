Harry Potter and the Monster Within; or the one where no one knows what it means

His scar began to sense the chill of death. “I'm dead,” he said, and he walked away, out of sight. “The whole of Gryffindor House is in mourning,” said Dumbledore. “I don't know how you can say it, Harry, but I feel as though you have been poisoned. ...” “I've been poisoned,” said Harry, his mouth dry. “I was there. I saw what happened. I know what it means.” “But you don't know what it means,” said Dumbledore. “You haven't been there. You have no idea what it means. You don't know what it means at all.” “I know what it means,” said Harry, his voice shaking. “I know what it means, because I've been hurt by it.” Dumbledore looked down at his own hand, then at Harry. “You have been hurt,” he said, “and you must be punished.” “I' ve been hurt,” Harry repeated. “I've hurt people. I've hurt people.” “You've hurt more people than you know, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You've killed more people than you know.” Dumbledore lifted his wand. “I will punish you, Harry, as you punish me,” said Dumbledore. “I will give you a choice. You can continue to suffer and suffer and suffer and suffer until you give up, or you can give up now and I will punish you.” “I'll give up,” said Harry, his fists still clenched. “I'll give up.” Dumbledore raised his wand again. “You will kill me, Harry. I will return to this place and time and space and kill you.” “I'll do it,” said Harry. “I'll do it.” “Good,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I want you to imagine what it would be like for me to be standing here in this office, and you'll be the only wizard alive, and I'll have a sword in my hand, and you'll be able to talk to me like you'd talked to me in the Chamber of Secrets. And I'll tell you, Harry, that you're not very smart. You can try and defend yourself against me, but you won't be able to.” Harry looked up. He could hear the distant thud of the door closing. He was going to be murdered. His heart was beating very fast. He wanted to run. He wanted to scream, but he didn't dare. He didn't want to appear weak. He didn't want to appear stupid. And then the door opened again. This time it was Snape, and he was holding the sword in his hand. Harry stood there, dumbstruck, stunned, and then --- Snape was holding the sword in his hand. He was laughing. He was very pleased with himself. He was showing Harry the very worst thing that could happen to him. He was going to show him exactly what he was afraid of and then laugh as he killed him.... He was going to show Harry exactly what he was afraid of. ... Snape was going to kill him. ... Snape was going to kill him. ... Snape was going to kill him. ... “I'm going to kill you, Potter!” he said, and he made the most horrible, almost sickening noise that Harry had ever heard. ... He was going to kill him. ... Harry stood there, dumbstruck, stunned, and he knew at last the monster that had been inside him was going to be killed. ... He stood there, and as the words that had just escaped his mouth floated to the surface of his mind, he realized that he was standing in the place where Voldemort had died, and Voldemort had killed him. ... He stood there, and he saw Voldemort's face, and he was going to kill him. ... “You're going to kill me, Potter!” he said, and he held out his hand. Harry took it. “I'm sorry,” he said, and he held out his own. “We'll die together.”
