The Prompt: Harry Potter wanted to his change his appearance and name and escape the country.

(I changed some tenses to make it somewhat coherent)

--------------

He needed to find a new name, a new identity. He needed a place to stay, a new name. He thought that if he could just get a new wand, he could find a safe place to call home.

--------------

Harry had never been able to find a wand that was as good as the one his mother had given him. He had never found a wand that would help him. He had never found a wand that would help him so badly. But now... He had a wand, and it would save him so many times. He would never be able to get rid of it, and he would never want to get rid of it. He was sure that he would never be able to get rid of it, that it would always be there, waiting to be used. It had been there, waiting for him. And now, at last, it was his.

“I've found the wand that will protect me,” said Harry, his voice shaking as he spoke. “It'll help me. It's mine.”

He raised his wand, and the wand that had been waiting for him, the wand that had been waiting for him all along, the wand that he had been trying to get away from, but had failed to do all along, the wand that he had been so sure would never be able to help him at all, the wand that he had been so afraid of...

And he felt the wand touch his forehead, and his heart was lifted, and his scar hurtled through his fingers, and he felt the wand leave him... And he was free, and everything was right again... but he was not free, he was not right, he was not... he had been wrong, he had been stupid, he had been a coward... He had been a coward, he had been a coward who had been stupid...

“Harry,” Hermione said, her voice very high and very cold, “you'd better get a grip on yourself.”

“I don't think I can,” said Harry.

He rubbed his forehead, his scar was starting to burn again, and he looked around at the others, and he said, “We're supposed to be the ones who break the rules, not the other way around.”

“That's exactly what we thought,” said Ron, “You're the one who needs a break, Harry. We're supposed to be the ones breaking the rules.”

Harry and Ron looked at each other.

“I'm sorry,” said Harry, “but I think I'm going to have to go and see Professor McGonagall about this.” He turned to go.

Ron looked at Hermione. “What about Harry?” said Ron. “I'm sure he's fine,” said Hermione, “He's just been really stressed out.”

They were both right. Harry had been really stressed out. He had been talking to Ron and Hermione in a very high-pitched voice; they had both been listening intently. He had been trying to explain to them what had happened, and how he and Voldemort had come to blows. He had been trying to make them understand that he was not going to lay the blame for his own defeat at the door of Voldemort's wand, but that he and Voldemort had both made some mistakes that day, and that he would have to learn from them. He had been trying to make them understand that he needed them more than ever, and that Voldemort had been the one who had called him to this.

“And now, I think, I think we ought to make a deal,” said Dumbledore. “You must promise to return to Hogwarts after your term's end, and to tell me the truth about Voldemort. Tell me everything you know about the Dark Lord. “I'll do that,” said Harry, and after a pause, “but I don't want to tell you everything. I don't think I can.” “You can,” said Dumbledore. “You can tell me everything you know about the Dark Lord, and Voldemort will never be able to hurt you again.” “I don't want to tell you everything,” said Harry. “I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can live like this. I'm not like you. I don't deserve to be like you." “You're not like him,” said Dumbledore. “You're different. You're brave, you're smart, and you're clever. You're not like him.” “I don't think I'm like him,” said Harry. “I'm different. I'm smarter, stronger, and more noble than he is.” “You're not like him,” said Dumbledore again. “You think you're better than him. You think you can beat him.” Harry looked up at Dumbledore. �
