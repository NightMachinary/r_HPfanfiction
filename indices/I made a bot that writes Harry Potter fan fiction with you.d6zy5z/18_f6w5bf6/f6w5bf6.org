Voldemort was near. Harry felt the cold metal of the Cruciatus Curse press down on his insides, and the pain in his scar was growing worse. The pain that was making him feel the pain in the world, the pain that was making him kill. Harry knew he had to do it. He had to do it. He had to kill the man who had made him feel the pain in the world. He had to kill him. He had to kill him. He had to kill...

“HARRY!” Harry felt a jolt of terrible strength in his scar. He was going to do it. “I'm going to kill you!” The pain in his scar was growing worse and worse. He could feel the blood coursing through his body, could feel it pulsing in his chest. He was going to kill himself.

He had to kill... “You're dead,” said the voice behind him, and it was the very last thing Harry expected. He fell to the ground, his hands over his face.

He opened his eyes. He was lying in a bed in a hospital wing. His eyes were open. He was wearing the glasses. He was holding a glass of water. He was holding it in his other hand. He was holding the wand.

He was breathing. He was alive. He was Harry James Potter. “I'm sorry,” he said. “I didn't mean to kill you.” “I didn't kill you,” said the voice again. “I'm sorry, Harry.” “What d'you mean?” said the other, standing up. “What did you say?”

The other Harry was very tall. He was wearing glasses. He was carrying something. He was holding a wand. He was holding the wand. “The wand,” said the other Harry, “that's what I was going to use to kill you.” “And what did you take?” said the other, still standing. “A bottle.” “The bottle,” said the other Harry, “I took the wand.” “Oh, really!” said the other Harry. “And what did you do with it?” “I --- I ---” the other Harry looked bewildered. “I don't know. I don't know.” “Then you'll have to try harder than usual,” said the caretaker, who was now glaring at the other Harry. “I expect you'll have to try harder than usual in the coming weeks.” “I don't know what you're talking about,” said the other Harry quickly. “I'm sorry.” “Don't be sorry!” growled the caretaker. “Harry Potter is not going to be asked to do anything stupid like this again.” The other Harry looked even more bewildered. “So you're going to have to try harder than usual, too?” he said. “I like being told how to do things!” The caretaker glared at him. “You do like it, don't you, Harry Potter..."
