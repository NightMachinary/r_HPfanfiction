*I'm Sorry, Harry*

“I'm going to kill you,” said Harry.

“I'm going to kill you, too,” said Crookshanks. “I've got a plan.”

“What plan?”

“I've got a plan,” said Crookshanks, and he raised his fist. “I'll show you my real body---”

“You don't have to do anything.”

Crookshanks raised his hand and pointed at his belly. Harry saw the blackened, scabbed hand disappear into his intestines; Crookshanks raised his own fist and threw it, too, into his guts. Harry saw his body disappear, too, and felt a surge of rage that he had never felt before. He had never been violent before, but he had never felt so angry before. He ran at Crookshanks, arms outstretched, fists clenched, and the two of them were fighting so fiercely that the sound of their voices was drowned by the roar of the crowd.

Harry saw a hand smash a window and saw a small, bloodstained owl fall through the gap between the tables onto the floor, then a second window smashed, and a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, and a seventh, and a seventh, and Hermione was screaming, “Owls! Owls! Owls everywhere, owls everywhere!”

Harry was too busy trying to break open the owl's beak to hear what was going on around him. He was so frightened that he didn't notice that Malfoy was standing on his own head, trying to eat it. Harry looked around at the people who were still there, and saw that they were all staring at him. He saw Hermione's eyes widen, and Ron's, and Ginny's, and Seamus's, and Dean's, and Neville's, and Ginny's, and Seamus's mother. Harry didn't know what to do. He had never seen his mother so scared.

He turned back to the door, and with a loud bang, the door flew open and the rest of the school burst into flames.
