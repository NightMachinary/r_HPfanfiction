*HARRY POTTER & THE THING HE WANTED TO TELL HEDWIG*

Hedwig flew into the air and landed on the floor.\\
“I've been wanting to tell you something,” said Harry, and he looked up at her.\\
“What?” she said, and immediately she looked startled. “What are you talking about?”\\
“I don't think I can tell you,” said Harry.\\
“You can?”\\
“No,”\\
Hedwig scoffed and flew back down, and Harry saw her fly back up again, and he was so angry he wanted to hit her with a large, heavy fist.\\
But Hedwig didn't seem to mind. She was staring at Harry with such a mixture of pleasure and stun that it was as though he was a master of the deadly art of flattery. Harry felt as though he'd won an important prize. He could tell that Hedwig had been thinking the same way.\\
Suddenly, Harry's anger seemed to vanish. He had won.”I don't care what you've done,” he said, and Hedwig gave a tiny, piteous sigh.\\
Ron was grinning at Harry.“You're the best, Harry.”\\
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, “but I don't think I've ever been more grateful that the rest of the tournament's taking place.”\\
Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked down the stone steps into the chilly evening air. The Quidditch World Cup was starting, and the tournament was about to get much weirder, because the champions of the four Quidditch teams were now facing each other.\\
“What're we playing?” said Hermione, looking around for a good idea.\\
“Quidditch,” said Ron\\
The match started in earnest at the end of the last Quidditch match of the tournament, and the match ended at the end of the last game of the tournament, because that was the only thing that mattered.\\
A bludger killed a hundred and twenty-two people, so nobody really died. But the death of a hundred and twenty-two people was still terrible, because it meant that the tournament was going to end in a draw. Harry and Ron were now the only ones left, and they had just one thing on their minds; they were going to steal the golden Snitch from the giantess, and steal it now. They were going to steal it now. 'We're going to steal it now!' Harry was saying to Ron, and Ron was muttering the same thing.\\
The giantess was sobbing into her hands, and she was crying so hard that the tears were splattering on the floor.\\
'I'm so sorry,' she said, wiping her face on her hand, and she threw the Snitch to Harry. 'I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to -'\\
'It's okay,' said Harry, and he held up the Snitch in triumph.\\
Later that night, the giantess was lying on her bed, weeping over the Snitch. Harry was sitting beside her, and he was so angry at her that he could hardly speak. He wanted to hit her, he wanted to kick her, he wanted to tell her to get back to where she came from. No, that wouldn't be enough. He had to kill her. He had to kill her now. He had to kill her, and he had to do it now. He had to. A great wave of cold rage swept over him. He had waited so long. He had to kill her. He had to. He had to. He had to. He had to kill her, and he had to. He had to.\\
He raised the Snitch high in the air, and his voice echoed through the empty castle. 'I have to kill her, no one else can. I have to. I have to.'\\
He had to. He had to.\\
He raised the Snitch again, and his voice echoed through the ruined walls. 'No one else can. I have to. I have to. I have to.'\\
He had to. He had to. He had to.\\
He raised the Snitch again, and the voice echoed through the castle. 'No one else can. I have to. I have to. I have to.'\\
He had to. He had to. He had to.\\
He raised the Snitch again, and the voice echoed through the castle. 'No one else can. It ends now.'\\
He pulled out his wand and pointed it at the giantess. 'Avada Kedavra.' said Harry, and the giantess' head exploded, scattering the castle. Harry, Ron & Hermione all stared, their mouths open, at the explosion.\\
'It's over!' Harry said loudly, and finally turned to Hedwig.\\
“I've been wanting to tell you something,”, he said. “I've been wanting to tell you for ages, but I can't do it, I'm too afraid. I've got to tell you something.”\\
“It was a good thing that you came along,” said the owl in a hushed voice. 'We wouldn't have been able to hear you.”\\
Hedwig, who had been pecking her head excitedly, was now staring at the giantess with narrowed eyes. Harry, Ron and Hermione also looked at her.\\
“She's my sister,” said Harry. “She's my best friend.”
