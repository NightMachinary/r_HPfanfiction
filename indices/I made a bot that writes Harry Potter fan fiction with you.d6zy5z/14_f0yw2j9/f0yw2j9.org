*The Harry Potter Defense*

Harry Potter, however, is a different case. In Harry Potter, the defendant was not charged with a crime in connection with the crimes of which he was convicted, and the government did not attempt to prove that the defendant's crimes were part of a common scheme or plan. See United States v. Smith, 624 F.3d 725, 731 (4th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he government need not prove a ‘common scheme or plan to convict a defendant of a § 846 offense.”). In Harry Potter, however, the government did attempt to prove that the defendant's crimes were part of a common scheme or plan, and the defendant did not object to the government's evidence. See id. at 731-32.
