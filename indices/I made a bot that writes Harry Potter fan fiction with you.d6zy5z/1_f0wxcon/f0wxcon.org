Played around for a bit this is what I got:

Harry kneeled down before the campfire. “I thought you were dead,” he said softly. “I thought I saw ---”

“I wasn't dead!”

“I know that,” said Harry, “but it still ---” He looked at the fire. The flames had gone out. The light in the hollow was now flickering slowly, and the pale moon was slowly rising over the sea of stars.

"You heard what Dumbledore said,” said Sirius. “The stone was too strong. It was too strong for you.”

“I saw it,” said Harry. “I saw what you were doing.� Sirius looked at him. “You saw what you were doing was wrong?”

“It was my fault,” said Harry. “I didn't know. I didn't care. I just wanted to get out of there. I just wanted to go back to the Leaky Cauldron.”

“You're going to have to go back to the Leaky Cauldron,” said Sirius. � You know what they're doing there, don't you? They're making you fight the other prisoners. You're not supposed to talk to them, you know.”

“I don� t want to fight,” said Harry. “I don't want to fight. I don't want to see them torturing the other prisoners.”

“You don't understand, Harry,” said Sirius. “You are the only one who can help us. You can talk to them.”

“How can I help?” said Harry. “I'm your father, Sirius, and I'm your father's best friend.”

“You're too late,” said Sirius, staring at Harry. “You were already helping us. You've found the Philosopher's Stone.”

“But what's the point of helping if we don't use it?” said Harry. “You said I'd have to fight, and I didn't.” Sirius looked at him as though he'd expected it. “You're going to have to fight,” he said quietly, “because we don't want you to. We're the only ones who can get you out of this place.”

“But I can't!” said Harry.

“We'll make sure of that,� said Lupin. “I'll go and meet them in the Pensieve.” Harry and Lupin left the room. Harry looked at the door. It was locked. He tried the handle. It was jammed.
