So I tried this with very minimal input and it was pretty...ah...dark. Maybe I should turn it into something.

  Ron and Luna were sitting together on the floor, their heads together, their eyes closed, their noses pressed against the side of their heads. Their breathing was shallow and shallow.

  “You know, Luna,” said Harry, “I think I'd better go and get my wand.”

  Luna nodded, still staring into the corner, her eyes half-closed.

  “I think you'll be okay,” said Harry.\ nHe pulled the Invisibility Cloak from his bag, put it over his head, and hurried out of the room, leaving Luna and Ron alone.

  The sun was sinking lower and lower over the horizon as they walked, and the sky outside the window was a deep, deep, dark blue. Harry could feel the cold, hard rain pounding his face as he walked, and he had a horrible feeling that he was going to get wet. At last, he reached the end of the garden and turned to look at the sky.

  “I'm really going to have to go outside,” he said. “I don't think I can stand it much longer.”

  He was right. The sky outside the window was completely dark, and the rain was pouring down on him from every direction. He could hear the voices of the other schoolchildren outside, but they were all yelling and screaming at the same time. He was so wet he was starting to feel sick. He had never felt so alone. He walked quickly toward the window, but the rain was still falling on him, and he couldn't see anything through the glass. He turned the glass around, and it was gone.

  “I can't stand it anymore,” he said, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. “I can't stand it anymore.”

  He stood up and stretched. The rain was falling harder than ever on his face, but he was still very pale. He wanted to cry, but he didn't dare. He didn't want to be seen crying. He was afraid of the man in the mirror, of what he would say. He was a coward, he knew it. He had no one to blame but himself. He sat down on the edge of his bed, and as the rain fell harder and harder. Suddenly, he broke down in tears. “I'm so sorry,” he said, wiping his face on the back of his hand. “I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!”

  Meanwhile, Luna and Ron were sitting together on the edge of the bed, tears still dripping from their faces.

  “What did you say to her, before?” asked Ron.

  Luna winced. "I told her to get out of the way,” she said. “I'll be honest with you, I was worried she'd come back. ... She was acting all weird. ...” She wiped her eyes again. �

  It's all my fault,” she added defensively. “It's my fault she's dead. I'm so sorry.”

  Ron looked into Luna's tearstained eyes and felt a great surge of sympathy for her. It was hard to imagine how Luna could have been so stupid, but somehow he knew that Luna had no chance of proving him wrong. “I'm sorry,” he said, � "for bringing it up. It wasn't your fault, Luna."

  "Tell that to Harry," she whispered, more tears leaking out of her eyes.

  "Tell me what?" asked Harry, standing in the doorway soaking wet with a tear stained face. "What did you do to Luna?” "I --- I didn't know what to do," Luna cried. "I didn't know what to do.”

  "Exactly," Harry said. "It's no more your fault than it is mine, or Ron's. We didn't know."

  "But we didn't know what to do!" said Luna. “We were stupid! We were cruel! We were terrible people, we deserve it, we deserve it, we're going to suffer-"

  "It's no more your fault than it is mine," said Harry again, and with another loud crack he fell to the floor.

  “Luna,” he said, wiping his face on his hands, “Ron... You guys...you made a terrible mistake, you know that's all.”

  Finally, Ron met Harry's eyes. "Mate.."

  "I know, me too."

  The three stood together in a circle, silent tears streaking down their faces, and hugged.

  "What happens now?" Luna whispered.

  "Everything changes," Ron told her.

  "Yes," agreed Harry. "But we stick together. Until the end."
