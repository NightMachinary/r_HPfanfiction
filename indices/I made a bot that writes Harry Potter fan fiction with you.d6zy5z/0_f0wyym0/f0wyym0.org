Harry Potter and the Recursion of the Great Hall:

Voldemort was near. “We're in the middle of the Great Hall!” he yelled, pointing his wand at the Gryffindor table. “Get out of the way!”

Harry and Ron both jumped. “Harry, we're in the middle of the Great Hall!” Hermione yelled. “We've got to get out of here!”

“We're in the middle of the Hall,” said Ron, who was still shouting. “Get out of the way!”

“We're in the middle of the Hall,” said Harry, still pointing at the Gryffind or table. “We've got to get out of there!”

“We're in the middle of the Hall,” said Ron. “We've got to get out of here!”

“We've got to get out of there,” said Ron. “We've got to get out of here!” He and Hermione both looked at the Hufflepuff table.

“We've got to get out of there,” said Ginny. “We've got to get out of here!” She and Luna both looked at the Ravenclaw table.

And, well, it just continues like that. I was personally shocked by the revelation that they're in the lake
