Indy!Harry fic #4,045

Dumbledore gave a malicious smirk, a twinkle in his eye.“You are not to tell me what to do,” he said, and for a moment there was a terrible pause, and then he said, “I am to decide where you go and when, and Dumbledore will show you how to do it.”

Harry felt his face burning. He had been told that he would have to go to the hospital wing, and that he would have to stay there all year. He had been told that he would have to stay at Hogwarts for the rest of his life. He felt sick to his stomach. He had never been offered such a dangerous decision in his life. He looked around at the other two and felt a terrible sense of betrayal.

“ Dumbledore's going to decide where I go and when!” he said angrily. “He'll decide who I marry!”

“Harry,” said Hermione, “he's got very little choice.”

“But how can I marry someone who's going to live here all year?”

“You know what, Harry?” said Hermione, and for the first time, Harry saw her eyes twinkle. “I think you ought to learn Occlumency.”

“But ---” he looked at her, terrified, “I don't want to be stuck here all year.”

“You don't want to be stuck here?” said Hermione, astonished. “You want to be able to leave at any time?”

“I don't want to be stuck here!” said Harry, even more astonished. “I'm going to help Sirius escape!”

“You don't want to be stuck here all year?” said Hermione, her heart beating very fast. “Harry, you're going to be stuck here because you don't want to be here!”

"But ---” said Harry. “I don't want to be here! I'm going to find Sirius, I'm going to get him!”

“You don't understand!” said Hermione, tears in her eyes. “Harry, you' re going to be in so much danger!”

“I know,” said Harry. “I'll be back. I'll find Sirius.” He looked around at the other two, and they were all looking at him too. He was going to have to fight them all at once. “I'll find Sirius.”

“You don't have to, Harry.” said Hermione, preparing her wand. Ron quickly followed. They left the Great Hall, down a narrow passageway, and into the entrance hall.

“Ready?” said the headmaster, raising a tall, dark wizard's hat. Ron and Hermione were both holding the horn to the door. Harry could feel his heart beating very fast. He could hear the teachers coming in. ... He had to find Sirius. ... He had to find him now.

“Ready?” said the headmaster again. “Ready?” The teachers came in slowly. Harry could see the look of panic on their faces. He looked around at the door, and the teachers were there too. They were all wearing the same thing: a very tight, tight-fitting, very dangerous-looking cloak.

“Ready?” said the headmaster. “Ready?”

“Ready,” came the deep, gruff voice of Professor McGonagall.
