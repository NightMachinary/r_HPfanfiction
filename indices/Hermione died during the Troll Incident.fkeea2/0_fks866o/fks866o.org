Now, this is in no way shape or form a recommendation for the abomination that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/2/For-Love-of-Magic]] , but it does indeed have Hermione dying from the troll. I've seen a few other fics who did this, but I'm afraid I don't remember them and "Hermione gets crushed by a troll club" is probably not a proper category of fanfiction (although I'm sure it's a tag on Ao3 where tags are at least 5 words long...).
