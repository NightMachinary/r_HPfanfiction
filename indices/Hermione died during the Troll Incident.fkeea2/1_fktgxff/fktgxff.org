There's linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) where she is grievously injured and the damage suffered by her brain leaves her with a speech impediment. She survives though and leaves Hogwarts, studying magic through private tutors.

In this story, Harry never attended Hogwarts. It was Ron and Neville who went looking for her but arrived too late. Dumbledore wasn't fired for this incident but the events in the next few years force him to resign.
