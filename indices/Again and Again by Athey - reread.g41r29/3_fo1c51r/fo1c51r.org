Yeah, A Cadmean Victory, it was my favorite fanfiction back in the day, it was like the best thing since sliced bread, I read it today and is not awful, just kinda meh

about " *Again and Again",* imo it has its moments, I love the "first" meeting between Harry and Dumbledore and when Harry reveals to Snape what he is. Unfortunately, I don't really like slash so I stopped reading when the focus started to shift in that direction
