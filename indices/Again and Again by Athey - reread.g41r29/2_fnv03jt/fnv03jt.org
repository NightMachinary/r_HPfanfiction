I'm reading it now (for the first time) but I don't think I'm going to finish it. I was able to read it for a while just because I wanted to get to the part where harry and tom get together, but I agree with you that it's quite full of tropes. Now that they've gotten together, and now that they have, that tension is pretty much gone for me. And its abandoned, so I'm not sure I can justify reading the whole 300k just to have an unfinished ending.
