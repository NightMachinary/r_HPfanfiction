Yes! I recently rediscovered linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4816968/1/Do-Not-Meddle-In-The-Affairs-Of-Wizards]]) which I loved ten years ago, it was my favourite 'Harry is betrayed/goes to Azkaban' fic by /far/.

I found it again around Christmas I think and OMG... So cringy, so awful... Every single time Dumbledore is mentioned it's 'Dumbledork'...

Yep
