Thought you were settled on Iris.

Lilith isn't bad for distinctiveness from other fem-Harrys, but the Biblical reference makes it seem like she's the witch of all witches, or a goth-girl attempt at such. Lila is good, though using it a nickname for something frumpy or otherwise unwanted might work better.

Or you could go with Daisy.
