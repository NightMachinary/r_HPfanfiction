It's a bit of backstory that might never be told, unless the scene revealing it was useful in further defining her character or relationship. Is it needed? Is it funny? Otherwise it's superfluous and readers will wonder why you wasted two paragraphs on it.

Just call her Lila because it makes sense to you. If I ever write a next-gen fic, Lily Luna Potter is going to be called Lilu [pronounced Lee-Loo]. Multipass!
