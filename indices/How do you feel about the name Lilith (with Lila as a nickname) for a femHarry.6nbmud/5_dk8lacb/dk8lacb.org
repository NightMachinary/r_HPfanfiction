I think that fem!Harry would probably have a normal British name. I mean, James and Lilly named their son "Harry," not "Lucifer" or "Prospero" or "Nightshade" or anything crazy or exotic like that.

I think we're looking at this from a meta perspective, so we're trying to think of epic sounding names befitting of The Choosen Oneâ„¢, but James and Lily hadn't read the books --- they didn't know that their child was the protagonist. As far as they were concerned, their child was just a normal kid, and most normal kids have normal names. Of course, what's normal in the wizarding world isn't exactly normal for us, but Lily /was/ a muggleborn.

I know we all want Fem!Harry to have a badass magical name befitting her status as a prophesied hero, but I think it's much more in character for James and Lily to name her something boring, ordinary and British, like Sarah or Alice. Iris and Lilith are the sort of names you'd give a DnD character, not your own child.
