I'm not saying Iris isn't a beautiful name, but it's just not the sort of thing British parents were naming their kids in the 1980's. It's [[https://www.behindthename.com/name/iris/top/england-wales][very modern]].

And I unfortunately can't think of Liliana without associating it with [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=235597][MTG]].

But honestly, I've never stopped reading a fanfiction just because I didn't like a characters name, so this really isn't that big a deal. Fanfiction writers should just choose whatever they like best.

However, if we were to ask JK Rowling what Lilly and James would name their daughter, I highly doubt the answer would be Iris, Lilith or Liliana.
