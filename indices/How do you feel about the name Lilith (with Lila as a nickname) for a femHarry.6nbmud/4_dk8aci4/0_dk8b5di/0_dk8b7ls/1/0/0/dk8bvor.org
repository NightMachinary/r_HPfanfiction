That's why I said they only adapted secular aspects of certain Christian holidays. So muggleborns coming in would call it Christmas and nothing else, because they're little kids obsessed with the holiday that gets them presents. Who doesn't like presents? That idea spreads. But certain traditions, such as Yule, stick around.

The whole thou shalt not suffer a witch to live thing would I think make them anti-Christian, so they wouldn't care about using a name a religious muggle might not like. If that's the case, then only adapting secular aspects of holidays still makes sense because it leaves the whole religious aspect behind.

And not everyone gets a godfather or godmother at a christening. They can be secular too nowadays and not meant to help religiously guide the child.

But anyway, this is getting away from the original question the thread starter asked. It seems like some like the name and others have strong religious connotations with it that would keep them from liking it.
