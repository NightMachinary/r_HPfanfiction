In my headcanon the wizarding world doesn't know much about Christianity, despite adopting secular aspects of certain holidays like Christmas. That's why the Yule ball is called the Yule Ball and not the Winter or Christmas Ball. So James and others from the wizarding world wouldn't associate the name Lilith with a demon.
