James was a pureblood who probably wouldn't even know the demon unless Lily told him, and I doubt Lily was a catholic. I mean, the magical world can kinda crush a lot of people's belief in that sorta thing. What's turning water into wine when you can multiply any wine or food?

It's not like she'd face any prejudice for her name in the magical world. I know a Lilith in real life and she's rarely ever had people say something rude to her because of it. Some people have brought up the demon but no one has really said she was evil because of her name. I mean, naming your kid Adam and Eve doesn't mean anything.
