It's dead, unfortunately, but worth a read: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/704082][/Switch/ by corvidae9]]. It's on the lower end of the crack scale, with most of the characters behaving as you might expect them to given the circumstances. The circumstances being the Weasley twins playing a prank on Hogwarts by drugging the Sorting Hat. Everyone gets sorted randomly.

Another fun was is the "Nude Quidditch Game" which is the definition of a crack-fic.

One that I've read several times, and is still being actively updated is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12355543/1/][/One Punch Wizard/ by MrWriterWriter]], which is actually a crossover between /One Punch Man/ and /Harry Potter/. Maybe I just have a terrible sense of humor but I found it quite funny.
