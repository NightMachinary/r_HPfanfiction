There's The Wendell that Wasn't. It's a short story and it's hilarious. linkffn(4396574)

I also remember this story as quite funny, though I read it more than 5 years ago (and my teenage humor wasn't what I'd call refined). There are 2 follow-up stories. linkffn(2533891)

If you happen to speak French I have some funny ones too! (More than in English actually)

I hope I linked everything correctly!
