Yeah, it's a weird setup. My sense is that wizards have had their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition][demographic transition]] centuries, perhaps millennia ago, so their population has been stable for a long time; but that would mean that the Muggle-Wizard ratio has increased dramatically over the past century or two, so you'd have more Muggleborns relative to wizardborns than historically; but there are so few of them now, why would they even be on Salazar's radar back at the Hogwarts's founding?

One possibility might be the Statute of Secrecy: before it, wizards interbred with Muggles much more---and that included "illegitimate" children, who would show up as "muggleborn". After the statute, the frequency of wizard genes (however defined) in the Muggle pool dropped. This would be because any Muggleborn (or illegitimate half-blood) would get snatched up and assimilated into the wizard society, removing their genes from the Muggle gene pool. So, while there are more Muggles relative to wizards, their individual chances of producing a Muggleborn are much lower.
