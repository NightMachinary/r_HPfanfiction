By what metric? Canon/the books? In that case, Rowling's classlist is representative, so you get a ratio of 40:40:20 pureblood:halfblood:muggleborn (with the "official" definition of pureblood, so all magical grandparents, not whatever the Malfoys would postulate).

In any other case: Whatever you want to make up.
