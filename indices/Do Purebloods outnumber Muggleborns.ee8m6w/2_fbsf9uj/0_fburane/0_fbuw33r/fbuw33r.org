That would be the implication, yes. But I'd venture it's all sorts of confusing in practice -- see the Sirius quote OP referenced, about how there are little "purebloods" left. That has to be some other kind of definition, in which a pureblood family is one that only ever married other purebloods (or was skillful in hiding outliers), and of course by that definition, the Potters aren't Purebloods and won't be for a long while.

And then, finally, you can make a case that some care more about /family history/ than actual "pure blood", so the name Potter having been around for centuries makes Harry a "pureblood" by virtue of his name.
