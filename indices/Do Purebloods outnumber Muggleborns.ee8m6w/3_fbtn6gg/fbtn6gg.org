If you go by the common definition of pure-blood = all-magical grandparents, then the vast majority of wizards would be pure-bloods. Consider the example of Lily Potter: her son was a half-blood, her grandchildren are pure-bloods. So the "impurity" which a Muggleborn introduces into a family disappears after a single generation, unless the children go and marry another Muggle/Muggleborn.
