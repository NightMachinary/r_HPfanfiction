"10 generations pure" are pretty rare, only a few inbred families. "all 4 grandparents magical" are a lot more common and call themselves pure whenever it suits them. Those and halfbloods (not pure but at least one magical parent) make up the majority of the population, while muggleborns with no close magical ancestry at all are also quite rare.
