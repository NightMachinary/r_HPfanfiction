I generally think of “pureblood” as having a few different definitions: the most liberal, where it's just a child of two magicals; the most conservative, where it's someone with no muggle ancestry at all (supposedly); and the compromise position of all-magical grandparents which is sometimes mentioned by Rowling.

In the sense of simply having two magical parents, they are probably a very significant majority; I can't imagine muggle-magical relationships being common (something like Dean's parents' situation would be the usual story, I expect), so it would just come down to the incoming muggleborns of the generation. That doesn't prevent purebloods from “dying out” in the traditionalist sense, though---with the population explosion and vanishing gap in material conditions between worlds it seems very likely that people would care less and less about purging their family tree in the way that is needed to maintain a pureblood image. There might only be a few families left doing that by the start of canon.

I can't find the calculations I used but I believe I went with a ~10% muggleborn ratio based on Hogwarts students, with that being a relatively recent development (it used to be lower). Children of muggles and magicals would be very rare, so halfbloods by the grandparent rule would be ~30% or so. This means the world is 60% ‘pureblood,' which explains the general apathy towards muggleborn rights we see in canon, but again most of them don't care about their family history like the Blacks and Malfoys. This matches decently closely to an obvious real world equivalent---white people have an outright majority in many countries, and as such racial issues often go unaddressed, but outright white supremacy is still relatively rare.
