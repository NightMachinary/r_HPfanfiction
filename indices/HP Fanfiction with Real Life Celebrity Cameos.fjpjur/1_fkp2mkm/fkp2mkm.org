Oh! I forget the story name and author, but someone did a few short fics where the trio, Sirius, and Serverus were stuck living in #12 so they started a movie night. Lupin was free to come and go so he would pick up the movies. Each movie had the actor of someone watching that night (example that the author didn't use so no spoilers: Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street would have worked for Serverus, Bellitrix, and Peter). I know it's not exactly what you are looking for but kinda cute. I don't remember anything else about the stories to tell you if there were pairings or what not.
