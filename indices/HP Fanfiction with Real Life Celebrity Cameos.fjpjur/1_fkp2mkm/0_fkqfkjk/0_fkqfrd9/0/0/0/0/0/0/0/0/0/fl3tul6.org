Ah, my condolences for your loss, Puck. Always sucks, losing a beloved pet. I do love the image of a cat in tiny armour. That would've been totally adorable. (Full disclosure, I am picturing the Steel Horse Armour from Oblivion here :D).

Ah, Bokmal, that chaotic bastard. I still remember the day I found out it just meant 'Book Language'. :D

I don't read it myself, but it's on the list of things to do before I die. I've contented myself with translations for now and a lot of textbook checking to cover the Kennings and references and such that just do not translate well at all.

Why limit yourself? In this time of Pandemic, do both! :)
