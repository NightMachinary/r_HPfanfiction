I admit, I'm not a believer myself, but I hope you do see him. And damn. Sounds like one gorgeous floof ball.

No, that's all correct. I can try dig out some of my reference texts on that, but from what I remember it's all true. I would emphasise that it's more of a written thing than a spoken thing - the spoken version has little to no standardisation across the country and thus is highly dialectical (meaning each region has different pronunciation or grammar or vocabulary specific to it), though it has what wikipedia tells me is called 'mutual intelligibility', which means that people using those different dialects can mostly understand one another (did not know it was called that, though it seems pretty logical and I hope I could've guessed it if pressed).

If memory serves, Duolingo is Scottish Gaelic, but I'd have to take the course and check (I grew up in Scotland, so I've a few phrases and words I've picked up from friends there over the years - enough to recognise, but not to converse, unfortunately).

I'm mostly trying to write and catching up with the TV, movies, books, and audio-stuff I missed while I was in Uni. I'm trying to learn to draw, but it's slow-going (I run D&D games regularly and I'm trying to get competent enough to draw character art and map-pieces and such). Oh, and I did learn how to iron properly last weekend, which I'm slightly embarrassed it took me until 23 to do. I was ironing before, mind, just... badly. I found out that half my pleated shirts really, really shouldn't have been pleated, I just ironed creases into them. :D
