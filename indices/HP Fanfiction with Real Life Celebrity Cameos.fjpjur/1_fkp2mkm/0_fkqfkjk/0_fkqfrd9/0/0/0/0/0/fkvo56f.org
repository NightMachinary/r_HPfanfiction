Indeed. I grew up reading Tolkien and when I found out he was interested in Arthurian Legend, I started reading up and loved it all. Plus, the adaptations get really spectacular - there's a steampunk cabaret-burlesque band called The Mechanisms that does an adaptation called 'High Noon over Camelot' that's absolutely magnificent. Sci-fi Cowboy Arthur really, really works. It's on Youtube, if you're interested. :)

Why do you ask?
