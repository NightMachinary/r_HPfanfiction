Yes they are and he was perfect. When I got him, I didn't realize the gem I was getting. He was rather small when I got him, I didn't want a kitten, but my apartment complex did not allow large dogs and I'm not a fan of small dogs, but the only adult cat available... they weren't sure if she was just fat or pregnant at the time. I realized his breed when he got to be very long in about 2 months. He did like playing in the shower water unless he got spritzed. Then I got a dirty look. His version of kissing me on the nose was to bite my nose. He liked being read to, but he'd get irritated if I paused in reading to laugh before I read the the funny bit to him. I loved that cat and I miss him so much.Oh! And he knew how to open doors, but his paws were too fluffy to get a grip on the knob. I always joked I was going to make him miniaturized war horse armor. As far as the sagas go, I started learning Bokm√•l to try to read them in their original writing. When Duolingo gets Icelandic I'm switching though.
