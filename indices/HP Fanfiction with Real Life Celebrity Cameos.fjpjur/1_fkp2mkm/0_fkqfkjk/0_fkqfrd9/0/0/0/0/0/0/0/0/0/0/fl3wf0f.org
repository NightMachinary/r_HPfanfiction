Thank you for your condolences, I personally believe we'll meet again. He was white with cream splotches and I didn't groom him to enhance his fluffiness if that helps your mental image.

Originally I was disappointed when I found it was called the book language, but according to my research, it is spoken by the majority of the country and the secondary most used language was only used in the more northern regions, was more limited, and though claimed to be more native sources seemed to disagree on that front. Of course my sources could have been flawed and I may be misremembering.

As far as continuing Bokm√•l after starting Icelandic, the two languages as similar enough, I'd rather put the additional effort into learning different languages instead. I'm leaning towards Gaelic, I do wish the app specified if it was Scottish, Irish, Welsh, or what. I'm guessing not Irish just because the app lists Irish separately. Expanding on my German could be fun too though.

Honestly, with everything going on, I've been so distracted I'm not learning a whole lot in my impromptu time off at all. How about you?
