Not a big fan of Snappy without some growth and development into 'not a bitter nazi arsehole' myself, but I can generally work around that for an interesting and fun fic like that one sounds to be. :)

Yeah. Same with music fics. A lot of them are just excuses for the author to talk about the media they enjoy consuming.
