The story is good but it progresses so bloody slowly. Also there's a weird obsession with the Mind Arts that gets a bit annoying. And like mentioned earlier, the "maybe this, maybe not". They are a brilliant author but he resorts to a few attention grabbing tricks more often than necessary. Tricks that are far below the standard they can easily produce. But if you start reading it, you can't stop. The story is that interesting.
