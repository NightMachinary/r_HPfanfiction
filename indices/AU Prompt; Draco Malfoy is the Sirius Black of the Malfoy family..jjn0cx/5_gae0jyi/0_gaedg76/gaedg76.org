Draco pushes ron to study harder

because be damned if he will let that smug bastard malfoy show him up in class. and be damned if he will rely on malfoys skills at quidditch to help gryffindor win. and be dammned if he lets that malfoy beat him at chess.

Basically Ron and Draco's friendship is insanely competitive. which is very annoying to harry and hermione. because they can no longer have a game of anything without Ron and draco trying to out compete each other.

Hermione brings up gobstones and she, harry ron and draco play a lovely game the problem is for the next game ron and draco seemed to have completely mastered the game by just shadowing the gobstones club and picking up pro strats.
