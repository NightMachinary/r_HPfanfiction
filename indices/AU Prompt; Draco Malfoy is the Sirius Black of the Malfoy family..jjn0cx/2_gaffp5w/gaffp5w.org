I've had this one shot idea in my head for a while now where Draco is secretly a HUGE muggle nerd, has been secretly studying muggle textbooks, sneaking out to take his muggle exams, is enamored with muggle technology, and wants to be a computer technician when he grows up.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sneak out one night and follow him because they think he's doing Sneaky Evil Slytherin Things (tm) but end up finding him in a closet hunched over a computer he's been building from scratch.

He very frantically begs them to not tell anyone and general hijinks ensue from here.
