Coz it gives Draco a redemption arc and character growth that the original series tried to but didn't really achieve.

It still portrays the confusion that Draco felt later on believably but the character growth went nowhere and a redemption arc is a lot more exciting.

Edit: There's another thing that having two Malfoy sons add and that's Narcissa's involvement in the plot.
