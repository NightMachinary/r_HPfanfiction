I love that while he has likable traits, the author doesn't make him mary-sue-ish. Draco still insults and looks down upon the weasleys and actually has proper character growth (which is applicable for almost all of the characters in that fic). I also love the way the author gives all of the characters proper motivations. And that fic has the only redeemed Snape I've seen in fanfiction. What I mean to say( if it wasn't already clear) is that IMO the innocent series is the holy grail of harry potter fanfiction.
