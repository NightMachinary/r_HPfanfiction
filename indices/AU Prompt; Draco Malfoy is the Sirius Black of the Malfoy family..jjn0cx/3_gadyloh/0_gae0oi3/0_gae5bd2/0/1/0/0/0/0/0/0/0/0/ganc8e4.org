Yeah I'm a sucker for long fic so I'm sure I will! I just finished the Arithmancer series by the same author and I really enjoyed that so I'm hoping accidental animagus will be good too! Definitely not Harmony. As for bashing I haven't seen any yet but I'm not super far in yet so I can't guarantee for later on. There is Dumbledore being called out on his bad decisions but so far it's been done well in a non bashing way.
