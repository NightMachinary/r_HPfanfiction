Without over hyping it (though I'm probably about to do just that), it is the most complete fanfic I've read, with the author using the same base story elements, and making something beautiful. Characters like Lupin, Tonks and Sirius (for starters) who weren't given enough screen time (in my opinion) are explored extremely well. That's not counting the little bits of lore the author adds into the story to just let us connect better with the universe and it's different elements. Another aspect is that the characters grow and form bonds with each other (unlike some fics where they just pair off at 11) as the story progresses

One thing that does throw people (that I've recc'd it to) off is the length of the story (which for me is a huge plus point, but YMMV) However, I feel like if you give the first few chapters a go, you don't even feel the chapters zipping past.
