Its a series of 5 if you start at innocent (like I did), if you look through the author page though you'll realise that the author started with Lily and James's final year at Hogwarts and a few marauders one shots; these are set in the same universe as the innocent storyline. These were the first stories they did, but the quality of writing has kept improving as the series progressed.

So if you want to start reading, my suggestion would be to start at innocent and if you like that, finish the series, then go back to the marauders stories as the writing is not as amazing(still more so than most other fanfics I've read, but I digress) due to the author still adapting their style.

As for the second question, no they are not complete, it's still updating around fortnightly. Innocent deals with harry before Hogwarts (the point where the story differs from canon is that Sirius breaks out of Askaban when Harry's 9, so innocent is from 9 year old harry to 11 year old harry), initiate( the first sequel) covers his first year, identity the second year and so on.
