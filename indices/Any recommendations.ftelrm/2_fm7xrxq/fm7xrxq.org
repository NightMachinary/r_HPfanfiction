Check out my collection! [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fapnkx/master_of_deathharry_excel_collection_help/]]

If you're new to the trope, I would have started with "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][Dead things]]" and "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]". Those are short, gen and so very good. Then if you want really other-worldly Harry and a very interesting plot, try "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321][October]]" (and other works by this author. "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus]]" is really good and popular). As for personified Death, check out "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244/chapters/38889167][Spoonful of Sugar]]". If you want something bigger and lighter, "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10218541][As good as Death]]" is a good one. Harry is Death in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852][On a Pale Horse]]", "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305455][Boredom is Deadly]]" and "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5936137/chapters/13650778][Be the Death of me]]" (though that last one is not everyone's cup of tea)

As for "/and head of multiple houses/", try "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18146660/chapters/42909539][The Graveyard Is Empty Because The Ghosts Are In My Head]]" and maybe "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4608235/1/It-All-Started-With-A-Visit-To-Gringotts][It All Started With A Visit To Gringotts]]".

If you don't want just links but a short comment from me for each of these recs and elaboration on how exactly Harry is the master of death in these (be it immortal necromancer or sorting mortals after their death or summoning Death to do his bidding), go check my collection ;)
