I'm operating under the assumption the Dursleys went to the US and dropped him off there lol. Although, you guys do have Bruder Hof (apologies if that's not spelled correctly), which are similar to Hutterites. And Hutterites are similar to the Amish, as they're both Anabaptist and believe in a sense of community or communal living while keeping the rest of the world just outside of arm's reach.
