There's The Lone Traveler by The Professional, later adopted by Dunuelos, which features a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter traveling to alternate dimensions and shifting their paths. It starts out in the /Harry Potter/ universe, but branches out into other continuities such as /Babylon 5/, /Buffy the Vampire Slayer/, and even /The Belgariad/ and /Elenium/.
