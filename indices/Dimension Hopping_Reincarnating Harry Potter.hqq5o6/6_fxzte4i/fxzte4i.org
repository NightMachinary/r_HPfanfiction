There's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13034223/1/A-Discordant-Note]]), where an immortal Dark!Harry with a harem is in either A Song Of Ice And Fire, or Game Of Thrones; I never got the difference..

And there's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains]]), in which Harry spends a few years as a Sith Lord before coming back to the HP-verse with no time having passed. It takes place mostly in the HP-verse, but has a continuation fic that takes place in Stargate SG1.
