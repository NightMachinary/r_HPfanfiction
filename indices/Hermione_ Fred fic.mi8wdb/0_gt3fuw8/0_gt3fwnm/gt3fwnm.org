  Hermione woke up after the war with a terrible surprise. Her life is forever changed, and she is going to have to learn how to live with her new handicap. If her new life wasn't going to be hard enough, she also has to deal with rengades who believe that Voldemort's view of Muggle Born's were correct. Can she accept her new life and help a friend find healing as well?
