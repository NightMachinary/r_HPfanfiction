It is a very inhospitable place, maybe too much even for a permanent magical settlement. As far as things living there, even magical things, the amount of available food, needed calories/magic just to stay alive likely means you wouldn't have anything more than penguins. At least, as far as creatures of flesh go.

Now, that doesn't mean that things didn't live there in the past, the continents have drifted, it might have been full of life at one point. If you can get through the ice, you can probably find very interesting fossils or possibly even dormant/enchanted sleeping creatures depending on how your fanfic's magic works.

Plus sides for a Hermione/parents/Harry trip to Antartica:

1-Likely no dark wizards!

2-Interesting fossils to secure or use in magical rituals/really cool familiar ideas if they're still breathing/asleep. (Or you could use magic for that, as in you found an extinct species of animal? use a ritual to force a similar animal to give birth to the extinct species instead of her own.)

3-With a wizarding tent, charms, and a bottomless pantry you can likely survive. Combine muggle heating unit with unlimited fuel supply!

4-the British Ministry of Magic has no authority to tell you not to use magic! Summer spellcasting: use it for training, fun, and exploration!

5-How long has the land been frozen/not see life? interesting stones/magical reagents.

6-Lost civilizations! Maybe?

7-Stagate: SG1 crossover! A bunch of possibilities, they find the stargate under the ice, they look up and see the battle of antartica, they find a ancient spaceship/lab/prison/anything you can imagine!
