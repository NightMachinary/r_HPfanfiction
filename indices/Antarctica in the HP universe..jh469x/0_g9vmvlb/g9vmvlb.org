I like the idea of it being a sort of Neutral Sealing Ground that everyone collectively agreed to Stay The Fuck Off Of because the Great and the Good all use it to dump their Magical Equivalents of Nuclear Waste and Lovecraftian Monsters there.

"Where do Vanished things go?"

"Antarctica, professor."

"...what?"

Even Lovecraft himself got into that a little bit, with a dash of the Atlantis thing, in the Mountains of Madness story. Arctic Explorers run across the dead remnants of an Ancient Civilization of Monstrous Beings. But that is not dead which can eternal lie...

I say 'everyone' collectively agreed, but that'd just be government and law-abiders. There'd probably be a fucktonne of scavengers and dark wizards there, trying to pilfer or dominate what got sealed away.

Oooh. I might actually try write that. That sounds fun.
