I think there's a good chance most wizards don't know Antarctica even exists. I'd bet only muggleborn and certain academic circles are in any way familiar with it.

Antarctica wasn't discovered until the the mid 1800's, and no landings were made until near the turn of the century. This is all well after the Statute of Secrecy.

There's probably a couple magizoologists embedded in the research bases canvassing the coastline for signs of magical creatures in order to cover them up before the muggles see them.

As far as anti-social dark-wizards go, there are much better options for places to set up a secret base that aren't quite so ridiculously inhospitable and inconveniently hard to get to even with magic.
