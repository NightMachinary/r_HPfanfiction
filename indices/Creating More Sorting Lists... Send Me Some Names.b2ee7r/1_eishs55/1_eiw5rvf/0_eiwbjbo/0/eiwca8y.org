Darn. I remember reading about it on a Wikipedia page. I can't remember which village, town, or hamlet it was listed under.

I was writing a fanfic where some Muggle-Born wizards built townships around the British Isles in conjunction with some Squibs and poor orphaned Pure-Bloods. Three of the settlements were located near Scaffle Pike. I'm gonna have to look into my notes from that abandoned story. I never did post it since it's just notes.

The gist of the story was that these Muggle-Borns founded their own hidden society outside the Ministry's jurisdiction. They took in the orphaned, disowned(Squibs), and abused(Muggle-Borns in witch hunting areas).
