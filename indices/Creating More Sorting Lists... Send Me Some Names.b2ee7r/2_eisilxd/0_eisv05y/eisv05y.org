I wonder if Peregrine is international? I actually ended up switching Peregrine Derrick's name around. I couldn't picture a Slytherin having Derrick as a surname, but now that I think about it, it makes sense. I think I'll split the name in two.

I'll definitely use Picquery. Don't think I didn't notice you got it from Fantastic Beasts. Thank you for the suggestion.
