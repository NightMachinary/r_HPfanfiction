For Muggleborns, you might review popular baby names in the 1970s and 80s in the UK: [[https://www.britishbabynames.com/blog/2011/06/1974-to-2009.html]]

I also like the idea that some of these British surnames might be 'rare' in the muggle world because they had a strong magical gene arise in the early-mid 1900s: [[https://blog.myheritage.com/2011/04/rare-british-surnames/]] [[https://blogs.ancestry.com/cm/is-your-rare-surname-about-to-go-extinct/]]

And this is just a great list of UK surnames: [[https://www.s-gabriel.org/names/christian/fairnames/surnames.html]]

That said, I like Otto, Barnaby, Victor, Asher, Atticus, Edmund, Fletcher, and Hector for boy names, and Clara, Cora, Felicity, Louisa, Maggie, Nell, Pippa, Sadie, Tabitha, Verity, Vivienne and Thea as girl names.
