There aren't any. Sorry. I've looked over ff.net, but PJO authors apparently either can't write or haven't tried, and HP authors just want to make Harry fix all of the PJO problems.

Actually, there may be a decent unfinished one? But I don't remember any. I still feel like there could be a decent Percy as DADA teacher fic, but I've never seen one that was any good.

Too bad XedAlpha will never write one.
