I think I know very very few complete pjo/harry potter fanfics but here is a list of those that I have found and enjoyed.

Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - The best one I have found and I know someone already recommended I just add it here so the bot can list it.

Home is Where the Hearth is - linkffn(12791536) - A nice fic and one I enjoyed.

For Want of Family - linkffn(10711973) - Another pretty well done fic that I enjoy.

Son of Athena - linkffn(11441234) - One of the only complete fics I know and pretty well done.

Sadly this is list is shorter then I like. But it's hard to find good pjo/harry potter fics. Most PJO authors are stuck using very much overworn cliches and tropes it's hard to read their work after some time. PJO got me into fanfiction in the first place and will always be my favorite fanfics to read but I rather cut off my hand then try to sift through the archives of PJO stories again.
