I got fed up with reading the same story, same plot, and copy and pasted characters over and over and over again. Like there are hundreds of 'Percy Guardian of the Hunt fics' or 'Child of Artemis' or 'Chaos champion bullshit' all that feel very copy and pasted. It kills me trying to look for something new and exciting but only to see that is the premise. Like it was novel the first two times but now it's been run into the ground so much I can't even stand to look at the archives cause those are the first thing I see. I stand by what I said about the cutting off my hand bit. At least I keep my sanity, what little I have left at least, lol.
