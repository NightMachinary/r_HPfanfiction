I'm not entirely confident that I would be able to identify a chav but linkffn(Not Fade Away) by Slide involves quite a few muggleborns from non-'generic' backgrounds.

The story also happens to be an absolutely amazing depiction of 1970s Wizarding Britain. Unfortunately, it is abandoned.

Edit: I don't know how to fix a bad FanFictionBot link so I'll just link to the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4095/Slide][story]]
