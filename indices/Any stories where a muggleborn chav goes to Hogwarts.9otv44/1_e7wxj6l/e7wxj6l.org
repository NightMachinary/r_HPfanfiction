Hermione isn't imitating them. Quite honestly she is just her own and equally prissy flavour of snob...She spends her summers in France, both of her parents are in the medical field and have their own Dental practice, Hermione even has an upper class view of charitable works. Not every pureblood family has money, but the ones that do are pretty old families just like the peerage in England, but some eventual become impoverished due to their scions running off to North America and idiocy and whatnot.

​

TL;DR

Chavers are basically Dudley and his friends and I don't want that bloke representing Muggleborn Wizards. If it were me learning I had access to a huge world ripe for power vacuum, I would definitely just imitate those with societal power and study hard, fake it until I make it so that I can snag a man with elderly parents and a fat inheritance *coughLilycough*.
