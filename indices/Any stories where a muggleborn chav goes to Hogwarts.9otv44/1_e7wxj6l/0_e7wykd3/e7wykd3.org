You are amazing, I don't even know why my first instinct is to ask this group something when I should just google, lol. I guess I just thought it was so unlikely that it would take some sort of deep hidden knowledge rather than be right there in the title.

As for Hermione, I agree that's the way it is in canon, but I was thinking more of fics like, say, Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, where she is specifically given lessons in ways to speak and even walk like purebloods, and then later rounds up a group of muggleborns to share the secrets of pureblood culture, that sort of thing.
