linkffn(9860311) A Long Journey Home - A great story, slow updates.

linkffn(11488906) Potter vs Paradox - Seems abandoned but the author swears they are working on it. I love it anyway.

linkffn(10131514) Back to the Beginning - This is actually a gender-bent one but I like it so I am going to recommend it anyway.
