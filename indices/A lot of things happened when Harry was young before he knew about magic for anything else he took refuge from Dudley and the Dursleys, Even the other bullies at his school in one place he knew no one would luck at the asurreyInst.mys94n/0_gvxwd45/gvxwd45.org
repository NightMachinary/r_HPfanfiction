darling this is wonderful, but there are so few full stops I had to catch my breath after reading,lmao! But I love the idea.

But also maths people, if you're interested, I have a prompt where Harry becomes an auditor because Vernon is scared of them and Harry thinks if Varnon fears auditors they must be cool af. But I have dyscalculaia and can't write a maths story, so someone else should.

But I always love â€˜Harry hides/finds sanctuary in this Muggle place and teach him things that will change the way he views Magic' storylines, and this is awesome.
