The current database has ~32,000 fics. The smallest number of favorites is 185, so if you enter a fic with >185 favorites, it should be in there.

There are plans to expand the database even more, though. Not sure when it'll be finished.

From a theoretical standpoint, I think this process could probably give decent recommendations for most fics. Maybe for anything more than 20ish favorites? I'm not sure.
