actually no... my algos are very /very/ simple and not even science based.

For the recommendations it just matches a ton of lists to your favourites and outputs a sum of appearances in those for each fic.

Slash/het was a bit more complex but still rule-of-thumby "Find lists with lots of slash and exclude everything from them that isn't on lists withotu slash"

Genres again, not science based: I calculated genre presense in each of userlists and decide on the fics genre based on which type of list it appears more often.

I've been meaning to write a proper recommendation algo, but got sidetracked actually reading stuff the last month :) Also, a large scrape of 500k userlists is currently in progress. When it's done I'll probbaly do some more nifty stuff for the app.
