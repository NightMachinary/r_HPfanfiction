I'm always happy to import more, though I can't really merge multiple independent datasets (especially if they calculate similarity differently).

I'll also need to look at optimising the importer, maybe do a chunked import. Unfortunately, especially with fkey restrictions, these larger DBs take quite a while (and eat a lot of RAM).
