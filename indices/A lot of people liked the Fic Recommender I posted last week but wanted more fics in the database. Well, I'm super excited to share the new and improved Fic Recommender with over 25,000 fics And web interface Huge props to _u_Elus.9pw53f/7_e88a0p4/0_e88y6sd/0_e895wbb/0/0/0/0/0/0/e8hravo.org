Hm. You could probably compress it down pretty heavily but I don't think the server I'm hosting this on has enough space for a 100 GB database.

Pruning sounds like the way to go.

My current format takes, for each fic, a list of similar fics and their similarity scores. If your final format can provide those scores, that'd be great. If not, I can make up some dummy values for sorting.

I can adjust the importer to parse pretty much any format.

If you're willing to do this, I can provide SCP/SFTP details for direct upload. Or HTTP upload to a Nextcloud instance. Or you can upload it elsewhere and I can download it.

Thanks!
