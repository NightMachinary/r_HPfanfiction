That could work. The current format I'm parsing from [[/u/vir_innominatus]] is two separate tables:

#+begin_example
  <story_a>: <story_b1_id> <story_b2_id> ...
#+end_example

And

#+begin_example
  <story_a>: <story_b1_score> <story_b2_score> ...
#+end_example

This could be shortened to:

#+begin_example
  <story_a>: <b1_id>,<b1_score> <b2_id>,<b2_score>
#+end_example

The matrix format you propose wouldn't be much different (it's actually closer to my database format, which stores rows of a, b and score).

Whichever is easier for you is fine.
