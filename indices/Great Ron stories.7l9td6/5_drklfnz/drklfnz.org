Ron is an important and intelligent character in my series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) linkffn(The Chessmaster: White Knight).

He's also a good friend in linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) and I believe Starfox5 portrays him in strong supporting roles in many of their fics, iirc.
