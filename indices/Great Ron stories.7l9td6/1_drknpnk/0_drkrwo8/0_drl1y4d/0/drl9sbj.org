I don't read on ff.net, so I didn't know they were there. Thank you very much for the link. Such a bummer that it's the censored versions. She wrote such lovely smut. She had a James and Lily story that was also very good/hot, but I don't remember the title of it. Way back in the day, I used to part of that MSN group, but I don't think it's around anymore. I might have to take a look through my ancient bookmarks and see if it's still there. Too bad I didn't think to save the stories I really liked on my HDD.
