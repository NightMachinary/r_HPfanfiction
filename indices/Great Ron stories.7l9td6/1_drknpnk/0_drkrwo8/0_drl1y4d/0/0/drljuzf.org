I'm so sorry I can't be more of help; I can only commiserate. I wasn't part of her MSN group, so you would know more than I would/do. I took a prolonged break from fanfiction. When looking again...Checkmated was no longer running. I do remember a Lily/James fic, but it could possibly be the wrong one. The one I think you're referring to, in one of the last chapters, involved a phenomenally good scene including all-nighters, a faucet, and Lily on the precipice of figuring out the marauders' secrets of being animagi with Moony as werewolf. Regardless, was the fic ever finished?
