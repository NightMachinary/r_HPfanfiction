I feel a bit uncomfortable linking my own work these days, but this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic]] one of mine features Dudley as a significant character. It's not exactly a redemption story but Dudley and Harry do reconnect in this and find some common ground.
