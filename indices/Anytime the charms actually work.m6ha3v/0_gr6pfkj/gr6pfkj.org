I'm not sure if you're going to find something like that because protective charms are just, well, meant to protect and prevent theft and I think many authors interpret them as such. Although I think you might have some luck finding what you're looking for in fics focused on anti-theft curses, particularly those placed on Egyptian tombs and what not.
