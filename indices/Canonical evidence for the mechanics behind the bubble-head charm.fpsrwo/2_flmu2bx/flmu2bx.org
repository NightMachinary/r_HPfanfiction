Harry did not use the spell. It was Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour in the second task who used it.

Yes it is suggested that it is used as an air purifier spell though people with bad breath have reported problems after 30 minutes. Otherwise it can be used for underwater exploration and to avoid nasty smells.

In OotP the students of Hogwarts used this spell when they were rebelling against Umbridge by throwing Dungbombs and Stink Pellets.
