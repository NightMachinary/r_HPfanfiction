I don't think so.

The average human head is approximately 20 centimetres (7.8 inches) from the back of the skull to the forehead and approximately 23 centimetres (8.6 inches) from the top of the head to the chin.

The average 3 gallon fish bowl is about 11 inches wide and 10 inches high. Since presumably the bubble head is formed /around/ the head, we don't have to worry about the physical constraints of getting the head in and out of the opening. But that is a reasonable choice to base the work off of.

Because I am not going to work out the amount of space left in a 3 gallon fish bowl /after/ you put a human head in it, we're going to say that the bubble head charm has the full complement of 3 gallons (13.5 litres) of air. Air is only 20% oxygen, however. Which leaves us with 2.72 litres of oxygen in the fish bowl.

Humans consume roughly 0.5 litres of oxygen and expel 200ml of CO2 per minute. A CO2 level of 7-10% will render you unconscious. Unfortunately, 10% of 2.72 litres is 0.27 litres, or 270ml. So that's about a minute and change before you fall unconscious.

Assuming that the Bubble-head charm can release CO2 but not allow more O2 into the bowl then your chances are looking better. In that you have about 5 minutes before you have no oxygen left and you fall unconscious.

Given that Fleur and Cedric were able to use the bubble head and stay under the lake for an hour and the distance between Hogwarts classes is probably longer than five minutes, the Charm must have the ability to extract fresh air from outside itself as well as expelling the CO2.

+please note, all figures have been gathered with minimum googling and I am in no way shape or form a mathematician so please take this with a grain of salt but, you know, don't stick your head in a fishbowl probably+
