Interesting, and definitely something that I myself missed, rather foolishly at that. Though, with this sub's disposition towards hating on Rowling for her "poor math skills", I'm hesitant to say that this is incontrovertible. That said, I see why authors would have it as a source of air. Still, it'd be nice to have it directly mentioned somewhere how it works.
