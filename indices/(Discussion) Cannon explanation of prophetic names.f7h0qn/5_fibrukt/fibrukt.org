Most of JKR's characters have some significant meaning to their name. Except Parvati, Dean, Seamus, Lavender etc., who hardly appear in the book. Their names have meanings, but they're not really relevant to their role.

Albus means ‘white'. Dumbledore means ‘bumblebee', although I'm not sure how that's meant to reflect his character.

Sibyls were female oracles.

Luna should be obvious; Lovegood, I'm not so sure. Doesn't seem to be particularly meaningful.

/Gild/eroy Lockhart, /Xenophilius/, Sirius (Dog Star) and all the Blacks named after constellations. Kreacher, maybe?

A shunpike is a side road used to avoid the main road. ‘Delacour' sounds like it means ‘of the heart' (so, apt for a Veela).
