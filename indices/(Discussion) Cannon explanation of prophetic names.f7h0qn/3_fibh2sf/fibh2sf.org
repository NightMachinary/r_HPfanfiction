I think this is quite common in story telling :

Take star wars, which I know little about:

Luke Skywalker - All I know is that I think he's the protagonist, he sounds like a saviuor or something due to his last name,

Darth Vader - Sounds to me like Dark Invader, I would not want to get on the wrong side of him!

There's even a form of this in real life. [[https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180404-do-our-names-push-us-toward-certain-jobs]]

The most well known one is Usain Bolt.
