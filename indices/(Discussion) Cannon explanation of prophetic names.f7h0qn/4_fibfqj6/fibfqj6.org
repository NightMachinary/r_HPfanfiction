I feel like I remember reading something about Rowling saying that it was a common and fashionable practice for a while for parents to visit a type of seer that would help name the child with a prophetic name, but I have no source for it. My guess is that it was an offhand comment in an interview or on Twitter, but it could have just as well been in a fic and I am confused.
