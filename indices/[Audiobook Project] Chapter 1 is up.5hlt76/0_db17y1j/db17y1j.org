You either have a lisp or the microphone does some weird stuff with your s sounds. You also have some reverberation in the sounds, making the whole thing sound a bit unprofessional (which I know it is, of course).

For the next chapter (or a rework of this one, maybe) you should also try to pronounce words clear, make pauses and stress the punctuation. This sounds a lot like you're reading to the class. However, you want to make an audiobook. Your reading should sound more relaxed, like you're telling me a story in front of the chimney. I also heard some pauses in your reading. There is no shame in re-recording a paragraph and cutting it in.

Anyway, solid work. Excuse me if I was a bit overzealous with my critic, but as someone with a sounddesign education, I can't overhear some stuff.
