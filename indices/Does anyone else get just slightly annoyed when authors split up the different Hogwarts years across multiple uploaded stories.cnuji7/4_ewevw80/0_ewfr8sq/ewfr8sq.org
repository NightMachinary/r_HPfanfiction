  the authors often write in the summary or makr the fic as 'Complete' only for me to find out that no, it's only the first book out of 7 or 8 they managed to complete, there is like 2 more parts that are complete, one half done with last update being 5 years ago and no word from the author ever since.

Oddly specific...
