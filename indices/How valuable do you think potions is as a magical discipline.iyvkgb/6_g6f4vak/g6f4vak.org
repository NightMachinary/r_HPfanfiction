I imagine most people would simply buy potions from people who make them full-time as their career. Better than accidentally poisoning yourself. Aurors can simply buy the potions they need. Aurors have no real need to adapt potions, though they do need potion knowledge to recognize them and investigate their use.

I think that potions becomes very important to a few select careers (potion makers, healers) and those at the highest magical levels (Dumbledore/Voldemort). Healers might need to synthesize new antidotes like in Arthur's case, for example. At the highest level, potions do things curses can't do. Voldemort's cave potion, for example.
