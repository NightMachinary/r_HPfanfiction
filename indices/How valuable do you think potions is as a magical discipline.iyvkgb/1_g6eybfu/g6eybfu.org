If you think buying something is worth it, who's gonna make that thing ?

Here you go, you have your answer.

After that, it's just a matter of supply and demand. If few people try to make a living out of making potions, then going for a potion-related job would probably be good business-wise.

Anything beyond that is a matter of creativity. But I can definitely imagine a potion master fighting with potions : grenades, temporary boosts to... “stats”, poisons... plenty of opportunities here.
