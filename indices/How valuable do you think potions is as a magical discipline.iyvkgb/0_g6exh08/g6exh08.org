Why do you cook meals when you can just order takeout?

I imagine it's cheaper to make your own potions (especially if you also collect/grow your own ingredients), probably more efficient for easy/quick brews, and you would have more control over the brewing process and quality of the ingredients.

Anyone who works in potentially dangerous situations (aurors, curse-breakers, anyone working with animals, etc) would presumably want the wizarding equivalent of a first aid kit to hand - dittany, essence of murtlap, anti-venom etc. Most households would probably have these as well!
