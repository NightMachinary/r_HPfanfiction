There are lots of medical ones, but off the top of my head there are also ones for general health, beauty (pimple solution, sleakeazy's), cleaning (doxycide). There are probably specialised potions for Herbology and Magizoology (fertilisers, feed etc), maybe duelling (something to do with accuracy or reflexes?) - I'm pretty sure study aids are mentioned in the books too?

But yeah, I'm sure that if you can imagine it, there'll be a potion for it!
