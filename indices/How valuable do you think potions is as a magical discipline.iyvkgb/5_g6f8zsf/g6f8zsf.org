It definitely does. Specialized Potioners don't waste their time brewing easy potion like a cure for boils. They probably brew difficult potions (Felix Felicis, Veritaserum, or any other "difficult" one not mentioned in canon) where they can maximize their profit and must spend most of their time doing research.

Anyone managing to create a new potion (Wolfbane) or to modify an existing potion enough to reduce its cost must have struck rich. Most of the "simple" potions are probably sold as a side product for another business (Apothicary, Joke shop . . .).
