I mean, if nobody takes potions, then there's no more potioneers to make potions for people to buy. So, it's going to be lucrative if you specialise in selling.

In terms of day to day life, I'd say it's kind of like Food Tech is for us (cooking class from secondary school, basically). It can be useful and lucrative if you specialise in it as a career, but otherwise it's just slightly cheaper to make stuff yourself than buying it from someone else (home cooking vs take-out). There's probably a lot of the easier day to day stuff at the 'plaster and ibuprofen' level that people can make easily if they wanna put the time in, too.

I always imagined Curse Breaking to use it a lot. It's pretty common for older civilizations to anoint (ceremonially oil up) their dead, so perhaps magicals made magical ointments that had effects which were best avoided or dispelled with potions. Or if you can't poke your wand through a gap to dispel a trap, you get a drip and let a potion flow through that'll do the job for you. That kinda thing.

Aurors might use flashbombs if there's somewhere they can arc a potion but not line-cast a spell. Or emergency 'health potions' (adrenaline, big painkillers, etc) if they don't have time to cast actual medical magic. Or anything where they don't have the focus or headspace to cast regular magic, I guess.

At the end of the day, Rowling's toolkit is flexible enough that you can basically pick a function you need for your story and invent a magical doodad or spell to solve it and it'll probably fit just fine.
