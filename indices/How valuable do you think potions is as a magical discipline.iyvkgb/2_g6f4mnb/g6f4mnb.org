i mean, in an ideal world the point of a school is to teach students information that they will find useful in life.

it's like a combination of cooking, pharmacology, or chemistry classes at a high school. most people cook for themselves. people don't make their own medications, but it's still good to know how they work; and for those who go on into fields where that information is relevant, it's important to get a solid grounding in the basics.

imo it makes sense to make your own potions instead of buying them if you don't have a ton of money but do have the knowlege; like how some people make herbal stuff to treat minor complaints irl. willow bark tinctures instead of aspirin, valerian teas for insomnia, stuff like that. hell, there's an online collective dedicated to creating safe homemade HRT.

i'm not too familiar with British school systems, but to my knowlege most schools irl require students to take science up to a certain level; the stuff i learned then is still useful now. i imagine it's the same in this particular fictional world (or would be if Snape was a good teacher.)
