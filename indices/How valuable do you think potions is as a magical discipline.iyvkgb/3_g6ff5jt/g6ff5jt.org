  in your head canon

  How do you imagine regular Wizards, or specialized professionals (aurors, curse breakers, professors etc) use potions?
#+end_quote

Think of everything chemical in your life, from drugs to cleaning products to cosmetics to paints, etc. In the wizarding world all that shit is potions.

So the common wizard has instant dry/no dribble paint, magical mess remover, fx tier cosmetics, etc.

Healers have drugs, enough said.

Aurors have magical luminol, veritaserum, antidotes, throw an object and a vial of blood in the cauldron and the potion tells you if the blood donor touched the object, etc.

Curse breakers likely need it as drugs to heal themselves after they receive their just deserts for being dirty graverobbers.

  but in your head canon, does it add enough value to specialise in
#+end_quote

Yes, because you need professionals dedicating themselves to research and production. You don't expect a doctor to mix his own drugs, a policeman to mix his own luminol, your ass to mix your own degreaser. Many potions are also mentioned to be too hard to be made by amateurs, and the ingredients too expensive to risk wasting them.
