I think in a modern fantasy setting it'd make more sense mass producing potions. Ingredients would be produced by specialized farmers, brewing would be done thousands of doses at once. Government agency to ensure quality. People venturing into the forest to gather a few handfuls of ingredients and brewing in a small cauldron at home isn't really economical.

There'd still be a large requirement for many professions to know basic potions knowledge in order to learn things like recognizing poisons and quickly administering the right counter, recognizing spoiled medical potions, and inventing new recipes.
