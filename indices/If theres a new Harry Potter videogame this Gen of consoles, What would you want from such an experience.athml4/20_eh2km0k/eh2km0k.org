Just a straight remake of the Chamber of Secrets for Gameboy Color.

However, they /have/ to make the flowers quest in McGonagall's office as equally vague and unclear, so that you're constantly grinding up versus the older students in the Dueling Club because you have no idea how to advance the story and this is the only other thing you can do in the game.

It was a 10/10 experience the first time around, for sure.

But nah, for real? I'd be good with a canon rehash, maybe with a party system, and give the characters bonuses in certain stats and skills, and special abilities.

Give Ron a Berserker state, that activates when one of his friends get hurt, increasing his attack speed and attack power for a brief time.

Give Harry a passive dodge ability, allowing for him to dodge spells easier than other characters.

Give Hermione the ability to learn/master spells easier than other characters.

That kind of thing.
