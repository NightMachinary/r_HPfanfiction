My point was that "those kinds of games" (single player, story focused AAA RPGs) are not even remotely dead while major studios still generate a comfortable revenue off of creating more. Clearly BioWare and Bethesda still consider that a good profit model or they wouldn't have begun production on new ones. They have not stopped, and they are not going to stop any time in the near future.
