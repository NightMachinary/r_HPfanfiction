What do you mean by that? Bethesda is still working on Elder Scrolls 6. That single-player IP never stopped being profitable for them, so they have no reason to abandon it. Meanwhile, BioWare has plans for a new RPG in the Dragon Age series, and they filed a new patent for their Jade Empire IP as well.
