Why do people say this kind of stuff is dead all the time? God of War, Metro Exodus, Kingdom Hearts, Farcry New Dawn, Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, even something like Spiderman. Some of these games have multiplayer or open world's, there are more of less quality. They're still single player narrative games first. It's likely still the most common game type, and it's likely to continue to be so.
