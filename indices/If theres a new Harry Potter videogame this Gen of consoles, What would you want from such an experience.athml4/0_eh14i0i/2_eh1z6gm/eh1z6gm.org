  have lots of quests where you talk to fully-realized classmates and professors

  Think Mass Effect crossed with Skyrim

I think the biggest annoyance would be the "mandatory" (ie quest giving) friends if you happen to dislike them. You can ignore the squadmates you don't like in Mass Effect, or the annoying followers in Skyrim. But that wouldn't work well in a school RPG unless the quests are a lot more dynamic than in most RPGs.
