I don't want open-world, I don't want an MMO, I just want a good, old-school, linear RPG where you get to learn spells, have lots of quests where you talk to fully-realized classmates and professors, encounter magical creatures and artifacts, and unravel a sinister mystery.

I don't want Slytherins to automatically be evil, I don't want a janky combat system, and I don't want just a million fetch quests.

Think Mass Effect crossed with Skyrim. That's what I want.
