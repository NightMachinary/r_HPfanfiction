'Bully' was game about this kid being shipped off to the worst boarding school in america and having to survive all the different factions of 'nerds' 'preps' 'bullies' 'jocks' and 'greasers'. it followed a full school year and had you going to classes and also exploring the nearby town fighting people off with hand to hand brawler style combat, riding about on a bike or skateboard hitting people with a sling shot all very denis the meance a great game. Persona is a JRPG about japanese highschoolers fighting various forces of evil. while also going to class hanging out doing everyday silce of life things as well... both have many elements that should be stolen for a harry potter game imo.
