I want to be able to be a bad person or a bully and for it to have reprecussions. For example, in school, I bully a guy and am a dick to him. Later, I'm in danger and he's the only person around and i ask for help but he leaves me there because I was a dick. Tldr; actions have consequences and actions shape relationships

Choose a romantic partner and sexuality, but have it as background or optional.

Explore magic like being a metamorphmagus (that would be so fun) or an animagus

Explore spells that arent in canon.

Have quests where you play pranks and generally have fun. I want it to seem like a school

Optional quidditch

Character customization, like appearance, height, clothes, house.

People wear robes, not mismatching blazers over wooly jumpers and shitstain brown pants like in the movies. Basically normal clothes for the nineties (please tell me no one actually dressed like that in the 90s)

Diagon Alley like in the books

Maybe have some set after hogwarts, like if your character joins the Order in the First war.

Marauder Era.

(Long list, I know.)
