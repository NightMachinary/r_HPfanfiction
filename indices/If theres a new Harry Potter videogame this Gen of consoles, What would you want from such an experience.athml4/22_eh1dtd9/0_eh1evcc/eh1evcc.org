The first 3 ps2 games with the cartoony art style were well on course to doing just that, following the books having stuff the films missed out like pevees, with decent zelda rip off dungeons gameplay and the games getting better each time... then they got the fourth game and started following the films and lost the cool art style and became dull nonsnese :( last 2 where like light gun shooiters or so i heard lol
