I would not want it to be set during the books, movies, or even during the same time as them. I would not want to be in Hogwarts. I think using your Hogwarts education background as part of the character creator would be fucking awesome and would give real incentive to play with different characters. I would primarily want it to be about living in the wizarding world, perhaps kind of like the witcher 3 where you do have a main quest, but you also do have to kind of live in the world to get it done. You can't just fuck off to the end game without ever experiencing the world, you have to do shit in it to progress.
