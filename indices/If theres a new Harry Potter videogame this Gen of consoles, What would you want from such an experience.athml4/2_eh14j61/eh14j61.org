Yeah, I think the only way to make a Hogwarts-era HP game work is to make a Persona-esque half-RPG/half-boarding school simulator. Personally I'm a little cool on the idea of setting it during the book/movie era, because there's going to be a lot of clashing with canon and your character won't get anything particularly interesting to do since we know what happens in canon. Same thing for the romance angle, we know the dating histories of the trio and people like Malfoy, so it's a bit weird for your character be like "yo I totally dated Harry" despite us knowing that he's really only dated Ginny.

I think the leaked game, don't remember if it was from Rocksteady or some other dev, was set in the late 19th century, which I think was a great idea because gives a lot of room to explore the universe without stepping on Rowling's toes too much.
