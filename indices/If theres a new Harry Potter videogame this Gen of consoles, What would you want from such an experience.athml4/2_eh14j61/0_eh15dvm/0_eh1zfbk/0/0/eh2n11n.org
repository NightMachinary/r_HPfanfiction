First, there is no reason everyone has to be squishy. Because I seriously doubt that Dumbledore is defenseless even though a single bullet would end him. Just instead of regular tanks he'd be a shield tank with lots of cover creation. The more offensive characters (Riddle, Bellatrix) would go for overwhelming with damage while regular characters would be cover and counter focused.

You would have to limit the spell repertoire for every character to 8, 10, 16 or 20 (8 and 16 for controllers), which gives you enough freedom but also an arsenal of 80 spells for a four player party.

Potions can be used for grenades, possibly even with gas mechanics like Verdun/Tannenberg or Battlefield 1. Bubblehead charm as gas masks. Transfiguration is about terrain manipulation (stone spikes, quicksand) and cover, or about NPC pets. Charms either about buffs and debuffs or healing. Herbology either about healing, aoe debuffs or traps.

That being said, the killing curse would hands down be the most effective spell, but that's canon. Even Bellatrix was taken down by a single hit. You'd have to gate it through long cooldowns or similar restrictions (or limit it to bosses).
