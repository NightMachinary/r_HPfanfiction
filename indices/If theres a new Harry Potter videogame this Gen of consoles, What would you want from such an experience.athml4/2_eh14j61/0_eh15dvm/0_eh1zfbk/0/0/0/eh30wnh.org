The killing curse is a huge mechanical problem on its own: canonically none of the good guys use it, all of the bad guys use it to excess, and there are no restrictions to its ability to kill. Frankly, that just won't translate well at all to a video game. Unless there's a morality system attached to the game, your character most likely won't be able to use the killing curse, and basically handicapping the player against enemies that can one-shot them at any point is hardcore in a way that even the most punishing games of this era aren't. For all the memes about how difficult games like Dark Souls and Ninja Gaiden and Cuphead are; I've yet to see a game where nearly every enemy can one-shot you on a standard difficulty /and/ you aren't able to do the same to them.

Removing the killing curse entirely or putting restrictions on how often it can be used or what it can work on (a la Power Word Kill from D&D) requires a huge suspension of disbelief for anyone familiar with canon, and using it only on bosses seems like a good way to reduce all bosses to a shooting gallery until you manage to hit them with one. I suppose that you could set the game during a period of time where the killing curse is relatively unknown or hasn't been invented yet (has Rowling ever given us a date on that?), but the further back you go from canon, the less it'll have in common with the universe that audiences first fell in love with.
