There's no perfect way to adapt HP magic to a video game, because there's no way to really account for the sheer breadth of magic spells there are while also conforming to modern gaming trends.

Sure you can use a sort of spell-slot mechanic where you cycle through spells like weapons and shoot them at enemies, but that fundamentally turns the game into Max Payne with wands instead of guns and some people might consider it lazy. A turn-based system can definitely account for all the spells you can learn, but it also can slow the flow of the game around and tbh turn-based combat isn't really in vogue anymore the way it was during heyday of JRPGs. You could also run the game like a classic CRPG with a party and semi-real time combat, but I don't know how you go about balancing combat mechanics when all of your party members are squishy wizards.
