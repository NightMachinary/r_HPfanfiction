true..but id say theres a good chance many games will be cross gen for the first few years of ps5/xbox 2(or whatever they will call them) if that footage was real and game has been worked on for a few years already could see it being on both ps4 and ps5...could maybe see alot of ps4 stuff thats already anncoued like last of us 2 and death stranding being cross gen launch titles too just have taht feel about them also cyberpunk 2077 screams ps5
