Considering that NextGen is rumoured to at least be announced next year I doubt it'll be for this generation, and honestly I'd rather them work it over for a fully realised NextGen release than to rush it for a late CurrentGen release. Though considering it looked as if it was at least at a Beta level, it could be that it will be a late gen release with a nextgen port.

As for it's setting , it looked to me as if it was Victorian era, though I think there was an estimate that narrowed it down further based on the cut of their clothes. But that can easily be chalked up to as Wizarding fashion/ something else.
