I'm fairly certain it was Rocksteady, not Rockstar. While Rockstar has made school-inspired games like Bully before, I doubt they'd be interested in making a game that didn't involve robbing and shooting people in some capacity nowadays.

Edit: That, and going from set, usually mid-30s-to-early-40s, male protagonists to a teenager whose characteristics are determined in a character creator is a huge deviation from Rockstar's wheelhouse.
