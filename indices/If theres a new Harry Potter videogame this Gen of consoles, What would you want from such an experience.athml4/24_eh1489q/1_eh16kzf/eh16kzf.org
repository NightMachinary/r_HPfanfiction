the footage was off screen shaky very poor quality and couldve been fake and just theres been no offical reveal or any other hints since then. so its all sketchy and could be something thats been canned already. many games go into production get some audience testing and are cancelled all before the general public even knows about them...however the way warner took down all footage very quickly seems to show that its real and maybe still coming so who knows.
