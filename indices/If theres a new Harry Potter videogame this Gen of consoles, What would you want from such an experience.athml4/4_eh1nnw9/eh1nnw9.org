Honestly, I don't foresee a quality HP game based around the trio or cannon story. It's too restrictive and there are too many problems with the idea of portraying the canon characters to everyone's liking.

What COULD be a good game however is one based around the "idea" of Hogwarts itself. It would HAVE to be a quality RPG based around 3 primary things:

1. Exploration of the school, grounds, and Hogsmeade.
2. Learning of Magic, Potions, and other such crafts.
3. Social interaction or relationship development.

Now obviously there is a 4th in terms of a "story" but that's implied in the fact its an RPG.

Now... 1 and 2 are fairly easy to do. The cannon world lays out the groundwork to build upon and it would NOT be hard to design around. If anything, it would be way easier than designing from scratch and magic itself does not really have to make perfect sense. It is magic after all. No... the hard one would be #3... social interaction or relationship development.

You have to be able to write and develop a quality social environment to begin with, which takes a truly talented studio and writers to do, but you also have to do it within the confines of a "school" environment. And that, ladies and gentleman, is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT without problems arising. Romantic entanglements? Realistic but these are school children so you really have to tread a careful line. Think of the issues with regards to anime and menga's when broaching such topics. Writing realistic children with realistic social interaction with each other? Extremely hard to do, especially for adults looking back on such things without bias or misunderstanding. These and so much more in my view make it unlikely to ever happen.

The best we would likely get would be a "wizarding world" RPG that takes elements of cannon and develops an entirely new story but from the adult perspectives. Of course, that's less likely to draw in as many fans or players because it's not within the "confines" or "context" of the books.
