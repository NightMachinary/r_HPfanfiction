My ideal HP game would be:

- Story driven RPG with a custom fully voiced character set post Epilogue at Hogwarts

- Covers all 7 years, with branching paths

- Main story is about breaking the statute of secrecy and the rise of Neo-Grindelwallism

- Third person camera ARPG

- Fully fleshed out sideplots, including romance

- For solving the menu clutter problem, split the shortcuts into parents:childs. So you'd have battle magic as the parent shortcut then fire magic as a second level shortcut, and then all the spells for that. So on a keyboard you'd press 1 (select battle magic), 1 (sub cat fire), 0-9 (specific spell). This would allow around 1000 spells to be shortcutted.

Or, if this game is made by Capcom:

- It's Resident Evil but with Harry Potter

- You have spells instead of weapons

- You fight inferi and dementors
