Proper character customization and freedom to explore Hogwarts. I also want to collect and exchange Famous Witches and Wizards cards like in the ps2 Chamber of secrets game. Flying around Hogwarts would be amazing too.

And I remember hearing that the game would be set in the early 1900's? Nobody knows for sure though.
