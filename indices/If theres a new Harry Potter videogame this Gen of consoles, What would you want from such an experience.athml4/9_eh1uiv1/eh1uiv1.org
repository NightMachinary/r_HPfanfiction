Basically I want an Elder Scrolls: Hogwarts. That is to say, open world RPG with a main quest line that follows the major plot events of the story and a bunch of different side quests. Make, customize, and name your character, then just have an endless amount of things to do and interactions to be had.

Vanilla start would be you getting your letter, creating your avatar, then going to Diagon Alley where you can do a bunch of side quests while gathering school supplies and meeting familiar faces along the way. From there, do whatever, just like Skyrim.

Sorting Hat would be like an internet quiz, but a lot deeper and more scientific so that you couldn't just choose "I would be cunning and ambitious" if you were trying to get Slytherin. You could choose other factions, like loyalty to Dumbledore's Army or the Death Eaters.

Classes would allow you to level up attributes like a perk tree that would make spells stronger, last longer, effect a wider area, etc. There would be books lying around with lore friendly content that you could read and store in your living space (dorm room, family home, Malfoy Manor if you're a Death Eater). Some would also increase your skill.

Instead of races, you would have genetics. Pure-blood, half-blood, muggleborn, maybe some half creatures like half giant or half Veela, all with their own strengths and weaknesses in different areas of magic and combat.

Speaking of magic and combat, that would be played like a fighting game. As in, you would have to input certain combinations to get different spells, and the more complex the spell, the more complex the combos. There would be a screen that kept track of all of them as you learn them, of course, but being able to memorize them would make gameplay a lot more challenging and immersive, not to mention more streamlined.

Are you honestly still reading this? Holy shit, good on you, mate...

You would start out with a certain amount of money and doing favors for teachers, classmates, and shopkeepers would let you earn money which could then be spent in shops or buying small items from your classmates, like a few of their ingredients for potions class if you're missing the required items or some prank items from Fred and George. Food and drink would give you health and stamina, prank items would work on just about any NPC, with different consequences to be discovered depending on who you use them on.

I could go on and on, as I've thought about this so very much...but you get the gist, I'm sure.
