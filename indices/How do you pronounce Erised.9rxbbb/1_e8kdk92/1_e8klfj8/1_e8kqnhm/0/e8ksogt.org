Jim Dale is the narrator in the US audiobook versions of the HP books, which are not only widely beloved and critically acclaimed but also probably the best-selling audiobooks of all time.

There is also a Stephen Fry version, only available in the UK.

Most reasonable people think both versions are delightful. Notable difference is that Fry reads the book like a grandfatherly storyteller, while Dale reads the book like an actor (with distinctive voices for each character).
