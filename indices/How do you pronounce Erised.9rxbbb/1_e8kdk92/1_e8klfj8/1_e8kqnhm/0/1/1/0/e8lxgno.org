It's totally subjective, and I realize I'm in the minority here, most people love him. His female voices were just gratingly high-pitched to me, and I found the intonation really weird, totally different from how I "read" it in my head, to the point that I felt it changed the meaning. Especially with Hermione. I actually started with tOotP, so I don't think I ever stuck with it long enough to hear his McGonagall, but I hear he's pretty good at that one.
