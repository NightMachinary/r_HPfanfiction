  I often see fics with like a few hundred wordcount and ask myself. Why do the writers even bother? It's not like you can tell a tale in a few hundred words...

I don't know about that. Hemingway wrote one in six words. "For sale: baby shoes, never worn."

Most fanfiction of any length is junk. I haven't looked at a bunch of short stuff to judge, but I'd imagine it's a similar rate.
