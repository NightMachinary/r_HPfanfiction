There are short skits out there (forgot the actual name for them) which often only do one dialoge or scene.

Sometimes its also authros who're a bit more into posting their stories than actually writing them.

I think you can post challenges here. Another place are the countless fanfiction forums. Fanfiction.net being the biggest. Finding them is probably a thing to do in the forums and not on the sub.
