Didn't Junior only get out of his father's Imperius thanks to Voldemort and Wormtail?So, without Wormtail, Voldemort would need more time getting back to the UK and releasing Barty, which would basically set his comeback a year later at least.

Actually, Voldemort coming back when Harry is a bit older would be a very interesting read.

Edit: Oh, and also, with a dead Wormtail, Sirius would never break out of Azkaban and no one would never learn of his innocence. (which is kinda depressing)
