I actually remember a fanfiction where Draco was tortured by muggle means, which involved breaking his fingers and then forcing them back together jo so they could do it again next day, at the end Draco dies and becomes one of Hogwart's ghosts Maybe i mixed up different fics, but IIRC, this was from a fanfiction called Cruciamentum Eternus
