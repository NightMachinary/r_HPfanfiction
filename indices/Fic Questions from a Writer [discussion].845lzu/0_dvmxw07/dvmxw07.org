I definitely wouldn't describe events (or anything else) that are the same as canon. This is fanfiction, your readers already know it and it would be hard to do without slipping into plagiarism. But what you can do is describe what other characters are doing while the canon events are happening. As long as what they are doing drives the events of your story in some way. Essentially, tell your readers what they need to know and don't include things that don't add anything to the story. That's a basic rule for any fiction writing. As regards chapter length, everybody has different preferences but apparently the general advice is usually 3-6k words.
