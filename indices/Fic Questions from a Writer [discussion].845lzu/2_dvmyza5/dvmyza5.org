I'm doing a similar fic myself, but since I'm starting in the years before Hogwarts, it'll be a bit longer.

That aside, a recommendation I would have (if possible) would be to not stick too close to canon in every detail. I mean do we need to have the troll incident again? Having the trio together is nice, but sometimes it's rather welcome to have them come together in a different way than usual. Like in my own upcoming chapters, Harry & Hermione meet before Hogwarts because, for reasons I don't feel like detailing, he saves her from getting hit by a car when they're 9 years old. Getting into the characters's inner thoughts about the situation at hand can also go a long way for characterization.

Also, if there's an aspect of the canon events that doesn't make sense, I'd ditch it or rewrite it so it's coherent. Chuck the bad out, basically. :-)
