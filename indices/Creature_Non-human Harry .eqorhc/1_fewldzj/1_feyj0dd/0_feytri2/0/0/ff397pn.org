What I love about Rowling's books is that they are primarily mystery novels, set in a fantastic, magical world. They all have a mystery to be solved and they are all journeys of discovery, both in terms of plot and world building. I don't like history books, and I don't like memoirs because they're simply a recounting of events and I don't feel engaged.

I read an account of a British triple agent codenamed Zigzag, and despite it being an incredible story of adventure, danger and espionage, it was boring. "This happened, then this happened, then /this/ happened".

Harry is a Dragon is very much like this. There is so much potential there in discovering /why/ he's a dragon, seeing him solve problems /because/ he's a dragon, having him encounter legitimate difficulties that only a /dragon/ could overcome...

Nope. It's cool he can fly, but all they really do with it (so far) is let him travel to a nearby town to visit the library. And a piece of candy made him sneeze fire once. I'm on chapter 28 now, and things had better pick up!
