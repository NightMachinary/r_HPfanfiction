Gosh. I don't read the heavy stories. I got tricked into reading one where Harry had a pet magic snake, donated bone marrow to his aunt, she died, he lost his magic, then Snape adopted both Harry and Draco, then everybody ended up super gay. It was very well-written, so I stuck it out far longer than I should have. I'm fine with characters being gay, but they were all slowly revealed to be gay and the story went pretty deep into the relationship between Snape and Remus, sometimes full chapters of it. I'm not interested in that.

I trust you've read Seventh Horcrux? That one is quite funny.
