Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2996114/][Saphroneth]] is an alright story that lots of people love. There's no real conflict or mystery though, as Dragon Harry simply makes better choices than Canon Harry.

Edit: this is including the mystery of /why/ Harry is a dragon. Everyone accepts it and moves on. It's only really questioned, and briefly at that, during the train ride before first year.
