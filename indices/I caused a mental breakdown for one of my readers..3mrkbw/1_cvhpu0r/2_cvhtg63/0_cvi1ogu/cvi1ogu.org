The reviewer definitely spent more time on that review than I'd consider 'healthy'.

  And they also apply modern-time logic to the bass-ackwards wizarding world (as seen with the mentions of “abuse” and other such stuff).

Laws against child abuse are not a modern invention. Even if there was no definition of or punishment for abuse in the wizarding world, the HP series takes place in the muggle world as well. Describing the conditions at the Dursley's as abuse shouldn't be an issue, since it happens outside of the "bass ackwards" world where people know that locking a child in a cupboard for 11 years results in an orange jumpsuit. And as a comment on the view that muggles shouldn't impose their views on magicals I'll submit this quote as an example of how two societies with varying views can coexist:

  /"Be it so. This burning of widows is your custom; prepare the funeral pile. But my nation has also a custom. When men burn women alive we hang them, and confiscate all their property. My carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed. Let us all act according to national customs."/ -Charles James Napier [Said to Hindu priests complaining to him about the prohibition of Sati religious funeral practice of burning widows alive on her husband's funeral pyre.]
