  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.------EXPLICITLY ABANDONED. Sort-of re-write in progress, moving v. slowly.
