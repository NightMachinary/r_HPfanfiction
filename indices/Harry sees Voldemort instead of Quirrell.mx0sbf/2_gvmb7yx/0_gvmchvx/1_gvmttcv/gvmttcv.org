It's never been clearly said in canon, but since neither Voldemort nor any of his Death Eater show any sign of surprise after his resurection, we can assume he must have looked pretty much the same.

The changes would also be fitting with the appearance he had right before the war when Dumbledore refused him the post of DADA teacher (skin becomes pale, eyes red, nose shorter . . .).
