When Hagrid led him to the man in the corner of the pub, Harry did his best not to show how horrified he was. The man Hagrid introduced as Professor Quirrell had snow-white skin, a serpentine face, red eyes, and an incredibly skinny body. When Hagrid later said, "Even Professor Quirrell stuttered when he saw you - well, he stutters most of the time." Harry was confused. Professor Quirrell hadn't stuttered at all. He had an uncomfortably high and cold voice and seemed a little perplexed for a moment when Harry heard him swear, but he had spoken very clearly. Then when Hagrid talked about how it had all started since Quirrell got back from his sabbatical, Harry wondered if Hagrid was possibly living a little bit in his own world, with his love for dangerous monsters.

It was over a month later, after their first lesson in Defense Against the Dark Arts, that Harry wondered if it was perhaps himself who perceived the world differently than the others. It happened like this: Harry walked out of Defense Against the Dark Arts class with a big grin. Quirrell might not have shown them magic, but he was a great teacher. Unlike Binns, he had managed to hold Harry's attention just with his words. He was a wonderful speaker. As he had described the curses - Harry could vividly imagine doing all these things to Dudley.

"Wasn't that a great lesson?" Harry asked enthusiastically.

Ron looked at him as if he had gone mad. "Great? I hardly understood him! And this man is supposed to teach us to defend ourselves? He's afraid of his own shadow!"

"Totally true!" Agreed Dean, who had heard Ron speak. “And what is that hissing noise in the background? Does he keep angry snakes somewhere in the classroom?"

Some of his classmates shuddered ... but Harry decided that it might be better not to mention that he was hearing and seeing something completely different than they did. Defense Against the Dark Arts soon became Harry's favorite subject. Not that he was telling anyone. Every week Quirrell introduced a new jinx or curse. They didn't try these during the lesson, but Harry secretly practiced them outside of class. Harry loved it. In no other subject he was as successful as in Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was easy. Like flying.

Harry got a little bit worried about his favorite professor when he overheard Snape and Quirrell talking to each other after the game against Hufflepuff.

"... you filthy, lousy traitor ... once I have all my power back, I'll kill you slowly and painfully, Severus ..."

"Oh, I thought we'd keep that between us," said Snape in an icy voice. “After all, the students should not learn anything about the Philosopher's Stone. Have you already figured out how to get past Hagrid's beast?"

"I'm going to do things to you that you can't even imagine in your nightmares."

"You don't want me as an enemy, Quirrell," said Snape.

"Oh Severus, I think you don't want me to be your enemy, my young friend."

"You know exactly what I mean."

At the loud scream of an owl, Harry almost fell out of the tree and missed the rest of the conversation ... but it scared Harry a little bit at how violent Quirrell sounded - even if it was against Snape who was trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone.

He had even more doubts when he tried to stop Draco Malfoy, who had seen the dragon in Hagrid's hut. He sent a curse after Malfoy that Quirrell had taught him over the past week. The result was frightening. The Entrail-expelling Curse did exactly what it was meant to ... but seeing Malfoy's internal organs slowly spread across the Hogwarts grounds was a nightmare that would haunt Harry his entire life. Malfoy barely survived - and only because Snape was nearby and started casting the counter curse.

Harry was then sent to the Headmaster and had to explain where he learned the curse. Harry tried to explain that he had heard about it in Defense Against the Dark Arts - that he hadn't meant to kill Malfoy ... but no one believed him, since none of the first years had heard of the curse - not even Hermione. Gryffindor lost 150 points, Harry got detention for the rest of the year and was removed from the Quidditch team. The other students, hearing very quickly what Harry had done, began to steer away from him. Only Ron and Hermione stayed with him - assured him that they were his friends ... but even in their eyes he saw fear.

As it turned out, Quirrell took over Harry's detentions from Argus Filch. When he entered Quirrell's office, he wanted to be angry with the man. It was all his fault. He hadn't told him the curse could kill someone!

"They all think I'm evil!" Harry said angrily.

"Oh Harry," said the man. "There is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it."

"I almost killed Malfoy ..." said Harry.

"And since then he's left you and your friends alone, didn't he?"

Harry wanted to contradict him, wanted to tell him that what he had done wasn't right.

“The strong will always conquer the weak, Harry. Most of your classmates don't have the power you have and that's why they fear you. Do you want to make yourself smaller than you are all your life, be mediocre just to please those who will never be as great as you are? Think about who you want to be."

Detention quickly turned into private lessons between Quirrell and Harry. They discussed the state of the magical world and Quirrell taught him spells he hadn't even dreamed of. Soon it was no longer just Defense Against the Dark Arts that Quirrell showed him, but advanced transfiguration and charms as well. Quirrell also listened when Harry just wanted to talk. About the fact that even his friends seemed afraid of him. About his classmates who called him the next Dark Lord behind his back. And about the Dursleys who hated him, just because he had magic. Slowly but surely Quirrell became a mentor and the closest thing Harry had ever had to a parental figure.

It was when Harry, Ron and Hermione set out to save the Philosopher's Stone that Harry's world was turned upside down again. It wasn't Snape trying to steal the stone ... it was Quirrell. And Quirrell was really Lord Voldemort, his parents' murderer. In front of the mirror, Harry didn't know what to do. He wanted to protect the stone, he was sure of it ... and before he could doubt it, the stone landed in his pocket. But then Quirrell ... no Lord Voldemort started talking.

"Harry, we've spent a lot of time together over the past year. I've helped you, I've listened to you. Remember - our conversation after Christmas, Harry - good and bad is just a matter of perspective. I know you, Harry. I know you no longer want to be weak - no longer a victim of your relatives, that muggle scum who wouldn't even recognize greatness when it hits them in the face. You no longer want to be exposed to the judgment of your classmates. You want to be free, I see it, I feel it ... all you have to do is give me the stone."

Harry remembered now how his classmates had avoided him, hated him when it was just an accident. Voldemort was telling the truth ... he was the only one who had never judged him. Slowly he reached out his hand and gave him the stone.

Voldemort smiled. “You did well, Harry. Together we will be great."
