I considered it. But I am currently writing another story and I really have problems in writing 11 year olds because I actually work with them and know how they are. Honestly: most of the time even JKRs version of eleven year olds are to mature - let alone all those eleven year olds you see in fanfiction.

So I am not sure if I will do it.
