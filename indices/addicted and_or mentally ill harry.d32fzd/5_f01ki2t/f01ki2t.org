I found that most fanfiction writers who tackle such problems gloss over them or don't delve into any detail. Which is expected, I suppose, since talking about such issues is very difficult for the people who experienced them firsthand and most others just know about them second or even third hand, not from the perspective of the addict.

It's fanfiction after all. Also any fanfiction with such a heavy theme, if written accurately, would be depressing as hell.
