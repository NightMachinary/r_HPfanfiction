The Taking Control series is a classic post ootp series, with an absurd word count, but it's incomplete. It's an indyish harry, he doesn't go full anarchy but the premise is "taking back control of his life." Harry/Ginny is the pairing.

The Refiner's Fire is set post Ootp, and while Harry doesn't really rebel (he keeps the same allies as canon, plus a few more), he does become absurdly op. Like, how ridiculously op he is an actual plot point. There's an oc/Harry romance at the very beginning, but it's temporary, Harry/Ginny is the main pairing.

In Make a Wish, Harry just fucks off and goes on a journey around the world to enjoy life post ootp, wanting to see the world before the prophecy kills him. No pairing.

Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy is a post ootp old timer, Harry/Ginny, and as evident in the title, plenty of op inheritance stuff.

Harry Potter and the Power of Revenge is the ultimate indy harry, he literally relocates hogwarts and creates an army against voldemort. Can't remember if there is or isn't a pairing, but of there is it must not be that important.

Dumbledore's Army by Bobmin (may he rest in peace) is an Indy ish Harry, he distrusts Dumbledore for some amount of time, by if iirc they make up. But he creates a hogwarts army in this one, which is pretty bad ass. Harry/Ginny.

And last but not least, I know you said no crossover, but this meets every other one of your requests, and honestly, you don't need to even know the source material to enjoy it (I didn't know any of it.) It's Mutant Storm, an xmen crossover set post Ootp, Harry/Ginny. Lily had a mutant twin (Jean gray) the she was obliviated of. When Harry releases a telepathic maelstrom of suffering the summer after ootp, it's sensed by his mutant aunt. He gets taken to the mutant school and gets a shit load of mutant powers. Lots of training and such.

But it's very linked with the Hogwarts story line, it's never full seperate. Eventually it even shifts all the way back to Hogwarts.

I didn't list the powers he gets in these bc honestly I couldn't remember, it's been so long, but I'm sure there's plenty I'm no remembering. If you have any questions about them I'm happy to talk about them!
