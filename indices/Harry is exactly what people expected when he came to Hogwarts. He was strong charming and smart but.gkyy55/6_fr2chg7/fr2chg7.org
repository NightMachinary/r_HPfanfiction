I'd honestly prefer if he was somewhat tangible, but heavily influenced by the belief that created him. It would be an interesting Horror scenario if some politician Lex Luthor'd it and as a result of smear campaign many people believed 'Harry' went Dark and EVUL.

Cue 'Harry' drinking in the new belief and changing to match... Of course, as 'he' was opposed, but won and won and won... The legend would grow, and so would he until all hope would be lost.

If you needed to examine such 'Harry' up close, you could have the quality of faith matter too - so a little girl believing in her heart that despite everything Harry would not hurt her would be safe, if traumatized - because adults couldn't produce that pure a belief and after feeding him dread for years, the conventional methods wouldn't work.
