Though this contains a host of other tropes, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies]]

Technically has Harry working for the unspeakables for a portion of it. It is actually one of my favorite fics, and for a long while was the benchmark I used for comparing other works. Don't be put off by TMR in the characters. It has absolutely nothing to do with Slash.

Also has Harry and Ginny working as unspeakables. It is a very curious reversal of roles, though I have since stopped reading the author's work.
