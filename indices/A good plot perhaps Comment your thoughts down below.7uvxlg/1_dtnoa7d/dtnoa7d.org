I like this. I like the opportunities you would have to play with "Did this happen in the past because of fate or circumstance?" questions. This idea is played with a lot in AUs, but I like the idea that, in this story of yours, James and Lily did /actually/ fall in love in a prior reincarnation, and now the question is will it happen again, or will different circumstances lead to a different outcome? Will the marauders be friends in this life? Will Peter betray them again in this life?

I also really like the idea of playing with this idea for Tom Riddle. In a loving (or at least less-neglectful) upbringing, how do his prodigy characteristics manifest? For a good Tom Riddle, I feel like the opportunities are limitless.

Go for it! Feel free to return here and let me know when there's something to read!
