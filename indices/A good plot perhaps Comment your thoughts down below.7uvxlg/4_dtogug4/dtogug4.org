A main character that is thousands of years old? Unless you are using time-travel, then the world is thousands of years older as well. Can you build a plausible world (including magic) of the 50th century? Or the 70th? What happened in the past? How can they access Hogwarts records at all?

And once you have managed that, can you build a plausible Harry that is so old?
