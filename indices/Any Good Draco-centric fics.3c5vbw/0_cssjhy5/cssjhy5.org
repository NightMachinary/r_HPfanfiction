I don't agree with the common fandom Draco characterization, so it's difficult for me to find good Draco fics, too. I much prefer him miserable and cowardly! [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]] writes one of the few Dracos I like. Her fics are pretty light on the romance even if they're marked with a ship; they are much more like character fics. I have [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322009][a fic]] as well but it's unfinished. The other Draco fics I know of feature heavier romance.
