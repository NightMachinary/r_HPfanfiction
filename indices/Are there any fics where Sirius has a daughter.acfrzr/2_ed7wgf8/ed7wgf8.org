The entire Dangerverse is a family-centric Universe of very well written fics, and Sirius has a daughter. Their relationship and family dynamic is very important to the stories.

If I remember correctly, this was originally finished back in 2003-2004, so is pre-HBP and pre-DH. That said, I think of this series when I think of stories I like more than HBP and DH.
