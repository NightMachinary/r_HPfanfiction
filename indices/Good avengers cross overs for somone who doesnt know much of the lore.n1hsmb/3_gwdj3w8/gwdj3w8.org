I read Finding Home before I watched a single solitairy movie - my knowledge of marvel came from the 90s cartoons and so not actually relevant to the MCU.

Honestly, I've read a /lot/ of crossovers where I had no idea wtf was going on with the other fandom, and was usually fine from context. Just sort by favourites/kudos or whatever and give it a shot.
