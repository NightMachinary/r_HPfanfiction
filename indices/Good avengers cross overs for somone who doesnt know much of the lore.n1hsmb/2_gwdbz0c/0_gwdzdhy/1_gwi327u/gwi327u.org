ATPF is definitely one for the long haul. Even at this stage, the author thinks there's a year or so worth of updates remaining. Don't feel intimidated by the chapter sizes. Its really well written and since updates a relatively slow (I mean, 50k words every 1-2 months (guesstimate based on what I remember) is pretty good) they'res plenty of time to read it before the next chapter comes out.
