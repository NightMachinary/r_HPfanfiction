A really good story I started reading this weekend, thats being updated regularly. Harry spends a lot of his time studying and learning different types of magic. He becomes very powerful at a young age, but doesn't show off, or care what others think about him. Dumbledore is more like a mentor, allowing him access to the restricted section. The Dursleys don't have a major role beyond what they do in Canon, but its a great story about a powerful and motivated Harry.
