Another great story I was reading recently, unfortunately it hasn't been updated in over a year. Its about a Harry that gets transported to a parallel universe after all thats left of either side is a few wizards, Voldemort, and Harry. He arrives in what would be his fourth year, his family is still alive with multiple kids, and a "girl who lived". Harry gets adopted by the Flamels, and goes to Hogwarts in his fourth year with the knowledge of a 21 year old. He has a strained relationship with Dumbledore, gets placed in Slytherin, becomes good friends with Malfoy, and basically turns Slytherin house on its head with new changes. Very powerful Harry, who doesn't give a fuck. One of my favorite stories I've read in a long time.
