Oh my god just Hagrid holding baby Harry over Aragorg to introduce his friend to his son. ðŸ¤£ Minerva spends hours baby proofing the hut then says fuck it and tries to convince Hagrid to live in the castle like the other professors.

Hagrid teaching first years care of magical creatures with an infant strapped to his chest, Harry fears nothing.

Hagrid cries with pride when his boy talks to a garden snake.

"He's just like his mummy he is! It's a family gift you see, working with the beasts."
