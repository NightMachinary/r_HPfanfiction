Hagrid brings home the dragon egg and Harry drags Ron down to meet the new baby.

Harry is convinced that he could talk to a dragon if he met one since they're "practically snakes".

Harry rides on Fang like a horse as a toddler, that dog is a coward except when Harry is around. He'd fight a werewolf for the boy.

Ron nearly shits himself when a spider the size of a cat scuttles up to Harry in their dorm. Harry laughs so much he cries at the amount of screaming from his roommates. "This is just Melvin, she's too small to kill anybody."

The centaurs love how polite he is and gift him pretty rocks and skulls when Harry comes along with his daddy for negotiations, The children of the herd and Harry play for hours.

Just, sweet baby Harry makes friends with all the creatures of the forest and grows up taught to treat everyone as people.
