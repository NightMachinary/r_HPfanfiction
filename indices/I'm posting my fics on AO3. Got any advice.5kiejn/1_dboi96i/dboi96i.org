Tagging is an art that many haven't yet grasped.

Before I even begin, I'm just going to rant on the people that frequently tag asinine things and have them added to multiple tags, such as some authors who insist on doing the following: 'I know it's silly', 'but I really think that', 'Harry could use a massive hug!'. It's such a small thing, but it completely ruins the flow of the tags and takes up space that could be sued for other important tags.

Tags such as '<character> needs a hug!' or '<character> is so cute my brain hurts!' don't contribute to the tags at all.

Another thing is not giving away to much information in the tags. I have seen quite a few fics where the fic has been spoiled because of the tags. You want to hook readers, not make them sigh and already know what's going to happen. You need to keep them coming back with each chapter you post.
