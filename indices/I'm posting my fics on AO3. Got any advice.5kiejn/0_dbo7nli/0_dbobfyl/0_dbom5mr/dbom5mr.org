Tell me about it. Search for "Harry Potter" and you'll get a load of fics that aren't Harry centric. Hell, you'll get a load of fics that don't even really involve him that much - he's merely given a passing mention, so the author tagged him.

AO3 tagging system is such a mess that it's pretty much irredeemable at this point for actually finding anything useful. Searching for any reasonably useful tags - such as any of the common pairings - will return basically every fic on the site, whether or not that tag is the focus of the fic or not.
