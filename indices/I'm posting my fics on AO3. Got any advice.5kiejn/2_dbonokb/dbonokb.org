I've just got one thing to add. Using Slash and And interchangeably is just stupendous. As in "Harry Potter/Ginny Weasley, Harry Potter/Ron Weasley, Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy" And when you check the rest of the tags you realise that it's actually a Harry/Draco fic. Proper tagging is key. Trust me. Proper yet sparse is the way to go, at least in my opinion.
