Eh, it's not that I have an issue with it. But there are those that have a 10K story and they've got a huge tag section. But then again some stories have gotten me to read them because of what was said in the tags. And thinking of it, tagging is essentially a series of words that should be used to write the summary. I'll have to consider that for my next fic :)
