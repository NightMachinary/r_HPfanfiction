I don't have a problem with tag sections longer than the summary. I do have a problem with people who used like, eight tags, and then the fic is 300k. There's GOT to be more than that in there...

tbh what I really want is for AO3 to add an user-side option where if you don't want to see tags/warnings, you check off a box in your profile that says 'Hide Tags and Warnings' and then you don't have to see them, you just see title/author/rating/fandom(s)/summary, and those of us who do want to can still see them, and everyone's happy. But that's probably a pipedream.
