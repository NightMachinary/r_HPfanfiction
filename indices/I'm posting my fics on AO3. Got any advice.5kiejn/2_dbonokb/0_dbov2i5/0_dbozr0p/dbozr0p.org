I know that. I tag romantic relationships with a Slash. And if I were to tag every non-romantic relationship it would just make the entire tag section five times longer than my actual summary. So, that's a no-go. Besides, it'll usually become apparent based on the summary or other tags.

Yeah, I've seen stuff like that too often to even bother thinking of reporting it.
