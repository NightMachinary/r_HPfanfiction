& is actually proper syntax for a non-romantic relationship, so you'll see things like 'Harry Potter & Sirius Black, Harry Potter/Ginny Weasley,' indicating that it's probably a Sirius-raising-Harry fic where Harry is paired with Ginny.

Anyone tagging a romantic pairing as Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy should be reported, and the AO3 tag wranglers fix that!
