Okay so a lot of different advice - some saying don't overdo tagging and others saying don't underdo! But imo only smut has a WALL of tags and pairings. If I see that when I'm looking for substance I just scroll right past.

But at the same time, you gotta tag the main things so that people can find you. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708/chapters/6238094][Another Mask Behind You]] is an example of terrible tagging while [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6239806/chapters/14295997][The Stately Homes of Wiltshire]] does a great job.
