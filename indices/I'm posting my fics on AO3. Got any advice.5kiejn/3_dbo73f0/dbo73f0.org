You should tag properly. Tag main characters, tag ships, but tag the actual content of the fic - particular themes, particular kinds of characters (e.g. Independent Harry), genres, et cetera.

The benefit of Ao3 is that it allows you to put in all kinds of tags, and you *SHOULD* use them.

The HP community on Ao3 is very small, and people don't just trawl for random crap like they do on FFnet - people search very specifically for certain ships or themes, so the more you tag (within reason), the more readers you'll get.
