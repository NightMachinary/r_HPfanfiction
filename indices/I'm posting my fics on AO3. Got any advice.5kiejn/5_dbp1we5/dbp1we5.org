Also remember to tag for triggery stuff if it applies. While AO3 has specific warnings for big stuff (non-con, character death, etc.), it doesn't hurt to also include those in the tags as well, since people can miss the AO3 warnings and look only at the tags. Tag for major stuff only. For chapter specific warnings, just put those in the author's notes for the chapter.

Basically, think about how you would go about finding your fic and use those tags. Think about stuff you would want to avoid and include those tags as well. Don't abuse the tags tumblr-style and ramble. But don't be afraid to use fandom tropes as well. (For example, "Howard Stark's A+ parenting" is a tag used in Marvel fandom to indicate that Tony Stark's daddy issues are present in the fic.)

Finally, AO3 has specific places for you to put author's notes. Make use of those. Don't leave your notes in the body of the fic.
