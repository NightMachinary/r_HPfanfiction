Nope. I love AO3 tagging and the smart grouping of tags. So if I click "Female Harry" and then limit it to Harry Potter, then I get every Fem!Harry, Girl!Harry, Genderbent Harry, Trans Harry, etc. back as a result. I know it looks odd seeing stories with TONS of tags, but it really does help me narrow down whether I want to read a fic or not.
