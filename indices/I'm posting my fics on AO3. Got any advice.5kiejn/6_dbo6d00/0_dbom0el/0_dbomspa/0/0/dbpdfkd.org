For me that isn't "proper" tagging. I have seen stories that have incorrect tagging or inappropriate tagging and that is annoying. But sometimes there is a story that is really, really good that I get from maybe a recommendation here that I hadn't read before solely because it didn't have tags that would have highlighted it for me. ): It's a hard balance.
