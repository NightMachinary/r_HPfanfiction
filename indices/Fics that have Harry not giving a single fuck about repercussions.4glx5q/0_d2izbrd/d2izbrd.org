To be honest, the premise is almost a direct ripoff of The Denarian Trilogy by Shezza (with permission, supposedly) but makes Harry quite a bit stronger; it also has a bunch of cliches (WBWL, Harry's name is not actually Harry) and quite a few grammar issues, so I'm not extolling the writing or the story itself.

Having said that, the events starting from chapter 9 through the end of what's been written are my absolute favorite guilty pleasure to read. Harry is so ridiculously badass (almost over the top), has no qualms/regrets about any of the decisions he makes, and essentially does whatever the fuck he wants do.

So yeah, don't expect to find a great fic, but I wanted to throw it out there because I feel like it really matches up with what you're asking for. If you can get through or skim through the first 8 chapters, then the rest of the chapters are a little more enjoyable to read.
