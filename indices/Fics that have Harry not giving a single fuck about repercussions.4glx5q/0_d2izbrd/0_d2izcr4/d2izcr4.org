  He hated his life, his relatives, and most importantly, his own weakness. So when he chances upon a Denarius coin, he took it, even if it meant damning his own soul in the process. And now, he's a Denarian, the host of a Fallen Angel, and the Fallen is hungry for vengeance; and for him, absolutely nothing will stand in his way. Based on Shezza's Denarian Renegade. Slight HP/FD.
