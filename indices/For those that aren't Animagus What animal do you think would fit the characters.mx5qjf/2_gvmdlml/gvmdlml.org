I was brainstorming who would be a better Peter Pettigrew if Sirius had a do-over chance and I aged up Colin Creevey to take that place (blond, bit of a follower, but he's more loyal).

His Animagus form would either be a Capuchin Monkey, or a Squirrel. They had explanations on the Patroni wiki that worked, and he could help the team. I just can't not get excited when I imagine the Marauders with their monkey mascot.
