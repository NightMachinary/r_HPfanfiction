My rule of thumb is that if wizard has Patronus that is not a magical creature, then it is their Animagus form. So for Harry it is deer, Hermione - otter, Ron - Jack Russel terrier, etc. As for characters whose Patroni were not mundane animals, there is only one of relevance: Albus Dumbledore. In my speculation, his Animagus form would be either goat as his brother associated with goats strongly or grey heron, because it is considered to be a prototype Egyptian god Bennu, who in turn is considered an inspiration for phoenix, which is Dumbledore's Patronus. As for few characters whose Patroni are not shown, my theories include Alastor Moody being wolverine, Hagrid being a bear and Voldemort - snake (python).
