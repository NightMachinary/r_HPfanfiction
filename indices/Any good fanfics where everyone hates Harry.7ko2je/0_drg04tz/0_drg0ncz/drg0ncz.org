Honestly anything like those is good, as long as it is a good fic, in your opinion. I have way too much time on my hands, so I should be able to read a lot. I'm just looking for a good fic where Harry doesn't really have anyone to turn to. But also bonus if people are trying to get back into his good graces and failing. Thanks.
