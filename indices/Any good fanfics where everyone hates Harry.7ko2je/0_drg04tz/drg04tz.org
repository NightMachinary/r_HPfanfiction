Anything specific you were looking for? In canon, Harry's disliked by the Dursleys for being magical, half the school for losing 150 points in a night, half the school for potentially being the Heir of Slytherin, half the school for being in the Triwizard Tournament, half of magical Britain due to the Ministry's smear campaign, and especially the Death Eaters for being Voldemort's number one target.

Granted, most of these are transient, but still, with how fickle and vengeful and aggressive the magical world seems to be, it's a wonder Harry was able to muster up enough love for them to do that self-sacrifice thing.

So, what specifically were you after? Fics where Harry's hated for something he did do, fics where he's a scapegoat/propaganda victim, fics where Ron & Hermione are card-carrying jerks and Harry finds solace with an OC, fics where Harry gets rich and everyone who previously hated him are trying and failing to get into his good graces...?
