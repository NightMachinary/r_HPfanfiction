I definitely see where you're coming from. I do like AO3's system better, especially when it comes to more complex fics as you can actually have a conversation with the author about some things that maybe weren't so clear, and you can bounce some ideas off of them as well. And yeah, OC stories are generally not my thing. The only OC story that I actually love is the Calista Snape series by Arinus. Terrific writing and great characterizations.
