TBH I find AO3 comment sections to be waay too coddling. you can't criticize anything about a story without being bombed and told: "don't like don't read." Ususally not with those words.

I find the tag system of AO3 makes Authors/Readers-in-the-comments-section unprepared for criticism because generally someone who reads the tags, won't bother reading, but if they decide to take a chance, end up not liking it, and decide to share that in the comments, they get bombed.

On FFN you seem to get extremely polarized reviews, and unlike AO3, theres no real comment threads for people to follow a conversation/argument. It's just a bunch of jumbled comments, which eliminates ganging up on someone who has a differing opinion.

I generally like FFN's system better, but AO3 is easier to find good stories that you're looking for.

As far as the OP's question, I personally dont read OC-centric stories. 9.9 times out of 10, its a self-insert, and even when it isn't, theres generally a bias towards the OC.
