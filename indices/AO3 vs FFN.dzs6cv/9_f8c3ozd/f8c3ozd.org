A) AO3 works by tags. Not knowing what type of story you wrote, it might be easier to find or stand out on AO3 more. Haphne, gay protagonists, bashing, etc. all do better on AO3. FFN has more of a 'rich get richer' approach - once you get momentum/attention, it's easier for people to find your fic. In FFN, you can really only search by characters, and all your characters are OCs. Of course you're not going to get as many views there, compared to AO3, where you could search for any 'theme' tags.

B) Pretty much everyone here goes through both AO3 and FFN. If people have seen it on AO3, they're not going to reread it on FFN.

C) People are probably seeing that you only have 3 chapters and dipping instead of reading it through. There are more fics on FFN, so it's easy to dismiss a fledgling fic and try something else.

D) If you posted on your FFN that you're crossposting, they probably just went there, because you apparently upload there first.

E) Some people browse FFN on third party apps to make reading easier, so maybe that's the case here.

F) Are you sure the formatting carried over?

G) Join a community on FFN. There are plenty for OC fics. That's how you get views, in my limited experience.
