  Pretty much everyone here goes through both AO3 and FFN. If people have seen it on AO3, they're not going to reread it on FFN.

I don't know about other people, but if I like a fic then I make a point of favoriting/bookmarking it on both sites. I try to help the authors I like get more recognition for their stories, even if I'm just elevating them a tiny bit in search results.
