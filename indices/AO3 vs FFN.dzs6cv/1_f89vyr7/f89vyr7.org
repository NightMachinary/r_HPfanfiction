You've got to consider what people search for. I expect your story will continue to do better on AO3 than FFN because of the tag system. In a story with pretty much no HP characters, FFN leaves you very little to attach to your story for people to find you. You're basically only going to get those who are sorting by newest updated, and even then that'll only last while your most recent chapter is new.

AO3 lets you tell people more about your story than just with character tags, so it's easier for people to actually get to your fic to read it.
