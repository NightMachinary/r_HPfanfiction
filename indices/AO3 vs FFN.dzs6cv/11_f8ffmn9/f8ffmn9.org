OC's are extremely unpopular in just about any fandom unless they're linked to an already existing canon character.

IMHO OC's are really unpopular because having them defeats the purpose of a story being fanfiction. The more OC's you add the further you push your content away from being fanfiction at all.

It's just my opinion but if I wanted to read about a ton of OC's, I'd just go pick up an original fiction book somewhere.
