I think OCs are generally a turn off for most readers... they are reading fanfiction because they love the original characters and are looking for more time with their beloved characters. I don't know if it is a AO3 vs. FFnet thing or not. It is easier to search on AO3 for characters, ships, etc. as well as filter out tags that you want to avoid.
