I think OCs are great. It gives the characters more opportunity to explore the Wizarding world. With OCs you run less chance of breaking existing characters. Personally I am a fan of Wizarding world fics. New characters in Wizarding world , probably a generation or two ahead of trio and doing their own thing. Also giving throwback to the old guys just to keep some anchor to existing characters. The stats for now are low to say something conclusive but keep going.
