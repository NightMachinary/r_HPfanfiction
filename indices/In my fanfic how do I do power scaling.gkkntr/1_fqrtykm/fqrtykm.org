Give powers you think are cool, just as long as you give them a justification, it doesn't have to be good, just a reason.

Keep it loose to you don't write yourself into a corner and remember the rules of making a proper DnD spell: it should do something useful, cool and theme appropriate.

​

As for power creep a few easy options

-Follow the shonen example and set up a strong enemy to loom over the protag, slowly building up to a tough fight.

Harry beats Draco, Draco loses to Snape, Harry must prove he can beat Snape before he goes after Voldemort.

​

-Follow the Sat morning cartoon example and have a bunch of enemies in flux with the heroes. All the powerlevels don't matter as much and it's where personalities, abilities and type matchups really matter.

Harry can beat Voldemort most times, but not Draco all the time, but never Snape.
