Fake Moody was teaching spell deflection in 4th year, separate from the use of the Shield charm. Occlumency and Legilimency may have been a bit more prevalent than you might think. We know that Dumbledore, Snape, Voldemort, and Bellatrix were skilled in it, but then Draco was taught the basics of it over the summer by Bellatrix, and it's not like she's a trusted figure in his life, or known for her tutoring skills. Horace Slughorn wasn't a strong personality but he was skilled enough with the mind arts to defend his mind against Dumbledore and to modify an memory for extraction.
