All is thought lost, Voldemort takes over Hogwarts. The captive students wait for any sign of resistance, and find it one day, in the form of a figure emerging from the Forbidden Forest, zweihander-holding arms held aloft in a "well, what is it?" gesture. Removing the best looking mask in the world, Harry storms the castle with infinite poise, staggerlocks Voldemort to death, calls his corpse a casul and reminds everyone that INT is just blue Dex.
