"Your scar, Harry, is far more than that. It is an accursed mark: the Darksign."

Dumbledore's words, uttered so gravely, sank over Harry like a smothering veil. Fawkes crooned from his perch by the grand fireplace, and Harry met the creature's shining black eyes for a moment; he read sadness there. Mourning.

Harry looked to the Headmaster again, and spoke with a throat gone dry. "Darksign, sir? I don't . . ."

"No, no . . . of course you don't." Dumbledore looked hunched against invisible weight, the same oppressive force that seemed to drag speech from his gentle frame against his will. "It is a curse---an abominable act of hatred born from a festering mind." For a moment his expression tautened into iron, the change subtle, yet chilling. "While the Darksign marks your flesh, your soul may never traverse beyond our plane of existence; you are bound here."

Again Fawkes cried out, soft and musical. A momentous, dreadful feeling wormed through Harry's heart as he struggled to grasp the implications put before him. "I'm 'bound here'? So I, what---I can't die?"

"Quite the contrary, I'm afraid," Dumbledore said. His brilliant blue eyes were like sunlit chips of ice. "For your remaining lucid years, death will be your most steadfast companion. You may die---you /will,/ again and again, and you will return . . . but not unscathed."

The silence rang, and the Headmaster studied Harry's face with a maddening look of piteous sorrow. Hogwarts' great bell reverberating through the stones forestalled a reply for a moment. Harry thought of Ron and Hermione, likely heading to lunch together, the two of them idly speculating what new piece of Voldemort's history might he and Dumbledore be unearthing.

Dumbledore continued to watch him, loathe to elaborate, perhaps. But they both knew he must.

The quiet stretched until Harry forced himself to speak around the lump in his throat. "I-I die, and I come back, and then . . . what happens?" The Headmaster closed his eyes as if against a blinding light, and every second he withheld, Harry's dread heightened. "Professor?" he added with urgency.

"Your soul, Harry," Dumbledore said, voice gentle as down and wracked with pain. "It will . . . shed. Fall apart. With every death, a loss---a fragment, not more, but each sliver worth everything dear to you, over again, until nothing remains; not a thought for your deepest desires, not a memory of your most cherished experiences, not a notion of feeling for those you now love."

Horror spiraled down Harry, cold and stark, and the hair on his neck stood up as he thought suddenly of Barty Crouch's son, blank-eyed and huddled against a wall, the slight rise and fall of his chest a solitary sign of life.

"Yes," Dumbledore said, his voice wavering a little. "That . . . that is your fate. Death and death again, until you are but a hollow shell, utterly numb and ever-enduring. I am so very sorry, my boy."
