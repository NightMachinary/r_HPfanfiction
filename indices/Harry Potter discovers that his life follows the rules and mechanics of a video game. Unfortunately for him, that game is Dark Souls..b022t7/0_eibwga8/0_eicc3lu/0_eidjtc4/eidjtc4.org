Those plots sound quite good! From my end, it would be a tragedy, I think. Brainstorming, I imagine Harry would eventually accept the fate Dumbledore laid out as inevitable, but Ron and Hermione certainly wouldn't. They'd search for answers as they hunt the horcruxes, chase fruitless leads.

Maybe Harry finds he can supplement his flagging soul with Voldemort's sundered pieces at the cost of his identity, which he is slowly shedding anyway. (What he doesn't know is that death isn't all that degrades the soul of the cursed; acts of murder, which go from abhorrent to necessary as his soul mingles with Tom's castoffs; also, despair/hopelessness eats away at the soul, the catalyst for this downfall.)

Perhaps the curse would lift on the caster's death (Voldemort, ofc). But by then, Harry is gone, something much more chilling in his place.
