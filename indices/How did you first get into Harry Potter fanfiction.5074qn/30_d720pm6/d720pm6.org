My art teacher's daughter actually wrote a really well known fic on fanfiction.net and mentioned it in passing to my friend and I after class once. We spent the rest of the term trying to find out what it was calles until she finally gave in. I read it for jokes but actually got sucked in and read most of it (~30 chapters) in a single day. Been into Hermione fics ever since.
