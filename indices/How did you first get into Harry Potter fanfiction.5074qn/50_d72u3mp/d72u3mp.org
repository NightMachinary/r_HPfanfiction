So, I used to be really into taking online quizzes when I was around 13-14. I used this website called Quizilla (or whatever it was before that). People started posting fanfiction in this format instead of quizzes, and I was intrigued. It started off with Yuu Yuu Hakusho. Then I saw my first Harry Potter one (I can't remember what it was about, though. Soon enough, I'd fall head over heels in love with learning about everyone's interpretations and seeing unlikely pairings. My first fanfic was drarry, and I've never been the same.
