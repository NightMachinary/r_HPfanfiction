I'm just discovered it on hp pages. I didn't have internet at home, and the whole thing was new and rush developing. I just copied everything I could on floppy discs (lol) - including photos, interviews, books in fan translation etc. and read later at home. I was young and loved dramione fics, and this way I also read my first slash fiction ever. I think I have never even thought that two boys could do it xD
