I don't even remember. I think I found it through the Harry Potter community on AOL. I remember reading the Eliza Diawana Snape trilogy (though absolutely nothing about it) and Paradigm of Uncertainty before finding Schnoogle and eventually ff.net. I had to have been about 13. It was definitely before GoF. Which means I've been reading Harry Potter fanfic more than half my life.
