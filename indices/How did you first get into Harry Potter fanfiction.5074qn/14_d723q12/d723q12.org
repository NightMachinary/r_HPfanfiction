I started reading fanfiction on muggle.net in fifth grade between GoF and OotP (sometime between 2000-2001). It was much easier to be satisfied by any random fic back then. Harry/Ginny was a crazy idea, or at least seemed like it to me. Fics got better and better until about 2009-2010 when the rate of new fics started to dropoff. After that I was well into college and I took a break. I read for a couple months in 2012 and didn't touch it again until December of 2014.

I tried my hand at writing sometime around Junior high (sometime around 2002-2003), but it was horrifically bad and I never wrote again. At this point I'd been reading fanfiction on and off for around 15 years and I was a man grown. I started writing at the end of 2014 and practiced on and off for over a year before finally submitting something reasonable earlier this year.

Great times. No matter which school I went to, what grade i was in, or whether I was happy or sad, Harry and the gang were always there when I wanted or needed them. Harry Potter is just as much a part of me as any TV show I watched, sport I played or friends I've had over any period of my life.
