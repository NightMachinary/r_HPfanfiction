I discovered fan fiction through Buffy "episode guides" I missed all of the episodes until reruns because it aired on tuesday nights when my parents dragged me and my sister to their weekly AA meeting. So my fix was episode summaries, eventually I noticed that one of the websites had a fanfic link. By the time Harry Potter was a thing I was reading about anything that interested me, it eventually became my main fandom.
