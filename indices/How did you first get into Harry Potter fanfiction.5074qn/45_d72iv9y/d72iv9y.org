My entrance is probably pretty typical. I wanted to know what happened after the war and before the Epilogue. So, lots of Harry/Ginny stuff, lots of Harry becoming a DADA teacher, lots of him becoming a pro Quidditch player. Thankfully, that ran its course pretty quickly, though I do look back fondly on the times where I could read pretty much anything, and I would devour 200k words in a day, every day, because the whole fandom was new to me, and I hadn't developed my bullshit detector yet.
