I read Not From Others in March/April from the fanfic thread on the HP subreddit and came over Oh God Not Again by accident in a thread where they asked which "fourth school" Harry represented during the Triwizard Tournament. After that I started paying attention to that fanfic thread and after a while, I subscribed to this subreddit as well.
