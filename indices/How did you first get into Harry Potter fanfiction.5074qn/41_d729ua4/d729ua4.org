Honestly? I'm ashamed to admit it, but the thing that got me into HP fanfiction was, well.. My Immortal. Not because I enjoyed it! But rather because a friend and I decided to look it up after hearing about it somewhere and read it aloud for a few of our other friends and had a great time laughing at how terrible it was. Later in the week I realized that if there was /terrible/ fanfiction of the Harry Potter series, surely there was /good/ fanfiction, right? So naturally (and dumbly, in hindsight, because it was the worst possible place to look for good fanfiction) I looked for smut. Specifically Lucius smut.

Luckily the first one I read, though now long forgotten, was well written! I fell in love with romance fics and the rest is history.
