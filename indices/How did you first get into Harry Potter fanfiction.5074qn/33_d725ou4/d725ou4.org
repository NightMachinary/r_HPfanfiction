I read some random, forgettable stuff on ff a while back, but wasn't really into it much. I was much more into Buffy fanfic, and read linkffn(6093972) because I knew the author. HPMOR was the second memorable fic that I read, and then I read Worm because it was recommended by the author, and natural 20 as well. The I was reading a lot of Worm fanfiction on spacebattles, and I read Seventh Horcrux and Applied Cultural Anthropology.

I was somewhat spoiled by the higher quality of writing on spacebattles, and only started reading other stories after finding this sub.

Please do give Worm a try. Very loosely put, it is a great deconstruction of the superhero genre.
