After "Harry Potter and Order of the Phoenix" came out, I started writing my vision of Harry Potter book 6. Back then I had never heard the term "Fanfiction". I thought I was doing something unique! HA! Then I discovered the world of fanfiction, and published my first story on Chamber of Secrets form (Mugglenet affiliate) back in 2005/2006. I've been writing fanfiction ever since. Still to this day. Have recently surpassed 4 Million published words on Fanfiction.net.
