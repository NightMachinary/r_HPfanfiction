I originally started looking for books like Percy Jackson (Wait until I get to the point!) and ended up finding "Percy Jackson and The Game" A beautiful fic that's still being updated.

After a while of reading Percy Jackson, I realized they weren't that good, and most Percy Jackson ones were terribly written.

Eventually I went onto Naruto fanfiction, and eventually ran out of things that fit my tastes.

Because I was so enamored with fanfiction at the time, I scoured my bookshelves, looking for things that would make good fanfiction. And, lo and behold, I found Harry Potter! I started by reading linkffn(The Natural Animagus by White Cat) and linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

I eventually got to the point where I started to read fanfiction all day, even through class.

And that brings us to today :D.

On a side note, I used "Eventually" a lot in this...
