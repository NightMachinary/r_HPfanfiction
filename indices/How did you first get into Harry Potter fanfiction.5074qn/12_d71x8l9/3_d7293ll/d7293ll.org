I started via Percy Jackson ff also--I was reluctant to venture into HP ff for a long time because there were just so many, I saw some really bizarre and outlandish concepts and pairings when I first looked, and I figured it'd be impossible to find anything of quality. Eventually I took the plunge, and am now hopelessly hooked.

I should note that I ended up looking for Percy Jackson ff after absolutely loving reading the books with my older son (now 16)--I know that I am much older than the typical ff reader, but I enjoy a good escape as much as anyone else! I also know that I do have much less patience for bad grammar and ridiculous writing than many, however, which makes me extremely picky and excited to find a nice, long, fabulously written story! I get a lot of good recommendations (as well as easily downloadable MOBI links for ff.net) from this subreddit for which I am very thankful.
