I had just finished reading book three I think, maybe book four, not sure, though this was likely around 2002-3 since I've had a FFN account since 2003. I was wanting more and didn't want to wait for the next book and being comfortable with the world of fanfiction due to accidentally discovering erotic fanfiction a few years before while in college, i decided to see if there was HP fanfiction. I found fanfiction.net and found people who were just as annoyed/exhilarated by the world of HP as I was--annoyed by the strange plot holes and inconsistencies, exhilarated by the world one could use, a hidden world of magic. Your weird neighbor down the street could be a wizard. That path no one traverses could be a spelled road to a magical alley. The ideas abounded.
