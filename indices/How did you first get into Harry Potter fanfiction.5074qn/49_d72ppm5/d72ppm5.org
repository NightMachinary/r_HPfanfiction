The year was 2008, and I was facing a world with no more new Harry Potter books (how naive I was). My sister recommended to me a little ditty called /In the Words of Ginevera Molly Potter,/ saying that it was a Harry Potter book from Ginny's POV. Needless to say I was hooked.

I started browsing around FFN, somehow gravitating towards Severitas and the ilk that these days make me shudder.
