I would use Mugglenet for pretty much everything, I /think/ I was in 7th grade (so about 2004?), I even had (still technically have) a mugglenet email address. Got curious one day as to what that whole fanfiction link was about.

Over a decade later and I'm a total fanfiction junkie. I left for a few years, thought I was free of it, but then like three years ago I got dragged right back in.
