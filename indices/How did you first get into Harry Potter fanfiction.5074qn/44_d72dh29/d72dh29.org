Well... I was in 7th grade when the last book came out. It was around that time that I had also discovered the Internet (even back in 2007, India had notoriously bad Internet connectivity). I loved reading a lot. So whenever I went on the Internet, I would always try searching for some sort of online library where I could read books. But I was unsuccessful. But I did discover Wattpad, which described itself as the /YouTube of eBooks/.

For anyone not familiar with Wattpad back in the days, it was host to quite a few original published works (pirated) like Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew novels. There were a few Harry Potter fan fictions, but not that many.

I don't remember the name of the first fan fiction, but I do remember that it was quite bad with a lot of cliches, but I printed the entire thing out because any reading material was reading material for me. I thought I could while my time on the journey to Bangalore by reading the fan fiction, and I'd finished it by the time I'd reached Bangalore.

Anyway, that opened the flood gates for me. There were a couple Potterheads at school, and my printed out fanfic made the rounds from grade 8 through 10 and back to the 5th. The next one that I remember reading was [[https://www.wattpad.com/84912-harry-potter-happily-ever-after][Harry Potter Happily Ever After]] and I never quite finished it. It was pretty monotonous and bored the crap out of me a few chapters into it.

Reading Potter fan fics fill me up in a strange sort of way. Potter has been a huge part of my childhood and was a window into a culture I've grown to love (even Blyton's books too, actually) over the years. When I find new fics by new authors, it never ceases to amaze me just how much of an impact Rowling has made on a bunch of kids' lives with just 7 books.

Whatever happens, I know that I will be a Potterhead all my life, no matter what. It's just that one thing that people can never take away from you. Once a Potterhead, always a Potterhead.
