So this might date me, but I first came across fanfiction on GriffindorTower.net (defunct since 2003!), a TOTAL HG ship site. I remember using tabs in firefox to pre-load chapters, since we only had dial-up. Eventually found some software that would crawl a set of URLs and store them for off-line reading. Much better (plus no accidental closing/loss of tabs).

Fell in love with fanfiction, eventually stumbled upon fictionalley.org and finally fanfiction.net. Worked my way through all sorts of crap and cliches, which I didn't realize when I was younger.

Eventually tapered off after I realized I was spending way to much time reading and not classes. eventually picked back up and dropped off a few times. Now I'm better at pacing myself.
