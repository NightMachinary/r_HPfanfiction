I started reading Ranma and Dragon Ball fanfics in primary school - off and on. That was around the turn of the millennium, so there weren't nearly as many HP fanfics around... Well, I say that. I think I liked the canon books too much to give it a chance.

The Three Year Summer hit its stride. I sniffed around, skimmed a couple of fics (several of which depicted Harry's grisly and/or undignified demise, though there were a couple of which I have very fond yet infuriatingly vague recollections) and discovered the RPG Toolkit and the How To Draw Manga book series.

Time flew by. I read the canon books all over again. And again. I found out what the Internet /really/ was.

OotP dropped. I was lit.

The thirst was real after reading the prophecy. I found myself neck-deep in a lake of boundless possibilities, but I didn't know what or how to drink.

And then I remembered what I originally thought the Internet was meant for.

It's been an interesting programme since. :D
