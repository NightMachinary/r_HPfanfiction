Late 2013. The first fic I ever came across was Dimcarien's Books From The Future series, which has since been deleted. I loved going to the computer lab and reading it over there.

During my first week of reading fics (in September, I think) I quickly narrowed down to reading pretty much exclusively Harry/Ginny. I read Epeefencer's Unexpected Events (used to love his fics, but not so much any longer) as well as Aspirations (yes, back then I actually thought it was the best of the best).
