I started reading Harry Potter Fanfiction when I was twelve or so. I devoured everything on Mugglenet.com like it was my job while I waited for Order of the Phoenix to be released. About a year ago while on summer break from med school, I was yearning for more Harry Potter in my life, and I remembered how much I enjoyed fanfiction as a kid. So I signed up for FF.net, and here I am, hundreds of stories later, and in the beginnings of actually writing my first one. It's become a little bit of an obsession at this point.
