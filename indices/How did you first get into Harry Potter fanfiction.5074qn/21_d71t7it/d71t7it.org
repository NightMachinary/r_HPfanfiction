Somehow stumbled upon a link to Seventh Horcrux (on Spacebattles) on reddit somewhere. I remember that it was part of a comment chain about HPMoR. Read Seventh Horcrux, thought it was hilarious. Decided not to read HPMoR, but then tried Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived, and it snowballed from there.
