I first started with that too, I enjoyed the first few chapters, but then it just got boring, I saw a lot of people praising it at the time and thought it was one of the best fics and there was no point looking for more. A year later I read Dumbledores army and the year of darkness, really enjoyed it, and then see most people hate it. Seems I started out on two of the most controversial fics.

Now having read a fair amount of fics I see how much better ones there are out there compared to my first two.
