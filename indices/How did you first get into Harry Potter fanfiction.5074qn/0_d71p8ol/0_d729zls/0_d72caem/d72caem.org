Oh I don't mind. I like to see my stories being read, that's what they're there for. I'll warn you now though, that it's a CC/OC pairing and I know a lot of people don't like those. Anyway, this is the first thing I wrote and then it expanded into a series and there is another story in the pipeline. If you do read it, I'd love to know what you think. And concrit is always welcome.

If I was writing it now, I think I would approach it a bit differently, but I don't think it's too bad. linkffn(10841322)
