Being old myself, I really want to read about the adult characters from the books - but definitely not if they are paired with any of the Golden Trio! Really and truly I want to read canon-compliant stories about post-Azkaban Sirius, but I don't find a lot of those. Most of the ones I do find are pretty good though.
