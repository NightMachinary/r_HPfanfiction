Hm . . . this is long. I'm very old, you understand, and my daughter is the real HP fan. she first introduced me to the books and then from GoF onwards we went to see the flms together. It was a regular mother/daughter thing we did every year. I suppose she must have been going through uni at the time.

Then three years ago she emigrated to Australia and I found myself missing her and reading the books again and noticing different things about them. Then I bought a dolls house (wait, I'll get to the point!) on ebay and decided to turn it into 12 Grimmauld Place. And as I was planning it I started to think up stories and scenarios for things that might have happened in that house in all the time poor old Sirius was practically imprisoned there on his own. And I started writing the story down.

Then I thought, "If I'm writing stories like this, I bet other people are too." So I looked and Lo! I discovered this thing called fanfiction. And the rest, as they say, is history. I've archived over 200k words since then and learned a lot, but the dolls house is still unfinished.
