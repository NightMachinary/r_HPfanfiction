I was about 10, so it was around 2001, and there was a cute site about Redwall that I'd found, with recipes and fanart and fanfic. I hadn't even thought about fanfic before that, but I was very keen on having more access to fantasy writing. (I, uh, ended up finishing my school's collection of fantasy novels before the end of middle school).

I ended up reading mostly Harry Potter fanfiction because it was really a fairly massive fandom compared to the others I read. It's big enough that I can go through phases: I get in the mood for certain tropes and pairings.

My tastes have, of course, changed significantly, as has my understanding of the characters as I matured and the series finished.
