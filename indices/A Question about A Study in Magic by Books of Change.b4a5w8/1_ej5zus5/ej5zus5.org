I read that fic a long time ago and remembered liking it. In spite of what other people said about the OCs, I liked them at that time.

Times change and there are some thing I can't remember about it anymore, especially since my memories of the Sherlock series have become blurry\tainted by the introduction of Sherlock's sister in the last season.
