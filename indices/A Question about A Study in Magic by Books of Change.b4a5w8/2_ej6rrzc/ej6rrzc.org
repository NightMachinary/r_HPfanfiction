I started reading it but never finished it. I may try again but it was lacking the of Sherlock sass and deduction in my opinion and I was highly not hyped by Lestrade being linked to magicals for some reasons. Seemed forced to me.

I would love to see a Sherlock like (for deductions and maybe a bit of the sass) adult Harry though (detective or auror).
