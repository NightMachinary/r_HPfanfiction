Damn, I was expecting more Backstreet Trio fluff. Thanks for the info anyway.

I love the characters here. Each OC (and Potterverse character) is alive, flawed in their own way, and no one is overly OP; except Grandmaster Shin, but even he's not omnipotent. Harry is not a mini-Sherlock, Sherlock doesn't solve the mysteries in five minutes.

The thing that bother me the most is how after everything that happened it still follow some canon plot points. Did they really doesn't do anything to Quirell? Malfoy has a mission and Snape taking Unbreakable Vow? Slughorn and Felix Felicis? Why did Snape still has to be killed by Nagini?
