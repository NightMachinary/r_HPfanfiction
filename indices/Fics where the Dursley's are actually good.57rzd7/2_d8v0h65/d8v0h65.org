"A Better Man" linkffn(2531438)

I haven't read it for a while, so I don't remember how good the Dursleys are, but the basic concept is that after a post-evil-Dursleys-whatever, after Vernon's death, Harry makes a wish that he was a better person; this wish actually takes, and Vernon is sent back from Hell, back in time to when he first married Petunia, and this time he actually bonds with the Evans (as in Lily Evans), and later on the Potters.
