Why did Voldemort never try curses other than the killing curse against Harry? Why didn't the Ministry intervene more in second year when they showed they could in 5th? Where did Harry go for 24hrs after Hagrid pulled him from the rubble of his house but before he got to the Dursley's? Why didn't Hogwarts protections protect Ginny from the diary? Why are we not given more slytherins who aren't evil for the sake of being evil?

Its a story. Sometimes things happen for narrative reasons rather than because they're the optimal series of events. Stories would be really short if people didn't make mistakes but making mistakes is human so its actually in character for people to make mistakes. Get over it and enjoy, some things don't need to be questioned.
