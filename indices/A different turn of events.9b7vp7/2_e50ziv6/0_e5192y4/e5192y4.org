A lot of the time, things only happen for narrative reasons in Harry Potter. Why didn't Dumbledore give the information directly to the trio during 6th year, instead of hiding them in the items left for them? Because JKR wanted a dramatic reveal in DH, no matter how stupid it made Dumbledore.

You don't need, and probably shouldn't, question that when enjoying the series. But you should question it when writing fanfiction - and preferably change canon.
