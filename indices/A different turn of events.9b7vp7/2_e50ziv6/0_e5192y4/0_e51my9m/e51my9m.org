Well said. Even in-universe, there's a really stupid thing Dumbledore did which was to not make public who and what Riddle was: a half-blood who attended Hogwarts (although oddly Ron in PS seems to know this). I'm pretty certain Dumbledore never told the public because Bellatrix freaks out at the mere insinuation by Harry that Voldemort wasn't a pure-blood. People like Lucius wouldn't have cared (apparently Lucius was even hoping Harry would become the next Voldemort) but a bunch of DEs and would-be DEs would have hesitated to follow Riddle.
