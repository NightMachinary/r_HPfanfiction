I got what you were saying, that Diarymort couldn't summon the diary since he himself is part of it. But I don't think that's right. The Hermione thumb wouldn't work because, well, the thumb is already right there so the charm, at best, might move her hand a bit if it does anything. If her thumb had been severed I'm pretty sure it would work. So if Diary Riddle says /Accio Tom Riddle's Diary/ it should work. He's a projection after all, not a diary, and it's not like moving the diary directly affects him (Fawkes brought it to Harry after all).
