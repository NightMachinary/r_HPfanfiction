Except in /Lego Harry Potter/ Book 2. Seriously, [[https://youtu.be/yoE8uAKYgPE?t=1192][just watch]]. I know it doesn't match with the books but goddamnit, it so funny, sometimes I wish it were canon.

Anyway, what I was assuming was that it was some law of magic that you couldn't use /Accio/ on yourself, which seems like a plausible extrapolation of the fact that you can't use /Wingardium Leviosa/ on yourself.
