What [[/u/Pudpop]] said sound reasonable. An alternate supposition, though: since stabbing it kills Diarymort, it seems that even if Diarymort could manifest outside of the Diary with a physical form, he still /was/, on some level, the Diary, just projecting a fraction of itself outwards. So perhaps it' would not even be possible for him to Summon the Diary, whether or not he was at full power and whether or not other people could use the Summoning Spell on the Diary, because the Diary is /himself/ and it's a logical absurdity to use /Accio/ on yourself.
