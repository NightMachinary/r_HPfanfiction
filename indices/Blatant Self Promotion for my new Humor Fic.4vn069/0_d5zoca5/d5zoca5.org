  One day, Harry Potter read, "Newt Scamander, master of the magical creatures, is looking to hire one young intern for a summer wide assignment of adventuring, exploration and learning!" And his life changed. Watch as Harry travels the world on this journey full of larceny, thievery and drunken debauchery, all the while pissing all over as many people as he can! Updates every week!
