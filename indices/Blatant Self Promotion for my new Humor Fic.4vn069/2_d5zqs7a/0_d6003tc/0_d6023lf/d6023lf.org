I understand. Still reading Harry as Dobby doesn't sound much of a fun. Because usually readers(or me) mentally create a picture whatever name the character is. Whenever I read the name Dobby, a certain creepy thing comes to mind, not a funny image for a humorous story. Finding several different names(as par the link you share above or by Googling) that's not used in canon aren't that hard. Dobby sounds creepy to me. I am sure, many other readers think similar too.

Edit: btw, I like the concept of the story, surely wait for new updates.

Edit 2: You could use Pokemon Go as Harry's alias ðŸ˜Š
