You look like a twelve year old because you acted like you didn't know what a word from the late nineteenth century and you use the word weeaboo in your name. Sure, mine is a stupid as fuck name using a number instead of at but this was originally a throwaway acocunt to reply to someone since i couldn't remember my old account and I wanted to let them know.

And perhaps I am. I'm also a 24-7 caregiver without pay for a grandparent with dementia. I'm living with more stress than most people save combatants.
