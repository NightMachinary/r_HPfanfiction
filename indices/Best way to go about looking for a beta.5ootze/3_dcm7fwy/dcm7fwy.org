DarkLordPotter is a brilliant resource for aspiring writers. There's a section of the forum that allows you to post your current (unbeta'd) WIP fics, and get feedback from some of the best authors in the HPFF community.

You need a bit of thick skin (though not nearly as much as in the past) and the ability to accept criticism though. If you're not ready to have your writing picked apart, probably best to avoid it.
