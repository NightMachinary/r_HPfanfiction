There are a few different ways you can go about looking for a beta.

- You can browse some Beta profiles in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/book/Harry-Potter/?genreid=0&languageid=1&rating=0&field=&ppage=1][official FFN Beta listings]]

- You can say that you are looking for a beta in an AN, asking interested readers to PM you. That way, the people who PM you will be more likely to be familiar with your story and will find it much easier to help you maintain the feel that your story already has.

- Alternatively You can handpick a reviewer of yours that posts really complicated and detailed reviews and seems to really be invested in your story and PM them with a request.

- You can also post here on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] as well as [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] with an excerpt and description telling people that you're looking for a beta. [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] has some very smart people well versed in HP lore, and [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] has /loads/ of writers who frequently beta for each other. Between the two, I'm sure you'll find someone that'll fit you well.

The one thing you should always remember to do is to have a long conversation and get a feel for their grasp of grammar. If they have some stories written, take a look at those too. Make sure you know their skills before you finalise anything. Good luck.
