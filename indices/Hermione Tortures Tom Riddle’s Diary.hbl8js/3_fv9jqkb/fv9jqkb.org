I think this is the one you're looking for. It's great and the author (who has incredible fics in several fandoms) has the beginning of a sequel up. Unfortunately, the sequel only has one chapter and hasn't been updated since 2017.

The closest, well-done Dark!Hermione I can think of is linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or]]), which is also incomplete at the moment.
