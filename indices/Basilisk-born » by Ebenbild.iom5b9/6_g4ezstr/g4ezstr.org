I think it's a great fic especially if you get into latter parts. The war against Grindelwald and the cause of Harry's animosity towards Dumbledore is excellently explained. Characters like Moody and Sirius get their own arcs. You can skip the Merlin era chapters like I did but as you get into the latter chapters the story gets interesting and the writing gets better.
