The first impression of this fix was that it had a great concept, but a horrible execution.

A few chapters in, we go to the past timeline, in which we learn stuff that only just now influences the present.

This repeats on/off for the rest of the fic.

If you have the patience for this and tropes in general, it's a good read. Otherwise, you're in for a few hours of aggravation and skipping through chapters.
