I've tried reading it several times before due to a premise similar to that of A Long Journey Home, but only recently have been able to read more than a couple chapters and catch up.

The fic is divided into two separate storylines: the past, which covers Harry being sent back in time until he returns to when he was sent back all while living in a teenage body, and the present, which covers the actions of a Harry who has lived all that time during 5th year.

The start is pretty boring. "Harry trying to blend in at Grimmauld Place" isnt very interesting, and neither is "Harry being a confused outsider in early times".

In my personal opinion, the "present" is a lot less interesting than the "past". Theres a lot of boring melodrama between Harry and his friends, and a lot of Harry's action are just build up to other things that dont happen for a long time. Recently, the present has been getting more interesting, mainly because Harry has stopped making vague references to his "plan" and started executing it.

The past also has quite a few issues. Theres a lot of pureblood tradition shit that's very boring to read through at the start, but that boring stuff is also some of the more important stuff plotwise. The author also makes Harry very OP to connect him with Merlin, Arthur, the Founders, etc. but then does a bullshit resetting of Harry's power and age. Theres also the fact that a lot of story elements repeat. Theres almost always a part where someone is like "That kid is a liar/wrong because he is a kid" and Harry is like "haha no".

I do prefer reading the past, mainly because things actually happen; past chapters generally cover months or years of activity at a time, and you get the sense that the world is actively changing whenever Harry takes a quick step away from society. Contrastingly, the present feels like a slog to read through, with chapters only covering days or weeks, or a couple of hours at times.

Theres also a fuckton of wizarding politics.

Overall, Basilisk-born is pretty fun, but I'm still not sure if reading 15 chapters or so to get to anything interesting just to decide whether or not you want to continue is worth.
