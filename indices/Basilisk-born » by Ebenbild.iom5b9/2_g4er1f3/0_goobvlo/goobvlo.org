Dropping into Merlins lap is plot armor but what story especially fanfic doesn't have that Arthur and Morgana make sense in the plot. Slytherin being prejudiced true but A: It Is an AU ad fanFICTION B: history always gets distorted. As for legal expert he's a century-old politician. Hed know the law. Being a family ad starting a school makes 100% sense. In that time not a lot of people depend on non-family or lieges for stuff. He's not an adopted goblin and respect does equal friendship. Its for acts he has done. Heler point but it's unique and well executed.

Its also in a niche genre where the comparisons are either not active or sucks worse.
