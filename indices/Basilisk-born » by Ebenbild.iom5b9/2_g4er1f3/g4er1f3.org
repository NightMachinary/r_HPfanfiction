I really don't understand the popularity of this fic, I hate it. Not only is essentially half the fic a backstory, it's a backstory in which time travel can't change the past. Beyond that it seems to try and hit every boring contrivance it can. Harry is related to Merlin oh and Arthur and Morgana too! He taught Modred! He owns Hogwarts which is Camelot! He's also Slytherin and not prejudiced! And he and the other founders were tots cool and related! And he's a legal expert! He has all types of ancient magic! He's adopted by goblins! He's a healer but a special super rare type! All the lordships! It was kinda ridiculous.
