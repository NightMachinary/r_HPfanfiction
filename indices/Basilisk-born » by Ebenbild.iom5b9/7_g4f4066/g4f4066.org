It's a great fic overall, however take in mind that the reason why Dumbledore never faced Grindelwald before was because of a bood pact they made, which would kill the one who broke the pact. (the pact was that neither of the would fight each other, and this was later broken by Newt Scamander).

Also, Harry in this fic, although is nearly a thousand years old, still has the mentality of a teenager. He believes that Dumbledore is a meddling old fool. Now, don't take me wrong, but Dumbledore holds so many titles and power over the Wizarding world, that it is natural to do so. How good would it do, if a major political personality dropped all his secrets out in the open. People believe that he used Harry Potter as a way to kill Voldemort, but in reality he really hated to do so, but it was either that or sacrificing the numerous lives of magical Britain and other Magical Community. Not to forget that he still tried to give Harry a chance, by not giving Harry to Voldemort and finishing Voldemort later, and by giving the discrete hint of the Deathly Hallows to Harry, even if we accept that he had tried to end the loyalty of the Elder Wand by taking it to Death with himself.

I think the fic is a good one, considering it was written a decade ago, but if we add in the new facts and theories that Rowling introduced since then, it doesn't really sum up. However if you like reading a fic with Dumbledore bashing and all powerful Harry, which has a deep running storyline and plot go for it.
