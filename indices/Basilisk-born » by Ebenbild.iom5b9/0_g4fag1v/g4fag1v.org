I think Basilisk-Born is the best Lordship/ Power trip story fanfic (which, to be honest, does not set the bar very high). The fic is far from perfect and has its own defaults that have already been said, but I think its best quality is that Harry powers are, for once, explained.

Harry isn't the Lord of several Houses because Gringott's will said so, but because>! he is a 2000+ years old immortal who met a lot of people and created most of these Houses!<. He isn't a legal expert because you can learn everything about law in one summer with some books, but because he has been a "politician" for centuries, and helped writting most of the laws he talks about. He isn't a friend of the Goblins because he recognised one of them and told him hello, but because he really gave them a big help in the past.

If you like the Lordship, Political and Power Trip tropes, you should have a good time reading it. If you hate them, reading it should just be a bit less painfull experience that other fics using these tropes.

PS: Hidden the spoils since you didn't read the fic, and also there is no Slash, MPreg, ABO or anything like that in the fic (at least until now but I doubt he would either add them).
