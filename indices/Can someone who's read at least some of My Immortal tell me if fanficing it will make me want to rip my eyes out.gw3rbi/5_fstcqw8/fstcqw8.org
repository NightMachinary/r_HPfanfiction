It's certainly doable, but you'll have to completely rewrite the plot. There's so much character bashing that it goes beyond character bashing... and everyone is severely OOC. I never actually got to the end (had to stop after about chapter 9), but I'm sure the rest of the plot is equally screwed. It's a big commitment, trying to rewrite My Immortal, but if you're up to it, then by all means, I wish you luck!
