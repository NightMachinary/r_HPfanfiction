It's mostly popular because it's bad. I've read it (at least) six times and probably the hardest thing is even trying to figure out what the plot is. After the first few chapters the plot just kind of goes away. Characters get referred to by several different names that are all spelt differently. The subplots get dropped, characters vanish for no reason, it's just bad. If you are going to read it I recommend you get some friends and read it outloud with all the spelling mistakes. I only read it alone once and it sucks unless you can laugh about it. It's 44 fairly short chapters (~22,700 words).
