That's up to the writer, but...

Dumbledore canonically sees just about everything Harry sees, but has a better understanding, so, as I'm a characterization pushes the plot person, he should know the creature is a basilisk, about Myrtle, and have an idea as to where the CoS is.

With that in mind, he can simply have Harry speak to Myrtle while he's eavesdropping in a corner. Harry looks around the bathroom then off they go down the faucet.
