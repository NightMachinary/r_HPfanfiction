I edited the prompt to clear up confusion, but I'm saying Ginny steals the diary back after the basilisk is taken care of and continues to write in it like in canon. Because TMR knows Dumbledore is watching the CoS, Ginny dies somewhere else. Quietly in her dorm room, her bedroom, or even the Gaunt Shack.
