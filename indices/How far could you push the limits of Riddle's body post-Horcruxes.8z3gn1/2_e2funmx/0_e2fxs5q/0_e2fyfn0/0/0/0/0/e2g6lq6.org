That doesn't make any sense to me. What you're saying is like saying that kicking a ball into a chess set accidentally results in a valid arrangement where black wins by check-mate.

Of course it has to be *more* difficult to only delete selective memories, making sure to not mess up the brain, not less. The more incompetent the spellcaster the more dangerous to let him cast Obliviate on you. But, even when done by professionals from the ministry, repeated obliviations can cause serious damage to the mind, as seen in Mr. Roberts during the Quidditch World Cup.
