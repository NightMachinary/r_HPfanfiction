Well, my understanding of Obliviate was that you sift through an individual's memories and wipe them out. Or, it could just wipe out memory from a certain period of time.

However, I don't think that there is a “catch-all” Obliviate that just wipes out everything. The Obliviation of Lockhart was accidental, a backfired spell out of a malfunctioning wand - you can't use that to determine how the spell normally behaves.

A better example would be from Goblet of Fire, where the Ministry Obliviators wipe the memories of Mr. Roberts (at the Quidditch World Cup).
