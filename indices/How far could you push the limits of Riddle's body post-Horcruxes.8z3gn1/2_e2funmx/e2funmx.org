Why do authors keep focusing on inventive ways of killing or destroying Voldy? If people used the same amount of creativity on capturing him we'd have more fanfics where he's just pumped full of Draught of the Living Death, hidden in a secret location and fed intravenously (after hacking off his arms and legs and cauterizing the wounds). Maybe add in an overpowered Obliviate for good measure, or as many as is necessary until his brain is mush (incidentally: does he gain his memories back if/when he dies and has horcruxes?).
