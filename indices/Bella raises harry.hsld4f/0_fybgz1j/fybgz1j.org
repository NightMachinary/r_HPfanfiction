While it is a bit different from what you are asking, it is the closest I can come up with. The Child of Azkaban linkao3(15068012) features a Harry who, due to weird godfather magic, ends up getting teleported from the Dursleys into Azkaban to be raised by Sirius and the other inmates, and the wizarding world doesn't notice until his Hogwarts letter is addressed to Azkaban. Bellatrix considers herself his aunt and does train him some, though it isn't a major component from what I recall.
