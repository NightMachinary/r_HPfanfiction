I got really emotional! Usually I'm not a Harmony shipper because people overlook the friendship aspect of their relationship and opt to only focus on the romantic sexual sides which really diminishes the power and magic of their bond in my opinion. However, your story was very balanced in that regard. It showed the strength of their friendship and also the potential to become more just because of how close they are platonically. I also enjoyed the bit of role reversal going on because I'm sick of reading stories were only Harry is doing the wooing or is extra stoic/suave in the relationship. I would imagine that by leading a war and killing a basilisk he might want to be more vulnerable and open in a relationship letting the other person have more initiative due to always having to lead and be strong in real life. So it was nice seeing Hermione take on that role while still showcasing her deeply emotional and empathetic side really trying to soothe Harry's soul! I loved this so much especially when Hermione said that she would cry for the both of them. Fantastic story can't wait to read more of your work!
