Nah, don't worry. I could never write something so sad. You'll notice that after they don the costumes, there are two scenes in italics where past tense is used whereas the rest of the story is all in present tense. Those two scenes are flashbacks.

But what you think is something that Harry often thinks as well. There will probably be days in the future...even when he's old and his hair is grey and he is no longer a child, when he wakes up in a cold sweat and is certain that he's back in that cupboard. That everything was really a dream that he made up to console himself.

Then he'll look to right and see Hermione lying next to him, fast asleep. Slowly his heart will stop racing and he'll think in wonder: "This is my reality."
