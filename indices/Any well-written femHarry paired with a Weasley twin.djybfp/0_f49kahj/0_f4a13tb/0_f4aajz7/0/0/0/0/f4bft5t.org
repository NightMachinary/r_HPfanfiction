I think I don't hate the stations of canon /per se/, but I dislike when the information about them takes the same amount of space as in the books. Whenever I hear Professor McGonagall explain how there are four houses of Hogwarts, verbatim copied word by word from the books, I scream out of frustration and desperation. We have all read it, just cut it out, and bring your own ideas! If you are repeating some story from the books then it *must* be different, bringing something new. So, I don't mind The Third Task in linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) (and note that his Tasks are different from the books), because its conclusion and progress is very different from the books. That makes sense. Copying it almost word by word (with some sassy remarks in between) in “Looking Beyond” doesn't.
