Nothing is 100% prefect. Although, even if I have my complaints with JKR books (e.g., [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][blog]]), I have not meant this like it. What I meant is that I expect from fanfiction to bring something of its own, not recycle the original text. For example, you have every right to just say that the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament is same, then why you can just summarize the events in two paragraphs and bring something of your own, and not to have two chapters which are mostly the same as what Ms. Rowling wrote in books.
