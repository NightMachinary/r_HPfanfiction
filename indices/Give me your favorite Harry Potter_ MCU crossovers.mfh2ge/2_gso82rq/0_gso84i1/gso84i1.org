#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.

  The Magical's were separating form the Mundane world. No longer able to ensure their secrecy with the advancing technology of the Muggles, they were leaving entirely.Harry wasn't going with them. Or, the one where Harry met Tony and the events of the first Iron Man movie mostly happen anyway.

  "The first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has around him."― Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince. After Loki's actions in Manhattan, he is escorted back to Asgard in chains with his pride stripped away. Yet, during his imprisonment, he finds an unlikely ally in the form of a guard with the same green eyes as the ones he sees in his own reflection.
