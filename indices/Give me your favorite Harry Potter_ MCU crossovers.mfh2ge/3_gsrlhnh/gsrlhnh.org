Ooo I been waiting for this one!

First off is Prometheus Bound by Anarchic Muse. One of the best fics I've had the pleasure of reading. It's about Harry becoming the MoD and having to deal with the fallout, which involves accidentally time traveling to when Steve and Bucky had just enlisted, then coming back. Beautifully written, and heart-wrenching. Updates are usually about 6 months apart, but the author's Tumblr hasn't updated since October last year, so there's a /chance/ it's abandoned (I doubt it though, a prolonged update waiting time is more likely). It was /supposed/ to be Harry/Steve, but the author changed their mind and made it gen, so you should be good.

Then there's A New Man by Steelbadger. Standard Dimension Travel, unlikely to ever be finished, but peasant to read.

Then there's Wand and Shield, by Morta's Priest. Featuring Harry traveling alternate realities until landing in the Marvel verse. Extremely engaging and well written, and the author recently indicated that they'll come back soon, though it's been on hiatus for a few years.

If you're looking for some lighthearted stuff with a bit of plot and don't mind slash, I'd recommend Friendly Neighborhood Falcon Mage and Welcome to Earth. Also both feature Harry going to another dimension of the Marvel world, and he gets together with Peter Parker--- it's an unexpectedly cute pairing. Both are still updating.
