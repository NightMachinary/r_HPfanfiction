My default suggestion is linkffn(The Snape Chronicles), which is quite long but a good starting point for anyone who wants a different perspective on canon events. From Severus' limited perspective, Harry did actually look like an inconsiderate, impetuous, violent troublemaker.

There are several good fics that give the in-Hogwarts perspective on seventh year; you've mentioned Not From Others. I don't recall exactly how linkffn(A Call to Arms) went, but I liked it enough to bookmark it. If you want sixth year, there's linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince), which has lots of snark-to-snark combat by the Weasleys.
