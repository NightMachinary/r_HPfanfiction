I'm here cause I didn't notice the & rather then /. WHere's that thread damn it? :P

But ok, I'm going to be useful. Ish.

Linkffn(Too Young to Die) is a WBWL Harry being a loving (non incest IIRC) brother. Spoiler Alert: She dies rather early, and most of the fic is Harry going to extreme measures to fix that. It does have some good bonding if I recall, both at the start while she's alive, and I think later on when he retrieves her soul or whatnot?\\
It's been a long time since I read it, and I enjoyed it back then.
