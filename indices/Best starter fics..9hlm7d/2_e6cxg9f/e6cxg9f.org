Emerald Ashes' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][/Seventh Horcrux/]] is a popular one, but in generally the funniest ones lean on fandom in-jokes to a certain extent. linkffn(10677106)

I got into fanfiction with time travel fics, IIRC, like Sarah1821's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][/Oh God Not Again/]]/./ linkffn(4536005)

Classics by nonjon (/Dimension Hopping for Beginners/ especially, but /A Black Comedy/ is a popular recommendation) may also be a good place to start. Dimension Hopping runs through a lot of the major fanon tropes, so I see it being a good gateway into a whole host of fics.

Otherwise, canon-compliant fics tend to be a good place to start, depending on what you want. +Give me a moment to pull some up and I'll edit them into this answer.+ too much effort to dig through with the broken/redone wiki

There are a lot of fun fics that go off the rails completely, like the current Book Club story Hermione Granger: Demonologist, but for the most part I'd say people getting into fanfiction are looking for "more of the same," trying to capture the magic of the original. Fresh ideas are more appreciated when you've had some time to dig through fics.

Not really crack, but you could also start with more oneshots- they're shorter to read and leave a lasting impression, since they tend to be much more focused on a single theme. Just search [[https://ffn.net][fanfiction.net]], set the wordcount low (I wish it had a <10k or <20k option, since <5k misses a lot), and sort by Favorites. Stuff like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/][The Last Enemy]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][All the Dementors of Azkaban]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][The Wendell that Wasn't]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4487319/1/The-Greatest-Minister-of-Magic][The Greatest Minister of Magic]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][Lessons with Hagrid]], and of course [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]]. About half of the above are humorous. There are literally dozens of great oneshots worth checking out.
