I normally recommend three fics for different reasons: linkffn(Cauterize) for canon compliance and proof of excellent writing in fanfiction, linkffn (The Aurors) for novella-length post-war that's again great writing, and linkffn(Stages of Hope) for a slight AU and some more tear-jerker writing.

If they're still interested after reading one or more of those, then I feel comfortable recommending more.
