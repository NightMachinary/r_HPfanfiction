*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*

*Genre:* War, Politics, Action

*Link:* linkffn(10595005), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Link Here]]

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts:* This fic is a little controversial, because it features a quite brutal/ruthless Hermione and Harry. However, it does a great job with respect to politics, strategies, and tactics. Writing quality is also very high. Ron, in my opinion, is the most sympathetic character in this fic, even though it pairs Hermione with Harry. Percy, Luna, and Victor Krum are well done too.
