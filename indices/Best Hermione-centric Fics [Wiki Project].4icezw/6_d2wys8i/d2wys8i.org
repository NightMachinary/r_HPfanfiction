Genre: Pureblood!Hermione, Family, Drama

Link: linkffn(6723584)

Status: Complete, but there is a sequel that is Incomplete/Abandoned

Thoughts: Very interesting. One of the first fanfics I've read that did not involve Harry, and was also not just a romance/ship. Hermione is the Pureblood daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange. It's so crazy, and unique. It feels like it's set in the early 1900s, and it really dives into the politics of Wizarding Britain reaching out and trying to gather allies with other Wizarding nations. If anyone has any questions about this, I love to discuss the one!
