There are already many fics with very similar premise written.

In fact, I hate that in almost every Hermione time travel to 1930/40s, she ends up raising or shagging him. How about something more refreshing like her successfully KILLING Tom, but then Grindelwald winning too? I'm pretty sure this idea had NEVER been attempted before.
