Tom was never driven mad /because/ he created Horcruxes; it just altered his appearance. He was mad before then. Also, like [[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]] said, Hermione accidentally getting thrown back in time via a Time Turner has been done countless times. It's pretty much the go-to for Tom/Hermione authors. And why would a randomly-falling Time Turner send Hermione back to 1942? Why not 1900? 1858? 1774? 1635? There's no indication a falling Time Turner would send Hermione back specifically to a set year because Time Turners don't work like that.

To answer your question, though, I'd only read Tom/Hermione stories that involved a more original-type plot, as while I'm somewhat a fan of the pairing, it's not my favorite. However, you should write what you want to read. Others who like and read what you write is an added bonus.
