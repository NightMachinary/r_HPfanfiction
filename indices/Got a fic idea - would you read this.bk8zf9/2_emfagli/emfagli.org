Definitely not my pairing, and would close-box it if I accidentally clicked on it. That said, do a good job writing the characters, and you can sell most things. You'll definitely have to give Riddle more redeeming character traits than "too brilliant to waste", and you'll need to actually deal with the legitimate issues inherent in Voldemort's character, namely that by that point he had already been researching dark magic, and had been able to focus his magic to torture people.

As for the immortality through alchemy thing, why the deadline of a year? Sure Riddle is well aware of his own mortality, having lived through the blitz, buy why is he on a timetable?

Furthermore, it seems like alchemy gives agelessness, whereas Horocruxes give the ability to effectively respawn. That's two different levels of protection. Why wouldn't Riddle say "why not both?" if offered a good chance of getting access to both.

These aren't to say the idea is bad, per se. I've loved fics with worse premises. You just have to address these, and other issues, in order to overcome them.

Edit: Other legitimate concern. You'll need to sell the shift to too brilliant to waste. Expect that you will face the opposition of "Voldemort is too brilliant and charismatic to trust with his lack of empathy."
