well, they explain in the story that they are not genetically siblings, and they dont think of themselves as siblings because they have different DNA or something like that idk. They also explain it as that they are the same person from an alternant universe, not siblings. so its alright. Idk it's been a while since I read it and I randomlly remembered it today so i guess I'll have to reread it to see for myself
