This one fits your description decently and is a classic with one finished sequel and one WIP sequel: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]. Harry gets a letter from the Dursleys and has to go home, mid semester. Guess who is assigned to accompany him? This is not slash. This one fits the more classic Snape is on Dumbledore's side.

This one is a bit of a stretch but it has Snape caring for Harry, Snape/Remus, and Drarry! It's also my favorite fic of all time. I will read it for my wedding vows and have it engraved on my tombstone. The first in the series is linkao3(the secret language of mistletoe by Endrina). The instigating factor is not a summer holiday. Instead, Remus snatches Harry from the Dursleys and enlists Snape to help. In this one, Snape is definitely on Harry's side.

Finally, a popular fic I've seen recommended here is Sacrifices linkffn(saving connor by lightning on the wave). This one probably fits your description the best (Snape is on Harry's side, definitely not Dumbledore's or Voldemort's, eventual Drarry), but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it as I don't really care for it. Ive read most of the first four. I think they are bloated and overuse tropes, but they are beloved by many. Your mileage may vary
