I really wanted to like “Terms of Matrimony” by Galad Estel (removed from FFnet, so follow the instructions on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][my review]] to get it), but for its unfortunate and rushed ending. It looked like a start of exactly this kind of story, but it ended too soon.
