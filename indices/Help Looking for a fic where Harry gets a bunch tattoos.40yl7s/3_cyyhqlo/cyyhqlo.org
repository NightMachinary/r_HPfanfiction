I'm sure you're looking for a specific fic, but I have no idea which one you're looking for so here are some others where he gets tattoos.

I don't remember exactly, but I believe he gets a tattoo or seven in Power of the Mind. I'm going to check the epub file after the bot posts it. linkffn(7441197). The rewrite was never finished afaik. Edit: It looks like it wasn't this one.

There's also [[http://triofqf.livejournal.com/31615.html][Triquetra by Calliope]]. It's on tumblr so no bot link.

Two other characters get tattoos in the Where in the World is Harry Potter Trilogy by nonjon with very amusing results. linkffn(2354771).
