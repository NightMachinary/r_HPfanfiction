Try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5494034/chapters/12692627][All the Important Words Unspoken]], by blamebrampton. It's HPDM and Astoria/Charlie, set around 1900. It's got HP-era characters, obviously, but it's not a time-travel fic --- Harry etc. just live in Victorian England, post-Voldemort. Blamebrampton's an excellent writer.

Summary:
