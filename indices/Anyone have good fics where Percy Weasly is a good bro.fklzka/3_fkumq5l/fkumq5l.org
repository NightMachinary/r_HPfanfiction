I think it's Oh God, Not Again, where Harry makes an effort to bring Percy in with his family and he turns out to be a half-decent brother in that. I can't remember for certain, though. I remember a scene with them in front of the mirror and Harry makes a comment about Percy's desire being just to be accepted by his family and that being okay.
