Grow Young With Me is the only Harry/OC story that I've ever enjoyed.

I haven't once felt like the drama and angst was manufactured and the pain Harry is going through feels genuine. I honestly bring myself to question whether you know what it feels like and, if you do, I sincerely apologize. If you don't, bravo. If you do, you've done an excellent job translating it to the page.

Abigail is a wonderful character. A true /Original Character/ in the best way. Not a Mary Sue, but somehow perfect for Harry Potter.

This latest chapter. The wedding. My. Fucking. God. Perhaps the best singular chapter I've ever read in one of my favorite stories of all time.

Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll wait, and everyone else will as well, as long as we need to.
