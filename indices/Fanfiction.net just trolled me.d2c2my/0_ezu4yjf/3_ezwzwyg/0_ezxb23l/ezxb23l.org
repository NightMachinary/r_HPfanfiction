I'm very fortunate to receive so many positive comments from people, and I never take that for granted. But yours, in particular, is one of those that really struck a chord with me. Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. I can't express how much it means to me, but it means a lot trust me. Thankfully I've never had to go through what Harry does in the story, but I've made it my mission from the start to stick as close to reality as I could. And I'll continue to do so.

Also, so glad you liked the last chapter. It was a difficult one to get just right, but I was satisfied with the result. It's good to know others feel the same!
