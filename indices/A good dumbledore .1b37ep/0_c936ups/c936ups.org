I have a lot more that focus more on the Harry/Snape relationship with Dumbledore strongly encouraging it, but Dumbledore honestly plays a relatively minimal role in those. I'll be honest and say that *Harry Potter and the Enemy Within* and its sequel is one of the better fanfictions I have ever read in terms of characterization and general writing ability. *Web of Lies* is a little more iffy in terms of both, but if you have a relatively higher ability to suspend your disbelief, I find it to be enjoyable as well. It also has sequels, which you can find from the author's page.

If you're curious for more recommendations, you can check out my page [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Epurplekyu][here]] which contains the majority of the fanfictions I've read and enjoyed. Sort by category and scroll down to find the Harry Potter ones in alphabetical order.
