Dumbledore from "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality" is good fit - keeps his character from canon (mysterious, manipulativy, slightly mad). Due to heavy AU he avoided screwing up life of Harry (lack of abusive family etc - so there is no repetition of cliches done to death), like most characters behaves now in way that makes some sort of sense and avoids being one sided character.

Moreover it is IMHO the best take on eccentric Dumbledore

  You see, Mr. Potter, everyone knows that Dumbledore's madness is a mask, that he is sane pretending to be insane. They pride themselves on that clever insight, and knowing the secret explanation, they stop looking. It does not occur to them that it is also possible to have a mask behind the mask, to be insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane.

(note that this is not the most layered interpetation of his character)

I think that it is rare example of Dumbledore that is better than in canon (most fics either mostly ignore him or turn really well done manipulative!Dumbledore from canon into evil!stupid!dumb!even_more_stupid!Dumbledore [why this type of stories is called manipulative!Dumbledore is quite mysterious]).
