[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1624376/ARedHair][ARedHair's profile]] goes into a lot of detail of the failings of Dumbledore and also a lot of the plot holes that occur. It's a great read and breaks down a lot of Dumbledore's failings logically. The main problem tends to come down to the fact that what we're told about him doesn't really match up with how he acts. They say that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and it seems that Dumbledore is single handedly building an interstate strait there.

I like seeing 'Good Dumbledore' fics, but unless it's pretty massively AU it can be tough to pull off, some like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]] stay closer to canon by creating their own revisionist history.
