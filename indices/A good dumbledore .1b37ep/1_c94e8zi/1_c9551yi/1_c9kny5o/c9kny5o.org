ARedHair presents the most nuanced and balanced discussion on the issue I've seen. However, I've always felt that many of the points made by him (and, less eloquently, by others) can be explained away pretty easily.

"[Dumbledore exercised] considerable arrogance presuming those charms were sufficient [when leaving baby Harry on the Dursley doorstep]" - Dumbledore is THE living authority on all things magic (according to an interview with J.K. Rowling); it's not unreasonable to assume he knew what he was doing better than us Muggle readers do! We also don't KNOW he didn't stick around invisibly, keeping watch until morning, or had some magical way of keeping a close watch remotely.

"Dumbledore makes decisions without consulting others, and doesn't share information" (paraphrased). This is a wizard who has led two war efforts, and no doubt got burned by leaks of information many times. It is natural for him to try to keep information on a need-to-know basis. Maybe he overdoes it, but it is hardly a novel approach to information security during a war.

Will of Lily/James. Lot's of assumptions here; we simply don't know that they had a will. They were young and thought themselves secure behind a Fidelius; it is also quite possible all the guardians they listed were incapacitated or otherwise unsuitable at the time of their deaths (Sirius=Azkaban, Remus=Werewolf, Pettigrew=Believed Dead, Frank & Alice Longbottom=Insane). It's quite possible it was all down to the default Potter inheritance clause, with Harry being declared a magical orphan, or something like that. We know from Tom Riddle's childhood that there seems to be no support system for magical orphans.

"Abuse by the Dursleys was ignored" (paraphrased). This is something that fanon has greatly exaggerated IMO, there is no evidence of real abuse; Harry is certainly treated poorly, but wizards have a more cavalier attitude towards physical injuries because they are naturally more resilient due to their magic (see lack of constant fatalities in Quidditch). It's quite possible that Neville Longbottom was in more immediate physical danger, with his great uncle trying to elicit accidental magic, than Harry ever was from the Durselys' neglect and Dudley's schoolyard bullying.

"Harry's abuse is not unique", "Dumbledore ignores Harry's end-of-year mental traumas" - lot's of assumptions here that the Wizarding world would have paid any attention at all to recent developments as far as the rights and treatment of children in the Muggle world. All canon evidence is to the contrary, that they are closer to a Victorian era Muggle outlook where children had zero rights and physical punishment was ubiquitous. Doesn't Filch still polish manacles in the dungeon and reminisce about the days of corporal punishment at Hogwarts? This was actually a practice that Dumbledore ended when he became Headmaster, according to [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Caretaker][this]] page.

"Horrid teachers" - This is certainly true, but it is possible there is some kind of tenure-like system that prevents Professors from being fired, outside of specific violations. This is left ambiguous by canon, but we do know there is a Board of Governors, and that the Ministry exerts considerable influence at Hogwarts in OotP. It's reasonable to conclude that that hiring/firing decisions aren't entirely up to the Headmaster.

I could keep going point by point, but I won't. Anyway, the books are written from the perspective of Harry, who is completely clueless about 99% of what goes on in the Wizarding World of politics, as well as what A.D. is doing 99% of the time. We usually only see a couple glimpses of Dumbledore in a given book. There's very little reason to assume that just because Harry isn't aware of it, Dumbledore didn't do anything.

PS. I realize I'm pretty late with this comment, and few will see it; but I needed to get this off my chest (lol)
