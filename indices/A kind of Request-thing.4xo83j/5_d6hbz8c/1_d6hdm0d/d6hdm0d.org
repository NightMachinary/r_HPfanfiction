I don't know about forgiving, but an actual conversation would be appreciated, and some other motive than just shear boring cowardice or jealousy. Maybe Peter was the victim of a imperius/confundus/potions/whatever. Maybe he was targeted and turned over time by a romantic interest. Maybe Peter has his own secrets that were discovered and used to turn him. Maybe his friends unknowingly (or knowingly?) did something that he considered a betrayal.
