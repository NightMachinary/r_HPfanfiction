I had an idea. Usually when Harry goes back in time, he has pettigrew arrested/killed/kissed/etc. What I want to read is where Harry captures him and as a civilized discussion about his motives o betraying the Potter family, which ends with Harry forgiving him(not forgetting) and getting an Oath from Peter to spy on Voldemort.
