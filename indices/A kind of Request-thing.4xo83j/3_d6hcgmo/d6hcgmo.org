A Harry/Luna that actually works would be appreciated. Those that work are rare. Not a purely romance fic though.

A Sirius/Pomfrey, again, not a purely romance fic.

A fic where Harry come back in time to do something else than kill Voldemort

#+begin_quote
  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry is arrested and thrown in Azkaban, after leading an insurection agaist a totalitarian, pureblood ministry. Most of his friends, his wife and children are killed. He finaly manages to escape, and finds a way to get back in the past, not to help in the war against Voldemort, but to prevent the future oligarchy to take the power thanks to the war.

A time travel story where Dobbie the house elf sends his mind back in time to save Harry Potter, sir, and help him defeat Voldemort. Actually this one from Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas, but I would love to see a full fic about it.

This one I posted in another thread yesterday, but it's really too much developped, I put it in case you find something interresting in there:

#+begin_quote
  One day when Harry is 7, the Dursleys go too far. Harry discovers magic while locked hurt into his cupboard. He discovers that he is a lot more powerful than the people around him. Affraid, he decides that since he's so much more powerful and strong than the others he'll have to be a lot more cautious as well. He will not interfere in the affairs of others, always try to avoid confrontation and always fight his own anger, for fear of hurting somebody. As a result, he won't be sorted in Griffindor, for lack of courage, but in Ravenclaw (where he can best avoid others). Dumbledore will have to take him under his tutelage far sooner than in canon, to reverse the blocks Harry has put on himself. Harry will have a really hard time accepting that he has to eventually face Voldemort. At first he'll be friendly with Hemione, a bit of a outcast herself, but her personnality will soon be too much for him to bear, they will finally put up but only in the later years. Harry will be more or less alone in his first year and then will befriend Luna and Colin Crevey in his second year. It will become better for him after he meet his godfather at the end of third year. He will be a target for Draco and his goons as well as Ron and other Griffindors who don't anderstand why the boy who lived behave the way he does, but will eventually become good friends.

And just because someone told me today that this ship is nothing but wish fulfilment with glorified self-inserts, so something along the lines of:

  Draco Malfoy never antagonized the boy who lived as much as in canon, eventually, he has his rebellious phase against his parents during which he rejects everything they stand for. That's when he becomes close with the grey faction of Slytherin, as the scion of a pureblood familly, he can relate with their traditionnalist views and his racist bigotry doesn't survives the contact of actual muggleborns. He rediscovers what the values of Slytherin (guile, ambition, cunning) really mean, and decides to lie his lives following these principle. Draco will never be the servent of anyone, not even a self-proclaimed Dark Lord. In his fith year, his ambition attracts the attention of Ginny Weasley. This is not a redeemed/Draco. He doesn't join the good guys. His relationship with Ginny is really shaky. He still has a certain taste for violence. But he must lose his arrogance as he grows and learn, often the hard way.
