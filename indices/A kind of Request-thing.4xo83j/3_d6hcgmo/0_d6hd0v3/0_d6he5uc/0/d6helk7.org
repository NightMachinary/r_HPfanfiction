Well, the ships could be written in the way of a movie that I watched one time, in which all the ships are involved, and throughout the fic each part of their lives is shown at stages, and the last two synopsis could be involved as well by having the ships set in that time period, and write around those themes. It would be quite a large project, and obviously not a large amount of attention would be focused on one side plot. It would work kind of like a pattern of excerpts from peoples lives, but with enough info each to create an interesting and captivating novel.
