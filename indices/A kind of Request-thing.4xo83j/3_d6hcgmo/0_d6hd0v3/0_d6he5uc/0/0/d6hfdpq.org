Something like a far less ambitious Cloud Atlas, you mean? Not a bad idea, it seems really complicated though. I don't even know where one would have to begin to unify thematicaly all the parts.

Perhaps a more traditionnal ensemble fic would be easier.

The ships could be integrated easily enough, although it means giving a far greater role to Pomfrey than in canon. It's the bit with Harry and draco that would be difficult to merge.
