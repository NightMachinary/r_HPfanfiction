Well, for starters I think it would be a good idea to decide what characters would be in a romantic position, what characters are in a enemy-like position, and what ones are just friends?

And what would happen to Hermione? Would she be kept as a very prominent character, or just a minor one?

I'm also assuming that this kind of fic would be quite AU, considering Sirius and Pomfrey. After all, if he is brought in around the time Harry meets him, would he still be considered a huge criminal? It would seem quite strange for a school nurse to be romantically or platonically interested in a murderer, would it not?

I would agree with you when you say that this type of fic would be very complicated. If I myself attempted it, or you, or any other fan fiction writer, it would be a huge task and would most likely take A LOT of pre-planning for pre-plans and then more planning (with a bit more planning on the side).
