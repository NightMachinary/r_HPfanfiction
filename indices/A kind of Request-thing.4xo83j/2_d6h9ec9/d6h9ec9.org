That's great!! There are lot things I wished I have seen written, but unfortunately I never saw... I would love to read stories where:

(1) Harry finds out that he have a half-sibling from James relationship with another woman different from Lily (like a one night stands with another girl...). This could even be Cannon Compliant as he could learn about it later in life....

(2) Stories where Harry finds out that he has fathered other children that he did not know existed from the same way... (maybe a summer sweetheart from Private Drive?????)

I never read anything like that... BUT I NEED IT!!
