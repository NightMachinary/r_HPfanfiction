No, I never have... the maximum I think that I saw was one where Lily had a secrect child with Severus... but I don't like that because Lily knew (obviously!) that she was mother of a child and deliberated abandoned them. For me, this is extreme Lily bashing.

On the other hand, if James could have a child from a one night stand with another woman while he and Lily had broken up after a huge fight or something. This wouldn't be James bashing on my opinion... men can have a child without having any knowledge of it; on the other hand, woman will always know.

This other half-sibling could be written in soooo many ways... could be someone from a Dark family, could be from a relationship with a muggle.... I believe that a very talented author could turn even a main character into Harry's half-sibling...
