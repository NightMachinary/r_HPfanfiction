James and Lily could perfectly have broken up for a couple of weeks/months, and he could have done that while they weren't together. Or... some witch could have spilled something interesting on his drink to take him to bed... or... a Dark witch on a mission using Polyjuice to impersonate Lily ended up having sex with him. So many different ways to make this happen! Shame no one seemed to have thought about this as a possible plot yet...

Yeah... I sort of started writing something on these lines... where Harry would later find out that the person he was trying to arrest was actually his Half-Sister, but neither would be aware of this until much later on the story.... but Uni got on the way... -_-
