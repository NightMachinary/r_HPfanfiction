I always imagined James to be a good-hearted man (after, of course, his school years when he would be horrible to Severus), so the idea of Harry having a half-sibling from a one night stand of James WHILST going out with Lilly would be repulsive to me.

However, a child form a past relationship or something when Lilly and Harry hadn't been in the scene yet would be quite an interesting read.

Have you ever considered writing something along the lines of that yourself? :)
