I just don't particularly enjoy the writing process, I like the end product. I've actually got more chapters drafted, but for far later in the story. I started with a rough idea of how it could happen, but I've been struggling to figure out how to connect the things initially at Hogwarts.

Harry also wouldn't be learning quite everything he did in his original third year. It'd be a big mess come end of year though, and that's part of what seemed so interesting about the scenario.
