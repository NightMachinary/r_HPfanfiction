Well, I speculated badly when I was waiting for the fourth book. I figured Pettigrew (if he returned) was going to Polyjuice as Cedric to kidnap Harry for voldemort. It would actually be pretty funny, I think, for Pettigrew to secretly be a competitor in the Tri-Wizard tournament.

edit: Or as Cho Chang, the ultimate unexpected. Feel bad for harry though if he kissed her.
