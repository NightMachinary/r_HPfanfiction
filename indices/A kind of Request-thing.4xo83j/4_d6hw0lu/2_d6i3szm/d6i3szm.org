I think that if written fully it would have the potential to become a popular trope, but I mean, it would probably have to be written extremely well with a lot of planning and writing done BEFORE actually uploading it to a fan fiction website.

And of course some people may dislike it, because Harry would be in second year and they may feel it's a tad early for him to be finding out everything that he's supposed to find out in The Prisoner of Azkaban, plus everything from the original story line of The Chamber of Secrets on top of that, it could prove to be a lot of work, like some of the previous suggestions in this thread.

Why didn't you enjoy writing it?
