  During his 2nd year at Hogwarts Harry has to deal with mass murderer Sirius Black, the heir of Slytherin. But not everything is as it seems, when others discover he is a Parslemouth it looks like Harry is the next Dark Lord. Can Harry save the school from closing down and prove he's not Voldemort reborn? Is Dobby working with Sirius or are other forces converging against our hero?
