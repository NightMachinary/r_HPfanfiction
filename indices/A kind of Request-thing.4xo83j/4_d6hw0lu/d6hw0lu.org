This may be a bit of a self promotion, but when the books originally came out I was very curious as to what it would have been like if Sirius Black had broken out a year earlier, during the Chamber of Secrets, and was widely thought to be the Heir of Slytherin. Since he was from a known dark family who had, except him all been in Slytherin. Just get Wormtail in that photo Harry took with Lockheart and BOOM, you've got a messed up mass murderer on the loose and no one would think that Slytherin's monster is unrelated, would be a great way to throw a reader off the scent and give an interesting B story to the book.

I figured it would make a lot of sense. I ended up writing the first bit about two years ago, of how it could plausibly happen, but have hit a hard wall of writers block since.

It's frustrating because I've never seen anyone else write this particular plot and I don't really enjoy writing, though reading it later can be equal parts fun and embarrassing. It's called Harry Potter and Plot by Fridge.

I'm no S'TarKan and I haven't updated in far too long, but I think it could be a very interesting AU divergence point that people could run with and remake into their own set of tropes, like how soul bond fics became a thing or Harry going back in time working out, learning hand to hand, and declaring his eternal love for (insert ship here) became a thing.
