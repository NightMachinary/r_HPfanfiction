Okay then, so I guess their appropriateness would depend on what types of symbology you're seeing in them. Modern animal symbolism is kind of a mix and adaptation of an entire world of esoteric traditions and beliefs, so it's a little difficult to examine that specifically without knowing what you're thinking. What's your logic to attach each Patronus to each character?

Like, Foxes generally represent wisdom and cunning and immediate need for action in troubled times; Arctic Foxes can represent purity, or magic within mundanity, or even stubbornness and a need to persist through troubled times; Gray Foxes can represent conservatism (as in the sentiment, not the political alignment), harmony and balance, or difficulty distinguishing between truth and fiction, or even just nobility. There's a big range of symbology attached to each animal depending on what part of the world you look at them in.
