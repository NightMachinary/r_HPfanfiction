  She doesn't know the world, or herself, but she'll always know the boy who meets her in a washed-out King's Cross Station. Even when he starts coming to her in pieces.

  Salazar Slytherin stumbles into the future a thousand years ahead of his time, just as Hogwarts is getting ready to host the Tri-Wizard tournament. His arrival causes havoc not only for himself but for the modern magical world. He's a bit of a mess, and a relic, and a problem, and everyone has an angle he needs to understand.

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix Lestrange uses dark, sacrificial magic to bring the Dark Lord back to life after Harry Potter has given his life to defeat him. However, asking for a "Dark Lord" turns out to be a tad bit too ambiguous. Baba Yaga is having fun, Godelot is a sadistic bastard, Herpo the Foul brags about his horcrux, Tom Riddle is unimpressed. (Dark)

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)

  Dudley's been sent back in time. Which is fine, really. As long as he can get past the nightmares and the memories and the face he has to see staring back at him from the mirror, it's all fine.
