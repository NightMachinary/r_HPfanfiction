If Albus Severus Potter was sent back to the 1960's and was at Hogwarts he'd be in school with his maternal grandparents as well as Bellatrix, Andromeda , Narcissa Black and Lucius Malfoy. Probably the Lestrange brothers as well but I haven't seen an exact date for their birthdays/birth year.

*Arthur's* birthday is February 6th 1950 - Hogwarts = September of 1961- June 1968

*Molly's* birthday is October 30th in 1949 or 1950 - Hogwarts = September 1961- June 1968 or September 1962- June 1969

The Black Family tree had birth years for Bellatrix ,Narcissa and Lucius. Andromeda was burnt off but I assume she's in between her sisters based on where her burnt mark is on the Black Family tree.

*Bellatrix* was born in 1951 so -Hogwarts = September 1962- June 1969 or September 1963- June 1970

(I assume Andromeda would be in between these two , which is why I head-canon Bellatrix as being at Hogwarts September 1962- June 1969 and Narcissa being at Hogwarts between September 1966 - June 1973 putting *Andromeda* at Hogwarts September 1964 - June of 1971 but she could also be various other years depending on when exactly her birthday is.)

*Narcissa* was born in 1955 so Hogwarts = September1966 - June 1973 or September 1967 -June 1974

*Lucius* was born in 1954 so Hogwarts = September 1965- June 1972 or September 1966- June 1972 (pretty sure he was Headboy when he met Severus Snape, so it's more likely to be 1965-1972)

Lily Evans was born January 30th 1960 - Hogwarts = September 1971- June 1978

James was born March 27th 1960 - Hogwarts = September 1971- June 1978
