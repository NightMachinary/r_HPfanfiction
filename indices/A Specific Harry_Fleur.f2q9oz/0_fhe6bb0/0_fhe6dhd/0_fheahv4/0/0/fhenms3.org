Everyone at Hogwarts died due to an ambush from the Death Eaters... who have no governmental support, no Voldemort, no allies. Just whatever Death Eaters who happened to be around managed to kill everyone.

I get that it's probably intentionally looking for a way to get Harry out of Hogwarts without bashing, but that doesn't sell for me.
