Harriet, Herman, and Ronalda ðŸ˜‚

In all seriousness, if you do write it, please actually have the gender swap change something in the story. So many fem!Harry authors just shit out a rehashed canon or tired old tropes and expect them to fly since Harry has a vag now and that's sooo different. Ugh. It's the primary reason i avoid fics of this type.
