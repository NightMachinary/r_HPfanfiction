That's the least of all your problems. People who will reject you just because of stupid name are morons. There is still Brogan Snape in linkffn(Snape's Daughter by Tribi) with hundreds of reviews and there is no possibility you can choose anything worse. Care more about plot, character development and similar stuff, not about freaking names.
