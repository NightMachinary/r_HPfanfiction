Linkao3(future's past by darkseraphina)

Female Harry who time-travels and merges with a previous incarnation. Temper and snarkiness intact. Unique point of departure for time-travel making changes. The entire first chapter is author notes, so skip to chap 2 if you just want story. It does explain the dates being shifted, though, and is kind of a tell-not-show prologue.
