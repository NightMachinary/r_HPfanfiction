You can accept what you consider Canon, there are usually base items that fit into Canon because they created it aka the original release.

For me Potter Canon is the 7 Books, Quidditch through the ages, Magical Beast and where to find Them (Book), Magical Beast Movies and that's it. I don't consider Cursed Child or even Pottermore Canon
