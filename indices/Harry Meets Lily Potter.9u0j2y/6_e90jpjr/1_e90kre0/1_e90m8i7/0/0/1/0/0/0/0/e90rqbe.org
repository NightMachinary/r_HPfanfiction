The series is about Supernatural immortals who have lived centuries playing a world wide game of king of the mountain where the objective is to take off the others players heads, that is Not a euphemism.

The second movie turns them into aliens who are de-aged, sent to earth and are tricked into playing 'The Game' by a evil Warlord from their alien planet. Did I fucking mention they were FUCKING ALIENS?

This is only accepted as Canon in the second movie alone, in the first, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Two Television Spin offs this isn't canon or even mention at all as a possibility. In fact the rest of the series focuses it self on the magical and mystical nature rather than any Scifi elements.

Many even debate the canon of films 3,4,5 as All Three features the 'End of The Game' in some definite way. In fact it supposedly ends in the first movie. Look when you deal with a clusterfuck of a series you learn real quick that Canon is what you make it
