Even if you think so, The Cursed Child is still debatable at best because Rowling didn't write it. She approved of it, but beyond that, no one seems to even know exactly how much involvement she had with writing the script. It seems universally agreed that the script was written primarily by Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, however.
