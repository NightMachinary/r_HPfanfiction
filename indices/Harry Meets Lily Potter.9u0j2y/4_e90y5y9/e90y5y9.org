*face death in the hope*

Here's one. Time travel but different from the others. It's not a school time Hogwarts in fact James and Lily already have bought their house together I believe. I mostly read it for the fact that Regulus Black is a main character in it. Regulus/Harry in the tags but it hasn't happened yet despite it's length. Ongoing, regular enough updates.

*A storm across time*

I liked this one to begin with but now it feels like it had past when it should have ended. Again, I read it for Regulus even though he's not a main. Harry meets his parents but they don't know who he is. Bit cringe with the whole "Hurricane" thing but it's alright.
