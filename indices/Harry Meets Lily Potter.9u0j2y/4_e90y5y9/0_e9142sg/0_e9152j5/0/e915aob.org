The author is really rather spectacular at it.

I was starting to think the author was making the mistake of rehashing the "Regulus doesn't X because Blacks don't do that" bit before I realized that it was only ever /Regulus/ thinking things like that and I realized that the author was conveying that Regulus is very... trained. Almost brainwashed into his beliefs about how a person should reflect their family.

It was a real "Oh..." moment.

EDIT: I'm also really beginning to suspect that the author is giving the best portrayal of PTSD in Harry that I've ever seen in fanfiction.
