From your first recommendation, this might be the funniest few paragraphs I've ever read in fanfiction.

  “Oh, well, they were. Tom Riddle Sr. and Merope Gaunt.”

  Regulus stares at him for a very long, very awkward moment, before he whirls on his brother.

  “Is this sort of thing not proof enough for you?” Regulus demands. “Because he's been doing this ever since I met him and I'm not sure that the Dark Lord can kill me enough for knowing this sort of thing.”

  “He'll definitely try,” Harry mutters, a little offended and not entirely sure why. “He killed all his living family, more or less. He even framed his uncle for the murder of his father.”

  “Constantly,” Regulus complains to Siirus.

  Sirius just stares back at him, looking between like brother and Harry, looking like he's having difficulty remembering what words are. He looks a bit like he'd like to go and try his luck with the hallway again, but Regulus is looking at him very unhappily and very expectantly.

  “That's... troubling,” Sirius says finally.

  Regulus nods, posture finally slackening as he leans back in his seat, so very relieved that his brother agrees with him that Harry is definitely offended, even if he still doesn't know why.

  “Isn't it?” Regulus says.

  Surprisingly, someone pipes up to agree with him willingly.

  “Very,” Marlene McKinnon says, flicking her wand at the broken cup on the floor. It comes together with sure clicks and settle wholly in the strainer with the crystal ball. “I have never in my life felt so fantastically outdone,” she complains. “How very dare you, Harry Potter.”
