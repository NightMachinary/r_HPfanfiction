The Last Casualties is probably the best "Harry meets his parents' fanfic in the HP fandom. Lily and James were put into suspended animation by Voldemort rather than killed, and everything happened as canon until Harry's fourth year where the story begins. It's a very good fic that's an excellent mix of character development, action, humor, romance, and interesting plotlines.
