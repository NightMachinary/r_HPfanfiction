The author claimed in one note to have been told by his reader that his story is very similar to PoS and then said that he must have taken inspiration subconsciously. It seems kinda funny, how they could have such a similar story and forget to remember where the ideas all came from.

​

But in it's defense, SaS goes further than PoS, and it does have a lot of original content. Inspiration from other popular fanfics is there for anyone who can see it. There's some small elements of Dodging Prison too. But the story is still good. The way Harry is being developed is clear and consistent. Though I do have an issue with some characters just never growing up and continuing to be assholes, which PoS doesn't do.
