I haven't read PoS yet but personally love S&S. Even though I acknowledge that it tends to fall into the tropes of Dumbledore and James bashing I thing the author portrays them well and explores their characters well enough that these tropes are enjoyable - but then again, I tend to like fics that fall into tropes if they are written well.

I'm subscribed to ther series and am loving what the other is doing with Harry's development and particularly the political side of things.
