S&S is a lot further along, so it is fairly different in that it has nothing to base itself on after year 2. Year 2 itself did feel more different than year 1 did as well. Also PoS takes all the annoying tropes WBWL fics have, and then either subverts or attempts to justify them in a more reasonable way than they are typically done. Where as S&S just has them straight out as they are normally done, so the author apparently just likes all those tropes. So S&S feels sort of like a bizarro version of PoS rather than just a copy imo.

Also as a result of those tropes a lot of characters in S&S feel like one dimensional caricatures rather than real characters, where as PoS does a better job of having its characters feel realistic, with real motivations. That said PoS gets overly complex with an absurd number of side plots, while S&S is a lot more focused on it's main story.

Even with the annoying tropes and one dimensional characters S&S is still reasonably enjoyable to read though, so if you liked PoS might as well give it a shot.
