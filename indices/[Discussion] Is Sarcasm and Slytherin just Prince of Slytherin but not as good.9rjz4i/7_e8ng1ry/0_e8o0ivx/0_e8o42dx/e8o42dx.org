Interesting. James, along with Dumbledore, are the characters I found the most ridiculous in S&S. Especially at the end of book 3. I found them to both basically just be mustache twirling villians with no justification for any of their actions. I haven't actually read book 4, so it's possible things change, but the actions revealed at the end of book 3 are pretty much unredeamable.

Where as James in PoS while his behavior is bad, does have an explanation for why he is behaving that way which is revealed in the last chapter of book 1. He's still a dick for acting that way, but it at least sort of makes sense, versus S&S where James is a colossal dick for no reason.
