I agree that James and Dumbledore look like obvious villains in the hospital scene at the end of book 3, but I've always gotten the impression that they have deeper motivations that Harry only sees hints of. For example, they would think their actions are justified if they know that Harry is a horcrux, they think it's vital to the war effort that no one ever finds out, and they are beginning to think that Harry has been influenced/taken over by the horcrux's personality. Their actions throughout the SaS series (the trial in book 4, etc.) are consistent with that hypothesis.

Thanks for the discussion. I've always found it interesting how some readers prefer one fic over the other. I'd like to finish reading PoS one day because I hear such good things about it, but I've had trouble powering through the first book to the reach the parts people have said are better.
