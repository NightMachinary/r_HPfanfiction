  Also as a result of those tropes a lot of characters in S&S feel like one dimensional caricatures rather than real characters, where as PoS does a better job of having its characters feel realistic, with real motivations.

It's interesting you say that, because I got the opposite impression when reading the two fics.

The portrayal of James comes to mind especially. In book 1 of PoS, James is portrayed as a buffoon whose hatred for Harry is entirely unjustified and unrealistic to the extent that everyone with a brain in the fic thinks he is being an idiot. It's as if his sole purpose is to be a plot element who divides the cast into separate factions of irrational-Harry-haters on one side and good-people-who-like-Harry on the other. In SaS, on the other hand, James still hates Harry, but he acts like a real person in that he has strong reasons for thinking of himself as the good guy, and he hides his faults well enough that it's understandable for people to take his side.

I've heard that PoS improves a lot in later books, but in that first year the author tends to give all the dialogue to one character in each conversation while having the others just stand like cardboard cutouts to passively accept the beatdown and/or witness the awesomeness. Comparing just the first two books of each series, SaS does a much better job having its characters interact in believable ways with well-balanced dialogue.
