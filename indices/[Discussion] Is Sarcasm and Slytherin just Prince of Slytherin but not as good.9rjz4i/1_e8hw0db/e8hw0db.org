To answer your post title, not really. A lot of the tropes used in S&S are not uncommon in Slytherin!Harry stories in general, which is why they make an appearance (and are often subverted to some degree) in PoS. S&S messes with some stuff, but a lot of the tropes are played straight. Common elements in these stories include Harry being adopted by Sirius, Wormtail actually having some character development/competence, general WBWL tropes, etc. But just because the events, outcomes, etc. are much more fleshed out and feel more creative in PoS doesn't mean S&S isn't worth reading.

I'd recommend reading S&S for something new before doing a reread of Prince of Slytherin. It's not the greatest WBWL/Slytherin!Harry story I've read, but it was decent and does some decently interesting things with the plot, character relations, etc. And it develops/is published at a fairly brisk clip.

And from the 4th book of S&S, you can tell that they're going in different directions. In S&S, unlike PoS, it seems the author is going for a "sane, justified" type Voldemort- this has been done before, of course, but is definitely different from the PoS direction. Similarly, they also use the "Dumbledore hating Harry" trope, whereas Dumbledore is fundamentally a good person and on Harry's side in PoS. PoS also feels far more creative with its reinterpretation of canon elements, but also allocates a lot more "space" for those side developments.

tl;dr: just read it
