Fic was too dark for me, but Too Young to Die is supposed to be good.

Also the series that starts with the definition of normal is not a twin fic, but is a decent Slytherin Harry story which is sort of similar since most twin fics have Harry in Slytherin. It hits some of the same plot beats they usually do, just without the twin part.
