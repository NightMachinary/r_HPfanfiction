  It's not the greatest WBWL/Slytherin!Harry story I've read, but it was decent and does some decently interesting things with the plot, character relations, etc.

By chance, do you know any other WBWL or Potter twins/siblings stories worth reading? S&S, PoS, HP and the BWL, and to some extent Antithesis are the only decent ones I found so far and I'd love to read some more.
