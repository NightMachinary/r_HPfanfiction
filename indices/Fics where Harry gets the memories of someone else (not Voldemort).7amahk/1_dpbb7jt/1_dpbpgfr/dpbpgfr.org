The overly vulgar sorting hat (the thing hardly goes a full sentence that I remember without saying something crude; it's been a while since I read the fic) along with the gryffindor bashing (the only time the house as a whole even remotely approached being that much of a bag of dicks towards Harry in canon was after the Norbert incident) are the reasons I consider this one to be one of my least favorite fics I read all the way through that weren't by robst.
