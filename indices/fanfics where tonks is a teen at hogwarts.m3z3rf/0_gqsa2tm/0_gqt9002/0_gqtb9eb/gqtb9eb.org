Story: Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188150/0]]

Not exactly what you're looking for, basically a time travel fic with tonks as the main POV in OOTP. She behaves as and ultimately become a teen. If you're looking for a fic at the time period where she attends Hogwarts, you may want to repost this as promt. I haven't seen a fic in that period before.
