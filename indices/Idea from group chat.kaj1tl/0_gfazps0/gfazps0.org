Ooh, I like this. I've read something where Petunia wanted to be a Muggle Teacher after she couldn't be a witch, but Dudley and Vernon happened and then Lily died and her life got wrecked. She found an essay out in the open about "Why 4 out of 5 DADA Professor's recommend killing HP" or something. She didn't know anything that was going on, and nothing about magic. But she corrected a ton of his grammar and stuff. HP became an Assistant Prof or something for his sixth year.... I can't remember the name.
