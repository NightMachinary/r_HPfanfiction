There're two fics that I know of that don't have a Dementor boggart, but they also don't have your examples either.

/The Boggart/ by hypotemoose :: linkffn(3894532); Harry's boggart is him not being himself.

/Riddle in the Dark/ by LeeASherlook :: linkffn(13372427); Harry's boggart is Tom Riddle.
