Fate Magecraft and HP magic doesn't really get along, imo. Magecraft is high cost for little reward and is slow as fuck to develop(see progress measured in generations), though it does have the advantage of being very science-like in nature which allows for things HP magic can't really do. HP magic, on the other hand, is very easy to use, easy to create, and can have major returns for the amount of effort required.

So, maybe you can play that up. Mages seethe with jealousy over the efficiency and power of wizards, while wizards look down on mages as barely more than squibs.

You're also going to need to address the fact that mages would be quite willing to kidnap and dissect wizards(adults or children) to get whatever it is that gives wizards their magic. And what they might do with it if they can successfully get wizard magic.
