I have to agree with you and thats where I've been having the most trouble. Both systems of magic really don't jive well and its been my biggest stumbling block. I was planning on playing that tension up a lot. Like you said, Mages are somewhat jealous of how freely wizards can use magic as well as disaprove of how they treat it so casually. Wizards on the other hand like you also said see Mage's as barely above a muggle. Mage's will also have tried to capture and dissect wizards in the past, but that has mostly stopped when the ICW and Mage's Association came to a peace agreement in the past though there are still cases of it happening under the table. Up until now, no Mage has managed to figure out wizard's secret to using magic like they do. This also leads to wizards looking down on Mage's as almost barbarians as well (in their eyes). For the most part though, the two groups ignore each other. No one wants to accidentally set off a war between them.
