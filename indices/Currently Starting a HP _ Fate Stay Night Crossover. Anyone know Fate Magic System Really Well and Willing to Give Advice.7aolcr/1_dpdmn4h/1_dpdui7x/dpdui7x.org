It's an interesting idea. I was considering more that Mages would be jealous of how freely wizards can use magic (sort of like the other commenter on here mentioned) while most Wizards just look down on mages. Both sort of underestimate each other. Or at least thats how I was thinking of writing it.

I'll have to check out the story you linked. I don't actually think I've seen this one surprisingly.

Edit: I have read that fic before. Its quite good. Hope to see it updated again.
