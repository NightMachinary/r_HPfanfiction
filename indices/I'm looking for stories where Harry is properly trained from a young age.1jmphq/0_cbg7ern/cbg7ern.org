The classic story of this type is onoM's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745/1/Learning-to-Breathe][Learning to Breathe]]; though it's fairly long (150k words), I believe it's abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is 16 years old. He already defeated Voldemort, with the help of his Godfather Sirius Black. Now he is in for the biggest challenge of his life: attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Incidentally, onoM's story was based on an old, abandoned story by Jeconais called [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Aftermath/Aftermath/][Aftermath]].

  What if Sirius Black had raised Harry to be a warrior. What if he defeated Voldemort, and then had to face a bigger challenge. Going to Hogwarts for the first time. An attempt at a complete AU, but abandoned when I realised that the characters weren't that good, and that I had no real point to the story.

One that's updating very regularly (multiple times a week, typically--I think the story was pre-written before posting) is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] by MarauderLover7.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

SerpentSannin's old story [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=47][Knowledge is Power]] probably also counts. Harry was raised a wizard to be pretty much the textbook Jerk Ass Sue. Neville as Boy Who Lived, abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  Harry, in this story, is two years older than he is in canon. Nobody else's age is different, as far as I know, except for Harry being born two years earlier than normal.

I wrote a novel-length, complted story where Dumbledore acted after the second prophecy and took Harry into an apprenticeship. It's not quite what the OP requested, but I could link to it if anyone cares.
