Pre-wand? I think the advantages would have slight. Without wands, wizards would mostly be doing accidental magic, some controlled wandless magic if they can, and perhaps some rudimentary potions and taking advantage of some magical creatures. Though I'd also note, it'd be more dangerous as they'd also attract magical creatures without wands to defend themselves. The best advantage would be an increased natural lifespan, the decreased aging of which would keep their lifespan longer by decreasing the odds of death each year.

I do think that even before wands, there would start to be a seperation between muggles and wizards quite naturally. The slow aging, the fact that wizards attract different types of threats, and good old prejudice probably forced wizards to start slowly separating. For the most part though, I think both groups of people would have largely relied on the same things, except the wizards might have a few things magical.

The wand changed everything. Wizards had far better control, had a whole host of spells unlocked, and suddenly magic went from a trade-off to clearly being a good thing. And the separation would have continued. It's not a perfect one, and there's is crossover which is why the statute happening was still a big deal. But I do think that once wands were invented, wizards had a huge advantage when it came to civilization.
