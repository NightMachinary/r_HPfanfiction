I mean, someone has to create the spells, develop wands or other magical foci first. But you're spot on, and i think your point makes a lot of sense.

This is why it really is a shame that JKR got so rich so quickly. She really gave up on the whole 'creative' part of her writing almost immediately. Like, how while in 'the real world', the 1960s were a transformational time where civil rights became a major issue, in the 1960s wizarding world... uhh .. the same thing happened, at the same time. Funny coincidence.

If you read Pottermore, you can see JKR just went and found an Intro to Western Civ textbook, and went through line-by-line and crossed out "people" and replaced it with "wizards" ðŸ™„
