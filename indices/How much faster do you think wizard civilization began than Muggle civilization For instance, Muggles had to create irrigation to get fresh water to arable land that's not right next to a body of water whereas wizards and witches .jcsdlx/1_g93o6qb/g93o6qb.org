Wizards had to first learn how to do magic in a systematic and organised way. I imagine that magic and Muggle civilisations were the same thing until relatively shortly before the Statute of Secrecy. We see hints of this from the books too, with Nearly Headless Nick being a former Court Wizard, the ancient Egyptian wizards with their tombs and the curses on them... I imagine that early magic was as rudimentary as early Muggle technology.

It wouldn't have used wands for a start, since those are said to be a Roman innovation and there was already thousands of years of Muggle innovation and learning needed to get to Rome. We see hints of older magic in the books as well, with things like the sacrificial protection Harry had, the curse on the defence position, Voldemort's resurrection ritual.

I think the very earliest wizards would have just had the basic advantages that wizards have over muggles - they don't get sick from simple Muggle diseases, they're durable, and live a long time. Just like writing and mathematics, I assume spells and real magic came much later.
