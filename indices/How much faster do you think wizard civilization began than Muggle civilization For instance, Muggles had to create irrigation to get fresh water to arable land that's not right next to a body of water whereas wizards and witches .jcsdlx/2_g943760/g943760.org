I think one thing to consider is how wizards piggy back off muggle technology. I mean at the time of the books, the wizards were still using radios while TVs had become norm in the muggle work. Also between the 1990s and the Statute if Secrecy, the wizard world never developed better clothing than robes, better writing implements than quills, or even a maybe more logical sport than sending 17 year olds into a death tournament. I mean this lack of innovation is most likely due to the small population of wizards so they use muggle advancements for the â€˜normal' things while they focus their advancements on the magical. This still leads to wizards relying on muggle advancements.
