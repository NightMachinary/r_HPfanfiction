My headcanon is that for most of the human civilization wizards and muggles worked together. I think that magic is something that evolved in some humans more and some humans less. If we were to take Dumbledore's statement that "words are an inexhaustible source of magic" and that love and sacrifice are some of the most powerful forms of magic, you could say even muggles are capable of some rudimentary magic (we say that someone has charm when they make you feel good around them and we use curses for words that make people feel repulsion and discomfort). This would indicate that both muggles and wizards have the same origin. I think that the first forms of 'magic' were being able to domesticate animals, women to seduce men for protection and men would use charisma and inspirational words to get other people to follow them. This form of rudimentary magic evolved in some people to the point that their willpower alone was able to protect or harm others and later on even to manipulate weather. These people became priests or shamans or leaders (in ancient Egypt) or were even so revered that they called themselves 'gods'.
