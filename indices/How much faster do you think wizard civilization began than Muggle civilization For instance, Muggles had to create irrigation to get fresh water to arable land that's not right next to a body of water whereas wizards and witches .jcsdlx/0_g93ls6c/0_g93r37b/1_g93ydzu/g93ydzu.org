Compare the 1300s to tens of thousands of years ago. Civilizations would have been built together, although magicals would have a lesser effect on it by virtue of having a lower population throughout history.

Did wizards & witches have a spell to hold food or did they use bowls? Muggles and magicals don't exist in separate spheres. They don't even in modern times, one side just doesn't know the other exists but they still interact and feed off of each other.

Was the advancement of magic faster than the advancement of technology? I think, yes, until about 100-200 years ago where muggle technology starts to outstrip magic. Magic peaked early and stayed there until very recently.
