The key phrase there was "at least". I think the implication in canon is that magic was /never/ practised openly among Muggles, at least within the era of written history - this is why Muggles have legends of magic all the way back to the classical era, with stories about dragons and sirens, centaurs and mermaids, but do not have any stories which are /accurate/ accounts of the magical world - because they only ever caught glimpses of magic, with wizards generally keeping to themselves and avoiding Muggles.
