Yes and no. The Statute of Secrecy made the divide official, but we know that the wizard/Muggle divide existed in Britain since at least the 1300s, when the Wizard's Council banned playing Quidditch within 50 miles of towns and villages to prevent Muggles from seeing magic. While we know that some wizards like the Malfoy family moved in Muggle circles, there's no evidence that they practised magic openly.
