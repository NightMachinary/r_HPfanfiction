Forget the beginning of civilization starting around 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. The idea of Magicals existing from the beginning of human existence starting around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago is incompatible with human evolution.

We're not even homo sapiens, we're homo sapiens sapiens. Were there magical homo sapiens? Were there magical homo neanderthalensis? Homo erectus? Australopithecus?

Let's pretend that speciation is instant rather than gradual, that homo sapiens popped up fully distinct 200,000 years ago, and that there were Magical and Muggle homo sapiens. Within a few thousand years, there would be no Muggles. Magicals would've out-competed and out-bred the Muggles.

We could pretend that Magicals almost immediately separated off into a separate civilization that we could call Atlantis.

The Toba supervolcano erupted about 70,000 years ago and caused something called a "genetic bottleneck," meaning only between 3,000 and 10,000 humans were left alive on the entire planet, and every living human is descended from that tiny population. There were probably between 100,000 and 300,000 humans living before that eruption. We could pretend that some gigantic Atlantean catastrophe caused the genetic bottleneck rather than the Toba supervolcano. Either way, there's something called the "minimum viable population." There would've had to have been at least a few thousand Magicals left alive after the eruption/catastrophe in order for them to not become extinct, so at that point the Muggle and Magical populations would be roughly equal.

If there were 10,000 Muggles in Africa/Eurasia and 10,000 Magicals in Atlantis, not only could those two populations not breed with each other for 70,000 years in order for what we know to be true about the current living population of the world's genetic history to be true, but the Magical population would have to grow at a rate that would mean the modern Magical population couldn't be as small as it is.

If there were 5,000 Muggles and 5,000 Magicals living together at that point and interbreeding, that would square with our genetic history, but it would mean every living person would have to be Magical and there could be no such thing as a Muggle.

The modern magical population being as low as it is just doesn't square with genetics or evolution. The existence of the Wizarding World only makes sense in a magical universe that's had the appearance of mundanity artificially imposed upon it. But for the existence of magic to square with recorded history and evolutionary history, magic had to have been invented or discovered extremely recently, as in less than 10,000 years ago, and that doesn't make sense if the universe is inherently magical, but it isn't possible if the universe is inherently mundane.

I can't see any way to make this work.
