The only "evolutionary disadvantage" is whatever prevents you from breeding before reaching the age of maturity. Magicals can summon clean water from nothing, and recover from flesh wounds and such, and ward off predators, and all sorts of other things.

Muggles have gotten themselves into all sorts of trouble over the last couple hundred thousand years. Malaria. Lions and tigers and bears. Starvation. Infections; from food, and from minor scrapes and cuts, and from impacted wisdom teeth, and from unclean water. Muggles are exceptionally squishy.

I won't look it up right now, I'll leave that for you if you're interested in diving deeper, but I'm pretty sure the child mortality rate has been over 50% from the beginning of time up until about 200 years ago. Even if Magicals were having fewer children, that probably evened itself out owing to the high rate of mortality for Muggle children.

The fact that canon doesn't contain as many Magicals as it should doesn't mean magic confers an evolutionary disadvantage, it means canon doesn't contain as many Magicals as it should. You're not arriving at "magic apparently confers an evolutionary disadvantage" by starting from first principles and working forwards, you're starting from canon and working backwards to try to justify it. For canon to have the Magical population size that it has, that means magic MUST confer an evolutionary disadvantage. But magic does NOT confer an evolutionary disadvantage. All that means is that canon is a fantasy story for children, written by an author who didn't care whether or not her world was compatible with reality. Which is fine. It's a fantasy. We're not supposed to be thinking about this stuff. It's ridiculous to even be having this conversation. But OP's question is about this stuff, so that's how I answered, by taking it seriously.
