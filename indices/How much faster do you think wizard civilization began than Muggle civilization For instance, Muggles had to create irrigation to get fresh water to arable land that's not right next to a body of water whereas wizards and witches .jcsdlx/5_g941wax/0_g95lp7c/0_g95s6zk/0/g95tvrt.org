Considering the potential for accidental magic to inflict harm, I'm amazed there are as many magicals as there are in canon. It's hard to childproof a home to keep just a muggle toddler alive. I'm sure magical toddlers can get into much worse trouble. I'd be surprised if their childhood mortality rate is lower than ours, or was any lower historically, or prehistorically.

Traits that prevent you from breeding after reaching maturity are evolutionary disadvantages too. Being smart enough to understand how to use birth control is an evolutionary disadvantage. So's having access to magical birth control. Being too stupid/not magical enough to use birth control is an evolutionary advantage.

Canon is perfectly consistent here. Magic is a cool trait, like albinism, that hasn't become prevalent in the population because of the evolutionary disadvantage it confers.
