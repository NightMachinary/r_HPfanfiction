There's no evidence in canon that magicals can outcompete and out-breed muggles. Magic apparently confers an evolutionary disadvantage, considering how few magicals there are in proportion to muggles. It's easy to see what the mechanism could be, as canon magicals use their magic to get themselves into deeper trouble than muggles are capable of.

Another possible mechanism is that magicals invented birth control earlier. Magical families are generally small. That's a personal advantage and an evolutionary disadvantage.
