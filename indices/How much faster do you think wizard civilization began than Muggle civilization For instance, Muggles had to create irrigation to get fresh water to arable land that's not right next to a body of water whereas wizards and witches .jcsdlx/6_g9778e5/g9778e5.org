Spell development probably took a long time. My headcanon is that as better, easier to cast and more efficient spells get invented all the time, if you look a few thousand years back the spells they used were different and clunkier and people generally knew fewer spells.

Copying spells were probably less accurate with small details and only the best could produce readable book copies or enchant quills to auto-write without making errors, so books would have been something reserved for highly skilled individuals and wealthy families. At least until Gutenberg would make all wizards think "why didn't I think of that".

The first water spells would probably be complicated rituals to make it rain that would take weeks to prepare, and slow but steady improvement would lead to modern spells. In the medieval age they might use a single complicated water conjuring enchantment that'd take a skilled wizard months to cast on a central cistern to provide a constant water supply, in modern times a much simpler and cheaper water conjuring enchantment on each individual tap could make plumbing obsolete.

You could imagine how importing Leibniz's calculus to arithmancy in the 1670s might lead to a wave of innovation around that time, which could produce a large scale memory spell that would finally make it practical to make muggles completely forget that magic is real.

So I think wizard civilization developed and improved mostly in parallel with nonmagical civilization. With both being much more intertwined in ancient times.
