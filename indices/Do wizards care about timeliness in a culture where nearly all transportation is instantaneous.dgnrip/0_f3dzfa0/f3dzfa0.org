While not particularly focused on in the books. Both Mcgonagall and Snape valued punctuality in their students. I would imagine from a world where transportation is instantaneous that punctuality would be a bigger deal. When it takes only a second to separate or throw a pinch of floor powder into the fireplace, being late can only mean that you weren't ready in time to go. There is no traffic to blame tardiness on, so lateness can easily be interpeted as showing the other person that you don't value or respect their time.

While obviously not all situations can involve easy apparation or flooing, I would expect punctuality to be valued within all of wizarding society
