No, Harry would definitely be trying to get home, especially so if Voldemort hadn't been defeated. There is absolutely zero chance of Harry abandoning his friends if he has a choice in the matter. As for how Harry would interact with James and Lily, I'll say that he would want to know them, but wouldn't treat them as his own parents. Which is accurate, and in character.
