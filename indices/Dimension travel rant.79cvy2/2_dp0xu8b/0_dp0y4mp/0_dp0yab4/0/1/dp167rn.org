That´s a really annoying assessment, it is not more realistic if he´s attention craving with his parents, it is definitely a plausible possibility, but not something that is closest to canon or closest to realistic behavior and don´t bring up the Dursley´s abuse, which even in the tamest reading is horrifying, people are shaped differently by abuse. Let´s say we have the scenario that everyone knows what´s up and Harry meets his parents, possible first reactions would be, him embracing them, running away, having a mental breakdown, cautiously assessing the situation... after that they may fall into "normal" familiar patterns, he can´t get over the fact that they aren´t his real parents, he may feel guilty about being happy with them, because the originals sacrificed their lives for him(this might not be logical, but very much plausible behavior), maybe he just cannot take being near them, maybe they have just a very awkward relationship, maybe he feels nothing for them. Then there is the question if he can choose to go back or not, if he can canon!Harry would take it in a heartbeat, because however much heartbreak awaits him, there are people that he deeply cares about, people he formed a connection with through many hardships and even if they exist in the other world they´re not the same, they might as well be strangers to him, of course should he be whisked away at any point before joining Hogwarts, sure there is no reason to stay for him, because he has no emotional attachments to anyone, if he was brought into the other world at a later point and he cannot get back, adjustment will be hard and he would take years to really appreciate a peaceful world with his parents alive, there are so many possible issues, survivor guilt, he may wastes years trying to find a way back, coming to terms with the fact that he cannot get back, being unable to form attachments to the people in the new world, getting depression, maybe even suicidal. He sure as hell won´t just accept it right away and make new friends as if he´s replacing some piece of furniture.
