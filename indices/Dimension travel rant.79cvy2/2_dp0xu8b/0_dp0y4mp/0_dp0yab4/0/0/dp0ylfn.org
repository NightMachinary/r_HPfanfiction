We do know. Harry has several parental figures in his life, he doesn't behave like this with any of them. Also when I said that's accurate I meant my statement that the alternate James and Lily wouldn't be his parents, just a very passable copy of them. Therefore Harry would want to know them he wouldn't treat them as his own parents. He wouldn't call them his parents, or address them as such.
