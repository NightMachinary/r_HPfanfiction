True, it is the whole angst part that is the problem here. I mean with Harry's depest desire (mirror of erised) is being with his parents, and he suddenly has them back, i just dont see him pushing them away in his oh so noble selfsacrificing ways. I think a more realistic harry would be a antentionseeking clingy cuddlebear with his parents, and go "find a way to dimension travel back to my home universe? Fuck that, im staying right here and you can't make me leave!"
