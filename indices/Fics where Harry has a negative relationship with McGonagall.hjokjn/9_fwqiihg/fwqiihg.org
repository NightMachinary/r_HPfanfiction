I've really been searching for some proper McGonagall bashing stories (where I include stories that hold her to account for her canon failures not just warp her personality) and I sadly haven't had much success.

The two that I can think of (other than Slytherin stories which I typically can't stomach due to Drarry or somehow Snape not being terrible):

- Something like Family: linkffn(6655313) - This is slightly more to the warped personality
- The Centaur was Late: linkffn(9676179) - I only really read the first few chapters, but she gets in trouble for the Forbidden Forest detention

Here's a community with some more stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Minerva-McGonagall-Bashing/116659/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]
