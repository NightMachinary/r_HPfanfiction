  “I have to admit that I am surprised you have come to me about this, Potter,” Professor McGonagall said somewhat stiffly as she peered at him from behind her desk.

  “I would say that if a Head of House doesn't expect one of their students to come to them when they have a problem, that Head of House is failing in his or her duties,” Harry replied, his eyes narrowed. “But, given your actions last year, that's not much of a shock, is it?”

  Harry could see his professor's mouth tighten in anger momentarily, but she made no response to Harry's jab.

  “I will speak with Professor Snape,” she finally said, “and we will go from there.”

  “And when he lies and says I cast a spell?”

  The stern teacher paused for a moment, as though gathering her thoughts. “Mister Potter, I get the feeling that you do not expect anything to come of this meeting.”

  “After what happened last year, is that such a surprise? I was shunned for months, and you did nothing. Odd behavior for a Head of House,” Harry responded coldly.

  “Mister Potter, you were caught fighting, and were appropriately punished. I cannot control how the other students react.”

  “No, I was found defending myself from an unprovoked attack. There is a very large difference,” came the quick reply. “You punished me without bothering to find out the circumstances. Which makes you a hypocrite of the highest order.”

  “Mister Potter, just because someone disagrees with you does not make them a hypocrite,” McGonagall replied angrily.

  “It is my understanding that you were a member of Dumbledore's vigilante group, the Order of the Phoenix. Is that correct?”

  “It was not a vigilante group, but yes, I was a member of the Order. Where did you learn about that?”

  “Where I learned about it is irrelevant,” Harry countered. “As a member of the Order of the Phoenix, did you ever leave Hogwarts to help defend against Death Eater attacks?”

  McGonagall pursed her lips, clearly seeing where his questions were leading. “Yes, I did. And I will point out that the situation was very different from your circumstances.”

  “You defended against Death Eaters and would have protested if you had been arrested for fighting them. And yet you punished me for defending myself. As I said, you are a hypocrite.”

  The teacher said nothing for moment, before finally asking coldly, “Why are you here, Mister Potter? You clearly don't think that this meeting will accomplish anything.”

  “I am here because I was advised to protest and appeal any unjust punishment through official channels. First is a meeting with the Head of House. If I am not satisfied at the conclusion of this meeting, I will proceed to send written notice of my concerns to the deputy headmistress, and then, the headmaster, and finally, the board of governors.” Harry paused for a moment to look at his teacher. “In this particular instance, it seems a bit redundant to send a written notice to you since you are both my Head of House and the deputy headmistress, but I was advised to follow the established procedure exactly.”

  “And what do you hope to accomplish with this course of action?”

  Harry chuckled bitterly. “Well, I hope that you'll actually do your job, but I realize that's pretty unlikely. No, I'm doing this so that in the future when I tell people about my time in Hogwarts, the faculty will have no excuses. I'll be keeping a record, and someday, I'll find someone who will listen.”

  McGonagall sat back, a startled, and rather unnerved expression on her face. The expression faded however, replaced by a look of determination. “Regardless of your opinions on the matter, Mister Potter, Hogwarts discipline must be enforced. While I will speak with Professor Snape, for the time being, the punishment will stand.”

  Harry smiled coldly. “Well then, I'll put this one down on the list of undeserved punishments. Expect my formal, written protest in a day or two,” he said as he stood and exited her office.
