Ummm Let's Try Again has her as a I guess bad guy. She's on (bad) Dumbledore's side and follows him blindly. Harry and her do not get along. But that's the only one I can think off top of my head. Not sure if its what you are looking for. It's got a a lot of character bashing Ron, Molly, McGonagall, Tonks, Dumbledore. But it also has Alive James (who's awesome), Fred/George/Harry soulmates. Personally I love this story.
