I've been craving something along these lines myself. I don't know about OP but it's not so much an antagonistic relationship between Harry and Minerva that as has been pointed out is pretty common in !SlytherinHarry stories, it's more about Harry reacting accordingly to the dismissiveness that Minerva shows repeatedly all the while enforcing rules that are pretty trivial in context.

From memory, the only 2 positive interventions that she has towards Harry are when she puts him on the Quidditch team and when she defends him from Umbridge in the career meeting and to my mind, the first was self-serving and the second out of spite to Umbridge not care for Harry.

I've found many stories in which post canon Harry has an apparent fondness for Minerva and I just don't see from where that comes from. That and naming his kid Severus because yes Snape might have been brave and maybe a war hero, maybe, but he was still an abusive piece of human waste, not something one wants for one's child.
