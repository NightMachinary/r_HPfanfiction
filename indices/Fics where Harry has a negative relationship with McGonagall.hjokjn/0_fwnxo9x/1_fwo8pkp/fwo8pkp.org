I don't really understand this interpretation and I'd like to hear more about it.

For me, it's clear why Harry has so much love and respect for her. She's strict, but she's very fair and probably the only reasonable authority figure by a real world standard. (The only teacher besides perhaps Flitwick who's not putting her students in mortal danger on the regular, who strenuously objects to the idea of using Harry as a pawn or letting him get wrapped up in violence, who enforces the rules equally...) And she shows compassion and care for Harry many times in small moments like in Prisoner of Azkaban when she makes it clear she won't tolerate risks to his safety or in Goblet of Fire when she pushes him harder in class to get him ready for the trials. To me, she epitomizes a good and stern teacher who I would trust with my life as a child and who I have immense respect for as an adult educator myself.

And Harry expresses how much he respects her when he Crucios someone for spitting at her. He loves her dearly, since he couldn't even summon up a Crucio immediately after Sirius died (though I suspect that was shock and grief).
