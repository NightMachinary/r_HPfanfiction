I concede the Forbidden Forest thing was really fucked up, but we're also not sure that she's the one who set that detention. It sounds like the system for detention is that a student is ‘given' to a teacher to help them with a task, so it seems like they were given to Hagrid and it was up to him to decide where they went. (And let's be real, ‘eleven-year-olds can totally handle the Forbidden Forest' sounds more like a Hagrid thought than a McGonagall thought.)

I feel like compressing a character present in seven books down to two moments is reductive.
