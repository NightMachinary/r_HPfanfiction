For a FIRST OFFENSE breaking curfew, something that is ALWAYS happening at a boarding school, she takes 50 points each, and gives them a soul-crushing setdown, saying that it was the worst offense she had ever seen and that she had never been so ashamed of students before.

That is NOT a stern disciplinarian. That is an unreasonably harsh, nearly Dickensian, martinet. You don't SAY such things to 11-year-olds.
