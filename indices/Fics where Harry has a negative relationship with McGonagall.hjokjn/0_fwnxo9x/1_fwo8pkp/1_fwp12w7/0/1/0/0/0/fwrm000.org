Breaking curfew is /absolutely/ a major offense. It's one of the worst things kids in a boarding school can do, short of drugs and getting pregnant. If a student breaks curfew, that means that the teachers don't know where they are and may not know to look for them until morning. A lot of bad things can happen between a student sneaking out and morning, and it's happened in the past where a student sneaked out, something happened, and they were seriously injured or worse because no one knew to look for them until it was too late. And that's in boarding schools without vicious three-headed dogs hanging around.

Speaking as someone whose been to multiple boarding schools, they take this very seriously. They install silent alarms on doors, have morning classes on weekends, do regular patrols, and put the fear of God into people who break curfew.

Like I said, it's not the strategy I would have used, but McGonagall's strategy for making sure the trio would be terrified of breaking curfew again would generally be considered acceptable in a boarding school environment.
