I went to boarding school in the 2000's, so my experience was just as close in time to Harry's as yours was. I also went to multiple, and I'm a child educator who's taught in overnight spaces.

According to my teachers, the boarding school scene in the area I attended went through a minor revolution in the 80s and 90s because there was a rash of student/teacher relationships, pregnancies, and drug abuse that were threatening to close schools. There was a massive overhaul of accepted practice, a lot of teachers were purged and new ones with clearer boundaries and stricter dispositions were brought on, and schools cracked down on rule violations among students. I don't know if you attended school in an area affected by this change in culture, but any overnight educational space I've worked at takes curfew violations really seriously both because of the practical need and the legacy of this culture shift.
