You make it sound like she whipped out a cane to beat them where they stood.

The house point system is a system of class management (and a pretty shitty one at that but that's another conversation). You have imaginary points represented by pretty hourglasses with jewels, you have your class invested in a largely ceremonial reward for points, and you use them as rewards and punishments. The entire purpose of a class-wide point system is to use the power of peer pressure to get students to behave. McGonagall used the system exactly as intended---five points here or there for talking in class, and a swathe of points for a major rule violation which prompted Neville to try preventing the rule break again.

You'll notice that mentions of house points wane as the book series goes on. It's probably because points are used less to manage older students because points don't have as much an effect on teens as on preteens, and it's easier to talk to a teen on an individual level and reason them into behaving a certain way for their own benefit. It makes sense that she would come down on younger student like that, because not only do you want to nip that behavior in the bud immediately, but it's also easier to scare them into managing each other. And I repeat, breaking curfew is very serious in a boarding school, especially a boarding school with a whole lot of dangerous things a student could get into.

It's not the strategy I would have used in her shoes, but it's a legitimate strategy and she got exactly the effect she was aiming for, which was prompting the trio's peers to keep an eye on them so they don't break curfew and possibly get into something dangerous again. (They petrified Neville and did it anyway, but still.)
