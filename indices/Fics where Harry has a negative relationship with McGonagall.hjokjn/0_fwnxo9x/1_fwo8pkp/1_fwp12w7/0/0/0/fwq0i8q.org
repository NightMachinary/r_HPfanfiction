Well, I think that's a little more subjective. Who would Harry Potter theoretically like?

I think Harry feels more connected to adults who make him feel connected with his parents, but I think that the absence of a connection to his parents doesn't mean that he wouldn't like a given adult. Children that grow up in abusive households on average tend to prefer the presence of adults who behave consistently, but most children everywhere like consistent behavior from adults. Someone like Hagrid is consistent even if he isn't always reliable; he's an honest person who's earnest and openly cares about people. Someone like McGonagall is also consistent even if she isn't always on Harry's side, as it were; she cares a lot about rules and holds her students to high standards, but her standards aren't unreasonable and the safety of her students clearly matters a lot to her. Adults like Hagrid or McGonagall are predictable for children because they are honest and consistent about what matters to them, and their reactions in novel situations are predictable.

Plus, I think it's clear that she loves Harry. This is more of a teacher-specific thing, but when you're in charge of a dorm and have kids in your class for seven years, you love them like they're yours. Their safety is your responsibility, their growth is your responsibility, and any good teacher takes that very seriously. McGonagall doesn't have to be demonstrative about her love for her students to respect that she always has their best interests at heart, and she was the one who screamed when she saw Harry's body. I think Harry always understood that McGonagall always had his safety and growth foremost in her mind even if she got in his way, and he responded to that.
