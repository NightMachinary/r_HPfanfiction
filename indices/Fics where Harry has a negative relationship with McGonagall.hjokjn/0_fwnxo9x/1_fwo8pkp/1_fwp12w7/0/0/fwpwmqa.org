In all honesty, I don't disagree with you, the issue I have is not that she is a bad person or teacher is that her actions don't fit into what I imagine Harry would like/love in an adult. Now if someone points McGonagall as Hermione's favorite teacher that makes perfect sense.

Harry usually feels connected to adults/older people that make him feel connected to his parents and/or while I can't think of anyone of the top of my head with people who acknowledge that despite his age he is neither incapable nor”useless” (maybe Sirius?).
