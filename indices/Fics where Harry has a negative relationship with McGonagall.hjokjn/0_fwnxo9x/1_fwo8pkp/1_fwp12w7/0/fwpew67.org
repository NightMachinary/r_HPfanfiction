I want you to imagine for a second being a teacher. You're responsible for children ages eleven through seventeen. You've been working with a guy for over ten years, and while he's kind of a jerk, he's been a part of the faculty. Now one year, a few eleven-year-olds come to you with info they shouldn't have, claiming your coworker of over a decade is planning to steal an object you know he helped hide.

I'd do the same thing as her, and to be fair to her, she was completely right. Snape wasn't trying to steal the stone.

As for breaking curfew, the loss of points makes sense there too. In a boarding school, curfew is law. Teachers need to know where students are at all times, and when students break curfew, not only are teachers not sure where they are but they're very likely to be up to things that would get them and the school in a lot of trouble. My boarding school historically had classes on Saturdays to limit the number of nights students might break curfew, and many boarding schools install silent alarms on their dorm doors to alert them if students try to break curfew. It's very serious in the boarding school community.

The Forbidden Forest, I grant you, was fucked up. But to be fair, we don't know if McGonagall was the one who set that detention or if she just assigned the detention to Hagrid to figure out himself.

As for the bullying, this goes into the heart of both British boarding school culture and the struggle of being a teacher. A, with British boarding school culture, especially in the 90s, hazing and bullying is rampant and considered part of growing up. B, as a teacher, it's harder to see bullying than people realize. Most students won't speak up about bullying, and most students won't be obvious about bullying in the class or within eyesight of the teacher. So it's easy not only to not realize that bullying is happening, but if you do realize it's happening, to be unable to get the context or know the extent because sometimes kids won't speak up, pretend they don't know anything, or outright lie about who's the aggressor. And trying to investigate and intervene at all runs the risk of making the victim a bigger target.

So I can see how a British boarding school faculty could not know the extent of the bullying Harry goes through, and when they get an inkling, figure it's part of the growing process and there's nothing they can do without making it worse. Bullying isn't accepted in popular culture anymore these days and yet it's still notoriously difficult to deal with in schools.
