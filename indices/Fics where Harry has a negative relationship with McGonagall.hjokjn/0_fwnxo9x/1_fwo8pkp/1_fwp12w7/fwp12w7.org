The problem is that reasonable!McGonagall frequently has to take a backseat to AdvanceThePlot!McGonagall.

Reasonable!McGonagall would at least listen to the concerns of her students, even if she trusts her colleagues to much to believe they'd steal the stone (I mean, Dumbledore /was/ gone). Reasonable!McGonagall would not take an absurd amount of points and then send four first years into the Forbidden Forest, just for breaking curfew. Reasonable!McGonagall would attempt to stop the bullying in books 2 and 4. Etc.
