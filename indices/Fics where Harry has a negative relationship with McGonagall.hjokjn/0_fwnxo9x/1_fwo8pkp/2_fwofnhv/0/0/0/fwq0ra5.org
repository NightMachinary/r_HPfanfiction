Like I've said above, the Forbidden Forest was fucked up, but we don't know if she was the one who sent them in there or if Hagrid was in charge of the detention and thought it'd be a great idea to bring the kids in there. (It honestly sounds more in character for Hagrid to volunteer to take care of their detention and then think that the Forbidden Forest would be a nice easy thing for them to do versus McGonagall deciding to send a couple eleven-year-olds into the death woods.)
