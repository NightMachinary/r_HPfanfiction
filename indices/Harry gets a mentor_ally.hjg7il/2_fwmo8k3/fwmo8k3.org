My personal favourites that came to mind for this are both D&D fics (You don't really need to know anything about D&D to understand them, I don't think - they explain it all relatively well, but I've been playing D&D since I was ten, so I'm not the best to evaluate that level of understanding requirement).

One is serious, the other is not.

The serious one has Harry raised by a D&D-style Paladin (warriors of Right and Justice, generally upstanding citizens of Law and Order - kind of like Captain America [ish] or Michael Carpenter [the most Paladin guy to ever have been written functionally in anything] basically).

Radiant Heart - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]

The less serious one has Harry raised by Minsc and Boo from Baldur's Gate. And yes, the two characters in that fic were actual characters in a D&D adventure PC game that was actually made and played and beloved. And everything they say is alarmingly in-character.
