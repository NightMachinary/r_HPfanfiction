This is EXACTLY how I feel right now. I used to love reading J/L, but I'm in a time-travel phase where I'm shipping Hermione and Sirius/Remus/Regulus (not all three at once, of course). I love these AUs because they almost always end in my favorite Marauders living on, because I can't stand that they don't. But if you can give me a couple of recs on canon-compliant Marauder-centric stories, I'd love to check them out!
