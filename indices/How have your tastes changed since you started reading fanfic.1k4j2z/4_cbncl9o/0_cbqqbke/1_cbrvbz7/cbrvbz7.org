Have I got some for you...mind, some of the characters may seem oddly done, but the overall series of events remain similar to canon. I've got a whole folder of one-shots and multi-chapter fics alike if you're jonesing for more :) Happy Reading!

Fait Accompli - This one is relatively short compared to some of my favorites, but really well written to compensate. This was one of the first ones that got me started on Jily. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6193007/1/Fait-Accompli][here]]

A Month of Sundays - Lighthearted and leaves you feeling warm and cuddly inside. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5249018/1/A-Month-of-Sundays][here]]

All Right, Evans? - This is quite possibly my favorite. It's the first installment of a trilogy that follows through 6th/7th/post-Hogwarts Jily. The second is called Dangerous Crowds, and can be found on the authors page. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8528896/1/All-Right-Evans][here]]
