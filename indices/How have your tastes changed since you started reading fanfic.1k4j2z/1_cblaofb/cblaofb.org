I used to ONLY read slash. Harry/Draco (my first fic was Plumeria's Draco in Darkness) was my OTP. I was obsessed. Then I branched out to het but even then it was Hermione/Draco or Ginny/Draco. My obsession seemed to be mostly With Draco.

Then I got into some weird powerful!Harry stuff, but that didn't last long. I went on a parody fic kick and any crossovers with the Buffyverse I could find. I have never been that into canon ships such as Harry/Ginny or Hermione/Ron, because I find that too boring. I actually used to look for the strangest pairings I could find sometimes.

Still having a weakness for slash and angst, you can imagine my delight when I discovered Harry/Severus. Another obsession was formed. I still love the pairing, but I also love Hermione/Severus now too. I also like Severitus-type fics or ones where he is Harry's mentor, which I'll admit is weird. I just love Snape, dammit. Oh, and Harry as a girl fics are good too!

This was a fun question to think about.
