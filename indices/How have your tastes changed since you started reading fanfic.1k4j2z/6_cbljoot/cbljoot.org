Probably the biggest thing is that, when I started, I refused to pick up a fic if it wasn't finished. I've become a lot more relaxed since then about just enjoying the story to wherever it ended up, even if it's obviously abandoned.

It took me a while to start enjoying crossover fics as well - the first few I tried were abysmal wankishness. But, as with everything, you just have to keep looking to find the gold in the mountain of dross. At least with fanfiction the quality is fairly obvious within the first few paragraphs.
