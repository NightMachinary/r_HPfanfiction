I started reading fanfic before OotP came out, and almost exclusively went for speculative 5th-7th year fics. There was one post-Hogwarts fic I really enjoyed (and cannot remember the name of) that was the exception to this rule. Since Sirius was my favorite character after Harry, after JKR killed him off in OotP I really liked fics involving Harry rescuing Sirius from the Veil.

Since the series finished I've also found myself avoiding canon fics due to my dissatisfaction with the Epilogue, preferring completely AU fics, or time-travel fics where Harry tries to 'do things better' the second time around.
