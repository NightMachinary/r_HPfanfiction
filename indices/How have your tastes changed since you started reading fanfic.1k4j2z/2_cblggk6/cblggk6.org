I started with HP fanfiction during the long lull between OOtP and HBP, when the fandom really started to take off. I began, like many, with canon-pairings, canon-characterizations, stuff that wasn't too far out there. Then the Indy!Harry thing took off and I rode that horse for awhile. I read a lot of time-travel, dimension-travel, a lot of AU reimaginings. I began to write in 2006 and that changed things as well as I began to first appreciate, then require good storytelling technique from the new stories I'd pick up.

Nowadays, I pretty much just want to read something that's original, that's polished, and that doesn't make me think I've read this same story already. I'm ambivalent with respect to shipping†, though I won't read slash if one of the parties is Harry (save for rare exceptions). As a hetero male who tends to identify with the eponymous character, this breaks the fourth wall for me.

I think that when you first start to read fanfiction, much like when you first start to taste wines, the world seems huge, that there are so many possibilities to try. In time, as your tastes become more refined, fewer stories appeal like they did, but the best ones are just that much better. The world of fanfiction seems much smaller, but you come to appreciate and relish the few excellent finds.

†With the exception of harems or polyamorous relationships, which, unfortunately, are almost always badly written wish-fullfillment by those whose sexual experiences don't extend far beyond their right hands and watching internet porn. After a few too many Kinsfire stories, I avoid these like the plague.
