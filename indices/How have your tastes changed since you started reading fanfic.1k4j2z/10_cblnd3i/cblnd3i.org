I started out reading the more fluffy FICA but I've started to find of the years that anything goes and I have a much more cynical view of the story, characters and world. I've stayed liking mostly Harry or Hermione centered stories that are a bit angsty and/or have them paired with some of the stories Slytherians. I've a special weakness for Harry rescued from the Dursleys by Snape adoption stories.

I couldn't stand AU and now they are some of my favorite. It's such a huge fandom that there is almost something for everyone.
