I didn't read my first fanfic until the series was complete. At that point I was mostly satisfied with how the story turned out, so what I was looking for was continuation; that is, canon compliant between DH and epilogue.

The first site I found was SIYE and went fairly crazy reading everything on it. Then I got tired of Harry/Ginny or OBHWF and redo fics where barely anything changed.

So I branched out, finding Portkey and WHOAH! After reading the first Harry/Hermione Story I realized it was how things should have ended up. I'd already thought that in the first place of course, but I knew from book one that Ginny would be his love interest eventually.

After getting tired of fluffy Harmony fics, and hurt/comfort fics where Hermione is in a semi/abusive relationship with Ron and Harry is cheating on Ginny....

I found LiraSnape and her lists of lists. I branched out into every pairing I could get my hands on (other than slash, I still can't stand it). And eventually found Harem is my favorite by far, followed by Harry/Slytherin Female (ie Daphne or Pansy).

Somewhere in there, I also found FFA and "Hope" which made my favorite female character ever Gabrielle Delacour. But there are surprisingly few of those stories, for fairly obvious reasons. Unless you are into little girls, most veela fics are H/Fleur.

Then I started writing, found I have a pretty good talent for romance...and my smut is master level. I'm not great at plots that don't involve smut...but I'm good at smut...

In any case, Harems are still my number 1, but I get tired of the same cliche's. I also enjoy crackfic from time to time, but I'm no good at writing it for longer than a chapter.
