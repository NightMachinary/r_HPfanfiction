SIYE = sink into your eyes ([[http://www.siye.co.uk][www.siye.co.uk]]) - a Harry/Ginny fansite

FFA = FanFicAuthors.net - an invite only author community, some of the greatest and best known names in HP Fanfiction

OBHWF = One Big Happy Weasley Family (also sometimes called Pumpkin Pie). Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Everyone is a Weasley in some way or another.

I haven't kept track of all the stories I've read in the last decade unfortunately. But if you go to Portkey.org (H/Hermione focused) you should find a Harmony fic pretty easily, in which both are married to canon partners, but end up together in one way or another.
