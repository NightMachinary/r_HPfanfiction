Early on, several years before the series ended, I remember my favorite fic was "I Am Lord Voldemort," by Nemesis, and that was my head canon for a long time until it was finally contradicted by HBP.

Pretty soon after starting to read fanfiction I got into slash, and was a dedicated Remus/Sirius shipper until very recently, when I just got tired of reading it.

And at various times I've alternated between Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Severus, and Hermione/Lucius, the latter two not just because I love the characters, but also because they're such a challenge to write that a certain level of skill is required even to make it feasible, and this meant that those fics tended to be better on average in my experience.

I also read an amazing Hermione/Tom fic recently, so I guess I'm getting back into the Tom Riddle fics after a 10-year break. :P

I tended to use FictionAlley a lot in the beginning, but then I've just stuck with FFN.
