I read Fanfics for more than 5 years, but only 3 of HP Fanfics. The first time time I read a HP FF i choose a random and complete, wich unfortunately I do not remember the name, and it was a mild bashing of Dumbledore and Ron. And the author explain a lot of things that happen in canon that, for me, made sense. I was thinking "why i didn't notice before?". Ever since i read some that put Dumbledore in the good guy position, but only 1 or 2 with Ron as good friend of Harry.

When Harry married Ginny in canon I was not surprise and didn't thing much of it, but afeter reding HP FF I start to think that Harry didn't married Hemione because Ron didn't have anyone else that he could have a relationship. Poor Hermione :/
