Hmm, tough call, as he's pretty much in a class by himself. I don't think anyone is as consistently original as jbern.

It's not fanfiction, but perhaps you may want to give Jim's original fiction a try.

joe6991 (Wastelands of Time, e.g.) has some similarly vast span to his stories, though he tends toward the more comically epic, whereas jbern keeps his characters more grounded, more human.

Many of the other AFC writers (nonjon, BajaB, Perspicacity, Master Slytherin, Heather Sinclair, Voice of the Nephilim, cheddartrek, etc.) explore similar themes or strive for similar levels of originality. Maybe some of their stuff?
