  Prisoners Cipher
#+end_quote

You got my hopes up that I had simply missed the story update email from fanfiction. Unfortunately, Prisoner's Cipher is not finished. There is (supposedly) one last chapter. But it is a good story.

Forests of Valbone is "finished". The author's note at the end says "So, that's the end, or at least the end of Harry's story. Like I said, there's still one more chapter to come", but its been a year since he posted that. There is also supposedly a sequel coming
