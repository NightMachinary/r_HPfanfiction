I don't know how well they fit your requirements but here you go:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1][Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«]] is an awesome fic which explores magical creatures and enchanting in more detail.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher][Prisoner's Cipher]] aside from being very well written has a very original take on Runes.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/1/Ambient][Ambient]] takes place in a sort of post-apocalyptic setting where wizards are slowly loosing their magic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][Skitterleap]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Lords of Magic]] are massively AU fics which might interest you.
