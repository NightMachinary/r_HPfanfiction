[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220][This series]] is fantastic. I don't like Harry in Slytherin fics and I don't like reading fics with Snape as a good guy in them (bc I find it hard to excuse his actions in the books). But this series makes everything very believable due to Harry's childhood circumstances so I found it extremely enjoyable and has also made me more open to reading these kinds of fics. It's quite long, but I suggest giving it a try and see how you like it.

Here's the first fic in the series (I hope the bot works): linkao3(11047995)
