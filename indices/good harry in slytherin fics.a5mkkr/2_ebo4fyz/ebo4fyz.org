I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On The Way To Greatness]] because I feel it is the most realistic Slytherin!Harry fic and it stays true to Harry's character. Harry increasingly becomes more cunning but the change in his character is written in a way that makes sense. Snape and Malfoy are also like their canon selves.
