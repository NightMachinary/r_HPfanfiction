I recently reread the first couple of books, and Harry seems plenty cunning and resourceful to me.

He frees Dobby by thinking on the spot about the whole sock & diary thing, he manages to convince Vernon Dursley that signing his Hogsmeade permission slip is in his best interest, basically by blackmailing him and saying he won't support the Dursleys' story that he's at St. Brutus School for Criminal in front of Marge... otherwise. (He messed it up later on, but still...), he uses Sirius Black to put pressure on the Dursleys so that they allow him to go to the World Cup... I'm sure there are lots of other examples too.\\
As for my favourite Harry in Slytherin fanfic, it's already been mentioned - On the Way to Greatness. The later books are really great.
