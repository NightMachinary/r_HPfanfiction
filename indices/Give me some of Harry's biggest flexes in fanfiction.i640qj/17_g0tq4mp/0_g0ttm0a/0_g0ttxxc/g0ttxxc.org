One of my favorite things about Harry's flexes in SIAT (I think Draco gets more competence porn) is that Harry does "impossible" things simply because he doesn't realize they're not supposed to be possible. I always love that particular kind of OP. It's a lot more subtle than most, and always more fun to understand what they're doing is so unusual through other characters' reactions.
