Sorry, I did notice that after I recced Sum of Their Parts. It's not /technically/ Death Eater pairings. I decided not to remove it because while Harry does become a Dark Lord, he's not a Death Eater, and he doesn't adopt Death Eaters or become in any way an associate or ally of Voldemort. He becomes an independent Dark Lord, and as such, flexes a lot of both magical and social power. Fine distinction, but it's one I make because I pretty much can't stand any premise that includes Harry teaming up with Death Eaters. Sorry if it crossed a line for you.
