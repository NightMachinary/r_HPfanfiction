The Spectre is an extreme reality warper. Basically, he can do anything.\\
to take the job, a soul must accept to be bonded with the Wrath of (God or Pantheon) and from then on, the Soul get power, while the Spectre force gains purpose.

Still, you are not far with the astral projection idea. It's just going the other way. That was where Deadman enters the frame, he is nothing but a spirit, and has the power to enter a living body and posses it for as long as he wants.\\
back to Harry, the original body is not really required for the soul/Spectre to exist.\\
In Harry's case, he returned to the Cemetery, to find his own corpse. Under the guidance of Deadman, Harry returned to his body, reanimating it.\\
at this point, the only thing that keeps the body alive is the Spectre's power.

should the connection be severed or cancelled, Harry's body will go back to being a corpse.
