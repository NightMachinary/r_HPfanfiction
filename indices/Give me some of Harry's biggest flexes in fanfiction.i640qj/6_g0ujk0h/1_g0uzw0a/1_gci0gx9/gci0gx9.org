Hi! Author here.\\
It is a bit complicated, as he is possessing his own corpse. The body is technically alive, but Harry's soul can leave it behind while he goes to work as the Spectre.

A small bit of the Spectre's power keeps the body functioning, but in a kind of coma.

At a point in his long story, Jim Corrigan existed as both Corrigan and the Spectre as separate beings, almost independent. Harry has not learned to do that.
