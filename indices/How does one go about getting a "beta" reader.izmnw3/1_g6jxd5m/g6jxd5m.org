Well, you could ask here, but that seems to get downvotes a lot.

There's a weekly beta-bartering thread in the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] sub that you could join (on Thursdays, I think, but the calendar is in their sidebar). Otherwise, there's a beta function along the top bar on FFNet (Browse, Just In, Community, Forum, Betas).

If you really want blunt feedback on what you've written, there's also the Dark Lord Potter forums. You need a profile to log-in, but they have a forum bit that lets you post your fics and ask for feedback and comments. Be warned, they can be quite brutally honest.
