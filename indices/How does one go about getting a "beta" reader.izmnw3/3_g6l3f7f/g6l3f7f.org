Ask here, but give some details on what your story is about first. Beta'ing a story you have no interest in reading is a chore. If it features a ship, go to that ship's sub or discord, they tend to be unusually enthusiastic. The hpff discord is also quite good, but again, make sure you find someone who likes what you're writing about.
