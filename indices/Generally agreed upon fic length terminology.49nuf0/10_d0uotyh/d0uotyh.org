I prefer to use epic /length/, not epic. But 100k words is nowhere near long enough for that. OoTP was like 250k words so I think it should be at least that.

I go by this guide, roughly:

Drabble: up to 500 words

Ficlet: 500-2000 words

Short story: 2000-20k words

Novella: 20-50k words

Novel: 50k+ (thinking nanowrimo for that base)

Epic length: 300k+ words (if as an individual story)
