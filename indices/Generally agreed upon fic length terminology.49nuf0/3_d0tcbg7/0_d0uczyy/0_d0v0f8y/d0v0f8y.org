NANORWRIMO is also original, not fanfic. Having done some googling, 50k is about 200 words, which seems to be borderline to me, even for original fiction. 90k words is ~360 pages, which seems more of a median length to me.

I also rarely see the term novella used outside of fanfiction. That could be due to geography or maybe it's just fading terminology. I usually just see everything referred to as a "novel" with some being prefaced with "short" or "long". For example, I'd call /Shogun/ (paperback clocks in at 1152 pages) a (very) long novel, and something like /The Physiognomy/ or /Descent Into Hell/ (244 and 222 pages, respectively) as very short novels.
