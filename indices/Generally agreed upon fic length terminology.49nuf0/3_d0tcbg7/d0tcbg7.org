I have to agree with the other few posters so far: those seem a little on the short side.

I'd bump short story to sub 25k, novella to sub90k, novel to 90k+. I don't think I've seen epic refer to length before, usually just style or content (in a literary sense anyways). Have the ficlet category cover the starting gap up to 10k. I treat the categories fairly loosely though, as I imagine most others do in fanfic.
