Is 'vignette' not a thing anymore? Or am I just old and they're called 'ficlets' now?

This is the part where I say 'back in my day', isn't it? Oh, dear, I /am/ old.... Anyway, when I first entered a couple of fandoms (not HP until a few years later), a drabble was 100 words, and a vignette was anything under 800 words or so except 100 words exactly. It was occasionally defined as a series of connected drabbles. Was this never a thing in HP fandom?

Regardless of my confusion over that, I agree with the other posters - these guidelines are pretty low. I would put novel at 50k - 150k words at least.
