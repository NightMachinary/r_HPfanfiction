I disagree on the first three. I'm from that sect of fanfic writers that insists a drabble is /exactly/ 100 words. Ficlets I tend to define as less than a 1,000, but I'm open to interpretation and I wouldn't say anything longer than 5,000. Short Stories I would stop at 20k, because that's about how much you can write in a single text (i.e. no chapter breaks) before epub generators split it up. (Semi-related: if your chapters are so long that an epub generator breaks them up, then they're too bloody long.)
