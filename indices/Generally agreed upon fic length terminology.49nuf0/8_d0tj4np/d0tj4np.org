In fanfic, there is little editing and plenty of room for extra words that are not needed. So the 100k epic is only epic if the story arc is amazing too.

My stories tend to be 50k at a minimum and I feel like those are short stories... because my larger stories are 500k plus

I'd bump these numbers:

#+begin_quote
  Drabble - up to 1,000 words

  Ficlet - less than 10,000 words

  Short Story - less than 40k

  Novella - less than 75k

  Novel - at least 75k up to 200k or so depending on if it just rambles or actually has a plot

  Epic - at least 250k words and with an actual storyline, even if its PWP it can't just be a bunch of porn scenes thrown together, it has to have at least one main arc if not a bunch of mini arcs thrown in. i wouldn't call it an epic unless it actually holds up to the scrutiny that a published original work would... though with obvious allowances for amateur editing.
