Still - I've read plenty of 100k fics that I wouldn't call epics by any means. Like, there's only one plot, not that many characters, etc. 100k is a lot shorter than it sounds.

Like when I think of fanfic epics I tend to picture works that are like 250k and still going. The kind of fic that clocks in at 1000 pages or more on my e-reader.
