It's a figure of speech. I don't think she actually fired her editor, but the latter books suffer from a severe lack of editing, and I think the reason for that is that Rowling didn't want to discuss the plot with her publishers and editor (something writers usually do), because she felt that she was such a big-time author, and that the series' fans would buy the books no matter what was in them (which is the truth).
