Fanfiction is very different from published fiction. There's a lot more dawdling, a lot more fan service, and generally more scenes that aren't essential to the story. Compare canon scenes to fanfiction scenes and you'll get what I mean - canon ones are a lot more "on point" (well, at least in the first 4, before Rowling fired her editor). A 100K words in original fiction is tantamount to, let's say, 300K words in fanfiction.
