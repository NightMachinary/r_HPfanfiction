I agree. I don't think I've seen a fic that I would call "epic" be anything under 200k, and many of them are near 300k. I've written a completely generic 4th year story that clocked in at 117k words, and there's no way anyone would ever call it epic-length. I'd probably move the "novel" tier up to 100k, and then have a "lite-novel" tier at 60 or 75K.
