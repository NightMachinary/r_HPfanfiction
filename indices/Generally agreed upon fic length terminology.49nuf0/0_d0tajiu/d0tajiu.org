Maybe it's more lax because it's fanfic, but 100,000 for an epic is a serious underestimation. I mean, I don't think anyone could call Prisoner of Azkaban an epic-length work with a straight face, and it's about 107k words.

And a novel of 40k words would be incredibly slim. Like, barely-over-a-hundred-pages-in-many-printings slim.
