The big thing I remember from this story is the Voldemort is absolutely livid about Harry's conditions because how DARE the muggles hurt his prophecised enemy, or any wizard for that matter.

Edit - Reading this again and I forgot how much of a Hermione wankfest this is. I like Hermione, but this story goes so over the top...
