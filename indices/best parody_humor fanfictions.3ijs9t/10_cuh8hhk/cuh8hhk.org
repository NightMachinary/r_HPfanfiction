One of my favourite humour fics is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again! by Sarah1281]] A little more serious (as in, less parody) but still very funny is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate by Sarah1281]] And if you don't mind incomplete stories this one is also hilarious: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the Waters and the Wild by Paimpont]]

Edit: fixed links

Edit2: And I forgot the absolute hilarious [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade by The-Caitiff]] and a slightly more serious, but still sorted as pardoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib by BajaB]]
