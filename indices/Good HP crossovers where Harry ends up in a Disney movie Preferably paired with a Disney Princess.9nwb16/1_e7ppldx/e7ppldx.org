Is a good crossover fic, that mixes with a bunch of different shows. Not sure if Lilo is considered a Disney Princess, but Harry looks after her in Hawaii, and ends up working for Five-O. Its a fun story I've read a couple times, that at some point crosses with Five-O, NCIS LA and DC, Bones, and a couple others.
