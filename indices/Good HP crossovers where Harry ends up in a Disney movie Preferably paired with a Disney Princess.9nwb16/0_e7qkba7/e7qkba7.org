I've always enjoyed the idea of a Frozen/Harry Potter crossover set in the early 1800s (technically Frozen takes place in the 1840s but there's room to manouevre). Basically instead of locking Elsa up, the King and Queen of Arendelle send her to Hogwarts where she can learn to control her powers. In so doing, Elsa would be the first royalty to attend Hogwarts in centuries, which would garner a lot of interest.

The fic would pick up in media res when Elsa is in her 6th or 7th year. She's a very powerful witch but still has problems with control, with her magic strongly tending towards making ice etc. Napoleon is on the rise and Europe is choosing sides. Suddenly Elsa, heir to a small but wealthy Kingdom and a powerful witch besides, is not just a curiosity but also politically relevant.
