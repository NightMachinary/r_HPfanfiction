FML stands for F*** My Life. Basically, "why me?"

I would think that would be his feelings about all his so-called "adventures." They weren't fun, and were usually life-threatening. Assuming he even wanted to have a perrmanent reminder of them on his body --- as if the scars weren't enough to remember them by --- I can't imagine it would be anything celebratory.

It was a toss-up between that and "Never again."
