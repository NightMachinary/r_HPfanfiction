Not really a crossover but linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) was a Handmaids Tale HP world.

Now, while this story was brilliant, very well written with a great arc and set up I do recommend it with caution. Its a Handmaids Tale story. Therefore it is veeery difficult to read a times with a lot of warnings so I wouldn't read it unless your ok with reading about enslavement and gruesome war things basically.

But it was very very good. I haven't read anything else like it and it is in my top 10. But again, mind yourself. =)
