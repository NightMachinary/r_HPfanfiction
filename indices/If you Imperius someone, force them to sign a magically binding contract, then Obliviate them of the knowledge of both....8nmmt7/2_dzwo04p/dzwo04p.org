Well, there are one or two aspect syou /have/ overlooked:

- We don't know that binding magical contracts are as dire as fanfiction makes them out to be. The worst a magical contract did on-screen was produce some embarrassing pimples. We don't /know/ what the Goblet of Fire contract would have done.

- We can't even be sure there /was/ a binding magical contract with the Goblet of Fire, which is our only point of data for non-consensual magical contracts. The one who /claimed/ that the Goblet of Fire constituted a binding magical contract was Ludo Bagman. I repeat. /Ludo Bagman/. In the general mess of the situation no one questions him, but it becomes clearer and clearer through the year that Bagman is an imbecile and a fraud, so... y'know.
