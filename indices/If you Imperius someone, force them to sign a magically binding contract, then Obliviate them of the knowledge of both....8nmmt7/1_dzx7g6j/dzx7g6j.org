Not exactly canon-compatible, but I had the notion that magical contracts require consent at some level. If so, then a person commanded under Imperius to sign a contract would be binding the person who cast the Imperius into the bargain, since they're currently taking responsibility for the Imperiused person's actions.

There are probably ways to game this to an advantage, but the rules are approaching a Fizzbin level of arbitrariness. ['...except on Tuesday']
