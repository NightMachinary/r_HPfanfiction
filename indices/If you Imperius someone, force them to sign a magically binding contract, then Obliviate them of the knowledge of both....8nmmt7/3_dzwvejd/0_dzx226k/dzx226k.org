Yes, but the Goblet of Fire had to be created somehow, right? So what would stop Voldemort from creating his own high-powered magical artifact for magically-binding-contract-making purposes?

That could be a plot point, really; with all of these people unwillingly enslaved by binding contracts, it might fall upon some of the few free remaining people to find and destroy the enchanted coffer where Voldemort keeps all of his enthralled victim's signatures/blood samples/etc.
