  what would stop Voldemort from creating his own high-powered magical artifact for magically-binding-contract-making purposes?
#+end_quote

The same thing that stopped Dumbledore from making a true replica of Gryffindor's sword: not even the greatest wizards can replicate any powerful artifact they desire. Lots of examples of this: the Hallows, Gryffindor's sword, the other Founder artifacts, the Philosopher's Stone, etc. If it were that simple, any above average wizard would do it.

Besides, even the Goblet had limits. It didn't enslave Harry, much less force him to do something indefinitely. Contracts will always have limits and total, forced obedience appears to solely be the domain of the Imperius, and even then it can be fought off. And I suspect being Obliviated would end most contracts that attempted to be forced in that way.
