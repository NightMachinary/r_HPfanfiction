interesting idea. the fic Im writing is one that started off in the wrong bwl vein with a dead James doing the sacrifice and a surviving, spared lily, but when I was writing it I realised how unlikely it would actually be that the wizarding world would think that a baby defeated voldemort when lily was still alive. so I ended up having everybody assume lily was some super powerful vanquisher of voldemort and given that my fic lily got whacked in the head during the attack and didn't remember what happened just enabled that assumption. I always got the idea that in canon dumbledore never dramatically announced Harry was the bwl or anything, just that lily, James and voldy died and Harry survived, and the public (mostly correctly) assumed that it was Harry that did it.
