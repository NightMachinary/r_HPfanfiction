What about if Harry was born on either the 7th or 31st of July 1977 and his sibling was born 31st July 1980. Lily and James were away at an emergency order meeting and Peter was left to look after the kids because he is the secret keeper but he lets Voldemort in and runs away so he doesn't see anything. Harry is woken up to taking down stairs and think his parents are home so he starts to go Dow until he actually sees who it is so he races up to the nursery and when Voldemort comes he refuses to move so he is hit with the killing curse leaving his sibling with protection but it turns out Harry is the predestined MoD so he lives but when he wakes up he is either buried in a coffin and accidentally apostates somewhere, or something else. Or he might be raised in deaths kingdom or something. But there is no bashing of Lily and James cause I'm quite fond of them. And Lily and James fight with the Daily Profit to have Harry named as the defeater of Voldemort instead of his sibling because they watch their memory and see Harry refusing to move and getting killed, leaving (...) protection.
