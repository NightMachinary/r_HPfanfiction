I just had a silly thought; 'wrong boy who lived', in the sense that there's a mixup at St. Mungos and James & Lily come home with the wrong child.\\
When a newborn Metamorphmagus happens across Harry Potter in the maternity ward, he thinks nothing of mimicking the newborn child, inadvertently causing a mix-up when the Metamorphmagus is mistaken for Harry and vice-versa.\\
The Potters and the...oh, let's say, Noel and Rennie Kelp, go home with (who they think are) their respective children...after a few months, though, the Kelps realise that the child they've brought home isn't their own after all, and after a bit of research, find out that they're raising none other than Harry Potter.\\
They try to locate James & Lily, but with the Fidelius up, most of the Order of the Phoenix in hiding, and the Death Eaters on the prowl, they have little luck...until that fateful night when Voldemort is destroyed by Lily's sacrifice.\\
With half of magical Britain singing the praises of Harry Potter and the other half seeking to avenge Voldemort, the Kelps quietly decide to keep their child's true heritage to themselves, even as the Metamorphmagus changeling is brought to the Dursleys by Dumbledore...

Ten years later, the two children come to Hogwarts, causing much confusion. There's a boy with James's looks but Lily's eyes, raised in the wizarding world, but claims not to be Harry Potter. And a shapeshifting Metamorphmagus, raised-but-neglected by muggles, who claims to be Harry but doesn't look anything of the sort (except when he does).
