In my personal, subjective opinion, a "Light Lord" is a bad thing not through itself, but because of what it takes to make one, same as 'Hero" and "Messiah".

To make a Hero, there must be disaster.

To make a Messiah, many must be facing damnation.

To make a Light Lord, people would need to lose the Gift of Eden, be lost, undecided, herds of sheep unable to determine their path, trying to lay their burdens and moral dilemmas on the back of one individual to then follow.

Of course, this is assuming that "Light is Good", and thus a Light Lord/Lady will not make a bid for power unneeded - that is what we can a Dark Lord XD

TLDR: I hate the idea of a Saint, because the opportunity for saintly deeds is an evidence of a fucked up world and/or bad writing.
