Sounds kind of like the plot of [[https://sshgreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/sgcbearcub-spellcaster.pdf][Sanctuary by sgcbearcub]] where Dumbledore sets her up to be the next Lord of Light with a reliance on muggle scientific thought, etc. Etc.

Should note that this is Hermione/Snape because of a marriage law, but there's not really much romance. It circles back to the plot- she marries Snape for revenge and because they think he might have something that they need.
