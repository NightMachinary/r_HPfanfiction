The only way to pull off an OP harry story that I can think of is that if he is *not* the main character. He shows up already powerful in the story with some motivation beyond what is shown in canon.

In fact, I can think of what I find to be a great example of exactly what you described in this fic linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB).

I won't spoil too much, but in the FIRST CHAPTER, Harry defeats almost all the staff at Hogwarts, a contingent of aurors, and most of the older Hogwarts students. He duels Dumbledore on nearly equal footing on several occasions (Harry is like 80% where Dumbledore is 100%). He uses incredible magics that I can barely articulate properly because of the beautiful descriptions, but some examples include: creating a black hole that sucks out the flames from fireplaces to stop flooing away, summons blades that seem to tear through the dimension, inverts the gravity in an entire room, and creates centipedes of liquid mercury. Seriously, this is a great example as I see it of what you are looking for.

Hope this helps.
