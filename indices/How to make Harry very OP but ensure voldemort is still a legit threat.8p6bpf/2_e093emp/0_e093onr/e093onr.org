I know that. That is why I am asking how I can make Harry op but make sure voldemort is still a legit threat. You could be on to something here. I will have Harry only know common stuff he found on the Hogwarts library and have him cast them at a op level. Voldemort will use exceptional level and constantly cast magic for which he has no counter. That could work.
