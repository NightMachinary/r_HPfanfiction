Glad you enjoyed it! Feel absolutely free to use this if you want to take a shot at writing anything from this.

I really love worldbuilding in fanfiction by scaling up one person, and then walking through the game theory of how it would change everything else. Here, the rules of engagement change because the assumption is that Voldemort will be inside your mind. And to expand further, Voldemort will get absolutely blindsided by Snape's betrayal, his entire paradigm is that he knows everything his subordinates know with absolute certainty. Similarly, Dumbledore can be outmaneuvered by increasing the complexity of the conflict to the point where he has to know too much to make the right decision, giving up the entire war effort. The ideal counter to Voldemort then becomes a small group of highly skilled improvisers souped up on Felix Felics (and/or any other available means of increasing luck), trained to reduce the time of each mental decision to maximize the luck potion.
