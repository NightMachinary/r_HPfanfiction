Brilliant idea building on this. Dumbledore knows the implications of this, and uses his pensive to store memories that would be dangerous for the dark lord to find out, possibly even implant fake ones. Cold war spycraft levels of standard protocols and procedures, letting him be combat capable without necessarily knowing anything more than what he needs to win the day. Voldemort not only can't beat him, he can't learn anything from fighting him, hence the constant avoidance. It would also explain the casual insanity and spontaneity.
