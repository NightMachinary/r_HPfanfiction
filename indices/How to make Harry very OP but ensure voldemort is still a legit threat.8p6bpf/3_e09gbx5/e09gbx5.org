Voldemort, in canon (or fanon, I forget sometimes), is supposed to be an incredibly powerful Legilimens, so much so that Snape being able to fool the Dark Lord is considered evidence of him being an incredibly skilled Occlumens. One of my personal pet peeves regarding the original seven films is how little they explored mind magic (despite stating the Voldemort was a world class Legilimens), and one of the main reasons I like the new films is because of Queenie, and how they use her to explore what being a powerful Legilimens would mean.

So I would love if your fic made Voldemort threatening, by really exploring what Voldemort's innate mastery of mind reading means.

Queenie, in the new film, is a mind reader, capable of easily and effortlessly hearing the thoughts of others. Voldemort should, at least, be able to do this, and much, much more. Make mind magic more central to his character. Grindlewalt became a Dark Lord because of his power, and because the Elder Wand only amplified that. Voldemort, starting out, didn't have an Elder Wand to make him unbeatable. Make the reason Voldemort is such a terrifying foe be his mind magic, and you have a way to have him reasonably threaten Harry without actually giving him a straight forward 'power up'. There's already so many 'psychic' spells in canon that a Dark Lord with a talent for using them would already be pretty terrifying.

Harry wants to use an incredibly powerful spell he knows? Voldemort is reading his mind, and manages to hit him with a tactical Obliviate so small and targeted it slips past his shields, deleting the wording of the spell from his memory. Harry is taking aim to snipe Voldemort from the shadows? Nope, can't be done, Voldemort can hear your thoughts and knows where you are. His organization can't be spied on (with the exception of Snape, who becomes even more valuable to the Order, letting him get away with being even more of a asshole). Voldemort is an expert of intimidation, persuasion, and torture. Duel Voldemort for too long, and he leaves knowing all of your secrets, long term plans, etc...

Essentially, make Voldemort threatening to an OP Harry, by making him more specialized in mind magic. Make him the Dark Lord that was so obsessed with the Elder Wand because he actually needed it to expand his power in other areas.

And this way a four way fight between Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindlewalt and Harry could be more interesting, because Voldemort would fight in a way unique to him, instead of just blasting supercharged spells everywhere like the rest.
