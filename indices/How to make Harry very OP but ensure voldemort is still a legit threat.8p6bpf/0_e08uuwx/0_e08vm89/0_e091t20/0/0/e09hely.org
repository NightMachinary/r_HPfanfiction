I don't mean on that level I mean have Harry obsessed with getting more like how he was in book 6 but with actual results but that is what he does every spare moment it should be portrayed as unhealthy and when people try to help him he should react badly.

This isn't about making Voldemort more threatening it is about making the story more interesting first. You make Voldemort interesting by have Harry use power as a crutch while Voldemort finds ways to go after vulnerable friends or trap an overconfident Harry.
