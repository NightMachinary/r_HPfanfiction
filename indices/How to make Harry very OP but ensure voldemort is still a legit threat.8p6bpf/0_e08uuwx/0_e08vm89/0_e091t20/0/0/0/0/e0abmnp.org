Again Harry would not be portrayed as going through magic special forces training he would spend his time learning dangerous dark magic and using rituals to boost his power. And we should see the consequences of that as Harry sleeps less, gets increasingly short with his friends, and in class Harry bypasses skill and technique in favor of just forcing his magic to accomplish the task. And then to drive the point home one of his friends should be kidnapped and Harry gets to come to the realization that he missed the signs leading up to it, didn't even realize it happened until much later, and when he goes to save the kidnapped victim he ends up exhausting himself because he has been relying on pure strength and not honing his skill and technique.
