Point 2 seems like a silly token to me. Having his GF dump him for trying to kill magical Hitler seems petty. "Oh, you saved the world. But what have you done for me lately?"

And having more teenage drama doesn't make Voldemort a more credible threat. If anything it makes him appear weaker because we've got time for such trivialities (instead of Voldemort's latest murder spree).
