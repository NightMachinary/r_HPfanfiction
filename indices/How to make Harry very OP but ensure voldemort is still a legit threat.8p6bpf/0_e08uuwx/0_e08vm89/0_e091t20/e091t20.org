How to handle this:

1. Make Harry suffer ie make him getting that powerful take effort and sacrifice maybe have him stumble on a book of rituals in the Black Library which making him better able to hold his own vs his enemies but that power doesn't come without a cost. Have it start small like he gives his ability to feel a negative emotion like envy or anger but it isn't enough so he starts sacrificing his more vital and positive emotions like joy, empathy, love, happiness.
2. Make Harry suffer more. Put him in a relationship and then break them up because he spends all his time training and makes no time to be with his partner and do things they enjoy.
3. Make Harry be wrong have him attack someone he shouldn't be over the top about it and suffer for it. JKR tried to do this in book 6 but it failed because we knew that Draco was up to no good. Instead have him attack someone more sympathetic because he thinks they are helping his enemies but he is wrong. This will then allow the story to go one of two ways Harry gets help and realizes that power isn't everything or he pushes everyone away burns his last bridges and the Wizarding world along with them.
