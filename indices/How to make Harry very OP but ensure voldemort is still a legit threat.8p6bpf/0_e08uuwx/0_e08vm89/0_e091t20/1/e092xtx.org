  Make Harry suffer ie make him getting that powerful take effort and sacrifice maybe have him stumble on a book of rituals in the Black Library which making him better able to hold his own vs his enemies but that power doesn't come without a cost

I don't think this works, it opens up questions like "Why didn't the Black family do this?" The house of Black were very arrogant and seemed prone to madness; if they could chunk emotions to gain power they'd have already done so and ruled Wizarding UK before Voldemort was conceived.
