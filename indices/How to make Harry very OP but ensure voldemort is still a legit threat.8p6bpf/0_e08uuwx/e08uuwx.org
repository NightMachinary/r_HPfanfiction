You can't. Those of Voldemort and Dumbledore's level can fight off tons of Wizards with little effort, but all the Death Eaters and the entire Auror force is just silly for Harry, even when OP. Especially if Amelia Bones counts (head of DMLE), who in canon was powerful enough that Voldemort had to "expend considerable effort" to kill her.

If Harry is already at this level, it cannot be done without doing some idiot ball stuff, i.e. bad writing. He'd be on their level, there's no room to grow without being silly. At that point, all you could do is make Voldemort even stronger than in canon, which defeats the point of making Harry so OP.

My suggestion (if giving it isn't out of place) is to just weaken Harry. I don't know anything about your story but having him OP (unless it's the story premise) seems boring. If you make him generously strong (near Bellatrix's level; she's very powerful) then at least there's real room to grow as opposed to "my magical core got a boost!"
