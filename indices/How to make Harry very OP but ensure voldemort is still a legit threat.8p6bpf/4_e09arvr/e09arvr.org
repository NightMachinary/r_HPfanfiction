Well...let Voldemort use Felix Felicis? Or let him foresee attacks, Jedi-style? Or let him have a secret Haste spell that lets him react and cast spells much faster? Any of those would make Voldemort much better at countering any spells Harry might use.

Or, he could be completely emotionless (heh, soulless), not feeling panic or doubt, not being disturbed in the slightest by an ambush, not pausing to consider if a certain spell is a good idea, and otherwise never letting up due to indecision, second-guessing himself, or concern for collateral damage.

Or the other way around, make him completely psycho, emotionally volatile; uncontrolled magic explodes out of him after every spell, magnifying his curses, sowing chaos upon the battlefield, and his rage gives rise to completely unpredictable magical effects.

Another possibility; give Voldemort a signature spell that he's an absolute monster with. Maybe his Avada Kedavra can pierce physical barriers and curve to hit living creatures, so that the Dark Lord can announce himself by firing a killing curse straight through Hogwarts. Maybe he can conjure up a freezing blizzard, turning any battle with him into a natural disaster. Or maybe Serpensortia, conjuring and transfiguring snakes from everything in his vicinity, transfiguring opposing Aurors into giant serpents that turn on their allies.
