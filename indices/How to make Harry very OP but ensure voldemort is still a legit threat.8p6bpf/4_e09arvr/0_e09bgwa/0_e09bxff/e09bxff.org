Well, to be fair we don't see much of Voldemort's capabilities in canon. In the graveyard he's only toying with Harry, and in most of his other encounters with Harry he only tosses one killing curse.

...Although, I suppose there's the /entire army/ of Inferi he raised to guard his locket, and his duel with Dumbledore which involved him creating silver shields that can deflect who-knows-what and transfiguring animated fire...

...There's an idea! Build on that scene from OotP where Voldemort transfigures Dumbledore's fire whip into a fire snake; launch incendios and fiendfyre to turn the place into a flaming inferno, then animate the flames into swooping birds, striking snakes and clawed monsters! Combine it with possession attacks like he used on Harry (and Quirrell) to turn foes/innocents into human shields, Imperius curses to turn enemies against each other, and killing curses to finish opponents cornered by his fire creations!
