I totally agree. I searched for slimy. The only times Ron calls someone "slimy" in the whole series is when Malfoy and his family behaved like arrogant snobs at the Worldcup. And really - they deserved that. He doesn't once call Snape or the other Slytherins that while in fandom it seems Rons favorite swear word.
