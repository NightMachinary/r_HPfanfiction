searched Dumbledore, Lemon Drops, and his eating or offering of them, were mentioned in the first book.

Ron mentioned "slimy gits" once, about Slytherins, in Goblet of Fire.

Those two tropes are seriously, overblown in fanfiction

Gred and Forge is mentioned once, in the books, and overblown in fanfictions.

Mudblood, is mentioned an awful lot, especially as the series gets more mature, but overall, I'd say that fanfiction also overblows the word, as well.

Didn't find the: "You can't be serious", "I am sirius" joke at all, in it. So that's just a fanfiction thing, in general.

Golden Trio, was also apparently not mentioned, at all.

Marauders Map, was mentioned, however, the "group" was mentioned by Ron, once. So I think the Marauders was meant for the map, and not the actual group. But people just decided to name them that.
