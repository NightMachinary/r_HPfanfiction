It's been fun to search the canon text to see how some fanfiction tropes compare to the original, eg:

- "Greater good" Dumbledore - turns out, all the occurrences of the phrase "greater good" are in DH, and are either directly related to Dumbledore's past w/ Grindelwald and not the present, or are Aberforth still being upset about said past
- Lemon drop addict Dumbledore - not true, Dumbledore appears to only once offer a lemon drop to someone. Other occurrences are when they are (or were) the password for his office.
- Harry my boy, my boy Harry, my boy, etc... - Said by Wood (after they win a Quidditch match), Trelawney, and Hagrid. Never Dumbledore. At least, never with the two words adjacent to each other like that.
