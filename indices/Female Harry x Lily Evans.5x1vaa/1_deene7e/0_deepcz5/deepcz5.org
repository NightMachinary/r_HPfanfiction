I got a laugh out of [[https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/814936463649292288][this dev response]] to someone asking if you can romance your twin in Mass Effect: Andromeda.

Personally I wouldn't have a problem with it, but it's not going to happen. Hideous amounts of violence in video games has a market, incest not so much. Save it for the niche fanfiction I guess.
