  Honestly it had been her desire to impress the strangely beautiful little blonde Ravenclaw that had been a good percentage of what had led her here tonight. Sure there was certainly some concern for her supposedly captured god father but most of it was a hormone driven need to get in Luna's pants. She suspected that Sirius would approve whole heartedly of her less than pure motivations in this regard.
