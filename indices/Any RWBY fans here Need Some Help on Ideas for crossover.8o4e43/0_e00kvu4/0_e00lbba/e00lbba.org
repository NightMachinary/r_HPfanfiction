that could be a cool idea. I actually sort of like the gun casting idea. Any ideas on what kind of gun? And how it would transform. I originally was thinking of him getting the goblins to somehow help with it's construction before he goes to Remnant but I was leery of the doing the whole "nice goblins" trope and was trying to figure out how he'd get them to help. I guess he could just buy their services but they'd expect the weapon back after Harry died, though if he's in another universe I guess they'd be screwed on that. lol. I wasn't sure if Goblins would have enough tech to make a trasnforming weapon either, unless they just forge the blade.

I was also considering some kind of staff/lance thing but wasn't sure about that.

I was also considering maybe making it, so at least he has a weakness with his semblance, that if he tried to phase something through aura and turn back solid it would hurt him but idk. I haven't decided on that and just drop it.
