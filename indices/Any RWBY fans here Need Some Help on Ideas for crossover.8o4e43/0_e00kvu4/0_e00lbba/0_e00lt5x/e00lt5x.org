Make it a weaker Kamui. He can phase through attacks but it costs aura, so it would only last a few minutes at most. So even if Cinder Fall blasts him with more fire than he can dodge or apparate away from in time, he can phase it, but it tanks his Aura pretty fast. That's both fair and balanced. Even if you made it unable to phase through Aura, it'd still let him 1shot every Grimm with your idea.

Let him buy the Materials from the Goblins and craft it himself. Goblin Steel is better than RWBY Metal. You could have the Weapon absorb dust, and keep all of the dust propertie.

As for the type of Gun and how it transforms... That I'm unsure on. To get a Sword length it'd have to be some kind of Rifle or Shotgun. Magical AK47?
