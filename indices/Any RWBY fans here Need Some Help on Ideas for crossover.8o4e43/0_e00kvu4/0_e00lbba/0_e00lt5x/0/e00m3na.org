That seems like a good idea, will probably do something like that. That might also work (the buying the steel bit). As for the gun, I'm sort of partial to a smaller gun, like a hand gun of somekind, but I don't know how that would transform unto a sword, unless the blade could like extend out and fold up. Idk.
