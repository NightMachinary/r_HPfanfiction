Guncasting. That way you get both Bullets, and spells. like a Gunmage from Final Fantasy, actively shoot out the spells, but it also gives him the option for Dust Ammo. Hybrid with a Sword form, british style long/broadsword (like the Sword of Gryffindor, or actually the Sword of Gryffindor used in the construction if you want to go that route) When you say Intangibility do you mean more like Kamui? Active Shadowcat Phasing would be OP AF, he could phase his Sword partially into Grimm and ignore their armour, and he wouldn't be able to offensively use his semblance in Combat Class or it'd bypass Aura and kill people (as much as that should happen to Cardin)
