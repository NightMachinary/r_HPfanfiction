To start i would like to say that i Love your stories. Harry's weapon is not that important since magic will be how he makes himselft important to the plot and if you are writing him whitout formal training would no make much sence having a complex weapon, unlike your weiss\cimder\hp fic. I would suggest a one handed\wand comb with a shotgun module for short range.

You could make his semblance Luck xD
