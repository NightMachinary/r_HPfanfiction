Go with Gryffindor's Sword. It's gun form could be having the sword's blade separate in half vertically and he can cast just a couple of offensive spells out the opening (Stunning Spell, maybe Disarming Charm). Since the sword is essentially unbreakable and is enchanted to automatically add to itself the properties of any stronger substance it touches, it'd be pretty great.

Maybe instead of intangibility you could make Harry's semblance work off of the sacrificial enchantment Lily left in his blood. He could temporarily select one single opponent to become immune to damage from due to a selective magical barrier. That one person cannot harm him by any means while in effect. But as a side effect, Harry cannot attack that person while the barrier is up as a trade off (the barrier would block any attack intended to target that other person). This, of course, means others besides that one person could still attack him and he could still attack them.
