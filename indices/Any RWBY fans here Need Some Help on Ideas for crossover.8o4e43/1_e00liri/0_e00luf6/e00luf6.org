That's an interesting idea. Thanks. And thank you as well for the compliment. I'm glad you've enjoyed my other ideas. This new one came to me a while ago and hasn't been leaving me alone so I started writing it. It's different from my others since it starts at the beginning of Deathly Hallows and the end of volume 3 of RWBY. It will have a RWBY character ending up on Earth for a while and eventually involve Harry going to Remnant.
