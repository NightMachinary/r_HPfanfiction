I'm a RWBY novice, so I don't know /that/ much about the kinds of weapons in the show (I've only watched a little over half of volume 1). But, I've always viewed Harry as someone who will try to hold back against an opponent until he is given no other option but to attack. So, I feel like some sort of shield that is charmed with all sorts of "battle charms" (or something like that) could be cool. And, because this is Harry Potter we're talking about, I'm sure he could learn how to turn a shield into a fine offensive weapon when needed. Hope that helps.

I really have enjoyed your crossovers (and your other fics too) so I'm anxious to see what you come up with.
