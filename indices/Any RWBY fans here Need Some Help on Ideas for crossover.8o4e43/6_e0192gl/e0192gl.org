If you are at all familiar with the dark souls series, you could always go for something more like the Farron flash sword. Rather then carry a traditional blade, harry could instead have some sort of casing/device he could pop his wand into, and uses it to project a blade of pure magic. you could also make it so he could manipulate the length/width/shape of the blade, based upon how much magic he is pushing thought it at the time.

As for the gun, idk. I kinda think it would be cool to have some sort of enchanted gauntlet or made up spell or whatever that could be used to summon an endless stream of metal flechettes or something. If you wanna keep him balanced, giving him Dust weaponry seems a tad overkill to me.
