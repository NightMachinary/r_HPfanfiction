I've actually been keeping a lookout for HPxWorm for a long time and... there's a surprising lack of them. I want a clear cut MOD!Happy-arrives-in-Wormverse-and-handles-shit, but nope, still haven't found it.

The one I've read most recently is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/yer-a-witch-taylor-worm-hp.340965/][Yer a Witch, Taylor!]], where Taylor manifests the ability to use HP spells (HP is an actual book series in there and the scenes of everyone having to rely on Vista's book knowledge is cute). IIRC, I think there's a weird SSxRune pairing in there or something, which was extremely strange to me, but the fic does have its good moments.
