Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind might count. Voldemort only appears in a flashback, but it's the final battle against him that kicks off the plot.

The Battle of Hogwarts doesn't happen in this AU; instead Harry, Ron and Hermione fight and defeat Voldemort outside Hogwarts... but somehow, defeating Voldemort ends up giving them all amnesia and they forget everything related to magic and the wizarding world. Harry and Hermione only remember their Muggle lives, and Ron vaguely recalls that his name is Ron, nothing else.

The plot is not only about the three coping with their weird amnesia, it's also about the Order of the Phoenix trying to find Harry and Ron, who have vanished since Harry can't go back to the Dursleys and Ron has no idea who he is... and of course, it also becomes a question of finding out exactly what happened to make them lose their memories and how to undo it.
