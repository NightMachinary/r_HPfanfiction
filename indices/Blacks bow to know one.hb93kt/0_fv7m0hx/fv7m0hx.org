There's linkffn(Growing Up Black) by Elvendork Nigellus.

I'm also writing a fic where the Blacks try to usurp Voldemort as the ruler of the Great Britain, but I haven't written it to that part yet. Would you also be interested in that story? (Right now it's still at the worldbuilding arc and the mystery arc)
