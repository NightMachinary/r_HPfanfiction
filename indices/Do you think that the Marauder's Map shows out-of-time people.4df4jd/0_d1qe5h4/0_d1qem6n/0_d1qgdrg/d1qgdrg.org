Plus, Harry doesn't know the names of everyone in Fred and George's year. It's likely they don't know all the boys in Harry's year either, and might've just assumed Peter's another student; plus furniture doesn't show up, I don't think - they could assume Ron and Peter are two dormmates just chatting.

As well, Fred and George have the whole map memorised by PoA, and they even told Harry they don't really use it anymore - because they only ever cared to see the secret passages, and avoid teachers.
