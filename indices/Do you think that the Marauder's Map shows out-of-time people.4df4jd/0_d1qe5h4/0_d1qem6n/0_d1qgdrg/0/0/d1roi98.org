They probably didn't know exactly how many boys are in Ron's dorm. Honestly, I wouldn't care to know stats like that for my little brother's class. Also, there were many /many/ war heroes besides Pettigrew, and most 13-15 year olds don't know the names of all of them. Their parents weren't in the original Order, so they probably didn't personally know or mention any war heroes beyond Fabian and Gideon. It's highly unlikely they'd know who Pettigrew was before Sirius' escape (I can't even recall if the article about him mentioned the name of the wizard he killed), when other students (including the very well-read Hermione, and Ron and Ginny Weasley) didn't know about the Longbottoms, who were /also/ war heroes.
