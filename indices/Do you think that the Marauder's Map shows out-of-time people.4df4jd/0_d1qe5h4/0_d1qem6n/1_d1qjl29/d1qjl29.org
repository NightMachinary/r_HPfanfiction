It wouldn't actually be all that much. Lets say that 5 boys and 5 girls is average for a year per house. Then you'd deal with 70 people overall. Thats /nothing/ for a school. And the twins use the map for an entire year and then some. Eventually they would notice a war hero - Order of Merlin First Class - that people believe dead.

It simply is one of the biggest plotholes in the entire franchise.
