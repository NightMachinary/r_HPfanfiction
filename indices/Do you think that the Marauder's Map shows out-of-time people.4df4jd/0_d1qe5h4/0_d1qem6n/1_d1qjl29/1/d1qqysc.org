We don't know that there are only x students. Even in Harry's Year, we hear about 40 and we can suppositionally expect that older years are going to be fuller due to death rates, fleeing the war, and birth control during war time. Those forty are the only named students in his year, there could be more.

Plus, if the school has 1000 students approximately, we CAN accept that they're fairly 50/50 boy/girl as that's the breakdown everywhere except china.

But ignoring the possibility of more in Harry's year, we fall back to 1000 and 50%. If we follow the logic she used, each house gets a roughly equal division--which doesn't really make sense--that means there are 125 boys stacked in seven dorms. Likely, second and third year are smaller as well since they would have been born at the height of the events in the seventies. So fourth through seventh are probably the most populous students.

Also, the map shows everything on one level, doesn't it? If there's no differentiation between floors it becomes more of a proximity alert device than a true map.
