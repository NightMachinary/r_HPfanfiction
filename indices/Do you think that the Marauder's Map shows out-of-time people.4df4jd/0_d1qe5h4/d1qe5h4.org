Hell, no one noticed peter pettigrew despite the map clearly displaying him for Harry while in his animagus form. His brothers never wondered "Hey, why's a bloke keep sleeping with Ron, is he a poofter?" No teasing about it or anything- I can't see the twins seeing anything like that out of bounds.

I think things like this have an easier explanation, they just didn't notice.

Way I see it, Lupin was just casually glancing at the map for signs of Sirus black, and when he saw him, he immediately left, not considering anything else, not looking for more- because Sirus black being near Harry potter was enough to forsake everything else, including Wolfbane potion. Hell, maybe he even skimmed over the names and those were ignored as "Not Sirus black, not important"

As for Hermione... Well, I figure a time traveler- and how irresponsible is that- allowing a teen to hold position of one of the only dozen or so time turners presumably to take extra classes instead of moving classes to non conflicting times, putting a foot down on her taking every class or offering her a self study option? But anyway, presumably they told the teachers that a student has an object like that- considering it's potential in pranking and rule breaking, even if it is Hermione, they'd presumably alert the other teachers about it.

So, TLTR: Yes, but the teachers including Lupin knew, and hermonie was careful to only use the time turner for class and just for class so Harry never had the chance to see it on the map.
