I think there's an appeal to having them all standardized - that is, the same way noble titles were somewhat standardized IRL, it would make some sense for all of them to use similar addresses (eg: 'Most Ancient and Noble' vs 'Ancient and Noble' vs 'Noble' would make sense at keeping it all in the same style). The address used by the Black family is also applicable to both light and dark houses - so it strikes me more as something that anyone would be able to use instead of just the dark magic houses.

Your method would work, for sure - but speaking personally, I think I'd struggle to take it all too seriously if every house pops in with some new - and increasingly contrived - moniker. I think I'd find it more fitting for them to vary their house mottos, instead, to show off their peculiarities.
