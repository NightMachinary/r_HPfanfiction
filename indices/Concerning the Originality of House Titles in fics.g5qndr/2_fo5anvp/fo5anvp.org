I always assumed only Noble and Most Ancient were used for pure-blood families because they referenced their statuses pre-Statute of Secrecy. A family that was made Noble, say, in the fifteenth-century or before, would be called 'Noble and Most Ancient House of X' but if the family was ennobled after that set date they would only be called 'Noble House of X'. That way, you can distinguish the aristocracy from the rabbles and even in the aristocracy, you can distinguish the more senior and affluent families from the junior ones.

Most, if not all fanfics using this trope, will use only one title, and that is Lord/Lady. There is no Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Baron hierarchy, so people use that distinction. As I said before, these descriptives wouldn't be used to describe the people who make the Houses themselves, but the Houses' status in the wizarding world.

Although, I think you're hitting something with 'The Venerable House of Bones'. It's not that exactly, but the lower Lords of the House of Lords are called the Honourable X and I think it would be great to add 'The Honourable House of X' to the wizarding aristocracy of Great Britain. Noble and Most Ancient would equivalate to Dukes and Marquesses, so like Black, Malfoy, Greengrass, Longbottom; Noble would be Earls and Viscounts, so Nott, Smith, Fawley, Selwyn, Potter (if you want to make them nobles), Lestrange; Honourable would be Barons and lower so Bones, Abbott, Parkinson, etc.

In the end, I think your idea is good in its essence, but the varying descriptives seems more Medieval than Early Modern, which is when, IMO, these kinds of things and the general fleshing out of 'pure-blood culture' would have happened.
