I think it's more that all her "reveals" are negative statements. So you ask something, and she says "no". At least metaphorically.

So instead of broadening her world, like making an open-ended mockup of a herbology book with "might not contain all species" at the start, she decides to go the opposite route and "clarify" that things are more umbrella-like than people had assumed.

- Instead of wizards being inspired by roman architecture, they canonically shit themselves.

- Instead of there being whacky names for all the families, they all use a dumb, standardized, boring moniker.

It goes on like this. She "clarifies" things, and instead of writing new material to fill the hole of potential she just erased, she does nothing, chipping away at the things canon implied bit by bit by bit.
