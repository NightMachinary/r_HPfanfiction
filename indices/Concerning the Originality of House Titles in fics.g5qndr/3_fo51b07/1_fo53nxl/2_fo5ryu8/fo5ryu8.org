JKR's magic system is extremely soft, and her worldbuilding is very contained around Harry and his perspective. The first part is what makes it such a wonder inspiring series to read as a kid and the 2nd part helps you see from Harry's eyes, since you learn about things like penseives and Floo travel when he does. But once you're older and expose yourself to series with incredible, detailed worldbuilding and intricate magic systems the WW comes across as very shallow.
