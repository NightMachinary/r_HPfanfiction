It's fortunate that in fanfiction, you're free to ignore what JKR says about the series, otherwise we'd be stuck with wizards just shitting themselves. As far as I'm concerned only things explicitly said in the 7 books are canon, the movies are their own separate canon and the things JKR says on twitter, in interviews, or pottermore are her headcanon.
