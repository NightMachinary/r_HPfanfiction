The less revealed it is, the more you fill in the gaps with your own thoughts. Obviously the more that gets set into canon, that'll fit less well with how you imagine it and it's disappointing.

Harry Potter never had /great/ worldbuilding - the main thing it did very well was create a world very similar to ours but with some twists that made the reader interested/find it a strange/charming, but recognizable, world.
