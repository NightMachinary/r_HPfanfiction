The only person who calls himself a Lord in canon is Voldemort. It seems he picked a title that wasn't well-known to wizards to make himself sound more mysterious.

JKR posted extra info on the Malfoys saying they actually are descendants of people who had muggle titles, and they could use a muggle nobility title if they wanted to. They don't in canon because they would not want to be associated with muggles.

Sirius uses the phrase "most ancient and noble" as a sarcastic joke, doesn't he? His parents thought very highly of themselves and he liked to make fun of them for it. The family motto toujours pur is canon, and it's possible other old families had similar mottos.

The sacred twenty eight list was written anonymously and doesn't seem to be widely respected or even widely known of in canon. Anyone becomes a pureblood if all four grandparents are magical in canon.

Fanon can of course do what it wants with lordships, but the point for it in canon is that Voldemort is the only one with that title. Wizards make up their own titles, like supreme mugwump and the like.
