That /was/ normal, certainly. In the US, with wages dropping in relation to housing costs and rising unemployment, it's becoming less common. I understand the same thing is happening in the UK.

It's also a question of whether your parents live in a place where you would easily be able to get work. Floo and Apparition makes this mostly a moot point, but if I had chosen to stay in my home town living with a parent, I would have needed to drive three hours a day for work, and I would have had a lot of trouble finding positions.
