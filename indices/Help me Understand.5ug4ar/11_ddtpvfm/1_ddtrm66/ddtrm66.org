Honestly there's a generational thing going on here. Rowling was born in 1964/5? She's the same age as me. When we were young, you moved out of your parents' home when you were 17/18/19. It was unusual for someone of our generation to still be living at home at, say, 20. Plus most young people find their parents a bit of a pain in the arse. It's a fact of life. It hardly makes Molly any different to any other mother.
