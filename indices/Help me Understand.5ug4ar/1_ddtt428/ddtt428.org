Molly can be very annoying, and ticks off teenage readers who have similar overbearing mothers.

A few months ago, [[/u/taure]] ran a survey here and it turned out Ginny's core haters are teenage girls. They must have bad experiences with similar RL persons. (Unsurprisingly, Ginny's biggest fans are among teenage boys)

Ron's betrayal in Book 7 ticked off many readers across the population segment. I was initially in the same camp until my reread. Now I'm convinced it was mostly Locket induced, because minutes after taking that thing off, Ron regretted deeply and wanted to go back. Only circumstances prevented him from doing so. And it was Harry who came up with this utterly INSANE and STUPID idea to put a Horcrux around their necks.

A lots of Weasley bashing also stemmed from readers' hate of Dumbledore and their loyalty to him. H/G shippers bash other Weasleys just as often as H/Hr ones, with Brennus and kb0 leading the pack.
