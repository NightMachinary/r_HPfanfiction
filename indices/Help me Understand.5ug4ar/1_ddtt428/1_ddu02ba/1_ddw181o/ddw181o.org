I didn't like Ginny because there wasn't that much we knew about her, and it felt like it was just an obsession (like when she was younger), because she was obsessed with Harry Potter from when she was young so it felt like why should it change? Also the chamber incident would have led to more obsession.

(Semi-Related to your comment)\\
The Ginny who gives love potions story trope isn't as impossible as some people say considering she has a hero worship, has brothers who can sell love potions, and its been attempted before without any repercussions (That we know of.)\\
EDIT: By attempted before without repercussions I meant by Romilda Vane, not Ginny.
