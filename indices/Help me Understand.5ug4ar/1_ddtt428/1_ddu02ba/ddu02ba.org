To add on, when I was a teenager (a while ago, while the books were being published) one of the common threads at the time which led to dislike of Ginny in general was that the idea of her winding up with Harry in the books was just too cute. As in, it was too easily telegraphed. There was also the feeling that her character literally came out of nowhere and that the story line with Harry felt 'forced' in some way.

As I got older and reread the books I've discovered I have little problem with Ginny, Ron, or any of the Weasley's in general. Molly caring so much about Harry became more endearing than overbearing the older I've become, and is one of the more powerful aspects of the book for me (contrast Voldemort growing up without anybody loving him unconditionally, with Harry's best friend's mother instantly accepting him as one of her own).

Most other complaints I held/had about the family have similarly disappeared. You realize that the characterizations of the family at the beginning of the story are 1) as part of a children's story, and 2) seen through the eyes of Harry who is not an unbiased or entirely reliable narrator.
