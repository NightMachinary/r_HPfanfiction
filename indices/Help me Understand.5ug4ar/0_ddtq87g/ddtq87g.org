A ton of bashing issues come from the fact that the early Harry Potter books were children's books and not really supposed to be held up to heavy scrutiny.

The Weasley's talking loudly about the platform is a cute way to introduce important characters while adding to the wonder of the magic world. Walking through walls? How neat. However, apply higher standards to the scene and all of a sudden it makes no sense. She has tons of children, and has been doing this four times a year for at least 11 years straight, plus when she went to school. She is also talking loudly about things that shouldn't be talked about in front of muggles. Most people ignore things like the fact that a muggle train station would be very disorienting for a mother with 5 children to look after, or that she might have been doing something silly to keep her young children occupied. The only logical conclusion is that it is a devious trap to indoctrinate Harry.

Next we have Ron sitting with Harry. People have crunched the numbers, there is no way in hell that "Everywhere else was full". Clearly this is another ruse to make Harry fall in with the Weasleys. Except that JK has been proven time and time again to be bad at Maths. Also, it's a children's story, she just wanted a way to introduce Ron.

We also have Molly pulling money out of Harry's account without him being with her. They must be stealing from Harry! Also, yes, looking back this is odd, but JK had already written about the bank and had no need to rewrite it, so she just had Molly do it.

The personalities are another thing. Molly is a caring, worried mother figure. Her not wanting the kids to be involved is a normal, even logical thing for her to do. It would be weird for her to want her children involved in the war. Arthur was supposed to be a fun eccentric father figure, unfortunately when looked at in the right way he is kind of demeaning and offensive..... again introduced when it was more of a children's novel. The twins were fun loving pranksters.... who when viewed in more adult eyes, are clearly bullies.

The rest is usually from Ron leaving Harry in 4th year and 7th year.People don't like ugliness in their stories, and the fight in 4th year was pretty realistic. The one in 7th year was a bit more melodramatic.

TL;DR The Weasley's were introduced in a less serious children's novel, and were not treated well when looked at in a more serious setting.
