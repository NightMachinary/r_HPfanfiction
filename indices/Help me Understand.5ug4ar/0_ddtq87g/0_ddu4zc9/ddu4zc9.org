The whole "everywhere else is full can't be true because maths" thing really ticks me off. Like, when I was eleven and I couldn't find a specific Lego brick for ten minutes, I would declare it lost, not search through every single one of the thousands of Lego bricks until I found it.

Ron could easily have not found any free compartments from where in the train he got onto the carriage and Harry's compartment, and declared "everywhere else is full" because to him, every other compartment he'd seen so far might already have been full. He might've only seen compartments at one end of one carriage, but such a statement in that context would still be true.

The whole thing about it being a lie to ingratiate himself with Harry (usually on Manipulative! Dumbles' orders, too) is just /beyond/ tenuous.
