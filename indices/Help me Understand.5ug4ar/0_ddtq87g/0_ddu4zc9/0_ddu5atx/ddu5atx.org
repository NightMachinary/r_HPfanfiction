I agree 100%, also what counts as full to an 11 year old? Personally for me if I looked in at a room with a single sixteen year old in it I would not even try to go in, that room is dead to me. Plus "Everywhere else is full" sounds better then, "Everywhere else is full, well except the compartments that I am too scared to go into."
