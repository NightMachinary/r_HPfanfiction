It's a collection of short one-shot drabble thingamajigs, one of them is Ron's perspective on finding a seat on the Hogwarts Express.

In a nutshell, yes, he lied, there were free seats in the other carriages, but he looked scruffy and everyone else looked neat and he was embarrassed. And then he finds Harry who's messy-haired and misfit clothes and who looks just like him.
