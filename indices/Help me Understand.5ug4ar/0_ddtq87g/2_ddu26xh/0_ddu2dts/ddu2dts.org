Yup, book three was full of things that were ok for a young story but really have unfortunate implications in an older story. Love Potions, Time Travel, Jail without sentencing, Jail full of soul eating demons, Soul eating demons at a school... Also things that just aren't ok at all, like old men sleeping in the same beds as young boys.
