  They are very intelligent, they just put that intelligence to the most efficient use possible.

Yeah I really enjoy fanfics that emphasize their brilliance. It's a big condemnation for the whole Weasly clan that it needs someone outside of their family (Harry) to encourage their talents and helping them direct it into something useful (opening a shop). It's fun to wonder how well they could have done in Hogwarts academically (at least in Potions, Charms and Transfiguration) if their intelligence wasn't so much focused on rebellion if they had a more supportive family. Sadly Molly seems more focused on image and being a "proper wizard".
