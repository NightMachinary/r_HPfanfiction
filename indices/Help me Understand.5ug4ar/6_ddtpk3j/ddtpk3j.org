I have several stances on Weasleys :

- *Arthur* : calls himself an expert on muggles, yet has no clue what anything pertaining to them, also pretty useless : /pisses me off/
- *Molly* : meddling, smothering, knows better than anyone else, hot tempered, but really loves people : /pisses me off most of the time/
- *Bill* : seems courageous, daring, the epitoma of Gryffindor in the family : /really like him/
- *Charlie* : don't know enough about him to have an opinion : /meh/
- *Twins* : underrated, brilliant, very intelligent, funny, but bullying, careless and childish : /need some whipping to get in line and could be amazing/
- *Ron* : arrogant, stuck-up, prejudiced, jealous, hot tempered, loyal when he calms down : /really don't care about/for him/
- *Ginny* : hot tempered, gooey, mushy, fierce, loyal : /really like her when not paired with Harry/
