  To be fair, all adults in YA books are useless until the plot requires them to step up their games

Your exception clause at the end seems kind of unfair. Of course the plot requires them to be that way in a well thought out story. In a good book nothing is just there for the sake of it.

I wanted to point out that there are quite a few adults who aren't useless in HP... your sentiment that in general adults have to be less competent in such a story is valid though. However, I think it can be done in a reasonable and realistic manner... An incompetent government and Fudge in particular seems quite plausible (just look at the Trump administration).
