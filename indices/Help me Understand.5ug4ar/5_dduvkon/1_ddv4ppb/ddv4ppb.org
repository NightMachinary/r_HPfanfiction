To be fair, all adults in YA books are useless until the plot requires them to step up their games. Percy Jackson series is even worse in this regard.

As for Molly, she fed Harry well and gave him something like a real family. Teenagers generally don't appreciate what their parents do for them in terms of basic needs. Only in adulthood do they began to appreciate the importance of a good and tasty meal.
