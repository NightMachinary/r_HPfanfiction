  Although I do disagree that they were rebelling(before 5th year) though. The twins were humorous, and they found their humor best aided in the creation of magical humor tools.

Here is a good example from Book 5 how they are rebelling against their mother and clearly need a strong father figure:

  “Fred --- George --- NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley shrieked.

  Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before.

  “FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE WAS NO NEED --- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS --- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!”

  “We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. “Sorry Sirius, mate --- didn't mean to ---”

  Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had toppled backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.

  “Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, “your mother's right, you're supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you've come of age ---”

  “--- none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again. “Bill didn't feel the need to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn't Charm everything he met! Percy ---”

  Does she yell at Harry/Hermione? I genuinely can't remember.

Molly isn't a main character, so it's the small moments, but this oneat the end of Book 4 stuck in my head particularly:

#+begin_quote
  When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him. All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.

  “Harry! Oh Harry!”

  She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.

  “Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,” he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, “you may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.”

  Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear? He needs quiet!”

Their best friend just got tortured and used in a resurrection ritual and this woman just barges in like that... it's just. ARGH. As if Ron or Hermione wouldn't be much more concerned about his well-being than her... she barely knows the boy and it's her who almost assaulted him after a traumatic experience (Dumbledore has to block her with his body). To me it's just a perfect representation of the kind of person she is, blustering, overbearing and overall useless. So she hissed at Hermione, not sure if she ever yelled at her, might be a slight exaggeration.

To be completely fair though, she /is/ a good person. We should not forget this in all of that, before people come out of the woodworks and claim that I hate Ron or Molly. They oppose Voldemort, aren't bigots and want to help Harry. I just don't much care for them.
