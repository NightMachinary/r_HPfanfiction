  If Arthur was as ineffectual as he seems the Weasleys wouldn't be so successful

As I said in another comment I believe the Twins could have been much more successful (both academically and in business) if they had a strong father figure that encouraged them, but also showed them limits for their attitude. Their rebellion seems mostly directed against their mother and they have a hard time growing out of it.

  I can't really think of a single situation where she could have actually "helped" Harry without overstepping her bounds as his best mates mother, other than Book 5.

I think you make some fine points, but they strike me as too apologetic. Some people act on hunches, or try to inquire if something strikes them as ... unusual. Everything surrounding Harry could encourage her to investigate his home life, his education (Snape!) or anything else.

Harry has very few people (besides his Godfather) who's 'genuine' place it would be to be his advocate, but I can promise you I wouldn't be criticizing her if she ran into Privet Drive with blazing red hair and yelling at the Dursleys or maybe sneaking food into his locked bedroom or just helping him along in any other way (she seems to be a very skilled duelist if she can keep up with Bellatrix, why didn't she offer to tutor him ever?). She could have made a place for herself...

When people (including me) call her "overbearing" we do it because it comes totally out of the blue, just because she saw him for a few weeks over the summer she behaves like a mother-hen when she knows nothing about the situation. If she were his *actual* surrogate mother (and being a mother comes with more responsibilities than providing food and lodging, she knows this) no-one would complain. Does she even have *one* genuine conversation with Harry concerning his messed up life that isn't completely superficial... about anything except that he should eat more? Does Harry treat her as his surrogate mother? Does he ask her for advice or think of her and send her an owl if he has problems at school?

  Of course she's overbearing and protective, it's the only way she can feel any agency when her kids are off beyond her sphere of control.

They are her kids. I don't have a single problem with her yelling at Ron, Ginny or the Twins. Yelling at Harry or - worse - Hermione is completely off-kilter.

Edit: The whole problem probably centers around the fact that JKR failed to portray what she had in mind when it came to the Weaslys and when it comes to Molly in particular. Like, I can see from the subtext what she intended and most or at least a lot of the readers just go with it and ignore the contradictions. I just can't. Same goes for Dumbledore, I can totally see what she wanted to do with him (and having a humanized Mentor figure who makes mistakes is a good idea), but it's not what's in the book.
