Hmmm... where to start? Arthur seems to be a very weak father figure and ineffectual. Molly... Molly seems to thrive in fandom mostly on what she's supposed to represent, not on what she actually does. I'm still looking for relevant parts in the books where she actually does anything to help Harry - excluding big talk ("Oh why did you rescue Harry with Arthurs flying car, we could have done something" - yeah, right, suuuure Molly). The only thing she does is get rid of Bellatrix and in terms of writing that clearly should have been Neville or maybe Hermione.

Personally I like the Twins, especially because they may have flaws, but they actually do something (as opposed to their matriarch), so I give them a pass for some of their flaws. I think there are some valid arguments that they are at least in part responsible for the poor state of Ronald though.

I don't have to say much about Weatherby right? He's an arse.

Bill and Charlie I have nothing against, but they draw a strong picture of a family that is much more dysfunctional than it seems from Molly's projection.
