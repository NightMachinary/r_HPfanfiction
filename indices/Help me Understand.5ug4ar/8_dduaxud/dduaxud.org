Alright, so let's start with the biggest issue, Ron. Ron deserted Harry not once but twice. He deserted the only hope of his world because he was hungry. He was jealous because his brothers achieved something and yet he does not apply himself. Also he treats Hermione horribly. They would never end up together since "desertion of your spouse never goes unpunished" (the quote was from a Harmony fic set during the hunt).

Next is Molly. Molly knows that Harry is abused and makes jokes about it (bars on the window scene). She refuses Harry information because he is too young despite the fact that he faced Voldemort four times at that point. It is also one of the causes for Sirius death since she prevents him from learning vital information which could have prevented the Battle in the DoM. SHE IS OK WITH RAPE AND RAPE DRUGS.

Ginny is an odd case because she had a lot of potential that Rowling threw away in the sixth book. There is no buildup to the relationship, Harry is somehow suddenly jealous of the guy she is snogging (love potions anyone?) If there was a proper build up to their relationship (and maybe more than two pages on the actual relationship) it would have been more believable but it is not the logical conclusion of the story of books six and seven. That would be H/Hr because two young adults alone in a tent with the threat of imminent death would lead to more than one night of love.

There is also the whole issue of Fleur and how the Weasleys (especially Molly and Ginny) treated her in the summer of 96. That was unacceptable and Bill did little to stop it.
