In addition to the "Ron/Horcrux" issue, he was worried about his family. Their home had been attacked, his family under heavy scrutiny for being associated with Harry and the Order of the Phoenix, and his little sister was in the Death Eater controlled Hogwarts. Harry's reaction to Ginny being sent to the Forbidden Forest was the match to the powder keg. It made it seem like Harry wasn't worried about what could happen to her. He didn't like the excuse of "She's been through worse" because to him, it didn't matter if she had been; it mattered that she was in danger now. Harry's parents were already gone, Hermione sent her parents away to safety, but Ron's were still out there, in the open, for any Death Eater who caught them. Then came the fact that there was no real plan for the Horcrux Hunt (which is not Harry's fault. As he said, he'd been straight with them, and going off of the information that Dumbledore had given him). Even Hermione was skeptical of what they were doing; Ron's just the one who voiced it.
