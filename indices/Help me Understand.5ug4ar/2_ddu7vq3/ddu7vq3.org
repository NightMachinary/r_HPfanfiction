Before I got into fan fiction, I had no issues with the Weasleys. Made sense since I was just reading the series for pure enjoyment and through Harry's eyes they were all great (save Percy).

It's only when I started reading fan fiction where I discovered that there are some legitimate reasons to dislike some of them. Ron is the easiest since he abandoned Harry twice and probably did hold him back a bit.

I understand the hate for Ginny purely on the basis of wanting Harry with someone else. You need to make Ginny unlikable in your story provided it followed canon up until when your story takes place.

Arthur generally comes across as affable and sympathetic even with other Weasleys are bashed. Same with the twins. In nearly every H/G story, the twins are cool with them from the get go, as is Arthur. It's really Molly and the older brothers who have the issue.

It's easily understandable why this seems to always play out the same: it's a combination of using existing canon and exaggerating the character traits and easily-created conflict in a story that desperately needs some.

Let's look at H/G stories that are heavier on the romance. The author generally wants H/G to have this great relationship, but the problem is a great relationship does not make for an interesting story. So in order to protect H/G, what the author does is create conflict by having Molly (and the older brothers) be an obstacle for them to overcome. And the author can get away with it because while they would have to exaggerate her character, there is canon-based evidence to support Molly being the obstacle. She is overbearing, controlling, stubborn and a "my way or the highway" type of mother. Of course, in the series, these traits are present but played down in favor of amplifying her positive attributes. The fanfic author merely subverts things to play up the story.

Percy is too easy to not bash. He was basically bashed in the actual series so the author might not be bashing his character so much as being consistent with the original series.

Ultimately, I think in a lot of stories it is less about having an axe to grind with certain Weasleys compared to it being an easy way to manufacture conflict without going too far off canon and out of character.
