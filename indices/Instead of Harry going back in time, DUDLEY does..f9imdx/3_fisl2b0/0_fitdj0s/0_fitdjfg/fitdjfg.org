#+begin_quote
  Dudley lives with the guilt of what his family had done to his cousin. He resents the person he used to be and tries to live as someone better, but a part of himself can never truly forgive the cruelty done to the kind-hearted Harry. After a car accident, he wakes to find himself a child again. He sets out to make sure Harry has a better childhood all while hiding his own magic.
