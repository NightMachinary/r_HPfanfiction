The title is decently compelling, but by the start of the second paragraph you've got something really interesting.

Sneakily supportive Dudley as a concept is clever. He's not trying to guilt-trip or inspire them to be better people (difficulty level: very high; author difficulty level: also very high), just get better outcomes.

How much future investment advice would he remember? 'None' is a fair answer.

This rundown falters a bit at the end. The Tonks family members turn out to be important, the Pettigrew plot is resolved easily, all so they can tackle canon's problems? Suggestion: you don't have to prompt someone with the whole resolution of the plot. On the other hand, there's no rule that someone can't be inspired by only some of what you wrote.

Diverging from canon is preferable, and you've already given one way to justify it with the dimension mechanic, but sometimes AUs are the most fun when they can justify more and more divergences organically from a simple premise. Offhand I can't think of anything, but to anyone attempting this it's something to consider.
