Hm, after reading some of the recs in this thread, I think I might actually write it from Harry's perspective. Then all the exposition about older Harry and Rookwood and the Unspeakables would be gradually revealed in disjointed bits as he learns Legilimency and sees Dudley's implanted memories. I might then just end it when Harry goes off to Hogwarts with a plan to defeat Voldemort, since I don't really have anything after that. It's mostly just focused on the relationship between the cousins at Privet Drive.
