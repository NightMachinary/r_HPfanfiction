There was another one on FFn where Harry accidentally arrives in Equestria by literally dropping from the sky and flattening an emerging King Sombra like a pancake.

This is before Celestia sends Twilight and her friends up, and before Cadence and Shining can take up her birthright (since she's a descendant of Princess Amore of the Empire).

Canon is promptly derailed as the newly liberated crystal ponies make this freaked out alicorn their new king.

Sadly enough, the execution was a bit meh on an otherwise brilliant prompt.
