Here's the summary :

#+begin_quote
  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; *manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny*
