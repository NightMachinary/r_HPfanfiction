I'm sure it goes without saying, but the Ginny and Ron bashing, (plus optional: love potion) trope is to be avoided at all costs.

I don't really know of any really good, convincing and well-paced Lunar Harmony fics out there, so it should be interesting to finally see one that +doesn't suck+ isn't fluffy, outrageous, and/or totally out of character. I look forward to what you come out with!
