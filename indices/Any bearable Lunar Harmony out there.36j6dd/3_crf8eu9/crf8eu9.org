Hardly any, which is sad, because it is my favorite pairing.

I told myself that I would not write any more epic length FanFiction, but in this case, I think I will. There will be no Lord Potter, His wealth (inheritance) will be very moderate (maybe the equivalent of a couple of hundred thousand US dollars, not outside the realm of what happens every day in inheritance cases), and he will not immediately become HARRY the GODLIKE.

There will be no Soul Bond of any kind. Period. I don't mind the concept as fluff, but this will be a more realistic look at things.

Will Harry be Powerful? Yes, this is Canon (diving off all the dementors with a single patronus).

If anyone can think of any other tropes that I should avoid, please let me know. If anyone is interested, let me know and I will post the link to the first chapter when I have it written. If you think I shouldn't waste my time, you can let me know that too. Doesn't mean I will listen.

Why am I rambling? I'm stuck at work with nothing else to do :(
