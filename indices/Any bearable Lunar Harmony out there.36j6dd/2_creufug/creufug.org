There was another Lunar Harmony story I remember reading at some point last year. I can't remember the name of it. What I remember is that [[/Harry%20is%20rescued%20from%20the%20Dursley%20residence%20around%20age%207%20or%208%20by%20a%20Potter%20family%20house%20elf%20and%20taken%20to%20a%20Potter%20residence%20where%20he%20is%20instructed%20by%20the%20magical%20portraits%20of%20his%20paternal%20grandparents.%20%20He%20meets%20Hermione%20&%20Luna%20through%20a%20means%20I%20don't%20remember.%20%20They%20&%20their%20families,%20along%20with%20a%20released/escaped%20Sirius,%20move%20in%20and%20make%20one%20big%20weirdly%20happy%20family.][spoilers]]

Edit - how do I mark spoilers with the black text instead of the fake URL that's way too long to read easily?
