In additon to those mentioned already:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10359113/1/][Tempest of the Fae]] is pretty amusing, another story from the same challenge as Faery Heroes.

If you like Robst, there's always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5210983/1/Fate-s-Gambit][Fate's Gambit]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5345583/1/FG2-The-Trio-Hit-Hogwarts][FG2 -- The Trio Hit Hogwarts]].

For humor, it's tough to beat [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!]].

There are others I'm forgetting right now, many of which are unfinished. If I happen to remember I will edit this.

Edit:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053661/1/][Harry Potter: The Forgotten Brother]] is a sort of crazy WBWL story. It has issues, but definitely worth a read.
