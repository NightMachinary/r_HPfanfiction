Not on FFN. On AO3, in a different fandom, if there is less than a 1 kudo to 10 hits ratio, it tends to be not great I find. On FFN in the HP fandom, I don't find that reviews and favorites make a huge difference. Instead, I find an author I enjoy and then read their favorites, and so on and so forth. I something ten or more author pages open as I do this, but it's the best way I've found of filtering good from bad.
