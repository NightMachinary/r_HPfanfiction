I use to do that before but not much anymore. Now I just judge it by the summary and the pairing (if there is one) but then if I start reading it and the author does obnoxious author notes in the middle of the story and it drops the story out of sync, I stop reading it because its annoying and not very good writing style. Nothing is more annoying then that.
