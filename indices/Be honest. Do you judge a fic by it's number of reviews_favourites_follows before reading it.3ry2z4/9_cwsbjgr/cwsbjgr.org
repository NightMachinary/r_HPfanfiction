I use number of favorites to sort my searches as an initial quality filter. And, although there are exceptions, when the favs start dropping below 2,000 it's less likely I'll enjoy a story (i tend to only read completed fics).

It's not a great system but until ffn gets actual ratings it's the best I've got. I try not to look at reviews because they often have spoilers.
