Below 2k?? On FFnet, just under ONE TENTH OF ONE PERCENT of all HP fanfics have over 2k reviews. Only .3% even have over 1k reviews. Less than a quarter of my fav list does and while I probably half or more of my list wouldn't make it back on there if I wiped it today, I still enjoyed them at the time. Even if you automatically write off 90% of ffnets offerings, its still 68,000 fics youre complete ignoring. Off ffnet, I don't think you'll find a single story with over 1k reviews. You've eliminated a huge amount of content with that and I urge you to see past the review count and consider other things like ratio of reviews to favorites for completed fics and follows for incomplete fics. Or at least lower your threshold to like 250, or 500 if you must.
