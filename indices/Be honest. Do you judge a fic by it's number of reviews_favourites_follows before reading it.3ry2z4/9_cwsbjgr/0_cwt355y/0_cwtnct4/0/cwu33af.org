This seems completely arbitrary. My oldest story (written in 2009) only just crossed the 2k favs marks and it has 1.5 /million/ views. I just checked, and there's only 1058 fics that actually fit that criteria (42 pages + 8).

I can safely say that the vast majority of those are either super old and haven't held up well with age (NoFP, Summer of Change), are genre staples that people bandwagon onto (Delende Est, ABC, TLIL, HP&BWL, etc), are stories involving pairings I won't touch (any slash, HG/SS, HG/DM, etc). Or, they're just outright bad (Poison Pen, Harry Crow, HPMOR.)

I think it's pretty safe to say that there are far more quality stories with less than 2k favs than there are with more. Like, Ectomancer just barely meets your criteria and that story is amazing, but stuff like The Unforgiving Minute, Incorruptible: the Dementor's Stigma, By the Divining Light, and Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod don't make your list. And you'd never come across something like Resurrexit which is a pretty new story of very high quality.
