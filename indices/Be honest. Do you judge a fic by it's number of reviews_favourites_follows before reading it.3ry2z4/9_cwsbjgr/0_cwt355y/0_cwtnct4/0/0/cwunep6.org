When I say "That doesn't mean I won't try them...", I mean "I try them." There is no "list", just something I've noticed. I'd guess that if a story really is "good", it will earn its favs in time and I'm in no hurry.

I agree with most of your opinions about specific stories though we'll have to disagree on HPMOR (I've read it multiple times and each time I find new details to enjoy -- such a vast number of subtle details, foreshadows, and interesting character interactions to debate).
