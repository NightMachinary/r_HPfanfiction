Certainly not. When By the Divining Light and Trial by Troll can get about 100 reviews and Harry Crow and The Poison Pen can get 10,000 you know there is something wrong with the general FFN audience. I don't use any metric that relys on FFN members.

Nowadays, I don't really even use FFN to find stories anyway. I rely on recommendations from here and DLP.
