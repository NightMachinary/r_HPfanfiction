No. I entered fandom through LiveJournal, which at the time offered a wealth of fests and communities and pairing-centric archives to help guide me. I latched onto favorite authors, friended their journals, volunteered as a beta, wrote recs for reccing communities, and kept tabs on stories I liked. I can usually spot within the first couple of paragraphs the kinds of errors or inadequacies in a fic that throw me out. And content warnings are also useful, because it lets me filter anything too fluffy, mpreg, bashing, etc.

I didn't really pay much attention to FFN, and it wasn't until AO3 became a major archive that I noticed the tyranny of kudos and review counts (especially because, for whatever reason, a lot of people are hesitant to leave comments at AO3, which skews statistics). My experience of scanning the top 20 - 40 titles for my favorite pairing tells me that my tastes don't really run parallel to the majority of fandom.
