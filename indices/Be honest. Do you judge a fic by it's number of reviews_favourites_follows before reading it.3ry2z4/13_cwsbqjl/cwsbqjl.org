When I'm new to a fandom I do. I sort by favorites on FF.net and have been known to try every interesting looking fic in the first 15 pages or however many pages it takes to reach a huge quality drop. Some fandoms have a higher ratio of good stories that this works better on.

Then after I'm done with those I look through all the newest fics and usually judge by summery.
