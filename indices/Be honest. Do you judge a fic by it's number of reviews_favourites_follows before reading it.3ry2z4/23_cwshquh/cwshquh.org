Kind of a mix. I try and pay attention to the summary and if it's complete, first, but then I will check the reviews/favorites/likes/etc. before I commit to it. Reviews were my number 1 indicator many, many years ago, but I've mellowed out a bit.

These days, I don't often have time for long fics with over 5 chapters anyway, so even if it doesn't have a ton of reviews, I will still likely give it a go.
