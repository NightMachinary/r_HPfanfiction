If I'm not sure about the summary I'll have a quick scan of the reviews - even if they're all positive, you can usually tell the quality of a fic based from them.

I never put thought into the number though, because there are loads of good fics that go completely under the radar, and plenty of incredibly popular fics that are just plain terrible.
