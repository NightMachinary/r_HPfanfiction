I've done the same for a while, unless the number of favorites is above 1k, then I check it anyhow. After that first filtering step I check the summary. If the summary appeals I'll read it, if not I read some of the reviews on the last chapter to see what people thought, and choose based on that.

Bad grammar/spelling in the summary means I'll skip it though. I also skip almost all stories tagged with 'humor' as a genre.
