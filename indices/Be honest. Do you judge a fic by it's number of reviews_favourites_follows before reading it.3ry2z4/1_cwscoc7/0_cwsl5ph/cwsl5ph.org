I use this criterion too. I think if people like a fic, they might review, they might fav, or both. On the other hand, if they /don't/ like the fic, they'll probably just review. So it's not a perfect criterion, but it at least weeds out some of the more controversial choices, e.g. MoR, Harry Crow, etc.

Also, a high fav/review ratio can be indicative of really good one-shots, e.g. Cauterize.
