Yes, especially if I'm going through a new site. I'll read all the top stories first, but after I've selected and read maybe 200, I'll read anything if their summary catches my eye. Ao3 is my site of choice because I can filter out anything I'm disinterested in. I do read a lot of new works, though, so this differs depending on my mood.
