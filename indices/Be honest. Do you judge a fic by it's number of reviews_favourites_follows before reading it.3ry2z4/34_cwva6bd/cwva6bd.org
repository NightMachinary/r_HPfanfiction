I mainly read stories advertised here or at DLP.

But sometimes there comes an urge to download some random stories on my kindle. Then my criteria are like this:

- Completed.

- Language: German / English.

- Sort by Favourites.

And THEN I start reading the summaries to choose seemingly good fics.

Probably not the best process and too relying on other peoples favouriting-habit but it's the best I've got so far...
