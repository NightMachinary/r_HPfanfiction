I'm far more likely to give a story a shot if it has very high numbers of favorites or about 1000-1500. Less than 1000, or between 1500 and 3000, and I'm less likely to try it. It's a stupid system, most popular stories suck and so do most less popular stories, but it's really hard to ignore thousands of other people liking a story and I've found a disproportionately high number of good fics with about 1000 favs.
