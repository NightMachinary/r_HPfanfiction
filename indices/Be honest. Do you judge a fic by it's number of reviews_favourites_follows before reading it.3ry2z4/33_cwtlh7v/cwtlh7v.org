(This is all for FFN)

Nope. I judge it by its word count and summary (+whether it's complete or not). With favs/reviews/follows the same, I'll pick something 200k words over something 10k words. I've found some great 100k+ works with less than 100 reviews before.

Number of reviews doesn't really mean anything, other than a bunch of people read it. It could be 3000 people asking for an update or saying it's trash or pointing out spelling errors. I'm not gonna go click on the reviews because of spoilers if I *am* interested.

Number of followers doesn't mean much, because a story could go massively downhill halfway through.

Number of favorites is a little more reliable, but even still that requires people to actually log in so already it'll be a lower number, and honestly everyone has different tastes. Something one person loves I might absolutely hate.
