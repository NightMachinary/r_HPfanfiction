Although it might be unfair to some writers, I automatically block OCs. Harry Potter is such a big universe to begin with, I question the need to have an OC, especially one as a main character. The fact the large majority of OCs are female author inserts Mary-Sues means the quality of the story is not going to be great. There are some good fics with less then 2K per chapter, normally they update much faster then those with >2K per chapter. I think some writers tend to use the next chapter as a scene break.
