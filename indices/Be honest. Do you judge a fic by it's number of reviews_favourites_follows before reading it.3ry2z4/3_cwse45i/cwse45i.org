Word count per chapter is pretty much my first criteria. You can't put enough love and care into a chapter below 2k. It just doesn't feel right.

After that it's a tie between pairing/characters and summary. I usually block Draco and Snape on ffnet and the majority of the rest of the dark characters if I'm using the Scryer in which case I block other keywords like mpreg, slash, WBWL, and a couple other keywords if I think of them. I already know I'm not going to be interested in stories with those summaries, so it's easier to just have them not show up at all. Also any mention of bashing (whether they say "no bashing" or "heavy bashing") is usually a skip.

Like most of the other people I simply don't care about reviews unless it's like below five per chapter with five or more chapters which is usually indicative of a bad plot. People just care so little about the story that they don't even comment on grammar and spelling. On the flip side, I'm generally hesitant to follow a story with huge amounts of reviews per chapter as, like at least one other person said, it's usually herd mentality and cliche ridden.

Lastly is the publish date, at least for incomplete or new stories. Less than 5k words a month, or if the story is a couple years old and doesn't have consistent chapters, I have no illusions that it'll be completed any time soon if ever.

Needless to say I read very few new fics.
