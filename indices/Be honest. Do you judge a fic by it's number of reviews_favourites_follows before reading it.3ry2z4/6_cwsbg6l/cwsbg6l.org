I try not to. For some reason, many fanfic readers are allergic to originality; it's why we see so many of the same shitty stories regurgitated over and over again to the point of parody: Independent!Harry fics, WBWL, evil Weasleys in H/Hr fics, hell, even DLP's collective waifu in Fleur isn't immune to the trite "I'm so perfect and nobody sees the real me, take me 'Arry!" storyline. Whereas I've seen some really great fics left by the wayside with less than 125 reviews, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/][The Changeling]] being probably the best example of this.

I take it as a rule: under-reviewed fics are almost always better than highly-reviewed fics, simply because the ideas in them are usually more novel.
