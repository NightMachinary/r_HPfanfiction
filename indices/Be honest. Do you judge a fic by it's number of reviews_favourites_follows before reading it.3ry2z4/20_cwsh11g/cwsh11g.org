To some extent. Whenever I've finished weeding through the masses for what I'm looking for, I generally judge on how coherent the writing actually is. If the flow isn't what I was looking for or the characters are super OOC for no reason, I just close the tab.

I'm super picky, though, and as a fic writer myself, I know that lots of reviews don't necessarily mean good story.
