I have a bad habit of judging a story by reviews. In my mind, if something's popular, its popular for a reason, and its probably good. There's a ratio I go by, if a story gets 10 reviews:1k words (1000 reviews for 100,000 words) then I'll be impressed. buuuut pretty much all of my favorite stories don't meet that. As for favorites/follows, I don't even glance at them.
