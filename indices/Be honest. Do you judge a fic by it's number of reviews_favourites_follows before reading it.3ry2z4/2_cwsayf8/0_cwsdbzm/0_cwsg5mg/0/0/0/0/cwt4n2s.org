That's true. But to me the age still doesn't really matter. I don't really put that much thought into it. I look over the title+summary+stats in a few seconds -- usually not even, if the summary is really bad. The way I judge stories, is that if the story isn't about something I'd normally read, but it has a lot of reviews, I'll probably give it a chance. Whereas if there's an amazing summary, it doesn't matter how many reviews it has, I'll still read it. So if there's a shitty story, and it doesn't have that many reviews because its only two months old, eh I won't read it.
