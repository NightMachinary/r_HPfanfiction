Hahaha, yes. That's why I said what I did was a bad habit -- I read lots of shitty fanfiction for a long, long time. Still though, when I look over stories I automatically do that calculation. Not that I use it decide what not to read, but if it has a lot of reviews, I'll probably give it chance.

It helps that I've set my bar really low.
