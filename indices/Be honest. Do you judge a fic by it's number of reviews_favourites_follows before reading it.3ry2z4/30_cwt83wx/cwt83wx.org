I do take it in consideration but leave immediately if the first few paragraphs are written poorly

Ultimately I choose to look at stories based off what I'm interested at the time. Even if other types of stories (next-gen, Harry/Ginny, etc) stories are written really well at any certain time I will only be looking for a certain type based off my mood, and from there will pretty much read through summaries/starts and decide. But I will be more inclined to check out a story if it is popular
