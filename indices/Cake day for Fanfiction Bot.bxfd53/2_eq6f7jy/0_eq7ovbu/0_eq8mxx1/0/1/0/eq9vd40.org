Imagine a programmer, let's call them J, has been paid to work on a particular problem. J solves the problem and The Company uses that solution to get a big advantage in their sector.

One evening, J comes across an open source project that would benefit from the same solution and adds something similar to it. The Company just lost its advantage.

Now in the real world, that's hardly ever going to happen. But if you're in a sector where innovation is key, you don't want your employees spreading their knowledge around too far.

I was once contracting for one company that tried to change our contracts such that any code I wrote, anywhere, was immediately the company's property. Needless to say, I refused to sign it. Others might not have had that choice though.
