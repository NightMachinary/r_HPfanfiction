linkffn(Post Tenebras Lux) Post-Hogwarts

linkffn(Chasing the Sun)

linkffn(Sin & Vice) The first half of this is excellent but I didn't like the end as much.

linkffn(An Unwritten Future) time travel and horcruz hunt combined

linkffn(Thirty-One Days)

linkffn(The Professor's Discretion) This one, I believe, was completed but left the ending vague to let you decide what happened.
