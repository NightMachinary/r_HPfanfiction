So, this ship is huge. There's a LOT of it. Recommendations might be better if you could answer give us some details about what you like. Do you want romance, humor, hurt/comfort, kink, SuperDark!Snape? Are other pairings ok or any to avoid? Do you want new magic, improved minor characters, and/or exotic locations?

That said, because you specified "good" there are 2 whole archives that come to mind.

First, [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/][Ashwinder]]. Posting there requires beta moderation, so I find the quality of fics better than archives that do not require any moderation at all. If you have a favorite story/author on another archive, see if they are on Ashwinder and crawl their favorites. OR, try looking up the author [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=2560][southern_witch_69]] -- she either isn't on FFN or AO3, or doesn't go by that name on them. She's completed 17 of 18 stories and has excellent favorites lists to crawl.

Second, the now-defunct [[https://web.archive.org/web/20151209122636/http://www.witchfics.org/][WitchFics is still available thru the Wayback]]. Some of the authors transitioned to other archives, but many gems are still there. It was an exclusive club of Snapefans, and it's *mostly* our favorite ship but there's some other stuff too. I really enjoyed the world-building of [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160106231428/http://www.witchfics.org/anna/][Anna]]'s /Roman Holiday/ and it's sequels, but, fair warning, the third in the series /Last Tango in Paris/ is not complete. The notion of "summer" reading made me think of it, though, as the story opens during summer break, and I first read it during my own summer break from school :)
