Flower War

XxTheDarkLordxX

Summary:

“So, I was thinking---” Neville cut off, causing Harry to peer up curiously. Neville's eyes were narrowed on the flower, small frown marring his features. “Oh, how rude.” “What's rude? It's just a flower. Strange, since Malfoy sent it to me. Do you think he was cursed? I mean, it's not like him to be nice.”

** Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."

 Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.
