I too enjoyed this one... until ending. (it's a 2chapter story, so it was short)

I too don't feel like Voldemort/Harry works, but this story somewhat works... as I can see it as: Harry's magic ended up in Voldemort, and changed his values --> Harry automatically feels his lack of magic in the background --> when Tom who is still obsessed (along with Harry's magic wanting to return pulling him constantly through the Horcrux-link) shows up, Harry reacts more to his magic than to Tom the person... and then the fic ends... and I imagine Harry ends up being in a fugue state most of the time, drugged by his own magic
