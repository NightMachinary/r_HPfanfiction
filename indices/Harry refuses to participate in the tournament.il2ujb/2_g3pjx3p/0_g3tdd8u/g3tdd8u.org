Wow, that plot sounds like exactly what I was looking for...I was going to say that I don't really have a pairing preference as long as it's done well, but then I saw this is Harry/Tom, and that is definitely one pairing I've ready very little of. It just usually either squicks me out or seems totally OOC. Or it's crack, which is OK, but a different kind of thing that's more for fun. But I gave this a chance. I liked the beginning, but I super do not understand the pairing. Like...for this to be at all realistic to me, I would need to see Tom feel intense, painful remorse for murdering Harry's parents. For that to be addressed. Or for it to be an AU where he didn't actually kill his parents. I just do not get how people just take it as given that this could happen between a person who murdered another person's parents, except as something sick and twisted.

Nothing personal if you're into it, and I still appreciate the rec.
