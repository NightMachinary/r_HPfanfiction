I think Arthur should go by himself and be the one to have a checkup. Your original idea is funny, but it looks too much like he uses his children as Guinea pigs, which I don't see him doing. Not if they're not voluntary and he doesn't want to experiment himself. I feel like Arthur would want to be the one having a checkup so that way he can experiment firsthand.
