While the Philospher's Stone is the pinnacle of alchemy (only because of greed, of course), that's not what it would be limited to. In reality, it was the pre-cursor to chemistry, a subject matter focused on the transformation of matter. Applied to the world of Harry Potter, this means that alchemy is most likely related to both Transfiguration and Potions in some manner.

So what does this mean? Hell if I know. But if I were to guess, it would involve transforming an item /cough cough/ a stone for example /cough cough/ in such a way that it takes on the properties of various ingredients. This would keep it separate from both Transfiguration and Potions while keeping it related. The transformation of the essence of the object from Transfiguration, but with the incorporation of properties in a manner similar to Potions.

I have always thought that the process of Voldemort gaining a body in /GoF/ was alchemical in nature. The object transformed? The weird Voldemort homunculus thing (heretofore referred to as a homunculus). The ingredients? We know of three. Bone of the Father: Gives a structure to the body. Flesh of the Servant: Gives animation to the body. Blood of the Enemy: Gives life/power to the body. If it was just a homunculus not possessed/inhabited/whatever by Voldemort, the process might just have created an artificial person, such as a flesh golem of sorts. But with it? Bam, reborn Voldemort. We know some other liquid was involved, because Harry was hoping Voldemort would drown, so there were probably other ingredients to give more and more properties to the body so it would truly be Voldemort reborn, and not a fancier homunculus.

EDIT: Holy fucking shit. Each of the ingredients do more than that, more than I had first imagined possible. Not only do they give certain properties, but they by their nature reinforce the Voldemort nature of the object. Bone of the Father says it is the child of Tom Riddle Senior. Flesh of the Servant establishes him as the Master of the Death Eaters. Blood of the Enemy defines him as the Enemy, capital N Nemesis of Harry Potter. That's another, even more important reason to use Harry Potter. Harry isn't just the prime enemy of Voldemort, but is essentially the embodiment of the principles that oppose those that guide Voldemort. Dumbledore would be the other logical choice, except that his Enemy, his opposing Force was /Grindlewald/. Less reinforcement of the Voldemort mantle.

Just as the Earth with turtles, magic is symbols all the way down.
