There's nothing I know of in the canon that says that Transfiguration is impermanent. But then again, we are discussing headcanons, so whatever. Potions, I would probably give that one to you, though the fact that some, say the Draught of Living Death, don't end until an antidote is given implies that some potions can be permanent. Saying that all Transfiguration is impermanent and the same with all potions just doesn't feel /right/ to me.

I always remember the Matroyshka dolls section from What You Leave Behind when I think of Transfiguration. The beetle that Harry is supposed to transfigure into a button remembers being a rock, so Harry is able to use an untransfiguration spell to return it to it's original rock-being. Even when transformed from a rock to a beetle, it retained an echo of a rock, a true part of it's existence. That, to me, is what Transfiguration does. It changes the nature of a thing, but the object to what it is transfigured 'remembers' or retains a bit of it's ur-self.

Compared to Transfiguration, Potions is a bit more straightforward. Potionmaking would take a variety of ingredients, chosen to amplify certain properties while decreasing/canceling other properties of the ingredients so the final product when ingested or poured, those properties are imparted to the user. Skele-Grow returns bones, and there they stay until something happens to them (permanence). Felix Felicis makes you lucky for a time (impermanence).
