  Does it say of the Draught of Living Death that the potion is permanent until the antidote is used? Because no other potion in the series seems to have that kind of permanence.

I thought it did, but sometimes I remember things that never happened, so I could always be wrong on that count.

  But skelegro is healing/reversing entropy [which is is still temporary because eventually the bone can break again or the person dies, it doesn't make the bone unbreakable for the rest of the recipient's life].
#+end_quote

Here I think we're using different definitions of permanence. What I meant was that the skele-gro created a new bone, that would then exist as bones do. That is, growing until whatever biological function tells it to stop, and existing whole until some force or action is applied to it, such as a break from a fall, or an incompetent professor accidentally vanishing the thing. I guess, if I were to distill my definition down, permanence would be an effect that doesn't undo itself, but would require additional actions to do so or to change unnaturally.

Would I be correct in saying that the definition you had in mind when reading my comment was more of a "bone was created, and never would it change or disappear?"
