But skelegro is healing/reversing entropy [which is is still temporary because eventually the bone can break again or the person dies, it doesn't make the bone unbreakable for the rest of the recipient's life].

Does it say of the Draught of Living Death that the potion is permanent until the antidote is used? Because no other potion in the series seems to have that kind of permanence.
