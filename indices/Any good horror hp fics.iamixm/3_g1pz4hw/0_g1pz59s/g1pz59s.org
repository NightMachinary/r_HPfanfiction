  Eight-year-old Ron knows his crazy Uncle Billius wasn't as cracked as everyone believes. Wearing gloves in the summer, pockets full of cheering charms, terrified of Patronuses: all of these things seem pretty reasonable to Ron who can see the Grim just as well as his Uncle could. Ron is content to ignore the creature until he accidentally-on-purpose kills someone.
