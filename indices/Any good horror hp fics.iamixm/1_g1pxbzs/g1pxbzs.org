The Eyes was pretty good. Harry sees things. They aren't good. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/]])

Whelped is a fic where Snape is the one who has to deliver Harry's Hogwarts letter. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12692794/1/]])

That Which Holds the Image is a Dr Who-HP crossover. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/]])

Deathly Hallowed was really good, but it's also not complete. Lily uses some dark magic to help save Harry in 1981. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed]])

/Friends/ by the psychotic house-elf was pretty scary for me as well.
