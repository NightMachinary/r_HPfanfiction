It is not quite horror, but it involves a crossover from a cult horror franchise. Evil Be Thou My Good by Ruskbyte, on ff. Very well written, and an absolute beaty of a crossover. Brilliantly well done. Plus, it has clearly been edited and proofread as there are very few, if any, misspellings or grammatical/punctuation errors. Linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good)
