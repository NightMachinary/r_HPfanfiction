linkffn(Reincantation by Alisonven). Time travel, with subtle but inevitable horror.

linkffn(Brightest in Shadow by Athan Mortis). Crossover with Silent Hill and other horror games. Not my favorite story by a long shot, perhaps because I never played those games.

linkffn(The Velveteen Noose by Marmalade Fever). Anything I say about this would potentially give away too much.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Obliviated Parents by ZebJeb). This has some similarities with The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag.

linkffn(Guy Fawkes Day by MisterQ). No monsters, but certainly some horror.

linkao3(Shadow over Wiltshire by DelphiPsmith). Lucius Malfoy has a duty.

linkao3(The End of the Hogwarts Rowing Society by BlueWhitney). There's something funny about the Giant Squid.

linkffn(It's Always the Quiet Ones by PixelWriter1).Luna sees things. Perhaps not truly horror, but ...
