Along those lines, I once read a fic that explained that house-elves will always cook a dish exactly the same way. That's really great for consistency, and for a restaurant, that would be great. But like you said, having a human around as a head chef would help a lot for anything that needs more creativity.

I also remember one fic where, due to the differences between human and house-elf palates, the house-elves underseason food, leaving it all rather bland. Of course, that was really just a way to justify Harry being able to impress people with his cooking.
