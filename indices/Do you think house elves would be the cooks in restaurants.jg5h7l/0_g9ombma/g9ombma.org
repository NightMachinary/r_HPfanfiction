If the house elves we see in canon are any indication, innovation and leadership may not be their strong suits.

So I think there will be a human executive chef that leads dish planning and directs a restaurant from day to day. However, I think the actual beings doing the cooking will be the house elves. The human chef would oversee it, make sure the dish is up to standards, and run the kitchen, but the house elves would be like line chefs (note: not cook so I could be wrong with the usage of this term).
