Wow, people really parrot lies without actually reading the story. All the wizards got from a member of the IRA - massively overpaid with gold from Sirius Black - was a tiny sample of Semtex and a few triggers. Hardly reaching to think that an individual would sell some a sliver of explosive and some replaceable detonators for a huge sum - especially in a time when the troubles were ending and they weren't supposed to use the stuff any more. (The wizards then used the Duplication Charm. A lot.)

Now, I know some people think that muggles drool, but, generally, explosives do get off when triggered correctly. And, using magic, it's not too difficult to place such explosives close to your target. The first time, when no one expects it. That's really not wanking. As we saw in real life, most such gambits work the first time.

However, since my characters on both sides of the conflict aren't idiots, the purebllod wizards did react. Potential targets moved to locations not known to the public, others sought hostages, some hid among muggles - and Voldemort happily used a bomb himself to blow up Dumbledore's people and blame the muggleborns for it. Actions have consequences, after all.

In the same way, plans and tactics in my stories tend to work until the enemy reacts to them - and that depends on how much they know and what they can do. Further, if people have the initiative and can plan to their heart's content, attacks tend to work well. have the same people react - or rush and attack - and casualties tend to pile up. In this conflict, both the Death Eaters and the muggleborns were generally striking from hiding, and vanishing quickly, so casualties stayed low at first, and attacks were generally successful - if they found a target. That changed as things heated up.
