That depends on your defintion of "wanking" (which usually means "portrayed more positively than I can stand!!!!!!!" for those who use the term). In my stories, muggle technology's use ranges from barely mentioned to prominent depending on the plot and the characters involved. A squib or muggle main character will, naturally, use technology more than a wizard or witch. An AU with a wizarding world more divided from the muggle one will generally see less muggle technology used. Further, if the plot doesn't offer the opportunity to introduce muggle technology in a plausible manner, it's not going to be used - contrary to what people who haven't been in the military think, guns need training to be used even half-way proficiently. So, whether and how muggle technology gets used varies a lot. As to Hermione - those who hate the idea that she could be as important and skilled as Harry would naturally call it wanking, but I generally aim for the trio - Harry, Ron and Hermione - to be overall about equally skilled/capable.
