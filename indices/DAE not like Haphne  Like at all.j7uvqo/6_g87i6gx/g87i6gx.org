The average Haphne story is as well written as the average, say, Dramione story. Which translates to both being pretty much garbage. However, the usual Haphne story contains almost no Draco (who I have zero desire to read about, unless he's being cruciated) and very little Hermione (who I can take in very small doses). Thus the average Haphne story is vastly preferable to a variety of other pairings.

It's not like I ship it even. I just dislike most other ships thoroughly. like Harmony (ughhh Harmonians) and Hinny (ughhh canon zealots) and Drarry (just no). The above ships make up something like 80% of all fanfiction btw.

So yeah Haphne is not perfect, or even good. I still prefer it to most other ships. (except HONKS, but we only get like 2 fics per year of that).
