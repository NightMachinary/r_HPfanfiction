Harry and Daphne is my favourite pairing.

I really like fics where Harry isn't so clueless and floundering as he is in cannon, and I find Daphne is one of the best ways an author can get him 'caught up' in the Wizarding world. She can show him the political side, the darker side, introduce him to how Wizarding society works (Harry is a Potter after all) as well as introduce a way to explain that not all Slytherins are evil.

She can be a fantastic counter point to Harry's blind loyalty to the light, without turning him dark.

When I think about who I want Harry to be with I just don't think he suits any of the major characters (Hermione, Ginny etc) so I'd rather him with an OC. Daphne is pretty much that, all we really know about her is that she's in Slytherin. She's a great blank canvas to write her personality pretty much however the author would like.

That being said, I also like stories with Harry getting with Susan, Tracy, Hannah, or anyone else who isn't one of the major characters.
