I enjoy some of the Haphne-is-canon jokes on this sub, and I appreciate the attempt to make Slytherin more interesting than it is in canon. I don't tend to like the sort of political stuff and macho power fantasies that I've seen in the Haphne I read, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are very good Haphnes out there.
