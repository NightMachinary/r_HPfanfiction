I can't say I dislike Haphne because I don't know much about them nor have I read many fics about them. She's basically an OC and I'm not a fan of OCs but that's just a matter of personal preference. Also, I strongly dislike edgy Harry, child politicians, and lords and ladies, which seem to make up a lot of Haphne fics.

I will say that I see Ice Cream recced to death (and it is in this thread as well) and I was excited to read it but didn't even make it halfway through. It's not bad but it's hardly the amazing work people made it sound to be. I'm not exactly inspired to check out other Haphne fics.
