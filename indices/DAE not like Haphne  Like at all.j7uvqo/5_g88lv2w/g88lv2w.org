I don't mind Haphne itself as a ship but I generally dislike the typical way it is executed (Slytherin politics, etc). However, some people like it. And vice versa, there's things I like that other can't stand.

I'm very reluctant in calling something "better than canon". Sure, there might be fics that I enjoy more than canon, but that's just down to taste. Canon isn't perfect but is generally far better written than fanfics.
