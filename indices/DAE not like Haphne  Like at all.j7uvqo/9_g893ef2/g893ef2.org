This post pretty much perfectly summerizes the meaning of my flair here. Finding a truely good Harry/Daphne fic is a struggle to say the least, the vast majority of them are full of bad tropes, and to be fair most of them are common tropes in all HP fics, but H/D fics are a magnet for them. So finding a fic for the pairing that doesn't have Harry Potter Black Peverell etc., helpful goblins, Ron/Dumbledore/Molly/Ginny Bashing, and other tropes is like finding a needle in a haystack.

But everyonce in a while you get absolute gems like linkffn(13323518) or promising but incomplete fics like linkffn(13648757) or the minimally tropey and quite fun fic linkffn(13133746) so it's just /mostly/ trash but occasionally pretty good. Also, you're under no obligation to like any ship if you don't that's fine, it's not for everyone.
