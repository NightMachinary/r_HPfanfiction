I mean I'm a fandom old timer so I am H/G and Hermione/Ron almost exclusively for my main pairings. I've “fought” my shipping war and have no interest in another. That being said there are plenty of poorly written fic for both those parings. That is the beauty and trouble of fan fic anyone can write and a lot of us are bad writers when we start. I know enough to include myself in that though I hope I have improved. When I started in the fandom (probably 2 decades ago!) there were sites that required you to have a beta to post there. I stuck to those for a reason. Also I'm still friends with my beta from that time so that's fun.
