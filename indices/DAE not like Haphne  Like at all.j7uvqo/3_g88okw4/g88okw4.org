Honestly the "Haphne is the best canon ship" joke was funny at first but after reading about the "Ice Princess" and "Slytherin politics" for the eightieth time I'm fucking sick of it. The fans (stans?) of the pairing aren't as bad as others I could name, but that's a /very/ low bar to clear.

If you want a complete destruction of fanon!Daphne tropes, may I recommend linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5287437/1/A-Half-Blood-Prince-Indeed]])? linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess]]) is another one you might enjoy.
