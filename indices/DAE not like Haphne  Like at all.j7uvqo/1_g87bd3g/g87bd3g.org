The way I see it is that Daphne is Jane doe from slytherin and many people want Harry to have a romance with slytherin girl. Daphne hasn't been characterised in the books and we only know the name, so she is the best choice (gives an authenticity since she is a character made by JKR but gives complete freedom to characterise her as she is a blank slate).

And I personally like Daphne because when I Google her, the first image that comes (I think the actress in the movie) is quite beautiful. So of course, I ship emüòÅ. And her younger sister is Draco's wife in the books, so it gives Daphne more authenticity even without talking about her.
