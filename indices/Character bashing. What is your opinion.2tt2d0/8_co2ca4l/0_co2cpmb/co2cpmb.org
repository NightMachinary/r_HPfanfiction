To me, it's not bashing as a long as a character acts in a way you could see them act in the original. I mean... Ron leaving Harry and Hermione in a terrible situation is literally canon. Having him do similar is not to far fetched. It becomes bashing the moment the author makes a character act like an idiot or just simply a horrible person as an excuse to make readers hate them and have bad things happen to them, however. For example; Dumbledore. Did he leave Harry with the Dursleys in hopes that they would beat him to near death so he could manipulate him better? No, he didn't. It might have been a poor decicion on his part but it wasn't made out of malice. So suddenly painting him the villain of the story is definitely bashing.

But that's my oppinion. What do you think?
