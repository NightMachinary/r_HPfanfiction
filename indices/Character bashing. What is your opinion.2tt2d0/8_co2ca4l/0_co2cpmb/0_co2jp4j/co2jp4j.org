But isn't the point of fanfiction characters acting in a different way than the original? Of course backstory and points of divergence are usually required, but I think this whole fixation people have on making characters act just like they did in the books just defeats the purpose of fanfiction. Like honestly, I didn't like how characters acted in the books, that's why I'm reading fanfiction instead.
