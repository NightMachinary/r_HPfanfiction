Well I mean, the character's personality would change through the different events they experience, especially in their formative childhood years. Like, I really hate the fics where they sort Harry into Slytherin, but he still acts and thinks like Gryffindor Harry. Like, maybe he'll pause. Few times to consider his words before blurting them out, but he remains hotheaded, moralistic, judgy, and quick to anger. But, fanfiction is meant to be enjoyed, so of course I'd never try to dissuade you from reading what you enjoy =) it just annoys me when people dismiss a fic just cos the characters don't act like their canon selves. Like, of course they're not?!
