Incredibly annoying. I have characters I dislike too, but I read an (otherwise canon) fic recently where Rita Skeeter was basically a Death Eater. Seriously? There are ways to write Rita Skeeter as an antagonist without making her OOC.

In addition, it's often just a convenient method to get a love interest out of the way, or to unite the characters behind a common goal. It's unnecessary, annoying, lazy, and one of the fastest ways to get me to click the back button.
