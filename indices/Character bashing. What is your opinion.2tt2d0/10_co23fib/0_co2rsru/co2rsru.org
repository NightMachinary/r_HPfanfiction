Exactly. If someone absolutly can't stand a character (like many people do Ron, for some reason) then it's understandable that they don't want to write about them or write about them positively at least. I think the best way of going about something like this is to just find a way to get them out of the story. Like, having Ron die in the final battle while heroically saving Fred's life. Or maybe getting him a job in a different country. Something like that.
