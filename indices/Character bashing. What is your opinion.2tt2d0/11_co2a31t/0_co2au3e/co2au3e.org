Well... for me to enjoy a story it's important that a characters actions fit his or her personality, and if an author bashes characters he takes away their credibility, dumbs them down, makes them do unrealistic and OOC things. bashing to me is not the same as writing a character differently or more negatively, I have no problem with authors writing a character different than it has been in canon, I only have a problem if they become one-dimensional and unrealistic in their motivations. That's bashing for me.
