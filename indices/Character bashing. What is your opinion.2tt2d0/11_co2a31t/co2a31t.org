Lot of hate for bashing here, which sadly is not a surprise. For me, as long as it's funny or otherwise entertaining I have zero problems with it. Fanfiction is meant to be entertaining, and that is really the only measure of success or failure I care about when evaluating anything an author chooses to do.
