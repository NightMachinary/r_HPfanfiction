I like it if it is done in a way that seems reasonable (that line may be crossed sooner when you like the character thats being bashed). Or in a way like it happens with Ron in /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/. He comes up once at the start just to be dismissed and made a side-character for the rest of the fanfiction. The scene where we see that Harry dislikes Ron in this one is short, intense and answers the question of what happens with him in this text. Its definitely bashing, but short enough to prove a point without being annyoing.

What I greatly dislike are fanfictions that make a cut in the story, sometimes even for a whole chapter, to bash a character. If you're so against someone in the story, just write them out of it but don't torture your readers with a rant about the character. Its not worth your or our time.

On the other side, what I actually love in my fanfiction is emphasizing traits that Rowling introduced but didn't write out well enough (Note that this is almost always a matter of perspective and subjective opinion and experience, and most often the case with the epilouge and post-battle canon). For example, a post-battle fanfiction starts right, for me, if Hermione and Ron break up shortly after, or better, the moment they don't feel like they'll die every minute now. It makes sense in my head that these two would not stay together without danger glueing them together. Unfortunatly such fanfiction get accused quite often of bashing either Hermione or Ron, sometimes even both.
