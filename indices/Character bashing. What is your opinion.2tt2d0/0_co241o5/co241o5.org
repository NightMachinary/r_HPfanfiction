To me, "bashing" is categorically poor writing. People have different ideas about what it means, though, so I'll spell out what I mean by it:

a) Setting up characters as straw men, who act, think, or speak in irrational, obvious, stupid, or outright senseless ways, all in the service of setting them up as a target to be bashed. Making their positions intractable - they will not change their minds, attitudes, or actions, even in the face of prudence or pragmatism.

b) Having the characters pop up throughout the narrative for the sole purpose of being bashed - they undergo no development, they don't move the plot along, they're simply there to be wrong, and for Harry to monologue at them about how wrong they are.

c) Taking the negative attributes of a canon character and highlighting them, while at the same time either inventing brand-new negative traits for them or getting rid of their positive qualities. Or, in some truly awful cases, both.

Examples:

Harry goes to Gringotts and discovers that, gasp!, he's never gotten a bank statement (never mind that no one in canon ever gets a bank statement), that Dumbledore, in his capacity as magical guardian has been stealing from Harry (never mind that "magical guardians" aren't a thing), and that Harry stands to inherent untold riches from the various Lordships he's entitled to (never mind the fact that this is blatantly stupid.)

If you're going to write an evil and/or manipulative Dumbledore, at least make him smart enough so that his plans can't be foiled by Harry walking into a bank. Point A - Dumbledore is a straw man and his plots are easily uncovered.

Dumbledore shows up at the bank with a big speech about the Greater Good (never mind that this was Grindelwald's pet phrase, not Dumbledore's) that rambles and makes him look like an idiot. Point B - the only reason Dumbledore is in the scene is to make him look bad and set him up for a fall. That's not a story, that's a cheap version of /The Count of Monte Cristo./

Aside: Revenge-as-plot can work, but not this clumsily. "Bashing" tries to deliver the payoff too early, before we feel that the characters have earned their just desserts. It's all about the buildup in a story like that.

Then, of course, you have Dumbledore nattering on about Harry's safety and forbidding him to leave and Harry pulling some awesomeness out of his ass to do it anyway. Point C - highlighting Dumbledore's negative attributes while forgetting about his intelligence and magical acumen.

In other words, bashing is terrible, don't do it. By all means, create huge, evil, messy problems for your protagonist. Just don't take a character and pull a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater][Ron the Death Eater]].
