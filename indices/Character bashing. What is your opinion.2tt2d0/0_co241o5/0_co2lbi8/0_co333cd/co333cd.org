I prefer the take that Dumbledore was just being way too involved because of the prophecy. Dealing with his finances and fan mail so that he wouldn't have a public image until he made one. I mean for fucks sake, he obviously wasn't evil, just a little touched in the head if you look at the overview.

I am saving my own comment because I am writing a piece of fanfic that won't be public anytime soon but it seems so easy to slip into Dumbledore bashing that I should remind myself not to. I swear fanfic authors just see characters with flaws and rip into them because of it.
