When the characters go off-the-deep-end evil, like Dumbledore summoning demons or making deals with the goddess of chaos or whatever, I'm done. When it's done as comic relief, for example Ginny and Ron driven out of their minds with jealous stupid, I really don't care, because they're not there to be characters, they're there to show the protagonists capable of curb stomping people. Usually their role in the plot-building is replaced by one of the more minor characters. It's not the epitome of quality literature, of course, but it's easy to write and easy to read. I won't start complaining about canon-compatibility again .-.
