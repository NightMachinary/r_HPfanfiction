I don't like it, I've never seen it used very well. It seems like a poor attempt at humour at a character's constant expense. I can stomach some of the mild bashing, but too much and I walk away. It subtracts from the overall writing and makes it appear very childish.

I don't consider pointing out character flaws or portraying them in a negative light as "bashing" I've seen some fics labelled bashing when all they've done is highlight some of the flaws and worked through them. I consider it bashing when it's one-dimensional and serves no point other than to illustrate that the author hates the character.

Peter Pettigrew is commonly bashed in Marauder fics which confuses me as the betrayal hurt because he WAS their friend. He wouldn't have been secret-keeper otherwise.
