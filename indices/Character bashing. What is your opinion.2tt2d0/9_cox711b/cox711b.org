Probably too late to chime in, but should it be considered bashing when a character is maligned in order to set up their "redemption" by the protagonist?

For example, there are several Harmony fics --- some quite popular --- that involve Independent!Smart!Harry schooling a very fanon!Hermione on how to "think for herself" (which, in practice, means "always agree with Harry"), that it's OK to disobey Rules and Authority, and so forth. Is that Hermione-bashing?

There are some fics along these lines with Ron.
