There was a time when bashing-fics where insanely popular. You could hardly get around on FF.net without a Harry whose inheritence from Sirius' death gained him powers / freedom. Or the Goblet of Fire helped. They were a fun read. But then it escalated to Dumbledore who was really Grindelwald or wanted to be next +Dark+ Light Lord and mostly the Weasleys were portrayed as nothing more then glorified Death Eaters. Except for Fred & George. Or Bill. Or Charlie. Love potions, an unknowing Arthur. And Molly (sometimes on her own, sometimes with help from "Dumbles" was the mastermind behind a lot of line theft plots.

Did I read them? Yes. Did I enjoy (a lot of) them? *Yes*.

But the difficulty with bashing-fics is that they quickly became repetitive, unoriginal and just a way for the author to vent his/her frustrations. And there is the crux of the matter. The author. Eventually bashing fics had nothing to do with the HP-books, or it's characters. [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]] talked about /straw men/ and that's exactly how they became. Completely different, one dimensional, characters who merely bore the names of Rowling's creations we know and love.

*TL;DR: In the beginning I loved bashing fics, but they became old /really/ soon.*
