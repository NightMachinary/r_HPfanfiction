'Harry' in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), did something similar. He even wrote letters to Voldemort:

#+begin_quote
  Dear Lord Voldemort,

  You may wonder why I, Harry Potter, have written you this letter. There are a few reasons for this.

  First, I would like to inform you that my associate has brewed a cauldron of polyjuice potion, while I have kidnapped several of your Death Eaters. Further, we just followed this owl to your base.

  By the time you've finished this letter, it will be too late.

  Love,

  Harry Potter

He basically tricked Voldemort killing his own people.
