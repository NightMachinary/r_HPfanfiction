Likely not but it's a usual trope. The heroes are intelligent clever and brave while the enemy is to dumb to realize they're being played. I've read a fic before where they used the taboo to lure death eaters to an ambush and significantly reduce their numbers before they realized what was happening and removed the taboo.
