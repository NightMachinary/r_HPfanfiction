There are many, many of these, but perhaps want to post this in the HPSlashFic sub because this sub tends to be anti-slash. Harry with multiple females is usually called harem instead of threesome (and will almost always include Hermione as one of his partners).

My favorite all-slash threesome is Harry/Draco/Snape, which I like to call Snarco (AKA "Two and a Half Slytherins"). A nice sweet story in this genre is [[http://www.pornbunnyfarm.com/pages/andthentherewerethree.html][And Then There Were Three]] by Swtalmnd.
