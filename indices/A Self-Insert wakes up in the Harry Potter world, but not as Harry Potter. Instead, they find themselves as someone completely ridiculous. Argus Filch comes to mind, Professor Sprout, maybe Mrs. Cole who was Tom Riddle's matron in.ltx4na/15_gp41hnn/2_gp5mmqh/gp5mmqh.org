Lucius Malfoy would be interesting though. Everyone kinda knows he's a death eather so who would ever trust him? Imagine awkward conversations with Draco about if he likes someone and Draco being like 'yeah dad, I know I should produce a Malfoy heir later, we talked about it' and fake Lucy being like 'why are you like this?' (to himself). Lucy ends up talking to Sevvy and somehow also becomes a spy (no one would expect the loyal Lucius to be a spy) et cetera
