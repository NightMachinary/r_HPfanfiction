I'm thinking I might, moving into the hinted at new franchise (at least mostly, I've got a stupid interlude planned) but I want to reread the original books I'll be moving into first to make it nice and fresh.

Suffice to say, I'm getting more ideas for this SI then my other fics... I want to continue the Valkyries one but I'm hitting writer's block, and I also want to transfer the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12724348/1/I-m-a-a-WHAT][Doctor Who crossover]] that I originally posted on FFN and continue it with a storyline involving Sister/Daughter Of Mine (Family of Blood) but that's a much more barebones skeleton concept atm... and I think I've kinda given up on ever transcribing the ideas I had on a Power Rangers rewrite due to sheer size (albeit I absolutely will have PR references in the SI given the... um... let's just say the favor Penny does for Ampexia in book 5 of the series I'd be moving into that I'm thinking I'd try to hijack).
