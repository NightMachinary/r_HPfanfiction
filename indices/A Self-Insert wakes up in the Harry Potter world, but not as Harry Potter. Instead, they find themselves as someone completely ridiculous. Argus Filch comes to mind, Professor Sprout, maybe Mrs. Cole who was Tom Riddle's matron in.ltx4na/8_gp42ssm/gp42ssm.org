If I was reincarnated into Madam Cole...Well, I'd have to change my behaviour with Tom by /a lot./ I'd tell him the truth about what I am, certainly. And explain to him what he was if he wasn't Hogwarts age. And if he was still just a baby, or it was just after his birth...Well, time for me to become little Tom's mother.
