"How do we know if a wand is correct?" Samantha, who used to be a perfectly fine science teacher wondered how she ended up like this. No really, what God's had she offended to end up not only in the Harry Potter universe, but as Ollivander. "You'll know if a wand is correct, for the wizard never chooses the wand but the wand chooses the wizard" she quickly said. She did read Harry Potter once and remembered something like this. "Ah yes, I see" the blond dude with long hair said. "And how exactly does one make a wand?" "Now, now Mr Malfoy, I'm sure you understand that is a family secret." the long haired dude just smiled. Really, he looks like some kind of hippy but the luxe kind. "I see, I would like to order a wand, I'll let someone bring the core." Now what the fuck is she supposed to do for this death eather weirdo?
