It was strange, this life.

When I'd finally worked out where I was - /what/ I was - I'd immediately broken down into a shaking, hissing fit that was the nearest I could manage to real laughter.

After all, what is a reader-insert story but a cheap, impossible power fantasy, and what could be more powerful and more fantastic than being an eleven-hundred pound spider with venom that could dissolve a whale and still have enough zest left in it to season the remaining slurry?

Of course, the oddity of my behavior immediately prompted attacks by several hundred of my much smaller kin. No honor among arachnids, it seemed.

The little blighters made quite a bit of headway before I could finally come to grips with my strange new way of perceiving the world. I was struck motionless for a moment when I tried to think about how to move my body (called to mind that joke about a millipede who can't walk as soon as someone asks him how he keeps track of all those feet) but once my wee offspring's venom started to really sting, whatever passed for adrenaline flooded my system and I shot into movement.

My initial stompings and stampings wiped out dozens and dozens of the smaller attackers. One particularly tenacious bugger (pun intended) had gotten wholly clamped onto one my elbows. Knees. Whatever. Between his chomping fangs and dripping venom, he was coming dangerously close to seriously hurting me. Waving the limb about frantically did little to dislodge him, and I could hardly devote more legs to any such endeavors, as the full complement of my limbs was busy re-establish my status as the leader of this little group.

I eventually quieted the mob but the persistent one managed to get all the way through my former leg joint and fell to the ground in a squelching heap, dark ichor briefly spurting out of the remnants of my leg. It fell in a way that left it briefly trapped under the severed limb and that moment was all I needed. A swift downward plunge of my fangs popped his carapace, spraying fluids across my face and dropping it immediately dead.

The exertion caught up with me and I felt a bone-deep weariness. I slowly lowered myself to the ground and found my smaller forelimbs reflexively cleaning gunk off the six eyes I had left.

The violence was fast, brutal, and strangely at a remove. A lifetime of smashing bugs I didn't like, perhaps? An innate inability to empathize with non-mammalian life? My brood, still hundreds strong, all fell motionless. I could sense no great emotion from them, no disturbance. It was is if their attacking me for a perceived weakness and my casually slaughtering a quarter of them was of no particular note.

I should have felt tired, but instead I could only be said to feel fatigue. "Tired" implies a certain set of feelings and expectations - heavy, drooping eyelids, a warm blanket and soft pillow, the expectations of dreams. Perhaps a fuzzing of vision as one burns the midnight oil, or a sour taste on the back of the tongue. Now I felt none of that. Could feel none of that. Instead, there was merely a faintly distracting sensation coming from my alien body, a sensation that clearly said "you need rest" but felt more like an irritating alarm than a visceral sensation that was /mine/.

Trying my very best to avoid thinking about it, I simply willed myself to "speak" to my children, "take me to Hagrid."

I suppose that I succeeded, as a half-dozen of the larger ones broke from the group and scampered off into the woods. I ignored the fatigue-alarm and followed.

It were strange, this morning.

I'd planned to get a good bunch of work done on repairing the thestral paddock, what with all the damage done to it this past summer. Foaling season had been a tough one, and the whole herd got right ornery when a mare died in birth. Then I was gonna go check up on the rumor about a dead unicorn. Not that centaurs would lie bout somethin like that, of course, but you couldn't trust somethin that strange until you'd seen it with you very own eyes, now could you.

All those plans went right out when I opened my door and found myself starin' right into ol' Aragog's eyes. Most of the eyes, anyway. Poor feller had been in a right scrap, missing at least three or four of those black orbs and was that... sweet Merlin, what was dangerous enough out there to take one of ol' Aragog's legs!

"Hagrid," he hissed, his voice soundin quite off.

"Aragog!" I cried, rushing forward to inspect his wounds.

He flinched back slightly. That were so unexpected it brought me up short. Never once in fifty years had Aragog done anythin other than embrace me. What was this? Was he hurt worse than I could tell? Was he dyin?

My eyes started to sting a bit as thought took hold a me.

"What is the date, Hagrid?" he asked.

The strangeness of the question cut off any fear I was feelin. What could an acromantula need to know the date for?

"Why it's August 31," I answered, dabbing at the edges of my eyes.

"What year?"

Stranger and stranger this were gettin.

"1991, a course, but why..."

"Oh thank god."

God? What? Had Aragog gone and et a bunch of muggle priest folks?

"Rubeus, listen to me very /very/ carefully," he hissed. And I surely did listen for this was now shapin up to be the strangest thing I'd ever seen at Hogwarts. "I have important news about Harry Potter. You must fetch the Headmaster immediately. Harry's life is in danger! Rubeus Hagrid! Go! GO NOW!" by the end o what he was sayin, the hissing had grown into a full-on shriek.

My heart started poundin in mah chest and I took off like I was bein chased by a thousand inferi. Harry! Was in danger! I had to get the Headmaster now!

It was strange and beautiful, this thing called life.

The world was a place wondrous beyond measure. Magic was a miracle surpassing all understanding and expectation. Over a century of swimming easily through the currents and tides of magic and still it found ways to leave me utterly speechless. For all my power, my supposed brilliance, I was a tiny, meaningless mote before the majesty of magic herself.

Before me was a giant talking spider. It hissed and wheezed and revealed secrets impossible. It claimed to have prophetic dreams and to have felt a connection to Harry and "a dark fragment of something lodged in his scar," and it revealed the past, the present, the future.

A spider seer.

Wonders would never cease.

I smiled behind my beard and promised Aragog everything he asked.

And three short days later, Tom's only remaining horcrux was Harry himself. A thorny puzzle, to be sure, but the spider seer offered tantalizing suggestions. We would crack it together, I was sure.

"Great Merlin's ghost!" Amelia Bones exclaimed, whipping her wand out and pointing it at the largest acromantula she'd ever seen. The barest beginning of an incantation was on her lips before she found herself knocked against the rear wall of the top box over the Hogwarts quidditch pitch. Her wand sailed the short distance to Dumbledore's outstretched hand.

The old fool had the audacity to smile and twinkle at her after assaulting her! She stood up, her face revealing the storm of indignation aimed at the old goat before she suddenly remembered the reason for her initial fright.

She raked her eyes across the box. It had obviously been expanded quite a bit, as it was now accommodating not just the announcer and a few faculty members, but a dozen-odd VIPs as well as a *fourteen-foot wide acromantula!*

It wheezed out a strange noise that Amelia slowly realized was laughter, "did nobody warn you about my presence?" it asked.

Next to it, a man in fine silk robes leaned over and nudged one of the beast's legs and stage-whispered, "can't count on those ministry folks to stay abreast of all the latest school gossip, now can we?"

Oh good lord was that Lucius Malfoy, joking with a XXXXX-class beast?!

"Oh you cheeky bugger, you slipped my paperwork through Creatures and never notified DMLE, did you?" it again gave out that strange hiss-laughter.

"Forgive me my little jokes, dear Aragog."

"I suppose it's all one big joke, isn't it?"
