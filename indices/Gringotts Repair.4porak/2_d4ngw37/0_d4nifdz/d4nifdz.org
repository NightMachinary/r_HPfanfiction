Well, I figured they would have enchantments on their stuff so it doesn't break so easily and last longer. Thus probably also harder to fix, and if it was easy to fix why would they pass a perfectly good chance to extort some money. Also there the damage Voldemort did on his rampage soon after, a little detail like who was actually responsible is insignificant :P.
