Ahhh, /tipsy/... I kept looking for "twisted" and "twisty" and "twirly".

Thanks!

To use the bot for fanfiction.net, you do "linkffn(Name of Fanfic by Author of Fanfic)"

So, for this fic, it would be linkffn(Tipsy Time Travel Tale by Yunaine)

If the fic is on ao3, you just change "linkffn" to "linkao3".

Instructions are also on the sidebar --->
