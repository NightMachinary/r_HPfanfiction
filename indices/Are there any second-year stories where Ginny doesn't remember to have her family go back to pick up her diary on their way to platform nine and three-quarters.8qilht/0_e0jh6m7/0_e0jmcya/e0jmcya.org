A fuming Riddle, from within the Diary, does /everything he can/ to influence people to get him back to Hogwarts to Ginny Weasley. No one believes him, or when they do, they insist he's in love with her.

Meanwhile, at Hogwarts, Gilderoy Lockhart falls madly in love with Sir Cadogan, and the Basilisk, left to roam free, dies from chocolate overdose after finding a passage to Honeydukes.
