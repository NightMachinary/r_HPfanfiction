Yes, but it's not incomplete. That's just where the story ends. If you liked that you might enjoy linkffn(Harry Potter and the Never-Ending Summer), which was /heavily/ inspired by SoC. Also, linkffn(The Green in the Grey) is pretty damn good, though it's still being updated. Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) has some good Honks moments, though it's incomplete and hasn't been updated in years. Another one is linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool), which does involve some time-travel/dimension hopping, but it's really well-done.
