/Harry Potter and the Irish Choice/ by /DisobedienceWriter/ linkffn(3771102) is a multi-part almost novel-length story, which I liked a lot when it was written and published. Although I haven't gone back to re-read it in a few years, I still have fond memories of it.

The first story that comes to mind is a different story though, mostly because its almost 900k words make this an epic tale and the longest Harry Potter fanfic I ever read. It's called /The Brave new World/ by /bellerophon30/ linkffn(2697521)
