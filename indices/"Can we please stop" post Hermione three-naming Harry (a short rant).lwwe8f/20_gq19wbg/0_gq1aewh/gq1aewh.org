Well, it is the title of the first chapter in the first book.

...

Edited to add: okay, turns out that's a fair point. It's the title of the first chapter, and the last words in that chapter. That's it.

Books 2 through 4: 0 instances

Book 5: 2 instances in the /last chapter./ (That actually makes it nearly five books in between mentions!)

Book 6: 1 mention in chapter 4.

Book 7: more instances than the rest of the series combined

- 1 mention in chapter 11
- 1 in chapter 17
- 1 in chapter 19
- 1 in chapter 22
- 1 in chapter 35
- 2 in chapter 36

So, in total 12 times in the entire series.
