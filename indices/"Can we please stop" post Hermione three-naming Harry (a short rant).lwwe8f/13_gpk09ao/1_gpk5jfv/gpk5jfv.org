Not really a southern thing. I grew up in California and my mother always used first-middle when she was mad at us. I do the same to my nephews because their mother (my sister) does and I started copying her speech patterns with them.

One comedian (can't remember which one) once said that the reason kids have middle names is so they know when they're in trouble.
