I didn't know it's not actually a Southern thing (I'm from the UK). I will say that it's very much seen as a Southern US thing in my experience, even if it isn't one. It's very much in the same stereotype as "Oh my, I think I'm getting the vapours, I'm going to go and sit out on the porch and drink mint juleps and fresh lemonade while I watch my strapping boys catching horses in the fields" and similar. :)
