Who said anything about not liking the pairing because of the age gap? I don't like the pairing because there was not a shred of romance between the two of them in the book. We see her liking Ron (and later him liking her back), but Harry never had a single non-platonic thought about her. She ACTED like his bossy older SIBLING the entire seven years.
