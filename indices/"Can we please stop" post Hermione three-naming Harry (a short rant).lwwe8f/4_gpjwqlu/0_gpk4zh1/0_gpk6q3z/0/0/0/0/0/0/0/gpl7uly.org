All I ask, if they want me to believe a Harry/Hermione story, is for them to ADD THAT SPARK.

But usually they just pick a random canon moment and suddenly have them decide to date/snog without having any of the build-up. Which is why I'm not a big fan of Harry/Hermione. I read plenty of pairings that weren't in canon, but for some reason writers of this particular pairing don't think they need a build-up because they were already spending so much time together---which is exactly WHY they need to rewrite some of the canon to make it work.
