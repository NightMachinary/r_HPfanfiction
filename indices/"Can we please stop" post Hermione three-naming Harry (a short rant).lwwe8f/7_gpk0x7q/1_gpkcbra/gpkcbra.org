It all depends on how the character relationships are portrayed, yeah. It can come across as bossy/mothering, or it could be a friendly thing - both interpretations could work fine.

I think a lot of people get pet peeves because they read badly written stories that use similar scenes/tropes, and then dump it on those tropes because that's a consistent element. Which I can certainly understand (both why they do so and the frustration), even if I disagree.
