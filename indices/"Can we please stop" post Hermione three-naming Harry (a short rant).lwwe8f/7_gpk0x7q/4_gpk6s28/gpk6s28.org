I suppose I can see that as, "I don't do it but others might." I don't remember ever calling my friends by their middle names except in jest (but I have a bad memory when it comes to my childhood). I only did that to my younger siblings. But I can see that children are more likely to scold their friends than adults are, because they're still learning socially acceptable behaviors.

Certainly, as an adult, I don't think it's my place to scold my adult friends. I might tell them that I thought their behavior was misguided, or ask why they did something, but honestly only if they brought it up themselves.
