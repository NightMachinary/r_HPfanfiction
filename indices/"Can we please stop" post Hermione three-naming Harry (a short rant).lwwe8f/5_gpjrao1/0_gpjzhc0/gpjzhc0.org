Oops guilty. Threw it in the first chap, guess I read so many fics I got with the flow. Not a Harry/Hermione thing though. Actually a story where Harry turns Hermione into an owl accidentally and her thoughts go "Harry James Potter! You wait till I can use my wand again"... Not sure if thoughts are as offending as speech though
