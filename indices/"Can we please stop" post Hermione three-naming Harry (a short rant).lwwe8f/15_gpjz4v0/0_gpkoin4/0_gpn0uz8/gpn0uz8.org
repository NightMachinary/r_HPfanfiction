I don't claim to have too many Harmony fics as I'm not really a fan of it, but I thought that most of the fandom hated it because of the bashing which comes with it.

And the weird part - as well as bashing Ron, Ginny, Dumbledore, Molly, I've read one called 'Not needed' which pretty much bashed Hermione ... and there were a whole bunch of Harmony shippers in the comments who were cheering her on as she basically>! acted like the horcrux to Ron.!<
