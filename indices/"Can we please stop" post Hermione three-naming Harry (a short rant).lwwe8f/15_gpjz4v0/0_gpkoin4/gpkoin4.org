Yes. Yes there are. My biggest problem is with the stories where Hermione is flat out portrayed as a domineering batch BY THE AUTHOR who is right about everything even when she's not, and instead of calling her on her bulletin at any time, everyone (especially Harry) just rolls over and takes it, and anybody who dares to argue is a racist who hates muggleborns or something. I can take a lot, but that's the point when I dip. I hate most Harmony stories these days because so many of them haven't figured out how to write people with flaws and personality traits.
