"Ronald BILLIOUS Weasley!"

"Uh-oh," Ron says with a nervous giggle. "I think she found us."

"Harry. James. POTTER!!"

"What wash your firsht clue," slurs Harry, as he concentrates on not dropping his bottle while attempting to put it down.

"I leave you two for FIFTEEN MINUTES because I needed to escort a Firstie to the dungeons, and THIS is what I come back to?!"

Hermione is well beyond steamed or even fuming, but Harry's somewhat confident that she's still not yet livid, so while Ron's dander is well and truly raised, Harry raises his bottle instead. "Want some?"

After a short pause while his two best mates stare at him incredulously, Hermione huffs before flopping down between the pissed Gryffindors, snatching the proffered bottle before Harry could change his mind. "I need a drink," she groans out. "It took me fifteen minutes instead of five because Professor Snape decided to interrogate me over why I was escorting one of HIS Firsties, instead of one of HIS Prefects." She takes a pull from the bottle before huffing in indignation once more. "I swear, you'd think he was trying to punish the poor Firstie for getting lost and and asking for help from the first person she came across, all while trying to somehow make it my fault enough that he could take away House Points!"

At this, Ron nods sagely, bumping his shoulder against Hermione's. "That's what I've always told you about him, innit? Snape's a bloody tosser."

As his two friends once again start to bicker over Snape's professorship, Ron's language, and whatever tangents those bring up, Harry lets out a heavy but happy sigh, brushing his bangs out of his eyes as he opens up another bottle. Exams were finally over, stress was being vented left right and center, and his care package from home had had a wonderful selection of spirits. If this was what being a Sixth Year was like, then he felt confident that the next year would be a breeze.

Of course, later, he'd blame that overconfidence on the alcohol.
