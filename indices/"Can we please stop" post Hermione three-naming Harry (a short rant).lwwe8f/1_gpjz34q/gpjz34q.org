I couldn't agree more.

I find this problem often appears simultaneously with characters (almost always women that happen to be his partner?) that seem emotionally erratic.

It's not normal that every time something bad happens (and I mean everything from a real, actually scary, fight to being called a bad name), the girl breaks down in fear/fright/paralysis/tears and needs a strong unaffected man (normally Harry) to calm them down and stay functional.

It's not normal that when the girl always breaks into tears at the drop of a hat, and needs time to cry out their happiness before they can eat their breakfast every morning.

It not normal that immediately following that, said girl is trying to be a mother (using your three name rather consistently) because their teenage man decided to play a prank/have an alcoholic beverage/do literally anything not prescribed by school rules. And said man immediately accepts that lady is right... Because that's her job?

Honestly, I can never figure out what the intent is for these characters. Is it some weird Mary Sue fantasy which I just don't understand? Is it drama/romance writing where the skills of the authir just doesn't have the capacity to represent their idea? Or maybe just some weird misogynistic mind-set which is bleeding into the writing?

Personally I find it extremely off putting when I read works like this, which sometimes have some really interesting novel ideas and plots for their stories.

Edit: changed my description of the characters to be more appropriate
