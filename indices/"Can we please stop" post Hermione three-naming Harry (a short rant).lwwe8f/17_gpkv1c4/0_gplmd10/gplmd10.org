Agreed, nothing pulls me out of a fanfic faster than someone trying to blatantly "correct" what the author sees as a flaw with the canonical character.

Personality traits (both good and bad) are what make the character have some amount of depth. Take away somewhat negative characteristics like Hermione being somewhat overbearing and you've turned her into a Mary Stu.
