No, I can't see the difference, nor the absurd presumptions you're making over someone using a full name. Hermione saying 'Harry James Potter' =/ 'I believe I am your superior so I should be in charge and screw your dead mother because I'm your mommy now'. Not to mention how some people just naturally /are/ the parent of the group without it automatically meaning they're looking down on everyone.

No, this issue is pretty obviously on your end. Particularly if you think the full name is a bigger issue than your fantasy Harry biting her head off for using it.
