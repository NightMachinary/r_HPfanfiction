I honestly *hate* when girls treat these boys like children, like they are their mother! Like the slapping at the back of the head? What if the roles were reversed? I don't know why people romanticise girls treating their partner like that, I couldn't ever hurt anyone like that! Especially not for a stupid reason like eating, being “stupid”, not doing something or just saying their honest opinion!

(Now I'm going to move over to RonxHermione, for a bit) Listen Hermione, I love you and all- but you are *not* his mother! Stop telling him to “behave”, or do his homework! You are his friend (Maybe girlfriend, depends on timeline)! You are not there to raise him, help him out! tell him to shut up! I know how he can act, and I know it can be very frustrating but it's honestly so annoying to sit here and read about you basically controlling him, acting like his mother?! pull yourself together, neither of you are perfect but you can improve, I know it.

Hermione, *you are not his mother, nor his sister* you have no right to act like you can lecture him!

Ugggghhhhh, I can't type it all out but I want you guys to know how much it frustrates me to see the unequality in these relationships! and toxicity, abuse and sexism.

I'm sorry but I hate when people make personality examples as well, and use gender, the “girls are timid and uncertain, and boys are rude, cocky and always think they're right” is so so aggravating!

While I'm taking about it, everything can go both ways! Sexism, Racism, Harassment and so so so so much more!

Please, think of how it would be if the roles were reversed.

But getting back on topic, it gets me so incredibly mad when the relationships are toxic and abusive but it's fine! because the girl was doing it, the guy either deserves it or she's just being cute- *but either way, girls are just pure, cute, innocent beings... *

As you can see by my rant, which does not even compare to everything I want to say, and I'm sorry if I'm being overdramatic, and it's “just fiction” bit this matter awakens a rage in me that just- bleh. G Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah! As you can probably see from the rant above this, I really really really REALLY- uh, reallly hate unequality!
