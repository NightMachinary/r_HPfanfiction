Don't know a fic about this, but you might wanna read this.

Ron can be the most important character in the story, if the author uses him correctly. IMO the best way to make Ron impactful is make him the heart and mind(not the brain) of the Trio. Ron is essentially a people's person. Harry is the hot-head who jumps into anything blindly out of flawed morality. Hermione is this obsessed genius who thinks only way to get a control of a situation is know everything related to it.

Ron...He is the cool-minded one. He sees a problem, he sees the risk, he sees a obvious solution. He knows the large consequence, he knows that spiders are dangerous, House Elves don't want to be freed, the ministry is generally corrupt. He is provides an unique view of being raised around magic. He can talk to others and let them understand what an impolite Harry wants them to do. Or let them know why Hermione is buried nose deep under this particular book. He cares about these two, because they see him and need him just as much as he needs them.

Like the best moment in canon Book one, "Are you a witch or not?". He's 11 and doesn't know the exact fire spell to take out the vines, but Hermione who should know is panicking. He points out the solution. Same with Book three, "You'd have to go through us", he will risk it when the need arises. Though, I'd have to think a few more of these instances, which became..rare in later books.

So, making him a little Mad-eye or uber manipulative or even knowing obscure facts, might not be the best way to give what he deserves. Make him the one normal guy surrounded by crazy things happening and without him both his friends would've died in like a first few months of the first year.
