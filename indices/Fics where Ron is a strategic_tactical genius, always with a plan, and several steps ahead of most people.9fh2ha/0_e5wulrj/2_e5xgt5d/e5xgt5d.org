I, for one, am not. The main sub likes to jerk off a couple times a week about /poor Ron/. People overcompensate for the movies having to take content away from Ron because Rupert Grint simply cannot act by saying Ron is actually the greatest character of all time ever created in the history of the universe. Then they complain in the same breath, without a trace of irony, about how much they hate 'perfect' Hermione.

I don't need that circlejerk here as well.
