Ron is a Slytherin and develops his tactical/chess side in my series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). It's a political AU, and while Ron is not on a Dumbledore level, he's certainly much more aware of things than in canon. I'm currently on the third of the series and have over 150k words total posted.
