can you cite a study or give any other examples showing that mpreg in fanfiction is a mental illness? i see you have clearly followed this thought to its logical conclusion with such a statement as "option one is blatantly obvious".

I also checked up on the pottermore and the article does not once mention anything about mental disabilities. Rowling only ever talks about physical illnesses and disabilities. Not sure how that means autism and other mental illnesses can't exist in the wizarding world. You just have to read the books to see there are any number of characters suffering from its various forms. the Longbottom's, Sirius Black, .../Harry Potter/.

in regards to sociopathy: it is not a nature vs. nurture argument, but an influence of environments, genetics, and neurology. And even then the concept of just 'Nature vs. Nurture' isn't even a valid one depending on who is asked. you can easily google this stuff.

And finally... what does being a sociopath, or being transgender, or being mentally ill in any way have anything to do at all with the concept of mpreg in /fanfiction/?
