i think you're confused about what mpreg in fanfiction is. it is not a transgender male getting pregnant or giving birth, it is a cis male with male sex organs who identifies as male getting pregnant or giving birth. In hp slash fics because of some form of magic or because of being a separate, third gender, like in a/b/o works.

I'm personally not a fan of pregnancy in /any/ form, you're allowed to dislike it. I'm just confused why you brought in all these irrelevant facts that have nothing to do with the concept, said people who write it are mentally ill, and reacted so strangely to someone stating how and why it works in harry potter fanfiction.
