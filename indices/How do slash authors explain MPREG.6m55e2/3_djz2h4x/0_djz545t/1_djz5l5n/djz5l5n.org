I've never heard anyone say magic was supposed to take out mental illnesses. Look at Neville's parents. They were tortured into insanity with no hope for a cure. Similarly, Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange are crazy, despite having magic.

I also don't know what mental illness has to do with pregnancy in the context of fanfiction, unless you're saying the people who write and/or read about MPREG are mentally ill. Or do you mean the authors are writing characters who are secretly trans? That would be an entirely different story.

Finally, there is a lack studies on transsexualism. Where are you getting your statistics?
