All of the above comment. And in one fic, the wizard had to transfigure his appendix into a womb. In a crossover, the wizard had to turn into a woman for the conception and duration of the pregnancy. In another, the men brewed a potion and contributed DNA to it, then gave it to a woman to drink, which impregnated her.

Also, because magic. In a world where you can turn into an animal or another person, it doesn't start to seem so far fetched.
