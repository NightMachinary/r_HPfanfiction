Not a slash author but this is really just about creativity.

1. Your own magic protects the child. If you get pregnant in a female form and revert back to male form your magic will make sure the minimum environment for the baby to exist is there. That doesn't mean external changes so C section time in 9 months or drink a potion to acquire the necessary parts needed to launch a baby from your hanger.

2. Emergency! Your wife can lose the baby or you can carry it for her but you've got to make a choice RIGHT NOW!

3. You sleep with Zeus there's a chance you get pregnant. Even if Zeus happens to woman at the time. You being male doesn't even matter.
