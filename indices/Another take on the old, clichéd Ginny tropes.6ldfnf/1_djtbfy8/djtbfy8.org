I can't say I've read such a fic, though my tastes don't gravitate towards that genre anyway.

I must say I really hate these tropes, the latter especially since it really has no basis in canon. Ginny was in a long-term relationship with two guys over nearly 2.5 years. Then, when Harry breaks it off, she (presumably) doesn't date or anything the entire year he is gone, then gets back together with him and winds up marrying him.

I've read a bunch of H/G fics where the author gives Ginny another boyfriend or has her casually date around at school and changes virtually nothing else canonically. It's as if the authors buy into Ginny being promiscuous but realize canon doesn't support it and thus feel the need to up her hook-up count.
