Oh man I have SO many of these so I'll only rec my very very favorites. But for later, here's my [[http://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&bookmark_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=99&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bquery%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=1&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&user_id=katelawyer86][full list of Drarry recs]].

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2699639][The Vanishing Department]] - The premise of this fic is that anything that is vanished (as opposed to banished) goes to a department in the Ministry. It used to go to the RoR, but after the fire, it was re-directed to the ministry. Draco is put in charge of the department as part of his parole, and when Harry accidentally vanishes everything inside of Grimmuald Place, he and Harry work together to get it all back. This fic is sweet, well written, and in-character.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4123870][Draco at Nineteen]] - this is short, but still so so great and worth a read. This fic is kinda like a HP mini version of the Time Travelers Wife. In the future, Harry and Draco are in a relationship and 25 year old Harry goes back in time to visit Draco on his 19th birthday during 8th year Hogwarts. Even though this is really short, it is incredibly detailed and paints a really beautiful picture of Harry and Draco's life.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124273][The Printed Press]] - Incredibly cute and well thought out fic where Draco is hired to write Harry's memoirs. I love journalist Draco (probably because of TURN) and this fic was angsty but not too crazy, well written and sweet. I also love that the plot device of the memoirs forces Harry and Draco to talk about all of the things that happened at hogwarts year by year - it is so cathartic for a Drarry fan and suuuper well done. I highly recommend it!

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3114812][Helix]] - THE Drarry Christmas fic. Set 8th year

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6239806][The Stately Homes of Wlitshire]] - brand new fic and already a favorite. So well written.
