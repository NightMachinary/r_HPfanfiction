Regulus. He is not in the books like, at all bar a brief mention but I can see his face and personality so well in my head because of the amount of Regulus I've read.

And I can tell you all about the complicated relationship he had with his brother. How they were so close as kids because Sirius used to cover for him but that broke down sometime during Sirius's 3rd year when Regulus came to Hogwarts. By Sirius's 5th year they were barely talking and never in public but they used to sneak up to the Astronomy tower at night to talk in their posh, dry sarcasm, under the stars because it was something they could never see at home in London (ironically, Sirius always saw more of his family from hogwarts than he ever did at home.) By the end of the years they weren't talking at all but Regulus would still curb attention from Sirius at home when he could. Problem was Sirius was also trying to curb attention from Reg so they both ended up getting in trouble for it but neither would talk to the other about it. When Sirius left, Reg spiralled further and further into Dark Arts, just desperately trying to keep himself alive. Which is where he found Horcruxes... and why he knew he had to destroy them...
