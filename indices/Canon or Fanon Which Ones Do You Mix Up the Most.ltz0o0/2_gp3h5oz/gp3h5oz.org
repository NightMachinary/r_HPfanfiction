So it doesnt happen very often in my case, the only one which i remember is that i thought Sirius middle name is Orion and James' is Fleamont, but they dont have one in Canon. And a few house traits like that slytherins care about brotherhood and hufflepuffs are good finders.

I often see that people forget that Hermione didnt know what mudblood means in CoS. And many portray Lyall Lupin as an abusive, homophobic father in fanfics and thanks too atyd many think that Remus father is a bad father, even though he is supportive and still loved his wife and son in canon
