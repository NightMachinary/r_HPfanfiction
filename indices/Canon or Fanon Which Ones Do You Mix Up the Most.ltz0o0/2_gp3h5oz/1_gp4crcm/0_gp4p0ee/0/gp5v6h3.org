Yes. And many forget that it is ONLY in the movies. I am still angry how they portrayed Ron in the movies. Like why should Hermione know what it means?! And one of my favourite scenes in PoA, the book, is the one in which Ron stands up from the bed with his broken leg and goes infront of Harry and says to Sirius, who they think is a murderer, that he needs to kill them all when he wants to kill Harry. In the movie it isnt as near as a sweet sign of friendship because Hermione does it
