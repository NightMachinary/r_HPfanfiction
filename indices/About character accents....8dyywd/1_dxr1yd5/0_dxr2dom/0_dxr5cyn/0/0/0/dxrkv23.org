I find this to be one of the most annoying ways in which authors try to assert a character's foreign-ness. Why would they use their mother tongue for, as you say, simple words which they learned in their very first English class? In spite of it being my first language, I can assure you that I don't respond to questions with the German "ja" or "nein" and don't know any foreigners who would and it therefore sounds really contrived when this is done in fan fiction. The only exception to this I can think of is where the character is surprised or shocked and reverts to their first language as this might be a more instinctive response for them.

One of the more natural ways I've seen for authors to get the accent across is to do the reverse: have the character (occasionally) struggle with difficult words which they wouldn't be expected to know. I think I've seen this used mostly in interactions between Viktor and Hermione.
