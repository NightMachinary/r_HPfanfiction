That sounds like more of a mutual thing which seems fine. I could see this happening between Bill and Fleur for example or even Fleur and Hermione (maybe because she picked up some French when she was there on holiday). But I think it needs to be presented as a couple or friendship type thing rather than throwing in random foreign words because the character is an idiot.

Taking it back to real life, if I'm chatting to a friend and one of us says "ja" it's funny. If I do it with a random colleague or a stranger it's pretty stupid.
