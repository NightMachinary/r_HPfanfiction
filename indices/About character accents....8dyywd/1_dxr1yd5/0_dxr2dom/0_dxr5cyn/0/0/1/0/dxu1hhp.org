Not really through, “ et” breaks up the story's pace, it's like adding a random word in a sentence that has no place there. Maman and Papa can be added when the French character is speaking to their parents but in a normal sentence? No. It's fucking annoying to revert to another language when talking to someone and I assure you nobody doesn't it willingly or even subconsciously.
