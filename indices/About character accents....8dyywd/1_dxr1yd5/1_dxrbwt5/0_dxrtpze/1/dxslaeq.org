I think they're referring to authors who take Oliver's quidditch obsession too far, to the point of mentioning it in every scene he's near, or having him speak only in quidditch terms. It's also possible that, seeing as this is a thread about accents, they're talking about his canonical Scottish accent. I haven't personally seen any fanfiction go overboard with phonetic spelling or slang, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happens; Scottish accents are rarely handled well by non-natives.
