I just don't do it, really.

Within my current story, Fleur being a main character presented this quandary and I decided that I'd just write her without an accent. I think using a dialect within speech often removes the value of the words themselves, or the value of the words is lost in the cumbersome writing, rather.

I think it depends, though, in a more general sense. As with all things in writing, does it serve a purpose?

Does writing in a dialect help with immersion? Does the use of a dialect help show a characteristic of a character? Do you change the 'thickness' of the written accent over time to show progression?

If so, then I would do so. But, if it doesn't serve a purpose, it feels to me to be a waste of time.
