It can be done well, but honestly if the reader wants them it's much easier for them to do it themselves.

About a third of the way through one fic (where Lucius Malfoy took over after Voldemort's death and forced the Order into exile in France) I realised that Harry, Ron, and the other second-generation exiles would all have grown up in France, so I spent the rest of the fic reading their lines in ridiculously over-the-top French accents. It was hilarious, but if they'd been written in it would have gotten old really quickly.
