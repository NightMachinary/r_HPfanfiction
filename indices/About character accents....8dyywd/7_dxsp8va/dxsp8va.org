I expect it to be done for Hagrid. It doesn't feel right otherwise.

I'll forgive it for the foreign characters, though it's difficult to pull off convincingly and a little goes a long way.

For any native English speakers, please no.

If you are trying to give your characters a voice, word choice is far more important than word pronunciation.
