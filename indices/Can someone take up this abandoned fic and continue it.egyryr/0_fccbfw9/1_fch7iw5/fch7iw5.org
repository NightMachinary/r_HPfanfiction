There's nothing to stop someone from basing a fanfic on a fanfic, as long as the original author gets credited. It would be pretty hypocritical for a fanfic author to complain about someone basing fanfic on their work.

Of course, there's also nothing stopping the original author from taking down their incomplete story, and someone else making a copy of it and posting it would be plagiarism.
