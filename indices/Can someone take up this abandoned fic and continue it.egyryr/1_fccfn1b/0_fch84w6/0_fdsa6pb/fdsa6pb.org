Not illegal as such, no. It's complicated and depends on your jurisdiction, but while, say, offering downloads of a fanfic for money would almost certainly cross the line in every jurisdiction, paying someone to write fanfic (which is then posed for anyone to read) may well be OK. I know of a number of fanfic writers who have Pateron accounts, for example, though they could just be too small-time to draw legal attention.
