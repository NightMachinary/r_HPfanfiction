Honestly, based on how this fandom treats Malfoy, I'm kinda glad. Like, the thing that would make this dynamic interesting, the fact that Malfoy uncritically accepts all of his family's awful beliefs where Sirius rejected them, is widely ignored by most writers, who, from what I can tell, seem to either write him as if he isn't an entitled, supremacist, classist bully, or not see anything wrong with him being an entitled, supremacist, classist bully.
