*Harry Potter*

I remember house elves having a hivemind in something, and I think Harry could connect to it, but I can't remember the name of it.

Found one! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11373351/1/][/Warning: Past Soul Bind Performance Not Indicative of Future Prophets/]] Not the one I was thinking of, admittedly.

*Crossovers*

linkffn(Fate's Gamble by Lupine Horror) Type-Moon crossover. It's more heavily featured in the sequel. Harry is a hivemind with himself and has multiple bodies. It makes sense. I promise.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Swarm by Beyogi) Starcraft crossover. Zerg.

*Non-HP*

linkffn(Transcendent Humanity by Solaris242) HFY Mass Effect. Technological hivemind.

linkffn(Biomass Effect by Beastrider9) Mass Effect/Prototype. Biotechnology and a hivemind.

linkffn(Enemy Returned by Palladius) Mass Effect/X-COM. Chapter 8 describes an artificial hivemind.
