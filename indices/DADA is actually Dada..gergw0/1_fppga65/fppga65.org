The canon curse on the DADA Professor position is, itself, a dadaist installation. It subverts the dominant paradigm of defending against the Dark Arts---learn some spells here, learn about some creatures and countermeasures there---and makes one question what /is/ "defence", ultimately?

In Year 1, we get Quirrelmort, whose (apparent) speech impediment prevents him from actually teaching. Thus, we are asked to ask, is the class about the teacher teaching or about the students learning?

In Year 2, we get Gilderoy Lockhart. He is, in the conventional sense, defenceless, yet also practices his own form of defence, both by cultivating being loved so that no one wants to harm him in the first place and by cultivating a reputation of being powerful so that those who do want to harm him are afraid to. We are asked to consider, does this defence-by-reputation count as "DADA"?

In Year 3, we get Remus Lupin, a dangerous creature, teaching the students about dangerous creatures. The self-referential nature of his class is further underscored by students having to face a Boggart, because ultimately, the boggart represents one's own worst fears, as opposed to an external opponent. Remus Lupin makes us ask, is learning to defend against the Dark Arts first and foremost about learning to defend against oneself?

In Year 4, Barty Crouch Jr, posing as Alastor Moody, raises the classic question of whether one can learn to fight monsters without becoming a monster. In a true dada spirit, the answer is left ambiguous. Here we also link the theme of Year 3 and the theme of Years 6 and 7: Viktor Krum, the representative of the Durmstrang Institute, which actually teaches Dark Arts from which DADA is supposed to defend, is himself brought low by a Dark curse (the Imperius). We are thus reminded that even becoming a monster does not defend one against monsters.

This duality is further explored in Year 5, when there are effectively two DADA teachers, Dolores Umbridge and Harry Potter. Dolores Umbridge represents defence by recourse to law: the students are asked to surrender their personal capacity for violence in order to benefit from the protection of the state. Harry Potter's clandestine lessons then represent anarchic principles of self-reliance and mutual aid. Ultimately, we are shown the flaws of both approaches: Dolores Umbridge forcibly shuts down Harry Potter's project, but her own project is then itself undone by its internal contradictions and found fragile when confronted with the state of nature (the centaurs). As with the other years, this part of the installation leaves us with more questions than answers.

Years 6 and 7 should be viewed as a single unit. Year 6 taunts us by offering to supposedly reconstruct the traditional notion of DADA by appointing a teacher who is competent, experienced, and highly motivated to teach: Severus Snape is the perfect teacher. And, indeed, everything seems to go well. Indeed, instead of being removed, this "perfect teacher" is in fact /promoted/ in Year 7 to be the headmaster (an allusion to Peter's Principle?), able to expand his traditional DADA paradigm to the rest of the school. And, it is here that we see the climax of the installation, as Defence Against the Dark Arts class itself is destroyed (reduced?) and becomes the Dark Arts class.

Some may interpret this as answering the question posed by Year 4: that no, one cannot learn to fight monsters without becoming a monster: that there is ultimately no difference between Defence Against the Dark Arts and the Dark Arts themselves. Others argue that the point being made by the artist is far more subtle and nuanced: that the line between the Dark Arts and Defence Against the Dark Arts has /always/ been a fine one; more broadly, that legitimatised state violence must always walk a fine line, and that even if a particular teacher (leader, governor, etc.) may be perfect, they are always one step from descending into tyranny, and, furthermore, that having a perfect representative of legitimatised violence (Severus Snape) given more power will not solve this problem but will in fact exacerbate it.

In the proud tradition of dada, this installation makes us to confront our assumptions about dominant paradigms of defence and does not provide us with simple answers. As with many dadaist works, this is by far not the only valid interpretation, and the reader is encouraged to offer their own.
