"And so with no further ado, I'd like to introduce Professor Duchamp!" Dumbledore looked out at the Great Hall over the rim of his spectacles, eyes twinkling, and made a sweeping gesture towards the newest occupant of the head table.

The students craned their necks to have a look at the unassuming Frenchman who sat there, cleaning his out his smoking pipe. He was seated next to Professor Snape.

Curisouly, and for the first time in many years, Snape appeared to be unbothered by the presence of the latest person appointed to the DADA position instead of him. And, though no one would dare say it, he also appeared to be amused.

There were many reasons for this--- among them, Duchamp's resolute silence. Or the fact that a dozen chess pieces had fallen from the folds of his cloak when he'd sat down. Or, as the students would have noticed had they been able to see from a higher vantage point, that throughout diner he drank his pumpkin juice with a spoon, saved sugar cubes in his pockets, and ate off of the underside of his plate.

It was no matter.

Nothing prepared his first class of term for what they saw when they walked into the defense classroom.

All of the desks and chairs, save for a stool with a bicycle wheel attached to the seat, were standing on the ceiling. A snow shovel hung among them, suspended from a rafter. Nearer the front of the classroom sat a cage full of sugar cubes as well as a cup and teaspoon placed upon a small saucer--- each item covered in fur.

Silence only reigned for a moment.

Before half the students could orient themselves, the professor turned towards them and asked, "Why Not Sneeze, Rose SÃ©lavy?"

When he was met with odd looks and confused silence, he merely laughed and waved questions away with a dismissive gesture. "It's alright," he huffed, "I wasn't really asking. Now come, come. Here's something you should see. My freind Meret made it years ago---remarkable object. Just remarkable."

It took a moment but the stunned, and tremendously cautious, students gathered around his desk. Unprompted, they followed his lead and began to stare at the teacup.

He let them contemplate it in silence for fifteen full minutes before a student, who'd spent half the time gathering up the courage to interrupt their class' impromptu meditation, spoke up.

"Sir?"

Professor Duchamp looked up as though awfully startled, his unlit pipe bobbing along with his head, but responded with a polite, quizzical look.

When he said nothing the student went on. "Erm... Sir. Sir, I was wondering what exactly that is and what exactly we are doing."

"Ah, yes." Duchamp sighed, taking his pipe in one hand and rubbing his chin with the other. " Yes. I was wondering the very same thing."
