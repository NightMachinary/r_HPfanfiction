Fred and George knew the exact moment they would dedicate their lives to absurdity. Professor Hugo Ball had not even lasted a full school term before he had tenured his resignation on the grounds that he was obliged to shake up the establishment. And so for the next several weeks that followed many bizarre events occurred. Three dinners in a row the gravy boats serenaded their potatoes, much to Snape's ire and Dumbledore's humor. Every prefect had reported furniture flipped up onto the ceiling of their respective house's common room. Portraits squeaked angrily from their frames, their canvases charmed to turn their voices into unintelligible sighs, ahhs, and groans. Luckily, the Ravenclaw Common Room was not guarded by a portrait but an enchanted and unscathed knocker. The other house prefects had been tasked with standing watch at the portrait entrances of Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Slytherin to permit students entry.

"Brilliant... even genius!" George whispered while his twin nodded in agreement as they studied Professor Ball's latest found demonstration. One of Hogwarts many suits of armor had been dramatically altered. In place of the helmet was an old leather boot split off from the sole with a rather realistic tongue lolling out. The left arm was aloft with a set of scales precariously dangled with an ever unbalanced load that rocked up and down at alternating speeds and depths. Lastly but not least were the feet, the right foot now sported a muggle roller skate while the left was planted firmly into an aquarium filled with live tadpoles.

"What does it even mean!?" Their brother Percy whisper-shrieked his face taught and so white his freckles were visibly paled.

"What does it mean?" Fred yelled incredulously "Gred, he doesn't know what it means!" George tutted his tongue and shook his head in disappointment.

"It's quite obvious, innit?" George taunted back and the twins were certain they could hear the grinding of their uptight brother's teeth.

"Covered it in our first class, we did." Fred nodded sagely.

"It's a protest against convention." A Ravenclaw student observed. Percy's eyes narrowed in speculation or perhaps suspicion.

"How so?"

"Well it's really up to interpretation, for example, traditionalism and judicialism." The Ravenclaw gestured from the roller skate to the scales.

"That is ABSURD!" Percy shouted, his face almost as scarlet as their house ties. In a flurry of movement an arrhythmic gong clanged as their previously departed Professor Ball appeared in a flurry of tissue streamers. "Yes! 50 points to Gryffindor!" He bellowed through a funnel while Gred and Forge cheered flourishing confetti from their wands in celebration. Percy's shoulders slumped in defeat.
