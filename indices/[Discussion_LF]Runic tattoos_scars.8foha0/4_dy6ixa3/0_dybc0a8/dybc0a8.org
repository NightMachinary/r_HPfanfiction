Thanks a lot for your thougts and encouragements. I like to think of runic tattoos in my story as pairs so there are great ideas in what you have suggested.

[Strong][Muscles]: End up breaking your body or pumping the heart so hard you pop like a bottle of champain. [Long][Lived]: Makes the cells in your body not die or reproduce, therefore trapping you in a single unchanching state.

Great stuff, thanks again !
