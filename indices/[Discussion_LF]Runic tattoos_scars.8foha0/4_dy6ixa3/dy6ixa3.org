Immediate upvote for going to the effort of writing your own fic. Good on you :)

I think the fic you're referring to is For Love of Magic, which was also recommended above/below. Here are some quick thoughts on examples of how they could go horribly wrong:

- Strength: muscles so strong that they break bones.
- Eternity (attempted immortality): becomes unchanging, may as well be made of stone.
- Intelligence: This way lies madness.
- Flight: Mutates arms to non-functional wings.

More minor symptoms could include pain, or a "tainting" of magic with the concept embodied in the rune. An example could be fire-related runes could make all of your spells burn, or burn the user when they cast.

Have fun writing!
