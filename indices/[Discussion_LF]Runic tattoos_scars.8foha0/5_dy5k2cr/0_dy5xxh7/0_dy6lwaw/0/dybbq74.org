I agree with you completely.

For now I am set on Harry being captured by Dothrakis “on arrival” and sold as a slave. He then has to fight for his life when he is purchased by a slaver who specializes in gladiators for the pits. With other slaves, he escapes and one of them claims he has a contact in Pentos that would help them cross to Westeros to work as sellswords and would even pay them to perform “small services for him”. They kill their master and steal his ship but end up having to sail through the Smoking Sea for a little bit in order to escape fast sloops sent after them to kill them. Stuff happens. The contact ends up being Illyrio Mopatis, friend of the Spider and host of the remaining Targaryens. In Pentos, at the end of the first Arc (approx. 9 chapters relating 5-6 months of story), Harry meets Dany very briefly and forms a sort of brotherly attachment to her (she is 13 and he is 20) that will come to play a role later and the group embarks on a ship to King's Landing that happens to be transporting Syrio Forel (canon compliant because the point where Sirio stops being First Sword of Braavos is not explicitly stated in ASoIaF).

I'm not going to regurgitate all my plot line here, especially considering that it is still a work in progress, but I thinks it's not impossible to write a mildly interesting story set in the world of ASoIaF with a Harry that is limited in his usage of magic (he will find an artefact in the Smoking Sea that will allow him at some point during the third Act to perform some magic).
