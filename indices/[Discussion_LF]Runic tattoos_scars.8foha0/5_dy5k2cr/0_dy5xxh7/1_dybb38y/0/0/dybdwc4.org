Ahah, okey, sorry for the little misunderstanding there. I tougth you were saying I should have put AU in my title instead of Discussion because [Discussion] was reserved for canon instead of... discussions. To be fair, I'm new arroud here and the first poster seemed very sure of himself.

Also, I just had a random craving to respond to a mildly offending comment in a self-righteously obsequious manner, as one does. That felt very good. Glad everything is allright in the end. 10/10 would overreact again ;) <3
