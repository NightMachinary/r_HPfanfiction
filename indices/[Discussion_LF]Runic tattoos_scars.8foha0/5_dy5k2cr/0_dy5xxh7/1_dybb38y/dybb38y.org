I'm not sure I understand this comment as the term “request” was used in my post as a way to ask for fanfictions that used runes well (specifically runic tattoos) which seems to me appropriate, and the term “discussion” was used as a way to initiate an exchange of words that would relate to the writing of a fanfiction using said runes as a plot device to adjust the power of the main character who is devoid of wand (because he would be too strong with it in this universe), and therefore ends up a bit too weak to face the challenges he is faced with during the course of the story.

It appears to me at this moment that there seems to have been an abstract meaning to the tag “Discussion”, that would replace “Discussion about HP canon”, which I do not seem to have grasped in my initial posting, and that it might have disturbed some other participants of this forum for a few seconds there... I therefore apologise deeply for having inconvenienced you so.

Being “so dumb” is, after all, an ailment that can afflict us all on occasion.\\
