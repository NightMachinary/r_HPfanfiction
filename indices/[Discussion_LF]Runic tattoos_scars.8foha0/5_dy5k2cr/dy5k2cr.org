Well if you're looking for discussion I'll tell you that this sounds like crap. Harry doesn't sound like Harry, not!Harry doesn't sound like a wizard, so I'm questioning what HP has to do with your fic at all.\\
Even ignoring that, runic magic doesn't seem to be a thing in HP magic. Ancient runes seems to be nothing but a language course, the analogue of Latin in muggle boarding schools. But that can be ignored to some degree, but you can't make it better, or even comparable, to wanded magic and have it make any sense to the HP canon.
