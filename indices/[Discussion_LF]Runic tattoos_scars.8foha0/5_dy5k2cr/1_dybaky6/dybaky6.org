Okay so, there are multiple points here that I am going to try to adress the way I understood them at least:

*Harry doesn't sound like Harry: First I would like to say that this is pretty much subject to interpretation. For example, if during a fic, Harry lost his wand and had to be without it for a while, would you skip the chapters entirely because it's not Harry any more? What about fictions that don't explore the use of magic at all, like some romances or mysteries or many other fictions where magic is not important but that feature Harry as a character. Would you say that they are "crap" because he doesn't do wand magic ? My Harry is a Harry in so far as he has the same past, character traits and knowledge in magic as canon Harry. Which is as pretty damn close to a Harry Potter any character can get if you ask me but fair enough.

*Runic magic doesn't seem to be a thing in canon: Well, it may not be to your liking, but as you suggested, runes can be a way to place enchantments in some fanons at least.

*You can't make it better or comparable to wand magic: Yes... yes that's the point. Harry would be completely overpowered in the world of ASoIaF if he had wand magic, as demonstrated in many other crossovers in the corpus. I've never said anything different. I even said I would nerf it and that the process of making a runic tattoo would only appear once in the story.

So would it make any sense in the HP canon if some obscure and dangerous way of using runic tattoos to place permanent enchantment on oneself existed, I don't know. Maybe?
