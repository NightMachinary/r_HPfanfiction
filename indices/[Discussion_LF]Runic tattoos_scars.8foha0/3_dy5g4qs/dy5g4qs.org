linkffn(For Love of Magic) He uses Elder Futhrak and a whole bunch of other languages as runes for carving into his skin, even Kanji and a language from WoW (I think, since I didn't play, I assumed it was from this). Its definitely a "dark" ritual but he simply doesn't give a shit. Lots and Lots of Smut though, if you don't like, its hard to skip because there isn't a warming and sometimes not even a build-up. Harem with Luna/Fleur/Tonks.

Really good story though, but a bit long.

Another one that's classic and old is linkffn(Runic Animagus) but this is just a cracky bad and funny fic.
