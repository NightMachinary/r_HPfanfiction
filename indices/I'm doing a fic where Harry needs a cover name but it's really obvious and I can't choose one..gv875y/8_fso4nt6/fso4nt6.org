I have some extensive notes I made in case I wanted to write a fic where he used a fake name. Here are some highlights.

If a person is serious about a fake name, it should be one that has absolutely nothing to do with their real name. "James Evans" is laugably obvious and wouldn't fool anybody looking for him. (I did read a fic where Snape is looking for Harry and hears about a Mr Evans that he thinks is him --- and makes a note to tell him how obvious the name is --- but Harry is actually going to Leo Slyder.)

A lot of people make fun of Hadrian, but I personally like *Harfang*: it's another name for snowy owl because hares are their main prey. He also has a Potter ancestor named *Hardwin*. Both of those have the benefit of allowing for the accidental "Harry," which if he makes that mistake he can cover it up by saying he's trying to ditch the "childish" nickname and go more formal.

Instead of Evans or Black, I've seen authors use Jameson, but -son is not the only way to indicate your father. McJames or FitzJames work. James is a form of Jacob, so *Jacobson* also works.

James is also easy to disguise by using a different language. I already mentioned Jacob, which can give the nickname of Jack. Irish or Scottish Gaelic is Seamus or Hamish, Welsh is Iago. (Side note: Evans is a common Welsh surname.) Harry is not as easy to translate because it is essentially a nickname, used as a formal name only in recent times. (We know from canon that Harry's name IS Harry, not Harrison or Henry with Harry as a nickname.)

To honor his mother all he needs is a plant name. There are many, and all you have to do us use a baby name site to search. My favorite is *Rowan*, a tree thought to protect against malevolent beings. (Elder was thought to bring bad luck, elder and rowan are opposites.)
