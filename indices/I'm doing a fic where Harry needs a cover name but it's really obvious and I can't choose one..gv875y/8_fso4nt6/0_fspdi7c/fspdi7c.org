Harry's going to a separate universe where he died as a baby so he can have a restart so no one's going to be looking for him. Eventually, he's going to reveal himself.

For the time being, until I can decide, I've been using Henry Evan Jameson. It's perfectly obvious and a nod to both of Harry's parents without being too obvious since his parents (and himself) have been dead for sixteen years. Henry is also close enough to Harry's first name that he can slip up easily and mention that his friends used to call him Harry. There's also the fact that his great great grandfather (in my fic, at least) was named Henry.

I was kind of thinking of using Evander Jameson as a name because it has Evan in it and it sounds unique enough to be a wizard's name. I really like what you've mentioned about different versions of Harry's first name that are similar to his name, though. I was thinking of perhaps using Jamie Evanson or something because I thought it was cute. I don't really want Harry to go around with an "ugly" name or a name I really didn't want to type over and over again.

Elder would be an interesting last name because I'm playing around with the Deathly Hallows and Harry's bringing the Elder wand with him.
