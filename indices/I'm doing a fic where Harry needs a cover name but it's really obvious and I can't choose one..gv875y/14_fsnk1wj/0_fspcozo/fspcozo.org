Well, I probably shoulda mentioned that Harry's going to an alternate universe where he died to start over so he can't obviously have the name of a living person. I was thinking James Evans but that would be copying the name from the fic that I'm basing my own fic on linkffn(The World Without Me), so I chose Henry Jameson until I decide if I actually want to use James Evans. I must say, I do like Jameson as a last name because it's so obvious.
