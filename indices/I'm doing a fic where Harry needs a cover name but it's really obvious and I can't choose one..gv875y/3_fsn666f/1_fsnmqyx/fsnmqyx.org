The reason I like mine "cover name" is he could take two paths. One - the tonks method of some parents shouldn't be allowed to name their kids. I.e, why he hates/doesn't use his first name. Or two - my dad said he always liked the idea of me having a Harem so he gave me that name so whatever happened I would always have one.

Plus it gives him an excuse etc if he makes a mistake and either answers or starts to state his name is Harry.
