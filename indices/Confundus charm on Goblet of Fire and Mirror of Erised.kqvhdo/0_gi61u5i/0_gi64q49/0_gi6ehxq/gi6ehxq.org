That's what I was attempting to say - might not've been what I did say, I admit (my language skills degrade massively when I'm tired) but it was what I was going for. :D

Getting Harry's name into the Goblet could've been done differently with the other person name thing, but the confundus didn't deal with getting his name into the Goblet, it was to get it to think there was a fourth school. That was the basic programming thing, and I was using the 'getting other person to put the name in' thing to say that it wasn't to get Harry's name into the Goblet, because there was an easier way to do that. It was to get a fourth school accepted, which meant that his name would be picked.

I don't know if that paragraph makes any more sense than the original, but I'm definitely trying to agree with you here. :D
