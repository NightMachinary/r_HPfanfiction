I can't remember the name of the Fic but I read one where the confundus wasn't needed as the Goblet was designed to select the best champion for each school. So if there were 4 school names used the goblet would pick 4 champions if there were 7 schools used the Goblet would pick 7 champions. There was a different fic (again I'll have to see if I can find it) where the number of schools was a "parameter' that could be "set" on the Goblet.
