Not at all. The part about the age line and the person entering the name themselves was a modern addition, not part of the Goblet's enchantments, which were: "Select a worthy Champion for each school from the pool of claimants entered."

This is where the part about the four schools is relevant. Instead of forcing Harry to be selected instead of Cedric (which would mean going against whichever criteria Goblet uses for its choices) a fourth school was added, with the selection pool of one.

That would mean, only input would be manipulated. Four schools insead of three, four lists instead of three thus four champions.
