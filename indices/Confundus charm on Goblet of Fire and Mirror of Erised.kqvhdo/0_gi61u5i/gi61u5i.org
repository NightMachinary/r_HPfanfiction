Probably. It seems like the kind of hilariously obvious option most magicals would miss.

If memory serves, the confounding of the Goblet was to get it to accept a fourth school, not to get Harry's name in. For that, the Goblet of Fire had an easier route - remember when they asked if he'd gotten someone else to put the name in? If they asked about it, that means it probably would've worked. So, the confounding was specifically interfering with the basic functions of the Goblet, meaning that confounding (I think I've written that word too many times now) the Mirror would also be able to affect its basic programming, so I think it would work on that level. I don't fully remember if Dumbledore's thing was an additional spell or a feature of the Goblet though, so I guess it would depend on whether it would work on extra spells or just the Goblet's main enchantments/functions. I would say yes, but it'd have to be cast more strongly than Dumbledore's protection.
