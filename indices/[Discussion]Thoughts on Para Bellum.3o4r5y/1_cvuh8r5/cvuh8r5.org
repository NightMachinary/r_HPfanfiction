It's quite awful. Like, the first half of Delende Est (up through chapter 20), was a fairly serious fic, and it was quite good. Then, it's like it was shifted into a parody, or the author really couldn't resist putting in all the shit that turned Earl of the North into a mess. And then the sequel... is just a bunch of Mary Sue that are neither funny or witty or interesting. It's disappointing, because Delende Est had soooo much potential.
