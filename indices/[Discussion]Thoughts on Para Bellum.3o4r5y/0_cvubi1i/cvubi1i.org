Delenda Est is one of my favorites (and I doubt that there will ever be a better Harry/Bellatrix pairing - there are some parts where I absolutely /adore/ here in that story), but I honestly have had trouble getting into the sequel. A big part of that is structural, I think - it's alternating between two different dimensions, and that inherently makes things confusing. Creating a comprehensible structure out of that would be challenging for any writer.

I want to like it - when I first read about the "Black Triplets" at the end of Delenda Est, I was hoping very much for a sequel because I found the idea so appealing. But... as interesting as they are, I just couldn't get into it.

It's possible that if it were finished, it would in the end be easier to understand. So I haven't entirely given up on it; however, my hopes for it are not nearly what they were when the first chapter appeared.
