I don't like Alexandra Quick.

The AQ series is not exceptional writing. Is it creative and original? Certainly. But not enough to warrant being on this sub's general recommendations list. Furthermore, you can't explain the plot without including some spoiler, whether they be direct statements about what happens, or implications of what happens.

I can name dozens of other stories more deserving of AQ's spot on the recommendations list.
