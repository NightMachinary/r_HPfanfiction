I don't see how it doesn't fit; the Resurrection Stone shows there /is/ an Afterlife in the HP universe, and Harry was literally at the gates of it in the King's Cross sequence (unless you buy into the idea that was all just a dream and nothing supernatural at all, but that's probably not what JK Rowling meant, what with her being a Christian herself).
