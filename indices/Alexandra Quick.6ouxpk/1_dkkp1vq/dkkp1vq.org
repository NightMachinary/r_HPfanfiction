There is a land of the dead, Alex visits it temporarily. It includes a bunch of new mythology and examines some of the things that happened to Harry and how a different person would handle them.

Alex is proactive, impulsive, and violent, and she doesn't mature noticeably during the four(?) years of the story. The fifth(?) year is starting as Alex's impulsivity and good intentions result in lots of her fellow students getting attacked, and she faces a punishment because of it that will probably result in some maturity. Her somewhat immutable character's a big reason why some people don't like the story; I personally enjoy a very proactive protagonist with enormous character flaws, but I'll admit she could make different choices in some parts of her life after facing negative consequences again and again.

The antagonist is this series is way better than Voldemort, and his reasons for revolting against the American wizarding world are explored in some depth. Unlike Dumbledore and the U.K. ministry, the US magical government is genuinely engaged in some horrible things to maintain their power. Also his relationship with Alex is complicated, but he wants her on his side, not dead, so Alex's brushes with death come from mostly third parties.

The mythology and American wizarding world is also very different from Hogwarts, and the prejudices are shifted around as well.
