Linkffn(the blood of your veins by Arinus)

This is my fanfiction following a Slytherin (daughter of Snape and Bellatrix) through all 7 years at Hogwarts

A lot of the plot deals with legilimency and Bella trying to use it to connect psychically to her daughter to try and influence/control her but there are many other subplots.

Edit: fixing a bot typo
