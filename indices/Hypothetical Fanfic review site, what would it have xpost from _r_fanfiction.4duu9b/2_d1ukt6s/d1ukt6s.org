lol, I thought you meant someone reading through a fic and giving a review of it.

"The grammar was quite good, and the concept of Harry going independently of the Order is a nostalgic treat. While the massive Death Eater orgy (complete with a detailed description of Voldemort's Voldie-bits) came completely out of left field, Hermione's transformation into a divine shadow phoenix more than made up for it. The Author's description of House Elf Coitus is thoughtful and vivid; he obviously spent quite a bit of time on it. My only problem with the fic is that Ron and the Nimbus 2001 never got past third base."
