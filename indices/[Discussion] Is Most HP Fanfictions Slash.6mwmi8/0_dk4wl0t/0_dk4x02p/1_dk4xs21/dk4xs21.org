I would recommend going through [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/][Taures,]] [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjpJsBshvv5sSTHsbHQ269e3DW2ZReBH20AT7NufJYw/][Newcombs,]] [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dKEPQYMsQGo_Vr7qGA6fuO4yidNAkS2mxe506ZbNVj0/][ScottPress,]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6811473/][Astaphta]] top of the fandom lists. Everything listed there is very well written as well as being the best in in the fandom.

After that I would recommend going through [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP's C2]] which is also full of amazing fics. As far as I know none of the recommendations contain slash.
