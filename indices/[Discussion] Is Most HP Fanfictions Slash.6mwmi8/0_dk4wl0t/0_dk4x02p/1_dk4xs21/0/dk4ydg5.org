Highly recommend every story on all four of those lists, excluding Alexandra Quick. Furthermore, DLP's forums contain many lesser known stories that are top notch in either plot, writing, or both. I highly recommend going over there and reading some of the 4 and 5 star stories from the different areas in the forum. The amazing thing about having hundreds of thousands of Harry Potter fanfictions on the internet is that there is most certainly at least /one/ story that will fit everyone's tastes, if not more.

On a different note - I don't understand why Alexandra Quick makes many "Best of the fandom" lists. The author's writing style isn't captivating, and the plot is essentially a loose canon rehash meant to fit a female protagonist and a different country with different antagonists. Can somebody enlighten me as to what makes Alexandra Quick such a popular character and series?
