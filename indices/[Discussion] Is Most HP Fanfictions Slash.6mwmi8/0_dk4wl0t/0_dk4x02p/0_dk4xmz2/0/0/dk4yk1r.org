FFN's search filter is usually enough to find even the most niche stories. Selecting characters (sometimes called /pairings/ if the characters have a relationship) is usually enough to, with time, find unique stories that may otherwise be extremely difficult to weed out.

Before you post here, I recommend googling your query first. Re-posting of requests for pairings (such as Harry/Daphne) is a serious problem on this sub, as the pairing is extremely common and requested almost daily, and it would be helpful if people were to search for their query first. If you can't find anything that fits your tastes, then that is when you should make a topic. That is what I do, anyhow. Your mileage may vary on when to create an original post.
