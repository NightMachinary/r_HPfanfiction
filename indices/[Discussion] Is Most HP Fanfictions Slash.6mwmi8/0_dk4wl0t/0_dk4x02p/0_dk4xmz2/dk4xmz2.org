Recommended and general recs are on the sidebar. Making a thread about the best stories from a certain "type" of story or plot-line (or simply googling threads) is a good way to find stories via this sub. You can also use FFN's search filter to narrow down stories by characters, type, length, reviews, followers, and other options.
