SOunds like you are reading at Archive of Our Own. The more popular stories at AO3 tend to be slash. FAnfiction.net tends more towards het and gen. I started at ao3 and was perplexed about the same issue. If you like your stories a little more butch and dark then visit Dark lord potter library and try some of their recommendations.
