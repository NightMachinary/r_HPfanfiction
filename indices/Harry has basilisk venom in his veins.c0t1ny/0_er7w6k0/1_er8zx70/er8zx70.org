I always assumed it was just JK Rowling using 'magic ritual' to justify matching Voldemort's appearance to his narrative theme and personality (Voldemort's a snake, in the sense that he's extremely dangerous, he's a serial backstabber, and he's generally evil).

What really bugs me, though, is that he was supposed to be very handsome and charming, and the charm apparently disappeared with the handsomeness.
