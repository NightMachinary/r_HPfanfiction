Black (with a capital B) has been the default in Britain for a while to refer to those of African descent.

The Associated Press style guide, which most American media follow, capitalized Black about a month ago in the wake of the recent activism after the murder of George Floyd.

A lot of identity/affinity groups have historically advocated for capitalizing these terms to emphasize a unifying purpose rather than a pejorative one. It seems these are now coming into mainstream use with Black, Native, Deaf, etc. all encouraged under the mainstream journalistic style.

That said, words can have different meanings, and Black is a legit family name, so there really is no difference - they're both referring to identity rather than a description. I believe "black" is not considered particularly pejorative and is probably okay as a standard literary descriptor when you're talking about an individual, but the recent trend does throw another meaning into the capitalized form.
