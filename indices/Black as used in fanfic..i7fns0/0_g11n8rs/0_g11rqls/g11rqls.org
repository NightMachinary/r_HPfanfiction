Sure! I see that. I think Black as capitalized in mainstream American media is a fairly new thing- since 1970 maybe- but people are pushing for it to be done more now as part of the larger re-thinking of racial attitudes on going rn. I know most people think it's common sense because it's a reference to proper name or noun. Like August or Taiwan. I think when talking about skin it might make sense to be like black or Black- it's either a commentary on the individual skin tone or the ethnic identity of the person.

I think it seems unclear to me because the context of using Black in media is more frequently seen by me as a reference to race then the specific context of using Black to refer to like a character group from a specific work of fiction.

I have no idea how the British use Black as a racial descriptor so that is fair! In story it would make more sense to read it as Black (the house) then Black (the race). I think the theoretical racial dynamics of a magical society are interesting but JK Rowling never really addresses it in text besides the obvious metaphors of blood purity and cultural preservation. If the Wizarding World is free from racial discrimination is a interesting question and I agree it depends on level of interaction with muggles and what history Black wizards have in whatever version of fanon is followed. Great insights! I think probably I would be more open to the idea of societal bleed-through of rhetoric or discrimination- the Magical world picks up a few cultural attitudes and institutions from the muggle one just on basis of size and shared space.
