I dunno, never really thought about it. Capitalizing "B" in "Black" when referring to the race/ethnicity/skin colour seems like a fairly new... development, all told? Not a new /thing/, I'm sure, though I've never looked into its history. But it feels fairly recent for it to have taken over the Internet the way it has.

It still feels to me that the uncapitalized form is the “norm” when just randomly mentioning a character's skin colour for exposition purposes; if someone wants to /identify/ as capital-B Black that is of course something I respect, as should everyone, but it's not a straightforward thing, and in the context of a story where there is a family with the last name "Black", whereas there /wouldn't/ really be many characters who'd use the modern usage of "Black" to identify themselves --- well, no, it doesn't seem unclear to me. /shrug/

(To elaborate on that last point, I am, to begin with, fairly sure that 1990's British English didn't commonly use a capitalized "Black" as an identity, no matter how long the Americans may or may not have been doing it. And moreover, only Muggle-born characters would be likely to make a point of it either way, because at least within the /common conception/ of the Wizarding World, "blood purity" and actual species differences replace any Muggle conceptions of race and racism. It is unclear how long there have been black-skinned wizards in the British, and, more generally, Western Wizarding World --- but worldbuilding-wise, they can't well have had a history with much in common with Muggle Black history; no slave-trading, for example, since inasmuch as the wizards ever “needed” slave labour, it was House-Elves who suffered the consequences, rather than human beings turning on each other. And so on and so forth.)
