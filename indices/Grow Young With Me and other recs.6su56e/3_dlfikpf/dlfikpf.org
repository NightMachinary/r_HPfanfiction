linkffn(10728064)

linkffn(11697407) and its other part linkffn(12381694)

linkffn(8262940) unatoned is sometimes considered one of the best written fanfics even if its not as fun as some of the others.

linkffn(9444529) Several of TE7s stories might work.

linkffn(7711029) Another post Hogwarts quidditch fic.

Oh I'll also throw out linkffn(10100723) since I know a few people find it amusing.

Then there is [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] which is pretty meh but pleasant enough.

A quick list that I posted to a similar thread a few days ago. Most are quite well known however since its a commonly requested but little explored area.
