Nice post - I linked a story that features Harry as Ginny's bodyguard but it didn't feel like the right one. Turns out the one I had in mind was Ginny Duty - it must have been removed from FF.net at some point or I forgot where I read it originally. Thanks for reminding me, because I remember enjoying it quite a bit.
