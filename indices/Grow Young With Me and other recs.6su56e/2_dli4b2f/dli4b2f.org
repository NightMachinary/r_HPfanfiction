This is one of my favorite genres too. Hogwarts romances are frequently cringeworthy and much more difficult to execute well.

One series which might fulfill your request is the Anguis series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4095/Slide][Slide]], specifically the last two books, Falls the Shadow and Beyond this place. It's largely canon-compliant and the 3rd book features wartime romance between recent Hogwarts graduates while the 4th book focuses on the aftermath of the war.

I'd strongly recommend reading from the beginning as the series has some of the best-developed OCs in all of fanfiction and you can watch them grow from angsty schoolkids into conflicted adults with real challenges. It's not as light as most of the suggestions herO_wraith give you though, which cover the bulk of the common post-Hogwarts romance fics, and it features a lot of action although romance is also a major part of the stories and I enjoy the balance.

I'll also throw in Black coffee, with sugar - it's a fluffy and a bit unrealistic H/D and there's still a lot to go but I've been enjoying it anyway. linkffn(12414949)

If you dig back to pre-DH release there are some decent post-Hogwarts H/G stories as well. I can look for them if you're interested.
