I dug up some of the ones I've saved over the years. I included everything that met the criteria, but I'll have to reread some of them myself - I'm sure some are a bit dated. If any seem really bad then let me know so I can clean up my C2. Also since some of these are more immediately post-Hogwarts there may be some teenaged characters and virgin-type sex scenes (I also think that earlier in the fandom authors tended to write all the characters and Ginny specifically as more pure, probably due to younger age).

I also wanted to include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/16/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]], which takes place at Hogwarts but features a mature and complex romance between Harry and Ginny and is probably the best story in the Professor!Harry-dates-student category. I've also read it more recently than the others so I can attest that it's well-written. Harry is aged up to about 20.
