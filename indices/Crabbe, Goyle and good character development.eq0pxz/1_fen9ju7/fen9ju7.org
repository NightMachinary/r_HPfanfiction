Crack time travel re-do. Stargate Crossover (no knowledge of Stargate needed) Crabbe, Goyle, AND Dudley get really good development. Greg has dyslexia, and while the both of them aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, they are pretty good people when you strip Malfoy from them. Dudley and those two form a muscle trio of sorts.
