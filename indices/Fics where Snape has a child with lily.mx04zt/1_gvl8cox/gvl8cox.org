There was a fanfiction where he had a daughter with her, she was harry's older half sister who was left with Severus Snape because Petunia refused to take her in. Harry was left with Petunia because of the protection. I think both of them had a scar and were "the children who lived" or something like that. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the fiction, if someone knows it please link it her.

I'll try to look in my reading history.
