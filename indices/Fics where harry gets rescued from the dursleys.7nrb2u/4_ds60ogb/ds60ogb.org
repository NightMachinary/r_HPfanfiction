Linkffn(Innocent by marauderlover7)

This is a great fic (series eventually) where Sirius rescues Harry from the Dursleys' when he's nine and essentially explores the series as what would happen in Harry was a rather well-adjusted boy who had adults to care for him. Also changes include: Malfoy brothers, where Draco is very different from canon. It's one of my favourite fics in the HP universe where about the only qualm I have is that Harry (in his third year, the fourth fic in th series) is a bit too expectant of being in the know - but other than that everyone seems very much of age and IC, which is so refreshing!
