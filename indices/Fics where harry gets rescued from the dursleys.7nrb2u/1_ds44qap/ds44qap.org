linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is a great one, and has a finished sequel. The writing quality is good, and Snape is the one who rescues Harry

linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai) is regretfully unfinished, and features a well-developed OC family who takes Harry in. I loved the writing style and have read it multiple times -- definitely worth it. The story shows a bit of Harry's childhood, then jumps to fifth year iirc

linkffn(In Care Of by Fang's Fawn) features an older Harry and definitely pulls at the heartstrings a bit
