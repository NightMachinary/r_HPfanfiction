Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?) SI in the character of LV. Set in the first wizarding war, the new Voldemort decides that trying to kill the child with mysterious prophecy powers seems like a stupid thing to do without knowing the specifics of the prophecy first so the miracle of Halloween 1981 doesn't happen and the war continues, with Lilly and Harry captured prisoners and drastic improvements in the effectiveness of the Death Eaters.
