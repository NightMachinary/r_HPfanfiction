My own two cents: Hermione and Tom both learned from a young age how important magical power and knowledge is to the achievement of their goals. They are both unafraid to use their considerable talents to achieve their own ends even if it means they have to hurt others. They both have huge ruthless streaks covered up by polished reputations that even their closest friends have fallen for.
