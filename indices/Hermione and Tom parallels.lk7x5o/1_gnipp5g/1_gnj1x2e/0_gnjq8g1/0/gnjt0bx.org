Hermione isn't really anywhere close to being as powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort. In canon, Snape was shown to be extremely studios as a teen and created spells of his own. James and Sirius knew a whole lot of magic and got straight O's in their O.W.Ls without working their asses off.

None of them compared to Voldemort, and by extension, Dumbledore.

Hermione is a very powerful witch, yes. But she would never end up being the kind of threat Voldemort was because she doesn't have his (or Dumbledore's, or occasionally, even Harry's) instinctual understanding of magic. Dumbledore talks about theories of magic beyond that which books refer to, giving insight that isn't academic in nature. Voldemort, for all his disregard of love, recognises Lily's protection as a strong and old enchantment, and comes up with a method to subvert it. Harry himself sees how the Bonds of Blood saved his life, thus allowing him to live after taking the Killing Curse again, during his conversation with Dumbledore in Deathly Hallows.

Has Hermione ever showed this? Remember, Harry taught her too in OotP, during their DA lessons. Stuff which he learnt at 14 for the Triwizard Tournament from a textbook, she learned that from Harry when she was 16.

This does not discredit Hermione. She is quite a good witch in her own right. But putting her in the top bracket of wizards and witches vastly overstates her power, and fails to recognise her real role and importance in canon.
