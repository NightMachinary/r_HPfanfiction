  Hermione isn't really anywhere close to being as powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort.
#+end_quote

I don't believe I claimed that she was. She isn't. Even if her baseline ability is like Dumbledore's or Voldemort's (which is a stretch I know, but let's suppose for the sake of the argument), they are inclined like scientists while she is inclined like a politician. She studies magic based on what she needs instead of learning for learning's sake. That's a tendency that would put her at a disadvantage against more curious individuals like Voldemort and DUmbledore were shown to be.

My point really was more that her inclination towards power is a lot like Riddle's. They seek power because there are things that they want, and their experiences have taught them that it is only through gaining more power and knowledge that they could achieve their goals. Riddle desires immortality so he learns about and creates his horcruxes. Hermione desires to finish the war and keep harry safe, so she learns of esoteric charms and spells far above their year to do so.

I was more referring to the similarities in disposition rather than raw ability. (There isn't a feat between them that are similar enough to make a fair comparison, I don't think.)

  But she would never end up being the kind of threat Voldemort was because she doesn't have his (or Dumbledore's, or occasionally, even Harry's) instinctual understanding of magic. Dumbledore talks about theories of magic beyond that which books refer to, giving insight that isn't academic in nature. Voldemort, for all his disregard of love, recognises Lily's protection as a strong and old enchantment, and comes up with a method to subvert it.
#+end_quote

I'm going to point out that it's a bit unfair to compare 18-year-old Hermione with fully grown Dumbledore or Voldemort in terms of instinctive understanding of magic. I think all questions about her abilities would be put to rest if her understanding of magic at 15 matches Voldemort's and Dumbledore's already. Also, how do you know that their baselines of knowledge weren't academic?

(A tangent: I really don't buy into any of that being "instinctive" in the sense that the understanding was innate. It had always sounded like these two incredibly learned individuals had learned enough magic over their lifetimes so as to be able to recognize even some of the most arcane magics. Kind of like how an experienced doctor would be able to "instinctively" that something is wrong with you, you know? It's a function of their experience rather than any "innate" sense.)

  Harry himself sees how the Bonds of Blood saved his life, thus allowing him to live after taking the Killing Curse again, during his conversation with Dumbledore in Deathly Hallows.
#+end_quote

I also think this is another flawed comparison. For one thing, he only understood what the Bonds of Blood did after Dumbledore explained it to him. For another, not only is he experiencing the effects of these special bonds and protections, he was also a first-hand witness to Voldemort's rituals and attempts. That's a lot of information that he has sole access to that Hermione doesn't have. Singular access to information isn't a function of instinct I don't think.

  Remember, Harry taught her too in OotP, during their DA lessons. Stuff which he learnt at 14 for the Triwizard Tournament from a textbook, she learned that from Harry when she was 16.
#+end_quote

And again, this is unfair. Harry didn't learn those spells from a textbook. Hermione and Ron were right there assisting him in the learning. They learned it at the same time, but he mastered it first because Hermione /spent all of her time and energy helping him learn./ With the exception of the Patronus, she was still always the first one to master the spell now that she's actually learning for herself.

*I'm still not claiming that she's as powerful as them by the way! Just pointing out that the baselines you're using are flawed.*

  But putting her in the top bracket of wizards and witches vastly overstates her power, and fails to recognise her real role and importance in canon.
#+end_quote

I agree. As I mentioned at the very top (ignore those digressions), I don't think she's on the level of Voldemort or Dumbledore.

I'm still not sure what caused the confusion, but if it was the mention of Voldemort and Dumbledore in my explanation, I was merely using them to illustrate what I meant when I said that possessing more magical knowledge often means power in the Wizarding World. Hermione being "booksmart" (ie. possessing significantly more knowledge than her peers) therefore translates to her being more powerful than most wizards and witches /her age./
