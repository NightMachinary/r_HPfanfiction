[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/kh5w7r/unpopular_opinion_hermione_is_actually_very/][This]] is my argument for Hermione's creativity. She doesn't just "parrot" what she learns from the books. That's selling her incredibly short.

  Tom Riddle and Dumbledore would never do that.

Tom Riddle and Voldemort also do not have an extremely reckless best friend whose interest in those objects is likely going to get himself and others hurt or killed. Her overcorrecting to stop instead of meeting these objects with curiosity makes perfect sense for her situation and is not an argument for her lack of curiosity.

Anyway, I do agree with you that she isn't inclined as a scientist in the same way Dumbledore and Voldemort were. Her interests laid in politics where theirs laid in magical advancement.

Copy-pasting my explanation from the other person I replied to.

  I don't believe I claimed that she was (as powerful. She isn't. Even if her baseline ability is like Dumbledore's or Voldemort's (which is a stretch I know, but let's suppose for the sake of the argument), they are inclined like scientists while she is inclined like a politician. She studies magic based on what she needs instead of learning for learning's sake. That's a tendency that would put her at a disadvantage against more curious individuals like Voldemort and DUmbledore were shown to be.

  My point really was more that her inclination towards power is a lot like Riddle's. They seek power because there are things that they want, and their experiences have taught them that it is only through gaining more power and knowledge that they could achieve their goals. Riddle desires immortality so he learns about and creates his horcruxes. Hermione desires to finish the war and keep harry safe, so she learns of esoteric charms and spells far above their year to do so.

  I was more referring to the similarities in disposition rather than raw ability.
