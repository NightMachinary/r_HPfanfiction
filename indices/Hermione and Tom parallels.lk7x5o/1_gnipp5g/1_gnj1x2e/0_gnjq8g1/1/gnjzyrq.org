  polyjuice potion, the DA coins, the Beaded Bag, the protection charms, using non-combat magic in combat situations

The only two things here that discredit book smart are the coins, which were a bite off the Dark Mark, and using spells not as they were intended, but Ron does this with the troll and I'm certain he's not the only one. None of this is "ingenious."

  booksmart is how you become powerful in the Wizarding World

As shown by Snape, Dumbledore, and TMR parroting what you found in a book isn't the end all and be all of becoming powerful. Hermione lacks all their creativity and ingenuity. She doesn't look at the Marauder's Map and the Prince's book as anything other than dangerous. She heard Harry's wand moved of its own accord and learned of the Hallows only to deny both. Tom Riddle and Dumbledore would never do that.
