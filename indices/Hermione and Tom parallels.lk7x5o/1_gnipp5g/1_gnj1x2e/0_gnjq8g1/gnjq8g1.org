I hate the booksmart argument so much. Hermione is so important to the plot precisely because of how she /applies/ her magic. Off the top of my head, there's the polyjuice potion, the DA coins, the Beaded Bag, the protection charms, using non-combat magic in combat situations etc. etc. She isn't "just booksmart" by any measure.

More generally, with the exception of magic based on intent and emotion (which the minority of the magic by a huge margin), booksmart is how you become powerful in the Wizarding World. Knowledge is literally power there. The more spells you know, the more powerful you are. The most powerful wizards are noted based on how varied their spellwork is in a duel. Dumbledore and Voldemort are the most powerful people in the world precisely because of the extent of their magical knowledge. Hermione's "booksmart" therefore directly translates into "power".

Also, her EE in DADA isn't indicative of her power. It's a matter of personality. Gut and nerve when facing stuff like Boggarts for example can make or break your score. Extremely cognitive Hermione will get points docked because she'd freeze up, not because she can't perform the magic.

So yes, Hermione is in fact a very powerful witch.
