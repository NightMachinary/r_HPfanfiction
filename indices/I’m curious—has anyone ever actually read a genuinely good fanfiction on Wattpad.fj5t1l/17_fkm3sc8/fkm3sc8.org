I remember I found a really interesting crossover with Twilight (which I know is really radical). It basically set up Hermione as Bella's sister. It obviously changed up a lot of things but was very creative.

And not fandom, but the best f/f stories I've read have been on Wattpad. Specifically one writer who's name I'm blanking on.
