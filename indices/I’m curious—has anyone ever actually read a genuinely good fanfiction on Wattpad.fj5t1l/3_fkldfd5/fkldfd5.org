I like [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter by writerer]] (and it has an unfinished sequel). It is very much non-adventure just the normal high-school life of teenagers in the magical school (and yes, Daisy Dursley is a daughter of Dudley), but if you like Kipling's Stalky & Co. or most high-school TV series, then this is pretty good. One of two best Dudley-has-magical-daughter type of stories.
