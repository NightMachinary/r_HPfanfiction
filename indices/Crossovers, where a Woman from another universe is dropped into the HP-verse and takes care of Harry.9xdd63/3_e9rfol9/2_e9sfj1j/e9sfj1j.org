One of those popular rune stories (just order FF filters by favourites, and completed and you'll see them.)has professor Babbling take him in. In it she's a young 20 yo or so professor just out of hogwarts. It was the first FF I read with her in it, so I always find it jarring when I read about her being old and boring like most other Ffs I've read since then.
