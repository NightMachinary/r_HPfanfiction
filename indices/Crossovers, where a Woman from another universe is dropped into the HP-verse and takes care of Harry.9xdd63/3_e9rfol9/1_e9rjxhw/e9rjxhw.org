Well, my own "No Longer Alone" started out because I found the lack of "protective adoptive family" stories disturbing. At least ones where Harry does not bang his adoptive sister in the end. The "momma-bear" role is split between Nymphadora and Andromeda.

Keep in mind that it is a pretty family-centric story, so no big action sequences or explosions. A little more friendship focused (Katie Bell, Hermione, Leanne) during the school year.
