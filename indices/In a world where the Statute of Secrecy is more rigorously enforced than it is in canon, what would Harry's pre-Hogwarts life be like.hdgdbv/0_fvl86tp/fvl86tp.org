Nurture vs. Nature, how much of Harry's personality is a product of his environment. Does his saving people thing stem from his inability to trust adults? Do his morals stem for his dislike of the Dursleys and the unfair way they treated him? Does Harry desire to be just Harry, a normal kid, stem from the Dursleys obsession with normality? Harry grew up not being allowed to ask questions, would he have known the basic stuff like that Voldemort's followers are called Death Eaters and that Sirius Black betrayed his parent before 3th and 4th year.

There is another kid in the household to see how Harry could have turned out were Petunia and Vernon to love him. But siblings are rarely carbon copies of eachother, so I'd hope for the wizarding world that Harry would be nothing like Dudley.
