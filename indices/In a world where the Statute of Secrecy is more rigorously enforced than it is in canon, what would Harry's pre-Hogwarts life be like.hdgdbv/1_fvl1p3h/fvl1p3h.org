I had a fanfic Voldemort wins idea like this, where his society is super strict and thinks all magical kids belong in the magical world so they memory charm the parents and steal the kids away at earliest signs of accidental magic, or if they're older and already attached they arrange for "accidents" to happen to make the kids more isolated and indebted to the magical world they "rightfully belong in."
