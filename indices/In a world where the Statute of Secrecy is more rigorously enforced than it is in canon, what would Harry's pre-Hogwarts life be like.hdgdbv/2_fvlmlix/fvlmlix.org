I wonder if Petunia would still be similar, unable to fully embrace Harry but not bitter enough to dump him in a cupboard.

I'm assuming she thinks Lily got headhunted by a fancy, secretive private school. So they still would have been estranged as Lily chose to live in the magical world and Petunia still could have felt abandoned and resentful; she just wouldn't have known why Lily left her behind.
