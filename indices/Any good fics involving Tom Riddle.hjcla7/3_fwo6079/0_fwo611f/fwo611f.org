  A fifteen-year-old Tom Riddle slips through time, pulled by a strange boy into a seemingly idyllic future. Harry Potter is thrown sideways into a different reality, one untouched by Voldemort's war.Taken into the Potter household, the two of them form an unlikely bond -- but between centaur magic, government conspiracies, and the darkness at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, this new world is not as it seems.
