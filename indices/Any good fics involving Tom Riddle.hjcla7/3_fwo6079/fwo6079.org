I've really been enjoying The Incantation of the Oak-Priest and I never see it recommended on here, which is a damn shame, really. It's a time-travel fic where Tom accidentally catches a ride with Harry to an alternate and seemingly idyllic future where both boys are taken in by the Potters. It's mostly gen, but there is the beginnings of a romance between Harry and Tom. linkao3(The Incantation of the Oak-Priest by relic_crown)
