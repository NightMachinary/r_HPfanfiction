1. Wizards cannot funnel magic into one another in canon, it's implied that they may create magic, control it, manipulate it, but they cannot absorb it (hence why Voldemort didn't just take all of Bellatrix's Magic and overcome anything Dumbledore sent his way in the Ministry).

2. We don't see everybody using Transfiguration in Duels in canon, in fact, from the people we've seen use it, it only seems to be reserved to those that are extremely prodigious at the art, when in combat. It's likely that it's a field of magic that provides a lot of magical 'strain', and requires a lot of talent, power, and creativity.

3. Bloodlusted Animals are still Animals, and once again, creating multiple animals at once is likely a lot of hard work, to the point where you will be significantly at a disadvantage if your enemy Duellist is someone quick on the draw (like Harry).

4. Don't believe Tag-Team Duelling is a thing, Duelling matches naturally have seconds if someone dies, but at no other point are they allowed to step in, at least, for a Standard Wizard's Duel (According to Malfoy, then later the Duelling Club).

5. Even in the scenario, that you set up above (which is likely the reason why they don't have 2v2 Duels or Tag-Team Duels), a Stronger opponent can still win. Take Dumbledore in the Department of Mysteries, apparently, he took down many Death Eaters before going to fight Voldemort, one of them probably attempted that strategy, and got their shield blown through and their arms blown off.
