I took a stab at a formal duel [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OMsEW54OUMXOhFI5upg0ViaqqyHVHv8Sf8diOV_pQyw/edit?usp=sharing][here]]. From my understanding of the books, tempo -- who's acting and who's reacting -- is very important in magical combat.

As [[/u/Taure]] said, nearly any spell that makes it past the opponent's defenses will end the duel in one way or another.

Depending on how much concentration, familiarity and effort apparition takes, combat anywhere that apparition is possible would be much, much more frenetic and chaotic than what we see in the movies.

We don't actually get a lot of professional-level magical combat in the books, and so things like the mechanics of shielding while casting other spells, transfiguring multiple things at a time, etc. don't get explored, and so we have to resort to fanon and/or speculation.
