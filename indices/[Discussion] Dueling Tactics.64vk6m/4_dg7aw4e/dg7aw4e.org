Lots of good points here already. Here's my contribution to the subject of magical combat.

Magical Dueling: Conventional magical combat is reminiscent of gunfights at low levels where taking cover is viable. At high levels cover becomes meaningless as the combatants are easily able to destroy or transfigure their surroundings and the combat begins to resemble sword fighting. Formalized dueling resembles fencing. Different shields block different kinds of spells more effectively and different spells are better at piercing certain shields. This creates a rock-paper-scissors scenario where the wizard with the larger repertoire of spells has a significant advantage (assuming they are otherwise evenly matched) because they have more options that their opponent won't know how to properly counter. A wizard with a sharp mind and sense of creativity can make effective use of even mundane spells that would not normally be considered combat spells. Low level spells are still relevant even at higher levels as distractions as well as the fact that many do not emit light when used and can be easily cast without notice due to their low complexity. The reason there are so many unnecessarily complicated and often gruesome dark curses (even though a severing curse to the neck is perfectly deadly) is because they were designed to be difficult to counter due to the strange and unique ways they operate as well as the shock factor to allies when they hit (though some of their creators really were just twisted fucks). Silent casting and casting with reduced wand movements provide a significant advantage in reducing your opponent's ability to counter. Another major skill is spell chaining, which is the act of sequencing spells such that their wand movements and incantations flow into each other in the most efficient manner such that the caster can get more spells downrange faster; serious duelists practice common and unique spell chains like a martial-artist practices kata. Unless the combatants are very evenly matched, most duels are fairly short affairs as it usually only takes a single successful hit to end a duel, either by directly disabling the opponent or setting them up for a subsequent finisher. Area-of-effect spells are usually difficult to cast but can effectively swing the momentum of a duel. Many mundane combat tactics (such as flanking, mobility, countering, misdirection, advantageous use of terrain, etc.) can be applied equally well to magical combat.
