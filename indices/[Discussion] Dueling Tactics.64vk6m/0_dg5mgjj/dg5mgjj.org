From what we see in Dumbledore vs. Voldemort, high level duels seem to be largely based around manoeuvring your opponent into a position where you can land a single incapacitating spell on them.

This makes a lot of sense compared to the fanon tank-like hour long duels in which each participant takes multiple hits and keeps fighting. Really, a single spell should be enough to end any duel. Either it incapacitates the opponent instantly, or it puts them at sufficient disadvantage that you're able to gain the upper hand and incapacitate them shortly after.

So the key is to land a single successful spell. With unequal opponents, this simply means overpowering your opponent, as Dumbledore did against the Death Eaters in the DoM. But with equal opponents, where you can't blast through your opponent's defences, you have to find a way around them.

We see a number of tactics to this end in the Dumbledore vs Voldemort duel. The base of these tactics seems to be trying to get your opponent to have to dispel a complex attack, which keeps them busy while you reposition yourself via apparition to launch another attack while they're still vulnerable. A variation on this is to gain a "multiple attacks" advantage by reversing your opponent's spell back on them rather than merely dispelling it. For example, Voldemort turning Dumbledore's fire whip into a snake. This means that you get "2 attacks for the price of one" which keeps the opponent extra busy and leaves an opening for you to land another spell on them.

This leaves a hanging question: is the best tactic therefore to gang up on people? It seems to depend heavily on skill level. For all her vaunted skill, Bellatrix barely even qualifies as a distraction in the Dumbledore vs Voldemort duel. Dumbledore dispatches a single animated guardian to deal with her, and she can't do anything to stop it -- all her spells bounce off it, whereas Voldemort's spells smash the guardians. This seems to indicate that a bunch of weak wizards ganging up on a powerful wizard like Dumbledore and Voldemort will not produce the same "distract them then land a spell on them" effect as we see when powerful wizards attempt the same tactic.

We see a similar scene at the battle of Hogwarts, where Slughorn, McGonagall and Kingsley gang up on Voldemort but can't touch him, and in fact lose the duel many times over -- it's only Harry's sacrificial protection that stops them from being quickly swept aside by Voldemort, since he lands multiple spells on them, it's just that they're protected from them.
