A tag-team duel would involve an incredible level of coordination, especially if one was shielding and the other attacking. The shield would need to be dropped and the spells cast at precisely the right time to prevent both friendly spells from hitting the shield, and the unfriendly ones from hitting the pair while the shield is down. The Killing Curse also limits the utility of such a setup on the battlefield. Levels of success would vary greatly depending on the skill of the opponent and pair.

It would be more ideal, I think, to have a pair constantly on offense. They could do a pincer move, and circle around opposite sides of an single opponent. That would make it very difficult for the enemy to see all oncoming spells, and just as difficult to block them (depending partially on whether the author portrays the Shield Charm as a dome around or as a flat surface in front of the caster).

Other things, like one of the two Transfiguring the surface beneath the opponent to oil or another highly flammable substance while the other uses flame attacks would be interesting. The trick would be to use two spells, both of which would normally damage an opponent, but would also interact to produce a third, unexpected, effect. The changing raindrops into icicles is a good idea, but it doesn't really play on the power of two duelists - you still have only one end attack (the ice spears), and countering them would only be as difficult as countering the initial raindrops. It would be more efficient for one wizard just to condense and freeze the moisture in the air into ice spears in the first place.
