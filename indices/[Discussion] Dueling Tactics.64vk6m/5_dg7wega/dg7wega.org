Assuming the tag team has substantial teamwork, high coordination, and all the fighters are around the same skill level this could work. We don't see many complex spells in Harry Potter the fighting seems pretty straight forward dodge, attack, block repeat and quite frankly, the fighters tend to lack creativity or maybe just simply lack the skill and power (Voldemort vs Dumbeldore had a creative edge to it) so I'm not entirely sure this would work but...

For example, two people can have a ring with some kind of twist effect or very small hidden blade compartment that draws blood with certain subtle movements and teleports the other who is also wearing a ring to the person who activated it or lets them switch places. It would work kind of like a portkey that only rakes you to the other one. It would completely blindside the person you are fighting and they wouldn't be prepared for a strange occurrence such as that.

I mean think about it, you're dueling someone and they are entirely focused on you. You're partner is dueling someone else, when out of nowhere he/she is now by your side sending two attacks from different angles and can press the attack. Basically this is how it would work,

You guys would show off your spectacular team work to make who you're fighting think it's better to fight 1vs1 and separate you two. Now you're fighting one person, while you're partner will fight farther farther away from you. As this happens, the opponents have to think they have the advantage here and they will press it. Then at the right moment, you activate the teleportation. Now you both are fighting 1 enemy instead of 2 while the other doesn't know what happened. The person you were fighting now has to deal with attacks from two angles and two people.

I find the idea of a double connected portkey quite intriguing, could even develop this more to be able to orchestrate full on ambushes. A group like the Death-Eaters would take full advantage of something like that. Idk about anybody else but if I was a Harry Potter characters I'd be making new spells, curses, tools, battle items, etc left and right. I would never be satisfied with what is available, I'd be a Scientist Wizard. Well I guess that technically counts as an Alchemist? but whatever. I mean seriously, don't the antagonist in the series get bored of the same killing curse and Cruciatus curse? Gets old very fast need to spice things up
