The best fem!Harry fic, in my opinion, is linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) linkao3(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus).\\
No femslash, (unless you count Ginny with a crush on Lily [fem!harry]) but it's REALLY REALLY GOOD. VERY.

I also really like linkffn(When Harry Met Tom) linkao3(When Harry Met Tom).\\
No femslash, but also very good, but that's to be expected because it's written by the same author that wrote that fic up there.

Hope you check these out and please reply to my comment to tell me how good you thought they were!!

(P.S. they're both ongoing, and if the update date seems some time ago, that's because she [the author] has a lot of ongoing fics, and updates them in order, but it really is worth the wait üòÅ)
