Not sure if this is still updated, but it is some pure fire dude:

You have preobably read these, they are very similar and both very good, archeologist is slight bloodborne xover, but don't worry about it. Note that these are both time travel fics with Harry becooming a woman after some sort of incident and the romance takes more of a back seat here:

Decidedly not femslash, but good and timetravely:

This list is almost all fem!Harry femslash, which is good as good cause it is very niche, however alot of it is in another language and/or is marked as 'yuri' which means it is probably more than a bit lewd (not 'shoujo-ai' which is tends to be wholesome):
