Yeah, the last 2 books sucked in comparison but I think your list of changes are overlong for the payoffs. There are plenty of fics where Harry improves himself in 4th/5th/6th year and several where there is a proper war with the death eaters. (And I agree that Harry should have been in that war gaining experience.)

However, very few of those have McGonagall rescuing him from Quirrelmort.
