Man TL;DR is right you missed the entire point of this focusing on minor details instead. The point is to keep building up to the epic showdown between Harry/Voldemort in Book 7 instead of the disappointment of Book 6/7 Harry and friends. I mean they go from fighting inner circle Death Eaters in book 5 to getting captured by tier 3 baddies who are not good enough to be Death Eaters in Book 7.
