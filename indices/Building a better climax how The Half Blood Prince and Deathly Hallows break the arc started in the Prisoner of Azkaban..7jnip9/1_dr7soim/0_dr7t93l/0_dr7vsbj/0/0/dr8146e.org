The very reason Dumbledore never bothered to train Harry was that he needed Harry to sacrifice himself. As long as Dumbledore pursued that plan, Harry would never get the necessary support from the Order unless he and other members dared to defy Dumbledore (which we didn't see it happen in canon).

The scar didn't necessary have to be dealt with, but a solution other than sacrificing Harry had to exist.
