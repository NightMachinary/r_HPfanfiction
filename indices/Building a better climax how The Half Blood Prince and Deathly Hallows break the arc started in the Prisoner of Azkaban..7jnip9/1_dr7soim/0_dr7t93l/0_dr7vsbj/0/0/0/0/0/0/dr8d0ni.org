I'm not entirely sure an obscure spell or two is going to level the playing field between Voldemort and Harry. Or at least in my mind it shouldn't and I think that would be a let down for me. The man is 50 years older minus the 13 years he spent diddling around as a spirit-y thing..

I also think Dumbledore giving Harry the knowledge of how Voldemort functions and his history is a legit type of training that gets brushed over way to often. Knowing your enemy is key.

However, it's your story so do what makes you happy!! :) Good luck!
