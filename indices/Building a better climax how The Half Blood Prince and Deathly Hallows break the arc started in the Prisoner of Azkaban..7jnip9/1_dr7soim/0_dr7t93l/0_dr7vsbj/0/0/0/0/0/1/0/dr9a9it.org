That is why I am suspecting that the Deathly Hallows are going to have to be the trump card. Probably after Harry has tried every trick and spell he has learned only for it to not be enough (even after dying and coming back). After all in canon we see that the master of the Hallows embraces death as an old friend and a part of life and that is something Voldemort cannot understand.
