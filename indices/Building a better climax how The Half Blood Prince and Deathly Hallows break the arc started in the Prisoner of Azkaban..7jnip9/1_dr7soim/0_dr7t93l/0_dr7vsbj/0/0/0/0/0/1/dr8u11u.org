I agree with the other commenter that Harry would be better off searching for unfair advantages in areas other than dark magic.

Since Voldemort had a huge thing for anything destructive, even Muggle weapons of mass destruction might not surprise him that much. This was a guy who had personally lived through the London Blitz, travelled the world extensively during the Cold War, and spent decades to push his own destructive power to the limit.

But anything that required him to risk his own life or care about other people was totally off limits to him.
