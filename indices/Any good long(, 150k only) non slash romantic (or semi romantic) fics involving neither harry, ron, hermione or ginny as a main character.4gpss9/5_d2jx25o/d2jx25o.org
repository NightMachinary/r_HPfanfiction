I feel like Alexandra Quick is the obvious answer to this if you haven't read it already. Takes place in US well after the British war with Voldemort is over. Tone wise, think fifth book and up.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is pretty good, and the golden trio are very much secondary characters, but the tone is pretty silly throughout.
