Those Gilded Chains We Wear by KuraiBites, it's Hermione/Bellatrix.

I was hesitant at first, but I came around and fell in love with the story really fast.

Summary: "During the battle for Hogwarts, Hermione accepts to do the Unbreakable Vow with Bellatrix to protect the people she loves. But binding herself to the dark witch has more consequences than she could ever have anticipated."
