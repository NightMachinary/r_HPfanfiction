Exactly that, this was what happened to me, one of my first H/Hr was HP and Fifth element (1.3m words) and I absolutely loved it, thought that HHr was a lot better than H/G, and started reading a lot HHr, but then, with a lot of fics with Ron bash, it eventually soured my opinion of him... Mostly because the first actual HP fic I've read was "Angry Harry and Seven" which is a horrible fic, but it introduced me to Daphne, which I loved from the get-go. And a lot of Harry/Daph fics have major Ron bash, mostly because she's a slimy snek. But I think the deal breaker was reading that series "Congregation of Asp" or smth like that. Over time, I just became more and more annoyed with Hermione "I S2 Authorities" and all that trope, eventually becoming my most hated character in HP, with a few exceptions, like a battle-veteran Hermione from "Stages of Hope" or an AU Hermione like from "What we're fighting for" from James spookie. Stuff like that. To be honest, I'd say i'm still a bit new to fanfics, only having started a bit over a year ago, but I have read quite a lot already...
