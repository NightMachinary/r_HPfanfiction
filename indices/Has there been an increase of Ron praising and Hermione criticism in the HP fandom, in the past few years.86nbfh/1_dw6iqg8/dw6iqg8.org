I feel like when you first get into fanfiction, people are naturally inclined against Ron and favour Hermione. The movies didn't do him justice and the Hermione/Ron ship isn't that popular.

The more time you spend in the fandom, seeing Ron getting bashed, the more you're likely to become bored of it. While you may have at first appreciated seeing it, as you spend more time analysing the characters, Hermione's flaws become more apparent and Ron seems more sympathetic. When I first started reading fanfiction, though I never personally disliked Ron, I exclusively stuck to Harry-centric stories; now I've moved beyond them. The other thing might just be influential stories appearing that have Ron in a likeable role becoming popular which shifted people's opinions, but I'm not sure.

The fandom in general has gotten older I think, including the people in it. I'd be curious to know how long ago the average fanfic reader read the Harry Potter books. It was ~2006 for me. Anyway, that's why I think there might have been an opinion shift over time.
