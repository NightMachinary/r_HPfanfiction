Character analysis aside, I think as the fandom ages they realize that the pairing of Hermione and Ron wouldn't be ideal given what we know about them. They could fall in love of course, but other pairings might work out better long term. Writers are catering to this too much, and I say this as someone who reads 80% H/Hr. Honestly, Neville and Hermione are better suited than any of the canon pairings. Easily the two most loyal characters and incredibly brave as well, not to mention the +2 sappy romance factor of sitting together on their first trip to Hogwarts,

This unfortunately seems to translate to a need to tear down Ron Weasley instead of evolving him into another role.
