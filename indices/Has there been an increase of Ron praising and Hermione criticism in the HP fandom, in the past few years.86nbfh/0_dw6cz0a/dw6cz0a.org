I think it's because of a reaction to the Hermione boost the movies did to her character and the character assassination they performed on Ron, isn't that about when we got a lot of Weasley bashing ? Personally I'm thrilled as Ron is an underappreciated character and I'd like to see Hermione brought down to the fallible, human, and therefore more interesting, person she is. Disservice to both their characters has been done
