I like Ron. I think he has the capacity to be funny, charming and yes a complete shit and brute, but who doesn't? I've only written a very few stories of the HP characters as teenagers because I find adults much more interesting and versatile. I use him as a foil for Harry. When Harry is too intense, Ron is there to settle him down and when Harry is about to do something ridiculous, Ron is there to talk sense into him. He has no qualms of telling Harry off, but he never hesitates to support him when needed. Ron will be the guy you call when you need to hide a body, no questions asked.

In the books, I kind of think that Ron was the most "teenager-y" of the teenagers. Moody, insecure and a complete shit sometimes because he /could/ be. He had a freedom neither Harry or Hermione had. Harry because ... well ... /Harry/ and Hermione because of all the pressure she put onto herself. Ron was just the last, least exceptional son in a bunch who happened to befriend two extradorinaiy individuals and there's nothing wrong with that. He was our window into what a normal wizarding upbringing could be.

Now, I say all that and right now, he and Hermione are just kind of chilling out in my Potterverse. They're kind of like that couple that are there and super chill and cool to hang with. I like using them as support characters for my Harry/Ginny stories, but I'm having some trouble coming up with ideas for the two of them. Maybe they need a vacation?
