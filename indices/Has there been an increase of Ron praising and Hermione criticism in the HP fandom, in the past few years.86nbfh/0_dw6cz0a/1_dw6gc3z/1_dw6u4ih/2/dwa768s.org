More like a divorce -.-

Sorry, but I don't see Ron supporting Hermione's ambitions...he might not think of her as a brood-mother like his mom (hell, Ron probably wouldn't want many kids because he thinks growing up with many siblings is kind of crappy because your parents have only so much attention to give etc. especially when some of the kids are away most of the time (Hogwarts and later on because of work, I mean Charlie isn't home often IMHO and Bill isn't either probably!) and get almost all of the attention when they are back home!), but I don't think he'd work well with a wife that is better than him in every regard (it would be a repeat of his childhood all over, being the unremarkable sidekick of a successful and intelligent woman! Hell, he would basically be the "housewife" in that relationship, I don't think he would like that at all!)

ps: I am discarding the crapilogue (canon my ass, even Rowling admits that a lot of it was wish-fulfillment and sticking "to the plan" (Ron/Hermione for example! She admitted that she only did that because that's what she had planned!))
