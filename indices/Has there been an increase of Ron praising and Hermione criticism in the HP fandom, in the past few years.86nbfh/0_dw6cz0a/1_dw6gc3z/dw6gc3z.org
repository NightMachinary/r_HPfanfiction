Ah, there we have a Ron supporter --- just the sort of chap I was looking for. In all seriousness, being a writer who's desperately tyring to figure out what to /do/ with Ron, what would your advice for writing him be? (The main character is a somewhat AU Hermione, and it's /not/ a romance, with or without Ron.)
