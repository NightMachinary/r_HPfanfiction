Ron understands people? No, otherwise he would not have treated Harry like he did in GoF! We all know that Harry would live in poverty for the rest of his life if he could get his parents back (Hell, he'd probably give up the money to just get away from the Dursleys!) and Ron is jealous because he has some money (It's not like canon Harry is uber-rich and will never have to work if he doesn't want to!)

If anything Ron is good at strategic thinking, but he never develops that beyond chess (hell, it should have been the other way round: Harry the prefect and Ron the quidditch-captain!)
