I don't have a particular story in mind, but my favorite characterization of Ron is when he's obviously knowledgeable of Wizarding politics but it only seeps through in moments you wouldn't expect it.

Like Harry and Hermione are discussing a strategy to convince the Wizengamot to listen to their point of view, and Ron just kind of offhandedly says something profound that /makes sense/. Why? Because he's /smart/ - if perhaps not in the same way as Hermione - he's just bogged down by the accomplishments of his family and those he surrounds himself with. He's insightful about and understands /people/, something that Hermione and Harry are both absolute shit at.

A Ron who slowly comes out of his shell of feeling mediocre to show he's a genuine asset to the trio, who can make allies where the other two wouldn't ever be able to, who can be the strategist not because he /plays Chess/, but because he knows the world and its inhabitants in a way that Hermione and Harry couldn't.

I love Neville as much as the next fanfiction reader, but when people shove the "Face" and representative of their movement onto him instead of /Ronald Motherfucking Weasley/ it infuriates me.

That being said, I hate the Hermione/Ron ship. You can love Ron as a character and still think that he and Hermione would never work as a couple.
