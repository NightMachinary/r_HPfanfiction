Remember, in DH, he was a key resource in their planning of their infiltration of the ministry. He knows about the day to day things that anyone growing up would, like how the government functions and a bit about they key players. Think of yourself in high school--you knew who was who in the elections, at least for pres and if you were more aware, local and state elections too. Remember, Ron's dad is the sub-head of an entire department and is later promoted to head, and does talk about work at home. If you think of the Wizarding government as being more like the state government of a US state or a ministry in the UK (e.g. Education Ministry), then subheads know the other heads and subheads, and generally attend department and interdepartmental meetings. Ron would know a little bit, at least, of the dynamics involved in politics and the major players and their motivations, as described by his dad, and probably his brothers, growing up. Bill works for Gringotts in, essentially, Acquisitions, so he understands the economic side of things somewhat, so Ron can always send him an owl too. Even given that he's a kid at first, he still knows some of what's going on. As kids, we knew about Bush and Kerry, we knew about the Twin Towers and the WikiLeaks leak about prior warning etc. We knew about Rice (Sec of State), the UN, etc. I know, as an eleven year old, I watched 60 minutes with my dad. The Weasley's listen to the Wireless and their mum and dad mostly decide what they listen to.
