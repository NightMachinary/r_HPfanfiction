He should be the main source of knowledge on the Wizarding World, not Hermione. If there's politics, he would be able to play the game growing up as he did in a pureblood family who works for the Ministry. He's loyal, friendly, willing to fight for his friends. His jealousy is overrated; only major time was Goblet and he's 14, who isn't an idiot at 14? Second is in DH and we know for a fact he was influenced by the Horcrux.
