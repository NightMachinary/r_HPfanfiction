Harry and Hermione may have been negatively influenced, but the Horcrux did specifically target Ron. Add that to the fact that Harry, at least twice, explicitly told Ron to leave. And Ron wanted to come back to them as soon as he was free from the Horcrux's influence, but could not because of external circumstances (Snatchers).
