The Horcrux targeted Ron specifically at the end when they were about to destroy it. There's nothing (that I recall) in DH that indicates his exposure to it was worse when they were passing around the locket. Also, lots of people have regrets immediately after they do something stupid, that doesn't mean Ron was being specifically hit harder by the Horcrux (also, I'm pretty sure Ron left the Horcrux before Disapparating, so it's not like he didn't have time outside it's influence before teleporting away). If anything, Harry had it worse since he also had the pain from his scar too.
