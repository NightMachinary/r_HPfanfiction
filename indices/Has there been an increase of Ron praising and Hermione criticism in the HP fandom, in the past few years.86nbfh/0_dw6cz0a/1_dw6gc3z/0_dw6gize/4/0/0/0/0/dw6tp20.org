It did not say it specifically targeted Ron over the others when they wore the locket, it just played on Ron's fears, as it did the others. Also, as I said, Ron took off the Horcrux and then left after. Neither Harry nor Hermione got so bent out of shape that they tried to abandon their friends. My issue is this is in line with his behavior in GoF, otherwise I'd be tempted to think it was more the a Horcrux than anything.
