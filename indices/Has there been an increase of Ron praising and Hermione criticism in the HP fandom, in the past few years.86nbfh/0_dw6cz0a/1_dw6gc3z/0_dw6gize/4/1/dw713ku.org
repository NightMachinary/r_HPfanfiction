For whatever reason, abandoning your friend not once but /twice/ in the face of peril and death constitutes being loyal to most Harry Potter fans on reddit. Every time I've seen the very idea of Ron being disloyal it's downvoted, and it's always pointed out in his positives. I don't understand it one iota. You judge a friendship on trust and loyalty. Ron has shown multiple times you can't trust him to be loyal when the shit hits the fan. His never stops being jealous and envious of Harry, down to the very last page of the series (longing for the Elder Wand Harry was giving up). Twice in four years he leaves Harry to the wolves while Hermione stands by his side like, yknow, a loyal friend, in the exact same scenarios.

Ron is a fine character, and a lot can be done with him in FF to continue that trend. But I've never seen a good argument for why Ron could ever be thought of as loyal.
