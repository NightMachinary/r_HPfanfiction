The attitude that was daring to trod on Ron's precious lack of self-esteem? They were already contentious up to this point, and were paired off. Ron was doing it wrong, so Hermione snapped at him how to do it correctly. Ron snarled back to prove it, she did, and got praised for it. It was only /then/ that Ron decided it was too far and that, to paraphrase, nobody could ever like such a person. But yeah, that's /all/ on Hermione's 'bad attitude'.

And let's not forget that her 'bad attitude' likely is the only reason Ron could properly cast that spell later that day to levitate the troll's club.
