Productive discourse works like this: you state a point, I disagree with said point and tell you why you're wrong, and you then have the option of either agreeing with my rationale, or disagreeing with it and telling me why I'm wrong. And so it goes until someone agrees, in a perfect world.

If you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong and give me your rationale. Don't be a passive aggressive child and huff that I didn't treat you like a delicate flower. I took the time to respect you and write a lengthy response to your initial statement that you never saw a reasonable argument for Ron's loyalty, all I ask is for that same respect back, and not an angry retort that I'm a condescending dick.

I'll give you an example of my first point. You state that ranting to your friend about a disagreeable person is bullying. I disagree, and think you're wrong. Hermione did something rude and annoying, which grated on Ron's nerves. Instead of pushing her around or telling her to her face that she's a know-it-all with no friends, he went to his friend Harry and let his feelings known to him. Everyone has done this. Bullies, victims, nice people, bad people, everyone in between. It's a way of letting some of the frustration and anger go without hurting anybody else. Ron's only mistake was doing it within earshot of Hermione.

I'd love to continue this discussion further, if you'd like. But if not, that's cool too. There's no reason for whatever animosity you have towards me, because I have none towards you, no matter how much condescension you perceive.
