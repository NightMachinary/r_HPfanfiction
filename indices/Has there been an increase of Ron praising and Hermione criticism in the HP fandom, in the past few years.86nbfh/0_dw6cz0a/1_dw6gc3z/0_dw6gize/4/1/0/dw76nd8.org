Arguments for Ron being loyal... that's a tough one. Let's take a crack at it.

In year one he felt bad that Hermione was crying in the bathroom because she heard a (tbh well deserved) comment /she wasn't supposed to hear/ so he and Harry ran to the bathroom to save her with very little hesitation.

Later that year he stands on top of a giant chessboard, looking at massive stone chess pieces just waiting to hurt him, and decides that the best course of action is to sacrifice himself so that his two friends won't get hurt and they can go ahead.

In year two after Harry never returned any of the letters he sent him, he gets frightened for his best friend and gets Fred and George to come with him on a rescue mission, flagrantly disobeying his parents and the Ministry. Just because he thought his friend might be in trouble. Then he stands by him when the rest of the school thinks he's the Heir of Slytherin, even though he has the same fear of Parseltongue that's embedded in British wizarding culture since Slytherin's time. He then follows Harry into the Forbidden Forest, following a trail of spiders, which he's deathly afraid of, only to come face to face with gigantic spiders.

In third year he stands up on a badly broken leg in front of his friends, in front of what he believed to be Voldemort's right hand man, a man who he thought was a sadistic murderer, and said, “If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!”

In fifth year he stands up to peer pressure and tells Seamus that he has Harry's back, and he believes him fully, even though the entirety of the British wizarding world thought Harry and Dumbledore were nuts. Then he joins Harry to fly to London to save Sirius, even though he thought he was flying towards Lord Voldemort.

In seventh year he leaves his family during one of the most trying times of their lives, and joins his friends on a hunt for Horcruxes, braving Death Eaters, dragons, goblins, and everything else with only his faith in Harry and Dumbledore to guide him. Then, for Hermione, he thinks of saving the house elves, beings he was taught were lesser than humans for his entire life.

Yeah, I left out year 4 and year 7 when he left.

Throughout this, Ron is a kid. An average kid, with maybe above average skill in chess, but still just an average kid. All his life he's been in the shadow of quidditch stars, pranksters that get all the attention, perfect-in-every-way Bill, and studious Percy. Then he makes friends with the savior of the wizarding world, and the smartest girl he's ever met.

I'm not excusing what he did in fourth year. What he did was disloyal and the height of jealousy and pettiness. But that's what fourteen year old kids are a lot of the time. He came back, however, and apologized and /meant it/. Because that's what real friends do.

In 7th year he was influenced by the Horcrux. Period. There's no way you can blame it on him, unless you can also blame Ginny for releasing the Basilisk and petrifying all those people. Not only him, but Harry was influenced too. They were both angry, miserable, and every negative emotion was amplified until it boiled over. The second Ron left and the horcrux was off him, he realized what a colossal mistake he made and tried to go back -- but couldn't. To call this being disloyal is putting your own biases ahead of facts.

Which is what Ron hatred is. Ignoring and forgetting every good thing he did and focusing on the one time he did something stupid, and one time he was influenced by outside forces to do something stupid.

Hey look at that, finding evidence for loyalty wasn't that hard at all. ;)

Meanwhile Hermione straight up doesn't give a shit that Crookshanks murdered Scabbers (which all the evidence pointed to) and didn't give a shit about Harry's Firebolt or his feelings, to the extent that without talking to Harry, maneuvers things so that he gets it taken away and then acts the victim when he gets mad at her.

Oh lets not forget her massive inferiority complex in Half Blood Prince when she got so jealous that Harry dared do things better than her in potions. Why is this forgotten, while Ron's isn't? I wonder...

But she's perfect in every way so she's made into some kind of goddess in every fic.
