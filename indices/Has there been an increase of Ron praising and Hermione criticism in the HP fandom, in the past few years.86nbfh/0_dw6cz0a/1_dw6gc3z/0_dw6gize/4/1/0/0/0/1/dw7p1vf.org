Shocking, someone who thinks bullying is completely fine and totally okay because 'it wasn't supposed to be heard' doesn't realize when they're being a dick.

You straight up say the only way I can hold my opinion is via projecting. You dismiss an entire argument you're against by essentially saying 'well, that's /your/ problem'. You then further discredit my argument by sarcastically attacking unrelated parts of Hermione's character, backhandedly insulting my argument again by implying she's a 'goddess' in my eyes. And 'goddess' forbid Ron looking better than perfect Hermione.

I could waste my time and further explain why Ron is a dick, but you've made it incredibly clear that my opinion is a far more inferior opinion than yours. I'd just prove my biases have overtaken me once again.
