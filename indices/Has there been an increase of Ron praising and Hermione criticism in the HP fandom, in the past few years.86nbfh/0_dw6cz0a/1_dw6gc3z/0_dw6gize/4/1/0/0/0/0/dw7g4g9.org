That wasn't condescending at all, If I could give you more than one upvote, I could.

I would add one thing to your list, and perhaps include a footnote: First of all, still in first year, when Harry, Hermione and Neville are all ostracized for losing Gryffindor 150 points, Ron is the only one who stands by them, even though associating with Harry and Hermione means he gets shunned and detested by assosiation.

As for the footnote, I'd add that for the falling-out in fourth year, Harry was in no way innocent here. He got butthurt that Ron didn't believe him, refused to explain anything, and then when Hermione tried to get him to talk he just got angry. The most Ron did during the fight was pull away from Harry and sulk -- Harry hurled insults and threw badges at Ron. And yet fans don't seem to see anything wrong with Harry's behaviour in all of this. Protagonist-centered morality at its finest!

It always irked me that while Ron tried to apologise for his behavior, Harry never did... and never even seemed to consider that he had anything to apologise for. Harry has a lot of admirable qualities and there's no denying that overall he's a compassionate and heroic person... but he can be a bit of a self-centered douche.
