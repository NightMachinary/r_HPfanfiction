I appreciate you took the time to try and rebuff me.

Hermione didn't leave in book 4 because she's not suffering from the same things Ron is suffering from. But she has problems of her own, which I'll get to.

Ron was literally wearing the horcrux when the fight started. He had been wearing it all day. Harry and Hermione had not. That's the difference here. That's why you can't compare him to Hermione staying. Hermione even said:

  “Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually high. “Please take it off. You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day.”
#+end_quote

And we know that Hermione is always right, isn't that what you've said?

Let's talk about her. In 3rd year she got a pet. It was an ugly cat, that's all they knew about it. I'm pretty sure it was Sirius who told them it was half kneazle. And the cat had been after Scabbers since before Hermione bought him. And the first thought that goes through people's heads shouldn't be, "Scabbers is untrustworthy!" but rather that cats like to kill and eat smaller animals, as they are a predator species.

When Ron was trying to find out what was wrong with Scabbers, when Crookshanks appeared out of nowhere and tried to catch Scabbers, Ron and Harry had to run outside and go all the way to the Quidditch store to finally get him. Hermione stayed inside the pet store and bought Scabbers. That's a shitty friend. A friend's first instinct is to help a friend in need, and Ron's pet rat had just escaped. But all Hermione could think of was buying the cat that put Ron in the predicament he was in.

And then every time Crookshanks saw Ron, he would attack the pocket Scabbers was in. Hermione, instead of stopping the cat, would tell Ron to get over it and calm down and to not shove Crookshanks away. Again, that's a shitty friend, and a shitty pet owner. Hermione's response to everything was to minimize Ron's feelings and put Crookshanks above everything else.

Then it happened. Ron went to his room to find Scabbers, but only found blood. He also found Crookshanks fur. Hermione refused to believe that Crookshanks killed and ate Scabbers, /despite all the evidence to support Ron/. Crookshanks was always on the prowl for Scabbers, to the point that Harry once had to drag him out of the dorm when the cat tried to sneak in, but because Hermione didn't want to believe it, she didn't.

Hermione's greatest flaw is that she always thinks she's right. And granted, many times she is. But when she thinks she's right, she refuses to back down. In the same book, Lavender's beloved pet rabbit died and she was in tears over the news. Hermione only cared about proving that Trelawney wasn't right, disregarding all social norms and everyone else's feelings -- because she had to prove that she was better than Trelawney. Her being right took priority over everything else, no matter that everyone was glaring at her for being an insensitive asshole.

So she refused to apologize, because that would have made wrong about Crookshanks from the start, and that she was wrong to always come to his defense.

Then she refused to apologize about the Firebolt, and even said I TOLD YOU SO when it turned out that Sirius did send it, because, again, proving she's right is really important to her. My issue with her in this instance is not that she told McGonagall, she was right to do so. My issue was that she didn't even try and convince Harry to go to McGonagall or Dumbledore himself. She took it upon herself to do it, because she was convinced she was right.

The problem is that you're looking at her actions in 20/20 hindsight. You have to look at them as they occur. Yes, Scabbers was Pettigrew and a rat animagus which Crookshanks immediately smelled out, and that was why he was always attacking him. But then -- Hermione scoffed at Ron when Ron said that Crookshanks wasn't a normal cat, that he actually knew what he was saying and that's how he knew where Scabbers was. She was wrong about that, but never cared enough to bring it up.

We only find all this out when we learn Pettigrew is a animagus. Before that point, everything pointed to Scabbers being finally eaten by the cat that had been after him the entire year. Pettigrew staged the scene to make it seem like that's exactly what happened. A friend, a true friend, would suck in their pride and apologize whole heartedly. They would be devastated, horrified, that their pet killed their best friend's pet. They would feel sick to their stomach. Hermione pushed all these feelings aside because she didn't want to be wrong, and told Ron that he had no proof, so Crookshanks was innocent, and never apologized.

Harry did the equivalent of using better and simpler methods to achieve the same or better result in potions than he would by using the standard method taught, the one which Hermione used. He's not cheating. These are actually better ways to do potions, because Snape is a genius who figured these ways out when he was Hermione's age. If, as you say, Hermione was angry because Harry was using shortcuts to do better than her, the non-jealous reaction would be to ask Harry to see the book, see the methods, and try and figure out why they worked better than the standard method, and then start using these methods herself. That's what any good scientist would do. But she refused, and continued using the standard method, and got mad at Harry when he kept beating her, because he was using better methods.

But people are missing the point. It's GOOD that Hermione has flaws. Everyone has flaws. But people ignore these gigantic flaws in order to make her the perfect girl for Harry, and that's why fanon Hermione is such a terrible character.
