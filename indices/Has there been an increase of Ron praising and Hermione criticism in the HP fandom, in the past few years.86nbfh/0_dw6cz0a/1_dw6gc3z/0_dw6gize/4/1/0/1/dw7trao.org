1.  Well deserved? No one deserves to be bullied Ron is clearly upset (or embarrassed) that the muggleborn witch is better at magic than him and attacks her after she tried to help him master the spell and only goes along to help her because of Harry. Loyalty to Harry maybe but I think it is more attempting to keep from getting in trouble.
2.  That is a fair point Ron does sacrifice himself in the chess game to let them go forward.
3.  2nd year yep he is a good friend to Harry. The 2nd year examples, however, requires very little personal sacrifice on his part for that loyalty.
4.  Again though given that Sirius is believed to be mass murderer the likelihood of hiding behind Harry would increase the odds of surviving are slim.
5.  I see you leave out book 4 until latter. I will address it here let me just point out that even after knowing what Harry is going to face Ron cannot get over himself enough to tell his 'best mate' about the dragon he is going to face. It certainly seems that Ron chooses his pride over Harry's safety.
6.  Because his family (except of Percy) all believe Dumbledore as well it takes very little personal risk on his part to back Harry especially given his higher social status as a prefect which he uses against Seamus to shut him up. Yes, Ron goes on the London mission, however, so do Ginny, Neville and Luna all of who have not been with Harry as consistently as Ron and Hermione. This was not some unique act of loyalty.
7.  Yes, he joins that hunt but he also abandons them and suffers the worst from the Horcrux. Unlike Hermione who stays by Harry's side throughout (even offering to go with Harry to the Dark Forest so he won't have to go to his death alone).
8.  Except in both cases Hermione stays by his side. That is the problem when given the same out she refuses to move from his side Ron has no problem abandoning Harry in these cases.
9.  Ah yes the 3rd year and 6th year and Hermione's problems. First, she was right that he did not kill Scabbers.
10. Crookshanks is part-kneazle and thus is very intelligent and can detect the trustworthiness of others.
11. Flat out wrong she cares about Harry being safe and alive so much that she willingly risks her friendship with him (likely her first friend ever) to do so. That is very loyal to Harry Hermione could have handled this issue better (tell Harry her suspicions first) but if Ron should get a pass for being 14 Hermione should get the same.
12. You clearly missed why Hermione is upset (so did Ron make of that what you will). Hermione is upset because she works for her results, for example, putting in the extra time in the library doing extra research to better understand the concepts she is learning and practicing the magic they are going to be attempting in class before the lesson. Hermione also clearly benefits from these actions with that ridiculous grade on her first year charms final. in HBP Harry gets better results without putting in the work to understand why that worked which goes against Hermione's core values: doing the work yourself and that hard work paying off. She warns him that using the knowledge of that book without understanding the how it works will hurt him and she is right (sectumsempra scene).

Why is this forgotten (or forgiven?) because she is always right Scabbers was not dead, Sirius did send the firebolt and the potion book was dangerous if not used properly. You don't have to like it but canon always justifies when Hermione betrays Harry's trust but not when Ron. And that is why Hermione gets a pass in fanfiction but Ron does not.
