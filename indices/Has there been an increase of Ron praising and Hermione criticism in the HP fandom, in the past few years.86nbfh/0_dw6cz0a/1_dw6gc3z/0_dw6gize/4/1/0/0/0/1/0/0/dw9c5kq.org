That 'rude and annoying thing' was prove she could do something Ron couldn't. She snapped and told him how to do something correctly, he snarled back to prove she was right. She did. And Ron got his precious self-esteem hurt. Which led to him loudly stating in a crowd hallway directly after class that he /understands why nobody likes her/. That's about as shitty a thing to say about someone as you can, especially at 11/12. That Ron was too stupid to realize Hermione couldn't have been more than a few yards away is somehow his saving grace? Oh, and here's the kicker: if Hermione doesn't correct him, he very likely doesn't get the spell right when he levitates the club later that very day.

But honestly, you then take an entire paragraph to lecture me like a child on the very /concept/ of talking. But of course, only in my /perception/ are you being condescending. And since you graced your time to me in response, you deserve my respect no matter what you wrote. Of course you hold nothing against me, you're so up your own ass you think my irritation is completely unfounded. I have no plan to continue any sort of conversation with you, but the good news is you'll come out of this feeling great about yourself, and that's all that matters.
