Everyone around them was having trouble with that particular spell, but no, leave it to Hermione to snap at Ron for not getting it right yet, just because she has an easier time of getting things right. It's not like she couldn't have been nicer about it, despite what you're pretending. Also, Ron's comment was clearly talking about what happened in the Charms class /and/ the other instances of Hermione's attitude scattered all across the prior two months. And he was correct: you don't get friends by being condescending and rude.

Ron has every right to vent to his friend about someone being rude to them. The reason why you don't want to accept that Hermione was being rude is because it gets in the way of your narrative of "poor little Hermione being bullied by evil Ron". But don't let me spoil that.

  her 'bad attitude' likely is the only reason Ron could properly cast that spell later that day

What a ridiculous statement.
