I'm just sick and tired of all this bile directed towards Ron, especially this constant harping on about how he isn't a good friend -- when Harry was by far the poorer friend of the two.

Harry's relationship with both Ron and Hermione are definitely NOT one of equals -- both of them are far better friends to him that he is to them. Over the course of the books, you always see Ron and Hermione they go out of their way to be there for Harry, support him, cancel their plans for him, make sure he's included in everything. Harry, however, is far less willing to do the same for them, unless doing so benefits him in some way. In their friendship, Harry tends to take and take, while Ron and Hermione give and give.

Now, there is a reason for this. Often, Harry just needs more support than Ron and Hermione do because his problems are objectively bigger. And it would be wrong to say that Harry never sticks up for other people, or that he wouldn't gladly risk his life for Ron or Hermione if he needed to. If there's an emergency, he's all set to rush to their aid.

But you see time and time again that he tends to ignore their problems, worries and concerns, and focus exclusively on himself and what HE gets out of it. This is most notable in his relationship with Hermione -- most of the time Harry literally could not care less about what she does whenever she isn't there helping him -- but Ron gets a fair bit of it too.

I'm fairly sure that the main reason why Harry isn't a more hated character is because he's the main character. We get to see his reasons for everything and the story is told from his point of view. But being Harry Potter's friend has to be extremely trying, and you see both Ron and Hermione get tired of it at times. The difference is that Hermione will immediately let Harry know when she thinks he's being unreasonable -- which Harry will generally ignore because he doesn't respond well to nagging -- but Ron tends to bottle up until it gets out of hand, which happens twice in the series. And because it does get out of hand, people tend to remember that more, and -- like Harry -- forget how Ron is USUALLY Harry's biggest supporter.
