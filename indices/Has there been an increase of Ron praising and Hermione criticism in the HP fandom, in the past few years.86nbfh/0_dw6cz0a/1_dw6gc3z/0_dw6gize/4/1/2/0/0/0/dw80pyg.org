I never said Harry didn't also act like a twat sometimes, but this post isn't about Harry. Also, Harry being a twat doesn't excuse Ron being a twat.

Harry was also abused his whole life and no one ever got him help, of course he don't know the "right" way to react much of the time. Ron had a loving and supportive family and still couldn't find it within himself to be a good friend when it really counted.
