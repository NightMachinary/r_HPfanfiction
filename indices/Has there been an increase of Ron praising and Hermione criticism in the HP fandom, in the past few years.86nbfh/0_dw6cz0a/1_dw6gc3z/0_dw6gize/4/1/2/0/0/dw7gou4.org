Funny... when GoF was published, I was ten and I thought /Harry/ was being a massive self-centered jerk throughout much of the book. Not saying Ron handled the argument well, but Harry was worse.

I mean, that scene where Ron gets worried about Harry and goes to check on him, and Harry gets so angry when his conversation with Sirius is interrupted that he decides he hated Ron, throws a badge at his head, screams at him, and storms off.

And Ron doesn't even retaliate. He just stands there, totally broken.

That was when I started seriously disliking Harry. A feeling that just got stronger in OOTP, where Harry goes into hyper-angst-mode, spends an awful lot of time screaming at everybody and demands special treatment from everyone, and even when people try to sit him down carefully and explain why something is a bad idea, Harry just explodes in anger and goes and does it anyway, cause he's HARRY POTTER!

When I got older, I ended up having more sympathy for Harry again, even though I still think he's by far the least interesting character in the franchise. I get that he's going through a lot, and most of his douchiest behaviour is born out of frustration with a difficult situation... but I still find it a little irksome that nobody ever call him out on how totally self-centered he is.
