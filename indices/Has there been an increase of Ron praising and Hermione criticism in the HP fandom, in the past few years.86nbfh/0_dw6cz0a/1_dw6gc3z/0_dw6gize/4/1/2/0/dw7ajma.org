When GoF was published, /I/ was 14 and I still thought Ron was a piece of shit for ditching Harry like that. That's not how friends act, and as Harry's /best friend/ Ron of all people should have known better in GoF than to think Harry entered himself.

So the "he was 14!!!11!" argument has never held much water with me. If I, as a fellow 14 year old, was disgusted by his behavior, I don't think it can be excused by his age.
