One bout of jealousy that lasted months and only came back with a halfhearted apology. Besides giving him a reason behind his disloyalty /does not/ excuse it. And the horcrux effected all of them equally. If you want to argue 'it effected Ron most' it was because he was the weakest and most disloyal one of the bunch. Ron also doesn't stay loyal to Hermione after agreeing to go on a date, instead blowing her off for Lavender at the slightest hint of Ron feeling inferior to someone. And again, you have the perfect counter example to laugh at all of the excuses Ron gets in his disloyalty in Hermione, who stands by him stoutly each time Ron doesn't.

It's a constant theme throughout the entire series. Ron is as loyal as they come until something threatens his terrible sense of self-worth. Then it's 'Ron first, fuck everyone else'.
