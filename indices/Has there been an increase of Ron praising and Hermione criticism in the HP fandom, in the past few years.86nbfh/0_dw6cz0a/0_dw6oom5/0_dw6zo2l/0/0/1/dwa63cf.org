I agree, but at least it was done subtly - unlike these days (Rey-Sue and her dumb male counterparts (who can't even follow orders - not that those orders were any good, but as a soldier you follow any order that is not illegal!) anybody?)

I like the IDEA OF HERMIONE, but not Hermione herself! I love it if she's reworked in fanfiction (a sense of boundaries (no constantly heckling Harry about secrets, about homework etc.), less arrogance ("I am the best witch of my age!") and maybe even her not succeeding at everything!) :)
