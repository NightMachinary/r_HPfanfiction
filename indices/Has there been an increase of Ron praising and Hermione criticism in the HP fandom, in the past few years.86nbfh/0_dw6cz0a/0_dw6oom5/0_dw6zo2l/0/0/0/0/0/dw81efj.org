The hogsmead village scene in POA after the revelation about Sirius betrayal when Hermione pulls the cloak off Harry and comforts him is so much more heartfelt and compelling then when she bizarrely turns to Ron (instead of Harry who they had established a prior emotional bond in that exact film) for comfort after Buckbeak is executed. So I just disagree with that assertion Emma Watson is the best of the main 3 actors at acting.
