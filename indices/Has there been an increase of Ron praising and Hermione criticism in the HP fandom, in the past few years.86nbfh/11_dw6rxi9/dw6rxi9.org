I honestly struggle to think of what to praise about Ron other than him being the funny one. His utility to the plot completely ended after Philosopher's Stone since Hermione quickly knew almost everything he did and more and was a magic whiz kid who solved nearly every problem that faced the trio.

Like I /want/ to like Ron, but his canon portrayal (in the books too) didn't endear him to me. The idea that it was mostly the movies is a fantasy. Abandoning your friends twice (first from random mistrust and the second from jealousy and anger, not just the Horcrux (a burden the other 2 shared)) is just a bad look.

I'm writing a fanfic currently and my disinterest in Ron made me outline things such that Ron probably will be unimportant and replaced by Neville and Draco. :/
