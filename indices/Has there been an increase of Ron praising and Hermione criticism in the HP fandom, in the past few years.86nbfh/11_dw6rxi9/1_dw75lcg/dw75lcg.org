It's super easy to look at the books and call Ron misloyal. But if I could shove some fucking perspective into opinion:

If I had a friend who stuck by my side while being hunted by the literal embodiment of evil, targeted by the wizarding world be it via the press or the entire fucking government, while I soaked up all the attention and put him in my shadow, albeit not by intention, and only fucks off /twice/ over /7 years/ starting from when we're literally /pre-teens/, I'd consider that the most loyal friend in the entire goddamn world.

To top off this shit sandwich, you're going to replace Ron and one of the choices is /Draco fucking Malfoy/ looooooooool
