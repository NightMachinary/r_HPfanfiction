That might be true, except that then we have Hermione who did the same thing and stayed by his side without fucking off twice.

I may personally dislike Ron, but saying that he's more loyal than or as loyal as Hermione (as some comments claim) isn't really the true.

Sure, a friend that in those circumstances falters only twice is still a good friend, but you can't claim him to be more loyal than a friend who didn't falter.
