He didn't stick by his side. He already dicked around in year 4 because "Wah my friend got entered into a lethal competition against his will". To top it off, that jealously streak was (while minor compared to what happened in DH) pervasive throughout a bunch of the portions of other books too. "Why am I poor while you have all this money" (from your dead family).

And that the second time it happens to put your friends lives in danger while the other friend stuck by without fail for the previous years? Yeah that's disloyalty and combined with the other shifty things from 3rd and 6th year where he was constantly disloyal to Hermione too makes it look like a character flaw, not a few times where, woops, I goofed.

And not that I owe you an explanation, but the Malfoys don't have the same history or quite the same disposition as in canon.
