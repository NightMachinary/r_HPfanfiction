I absolutely 100% agree with this! Honestly, people act like Ron's entire job as a friend is to be whatever Harry needs, all of the time. Ron faced his greatest fear, walking TOWARDS it, at age 12 for his friend Harry. He, with a broken leg, tells Sirius Black, who he believe to be a deranged mass murderer and Dark wizard, he'd have to kill him to get to Harry. Yea, he fucks up in 4th year, but honestly, once in four YEARS is huge. He was willing to sacrifice himself for Harry, not once, not twice, but every year (chess game in first year), so I think a bit of an argument is honestly nothing. He ALWAYS comes through when it counts. That is a ridiculously amazing friend! People marry other people who will do less for them--Ron is more devoted to Harry and his cause, than most spouses are to one another. 2 fights in 7 years is literal gold when it comes to friendships and relationships of any kind.
