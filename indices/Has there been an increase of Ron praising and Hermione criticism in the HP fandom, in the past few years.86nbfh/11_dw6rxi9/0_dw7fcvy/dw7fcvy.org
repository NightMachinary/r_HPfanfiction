Well, firstly, if you're thinking of friends by reference to their utility then you have fundamentally misunderstood friendship (and by extension, one of the most prominent themes of the HP series).

But secondly, the fact that Ron *only* put his own interests above Harry's twice in the space of 7 years is, frankly, superhuman. Very few friends in real life would willingly follow each other into one life-threatening situation, never mind do it again and again.

Seriously, the real life equivalent of DH would be one of your friends, tomorrow, suggesting you travel to Syria in an attempt to track down and kill Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The fact that Ron said "yes" to that without a moment's hesitation speaks to his loyalty. I know for sure I'd laugh in the face of any friend who suggested such a course of action. That Ron later abandoned such an insane mission is looking at it in the wrong way. Going in the first place was an act of friendship far above and beyond normal friendship. Abandoning the mission after several months makes him merely a great friend, rather than literally Jesus.

The standard of friendship you're proposing Ron be judged against is just not reasonable by any degree. You're saying that to be a good friend, you have to be willing to sacrifice all of your interests, up to and including your life, to your friend's interests, and that any lapse in this sacrifice renders one unforgivably disloyal. To me that sounds less like friendship and more like slavery.
