  Aurors are not soldiers

Hm, I wonder if I had already mentioned that? ...

  "The wizarding world doesn't seem to have formal soldiers,"

Anyway, that's entirely irrelevant to my point. The reason I brought up soldiers and Aurors is that no one would praise them for being otherwise decent people if they abandoned their comrades in life threatening adventures. In other words, you can be a decent or even good friend and yet still be called shitty for running out on your friends or being dickish in other scenarios.
