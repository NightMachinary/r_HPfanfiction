  Well, firstly, if you're thinking of friends by reference to their utility

No, I was talking about Ron's usefulness as a character. This is a meta issue involving Ron's purpose as a character, I obviously am not Ron's friend nor did I refer to others characters needing to treat Ron simppy as a tool, so this doesn't make any sense.

  lapse in this sacrifice renders one unforgivably disloyal. To me that sounds less like friendship and more like slavery.

Not what I said. It had more to do with the fact that it occurred (particularly in DH) in a way that put his friends lives in danger. No one thinks that soldiers in the military are Jesus for repeatedly putting themselves into life threatening situations. They are admired, yes, but those who abandon their comrades in arms in such situations are rightly viewed very negatively. No one goes "Ah well, you know they were great in all these other situations".
