The thing i hate about fanon!Hermione is that even when she is "bashed" there are never any consequences for her actions. It's always the fault of someone else. e.g. take a standard indyHarry fic with betrayals from Ron and Hermione; more often than not in my experience, Hermione is under the effects of love potions etc. Its never because Hermione made a decision of her own volition.

For once i'd like to read a fic like the one specified above but without bashing necessarily and without love potions.

Rant over and that being said, i enjoy canon!Hermione because she isnt reduced to something less than she is.
