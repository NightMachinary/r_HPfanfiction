Well, Hermione was just more interesting than Ron in the books. Ron's usefulness to the story basically ended after Philosopher's Stone. Hermione quickly ended up knowing more about the wizarding world than him, and he was never once able to carve out a niche where he mattered or really contributed to developing the narrative. It was a shame, honestly. Hermione's was a know-it-all, sure, but she was a stranger in a new world, brilliant and tended to solve the problems and mysteries vexing Harry. That's just a more fun character for me, anyway.
