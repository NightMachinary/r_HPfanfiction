One of the things that makes me really uncomfortable with Hermione in fandom is that I've read only one fic where someone calls her out on attacking Ron with the birds in HBP. Even highly rated pro-Ron or R/H fics that cover sixth year pretty much universally just let it go. Maybe she internally resolves not to do it again, but that's it. Neither Harry nor Ginny ever give her the colossal ass-chewing she so sorely needs. And again, I've seen McGonagall take it seriously /once/.

In the book, they claw at all his exposed flesh and leave him covered in wounds. What if he didn't get his hands up in front of his face fast enough, and he lost an eye? That's not an unheard of outcome for a serious bird attack. This is a serious crime. Like, expulsion, breaking of her wand, and a jail sentence kind of serious. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (with a weapon enhancement) or assault with a deadly weapon are not trivial offenses.

And for what? She's jealous that someone she hasn't even expressed interest in is dating someone else. That's pretty nuts. Even if she caught him cheating, a violent weapon attack is unacceptable, but Ron doesn't even know she's interested, let alone owes her fidelity. Like, if I had a crush on a friend and I saw her kissing someone else, and my response was to slash open her arms a lot with my pocketknife or set my dogs on her, I'd be a violent abuser who needs to go away and get some serious therapy before being in public again. And it would be surprising and kinda messed up if her sibling and best friend didn't cut me out.

And I'm someone who /likes/ Hermione. But her vindictive streak is a flaw that even authors that think they're not erasing her flaws still erase or excuse.
