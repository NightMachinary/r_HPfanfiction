Well, Marietta got what she deserved I mean the whole DA could have been EXPELLED for merely studying what they should be studying for OWLs anyway! It was also not an unprovoked attack or anything! I mean I sadly don't remember it well, but didn't people know that the DA-Parchment was cursed? If so she was tempting fate!

ps: The curse might have been a little too harsh, but over all? She really did deserve it!

pps: On second thought: Missing a year of defense-education (shoddy as it already was - Lockhart and Quirrel, enough said IMHO!) might have killed some people (because they couldn't have fought back!) so no, she got off lightly!
