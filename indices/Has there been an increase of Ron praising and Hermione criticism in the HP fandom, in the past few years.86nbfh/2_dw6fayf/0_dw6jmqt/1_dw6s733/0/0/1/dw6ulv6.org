Look, we had that argument at least three times. Yes, she needed saving at age 12, Harry did not save her from the Basilisk, he was at the Quidditch pitch when she was attacked while doing research for Harry. The knowledge she found was instrumental for defeating the Basilisk. During the third year she was only in danger for tagging along her friends, not through her own fault. Same in the fifth year and during the hunt, where she was the mastermind behind Harry. She even chose him over her supposed love.
