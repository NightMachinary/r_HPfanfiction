  How? She didn't take ONE responsible action during the hunt

Oh nonsense. She learned the protective enchantments, selected safe locations to Apparate to, charmed the food so that they had enough to eat (though it was hard) - and according to Ron it had to be her that did it because she was the best of the 3 at magic - she saved Harry at Godric's Hollow (you praised Harry for doing this for some reason, given it was a trap and ended with his wand broken while she saved his life), etc. Come on man, Hermione has faults but she's the only reason they survived longer than a week.
