Dumbledore gave the suggestion to use the Time Turner. She listened because it was a good idea, not because she was slavishly followed Dumbledore. And Sirius was nowhere near as good a friend. Hermione was there through everything, even when it seemingly required her to choose between staying with Harry and leaving with her apparent love. Sirius was simply never there for Harry to avoid, and given he was an adult, there was really no situation where avoiding him made sense (and even then, Harry avoided Hermione during part of 1 book, lol).

How would she sneak a message passed experienced wizard's who are well versed in hiding secrets? It's not like she stopped talking to Harry, she just couldn't put what the Order was doing in a letter for obvious security reasons. You'll note that both Sirius and Ron did the same thing.

Oh come on, she obviously solved it. I don't want to be rude but that theory is inherently wacky.
