That is a misrepresentation. I was talking about prolonged ignoring of Hermione. Otherwise, as you amply proved, the examples become absolutely trivial. /Everyone/ ignores their friends in brief spurts such as when they are annoyed with them or are worried about something they deem more important than day-to-day things like grades. There is a distinct difference between blowing off her suggestion to do Occlummency for Quidditch and avoiding her for months because of the Firebolt nonsense.
