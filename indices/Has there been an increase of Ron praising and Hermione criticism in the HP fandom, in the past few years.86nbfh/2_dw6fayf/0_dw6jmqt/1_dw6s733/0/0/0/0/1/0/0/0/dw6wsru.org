You're right he didn't do it in 7. But he did it in the third one over the Firebolt as you said, he did it again in the 4th when she tried to convince him to speak to Ron again. She did it the 5th when she tried to convince him to speak to Dumbledore about Umbridges torture method. And he did it in the sixth over the book.

Finally he did it each time she tried to make him open up even though he didn't want it or each time she fought with Ron.
