You're right about the hunt, she did have a bigger role than what I remembered. But I disagree about the Dementors. It was Dumbledore who asked Hermione to do it and she would obey Dumbledore no matter what. She was there more often than Sirius but it doesn't mean that she was a better friend than Sirius. Harry tried to avoid or ignore Hermione much more than Sirius.

Dumbledore forbade it but it doesn't mean that she should have listened to him. She could have at least tried some hidden message.

PS: I do have a theory that say that Hermione is not the one who solved the Basilisk issue but I don't think that's the place.
