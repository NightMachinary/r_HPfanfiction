You are misrepresenting things. Her knowledge alone solved the Basilisk issue which for some reason even Dumbledore hadn't puzzled out, her use of the Time Turner allowed Harry to stop the Dementors, it was almost entirely her work with Harry that let him survive the tournament (she picked out the spell selection and helped Harry and Ron train & learn the spells). And you cannot somehow blame the troll incident on her, she was the victim...

She was there more than Sirius (both before and after he entered the story). None of the Weasleys (save for Ron, who was still there less than Hermione) were there for Harry nearly as often, especially the twins. At least for Arthur and Molly you could say they gave him housing during parts of the summers.

And she didn't abandoned Harry at Dumbledore's request. Dumbledore forbade it, something everyone listened to. I agree it was pretty stupid given the events of 4th year but then everyone becomes equally to blame for that, meaning Hermione can't be singled out (you'll note she also tried to contact him when Dumbledore stopped them).

But realy, the troll incident was her fault???
