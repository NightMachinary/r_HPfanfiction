  She is the one person who kept Harry alive

Oh yeah you're right. I really loved who she shaved him from the troll. Oh wait that was Harry! But she still saved him from the basilisk. Oh wait! That's still Harry! Mmmmh... the dementors? Harry. Goblet of Fire. She taught him the summoning spell only after Moody hinted it. But still... I could keep on but it would be better to read the books again.

  and the one who stood with him more than anyone else.

What about Sirius? Fred and George? Molly? Arthur? Ginny? They all never left his side. Actually, Hermione did it twice. Once during the summer before 5th year, when Dumbledore didn't want her to contact Harry. And the second time during the sixth year when she was jealous of Harry because of the book.

  but she was loyal to Harry to a fault.

She is loyal to Harry as long as Dumbledore doesn't ask her to abandon him.
