I would argue that the stories with a godlike Hermione are as bad as the ones with a moronic Ron. Hermione is not supposed to be the sexy sex goddess of sexyness and having that in every story os just as bad as Death Eater Ron. I'm not a fan of Ron in any of his iterations (books, movies or fanon) and I don't think that he is the friend Harry needs, but that doesn't mean that he needs to bashed to hell and back. Give him a girlfriend with huge tits, a few friendly interactions with Harry and Hermione, and he'll be a happy camper for the entire story.
