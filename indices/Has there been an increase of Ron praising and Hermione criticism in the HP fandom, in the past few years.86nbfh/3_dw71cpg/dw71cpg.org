Is it, like, double-reverse backlash? Triple? I may have lost count.

Fans weren't happy that it wound up being Ron/Hermione. So they wrote Harry/Hermione and turned Ron into a POS to get rid of him. The movies helped by giving Ron's best material to Hermione, turning him into a kind of hanger-on who's not strictly necessary.

The backlash.

Okay, but then they turned Hermione into, like, the queen of all magic or something so writers began making her into a Dumbledore drone who will betray Harry for books at the drop of a hat.

Reverse backlash.

So now Harry needs another 2nd. They can build up Neville or turn to the Blank Slates (Susan Bones, Daphne Greengrass, etc. mostly) or they can bring Ron back.

Double-reverse backlash.

Mix all of this together and you have Harry, Flawed Hermione (who acknowledges her shortcomings and works to overcome them), and Resurgent Ron with one or two ancillary characters tacked on for completeness (Pureblood Nonsense is passed through families so Hermione's out; Weasleys haven't been down with the Nonsense in generations so Ron's out; Neville or the Blank Slates fill in the details that the others can't.)
