I don't think so, both are praised despite the fact that neither (IMHO!) has much (if any!) character development...if anything they don't get criticised enough, especially Hermione (I mean she doesn't know boundaries and can't accept it if somebody doesn't want to spill all their secrets to her, damned girl leave well enough alone!) the "smartest witch of her age" (yeah right, we don't even know how she stacks up against the Raveclaws or the Slytherins in their year!) who gets to boss Harry around in basically every fanfiction where she plays an important role...same for Ron who's contributions (or lack of contributions!) gets blown out of proportion ("Best friend" - yeah, sorry IMHO that's Hermione, as much as I dislike her sometimes!)

Hermione is basically a plot-device (because Rowling made Harry a dumb idiot who isn't curious in the slightest IMHO...damned, how you can treat magic just like "meh" and not try to study hard? I mean you don't have to be interested in everything, but not displaying any sense of wounder any sense of "I want to learn this" (except when your life is in danger!)?) and Ron is a plot-hindrance often enough IMHO (I mean he was willing to more or less get Harry killed because of jealousy! Gods damned mate, get a grip and pull your head out of your ass!)...then again a lot is emotionally stunted and isolationist (come on: He has two friends and a few acquaintances and isn't even all that interested in girls...Cho doesn't count IMHO) Harry's fault! Someone with more friends would have probably told either to sod off at various points (Hermione after snitching about the Firebolt and Ron after his jealousy in GoF)...
