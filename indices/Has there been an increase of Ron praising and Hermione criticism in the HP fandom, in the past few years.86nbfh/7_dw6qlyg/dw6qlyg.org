You also get better at weeding out the chaff as you read more, so if you've been reading fanfics for a few years, you can probably tell from the description/blurb (and tags, if on ao3) what the absolute swill is and ignore that. A LOT of that garbage has Ron bashing, so it seems like you encounter less of that. If you sort by Faves/Kudos, you generally don't seen any ron bashing in the first few pages of a search or tag search, so again, it looks like there's less of it. And if you like good quality writing, it is usually from authors who have read the books pretty well/deeply, and Ron was a pretty good guy in those--with a few fuck ups, but everyone has those. As you read more fanfiction, you probably got better at searching for well-written fics by good authors, and so you got good at not finding the ron bashing crap. :)
