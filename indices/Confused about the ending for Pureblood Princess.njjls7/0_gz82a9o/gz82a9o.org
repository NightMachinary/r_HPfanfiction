First of all, there are several Harry Potter fics called "Pureblood Princess". I'm pretty sure this fic is the most popular linkffn(6943436), but I'd like a confirmation.

Now, if you are talking about this fic, here's what happen :

At the end of chapter 18, Daphne had somehow managed to heal the injuries on Harry thanks to the Theories developped by her mother. But this feat somehow made her lose her Magic. She also lost all her memories of the Magical World but I personally think that was due to a Memory Charm.

Anyways, some years after the story, Daphne is living in the Muggle World with no knowledge of the Magical World (even her family keep it secret from her during their rare interaction). One day, she meets a guy named Harry that seem a bit strange, but really wants to seduce her.

The whole epilogue is basically Harry rebuilding a relation with her (to acquaintance to lover, and then husband), said from Daphne point of view. The only thing that really matter is that Daphne mother's died (probably killed because her theories saved Harry's life), her sister Astoria is fianced to Theodore Nott (which she dislikes), and that Harry also kept the Magical World a secret (she doesn't really know what he does for a living, but he showed her that he was loaded).

Years later, Daphne is a researcher married to Harry. They live in 4 Square Grimmault, and they have a little girl. Right after the 10th anniversary from their daughter, Harry finally tells her the truth and gives her the private diary she had kept while at Hogwarts, so she could at least understand what happened to her. He probably told her because their daughter is now 10 (or 11?), and her Hogwarts letter is soon due.

Epilogue 05 is what happened between Chapter 18 and the 1st epilogue, said from Harry point of view. How he won the war, and what he did before (re) meeting Daphne.
