Daphne's mom is killed by Death Eaters who wanted her to use the necromantic research to bring back Lord Voldemort. She refused.

Daphne, after losing her magic and her mother was incredibly depressed. Her father, also depressed at seeing his daughter suffering and losing his wife, agreed to erase her memories of the magical world as a coping mechanism. They create a diary that stores them that he holds for her.

Claire has a late summer birthday and is a witch. Harry tells Daphne the truth as he knows he wont be able to keep it a secret for much longer as Claire will be getting her Hogwarts letter soon.

The story ends where it does because anything after isn't going to be pleasant. Best case, divorce, worse case, suicide.

Unless the poster is talking about the last epilogue in which case it's a tale of a group of adventurers returning to one of their party's home town where the stumble into a misadventure while investigating the disappearances of some local mages.

Two of the party, Volke and Caelya, are working through a blooming relationship while knowing their decisions are likely going to estrange them from the group and struggling with leaving their friends and their adventuring life behind.

All while Torman is struggling with his jealousy of the relationship that developed between Voke and Caelya, assuming that the thief's introduction to their group is what prevented the cleric from loving him. He's looking for any way to get the thief out of the way, whether it's leading the group in circles through the desert hoping they die of thirst, or attacking when his back is turned.

All while Ragthuk is, well, compensating for something.
