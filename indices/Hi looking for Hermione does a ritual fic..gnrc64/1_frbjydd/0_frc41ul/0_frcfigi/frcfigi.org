Yeah, after skimming over some pages, I'm convinced that it's A Champion's New Hope, as someone else said before. Hermione basically becomes the "Gate Keeper", and has to serve as such for a thousand years in exchange for the assistance of the purple woman. The hand healing scene takes place in chapter 46.
