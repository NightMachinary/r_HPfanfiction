There is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20182612][Just Like Him]] where he saves Harry from the Dursley's when he's a child (he wanted to kill him but then, well, he could relate with the child. And he quite quickly understood that he was a horcrux). So, anyway, it's a nice Harry raised by someone else. They get adopted by the Blacks, get Sirius out of Azkaban, and basically try to get the Horcruxes to revive the Dark Lord. And Harry is shaping into a real equal for Voldemort, so, there is that. The only « problem » will probably be the ship (even if, for now, it's totally tame since Harry is a kid anyway). But, mostly, the platonic relationships Barty & Sirius and Barty & Harry are everything. (Plus, Barty is just so tragic, really).

So, anyway, I just love Barty character so much, it's really interesting to read.
