There's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/427653/chapters/719529][The Well Groomed Mind]] which is a... gen, slightly indy Harry? With a very negative portrayal of Dumbledore and a lot of alternative character interpretations. Also it's in first person, for whatever reason. But I kinda like it. Has my absolute favourite version of Barty, even if he isn't quite himself most of the time (since this takes place during GoF). linkao3(427653)
