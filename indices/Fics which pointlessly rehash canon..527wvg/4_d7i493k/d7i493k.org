What is nothing? If it's copied text only, then it literally adds nothing, but there are no fanfictions like that. Do you mean plot-wise? Personally, I don't like to read AU's about Harry and the Dursleys that tell the canon story, but with an addition of an OC or something. Strictly seen it adds something to the plot, but that doesn't make it good, in my opinion. However, they have a lot more reviews than mine. My story follows the plot from canon, and contains some repeated elements.
