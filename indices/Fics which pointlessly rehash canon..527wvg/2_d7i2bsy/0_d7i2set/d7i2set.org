I actually like both of these fics. Like you said, TRaTC was a summer story and I think it does HP/NT pretty well. And BBE is my favorite HP/OC story, while it does rehash the main points in canon, it adds so much to the story and, IMO, has the best OC of any fic. If you're reading BBE it's not for a totally new HP plot, it's because you wanted an in-depth HP/OC relationship and that fics gives it to you.
