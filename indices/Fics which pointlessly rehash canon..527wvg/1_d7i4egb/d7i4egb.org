This is probably too innovative for what you're looking for, but I've been reading linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]]) and I'm surprised at the amount of rehashing it contains. To the point where I'm skipping ahead pages at a time because some chapters contain almost identically what happened in canon.
