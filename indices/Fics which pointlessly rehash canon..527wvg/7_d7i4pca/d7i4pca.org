Ah, crap, I can't remember the name. I think it's something like.. A second Chance? Or A New Opportunity? Something like that?

Basically, the Dursleys are good people. They treat Harry like a son. And everything else plays almost exactly the same. Word for word. The diference is that every now and then we see How worried the Dursleys are about their Harry. Oh, and Krum falls in love with Parvati for whatever fucking reason. And Fifth year gets eliminated and the events of sixth start taking place there. I have no idea what happens after because I gave up on it there.

Sad thing, the idea had potential. I'd love to see what would happen if the Dursleys were to accept Harry. But these people weren't the Dursleys in any way.
