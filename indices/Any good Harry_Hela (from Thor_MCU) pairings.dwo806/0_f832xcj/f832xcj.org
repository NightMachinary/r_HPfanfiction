Late, but seeing as there are no replies, I'll at least drop this one here:

Sorry that it isn't really Harry/Hela, it is Harry/multi, but imo really well done. The plot and worldbuilding is always the main focus, smut takes a very balanced backseat. I just reread the now 1.8m words for the third time and really enjoyed it again. But Hela comes into the story late, and joins the relationship even later. As I said, maybe not what you want (Harry/Hela) but definitely one of the best MCU crossovers I have ever read.
