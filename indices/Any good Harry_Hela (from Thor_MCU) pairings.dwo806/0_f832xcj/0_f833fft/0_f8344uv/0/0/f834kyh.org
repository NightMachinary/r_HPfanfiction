Ah yes, thats exactly the reason why I myself just had my 3rd re-read of it :D It had been like a year since I read it and there have been like 600k words added in the time. So for that author, around 8 chapters... Just to mention it, if you also like other crossovers, his "Magic Of The Force" and "FILFY Teacher" are great too. Despite the name of the second one...
