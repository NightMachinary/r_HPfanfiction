I would let Hermione get killed by the troll. Or if she survives, she'll be hounding Harry and Ron about their rulebreaking related to the Stone, the Chamber and Sirius, and tell Harry off for putting his name in the Goblet, and she'll inadvertently be making it easier for Voldemort to return to power and keep Harry from beating him.

She'll even come along to the Ministry in 5th year, but she'll meet Voldemort, who'll compel her to join his ranks by promising her a new and better future and a position where she can make a change for what she believes in, and where peope will respect her.

It'll end up with Bellatrix killing her for thinking Hermione took her place as Voldemort's "first lady" while Voldemort just watches. The world will think of her as a Death Eater.
