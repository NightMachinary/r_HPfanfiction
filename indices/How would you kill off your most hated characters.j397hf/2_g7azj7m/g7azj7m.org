Well, I've had Dumbledore step out in front of a bus while demonstrating to a colleague how well he understands the Muggle world... They were in Canada and Dumble's looked the wrong way.

I've killed Voldemort by having him summon Harry's glasses, causing Velma from Scooby Doo level blindness for everyone's favorite boy wizard. Unable to see, Harry summons the entire frontage of a Diagon Alley store down on the Death Eaters, trapping Voldemort, then stumbling forward, Harry tripped over Lucius Malfoy and crushed Tom's throat with his knee.

I've also had Tom get Fricasseed in the graveyard because Harry made friends with the Horntale from the Triwizard (and her hatchlings).

Honestly, the most fun with Tom isn't killing him, it's making him live and suffer, like when I once had his Horcruxi combined into a sentient animated Teddy Bear and handed down through multiple generations of Harry's descendants while he lives in fear of the Washing Machine.

I don't think I've ever actually killed Umbridge... Though I've been playing with one where after her adventures with the Centaurs, she builds a cottage in the Forbidden Forest and coerces Bane to live with her as she's become a bit of a size queen. A miserable Bane begs Harry to save him from the horrible woman.

Snape is too much fun to fuck with to ever bother killing. In one story I made him 'lucky' to the point where his skills in potions no longer mattered, no matter what he did his potions turned out perfect... So he was miserable. In another, I suggested that the reason for Snape's general assholy-ness was due to a bad case of virginity, and that once solved old Severus became a Mister Rogers clone.
