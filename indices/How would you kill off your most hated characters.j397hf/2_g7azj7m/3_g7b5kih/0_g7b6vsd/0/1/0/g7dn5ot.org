I never said That these things excused Snape for what he did to the students. I specifically mentioned in that comment that it didn't. It is just an analysis of his childhood and why he grew up to be like that. But OK, you have your views, this is how I understood him. Please just stop calling people retarded b'coz they have their own different view for something.
