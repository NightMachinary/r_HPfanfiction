Not at all, Snape is a class A cunt. And I don't mean that in a good way. Lots of people have crappy childhoods, that doesn't make you, or Snape, special. Yet, somehow, those people with crappy childhoods don't set out to torture the children of their bullies.

Weird that.

Dumble's plan, which by the way, didn't work, with Harry winning completely by accident in no way associated with any plans made by Dumbledore, rested entirely upon Tom using the killing curse to kill Harry. What if, like all of this other plans, a different decision had been made? What if instead of the AK, Tom decided that beheading Harry with a cutting curse would impress his followers more?
