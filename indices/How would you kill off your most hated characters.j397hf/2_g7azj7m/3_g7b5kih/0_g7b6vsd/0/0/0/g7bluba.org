Bro... If Dumbledore had not done that than for the life of one Child I don't know how many other children would have perished. I never said that I like what Dumbledore did to Harry, to have spend a childhood still makes me sorry. But would Harry have not done it if he had know that he could save the lives of millions. I still feel mad that Harry never got a choice, even if we all knew what he would choose. I guess I could have worded it a better. I know that it is always a chance that Dumbledore is actually as you say, but he might not be. Harry isn't as powerful in Canon as in fanon so that needs to be kept in mind. That is something people keep forgetting.

And thank you very much but I have encountered enough children in my family and you would be happy to know that they are all fit and healthy.

So do you agree with the part about Snape?
