So you did rather that Dumbledore try to keep Harry alive while Voldemort wipes out the muggle and Magical world, an unstoppable force who can't be killed due to the Hocruxes and Prophecy? Seems a big price to pay, even for Harry.

As for Snape - His childhood was bad. Worse than Harry. You see, Harry at least knew that his parents loved him. Snape had a father who was a drunk bastard who used to outright beat him. Snape's mother loved him, but lived in the fear of his father. Although his treatment to the students is still NOT acceptable, it isn't completely his problem is it? Never having a good childhood, he of course despises those who had, and is jealous of them in a way. And the trio wasn't in clear themselves. They sneaked in Slytherin common room and Snape's private stock and stole items without paying for them. And Slytherins would have made their life a hell at Hogwarts if they ever found out. So the way I see it, Snape did them favours as well. They just didn't count them.

Lily. When he had met her, he had found someone who cared for him, like his mother, and was able to show it freely, unlike his mother. He discovered what it felt like to truly care and perhaps properly loved for the first time.

When he reached Hogwarts, he had so many plans. He had studies so much. He wanted to be great, to be known, knowledgeable and famous like Dumbledore. And in come James and Sirius. Rich, good looking attention seeking prats. They disliked him. Treated him badly because he was in Slytherin, a house that hated him because of his Half blood Status. Because he didn't look as good as them. Because he had Lily, whom James had a crush on. Can you imagine 7 years of tormenting, without nearly 0 friends and nobody to talk to?!! Lily left him 5th year for James, who was still a prat although improved. But he still treated Snape the same. And Snape loved Lily forever. Can you the bloddy hell imagine?!! He can't talk to his mother, not wishing to further make her life miserable. And his ideal, Dumbledore, had just brushed past the fact that Sirius had tried to kill him!!! And getting saved by the boy who tried to make his life as miserable as possible!!! Do you even the fcking realise that Snape was alone for 17 years most of his life. I think even the other Slytherins only warmed upto him because he was a better wizard, and that too only to use him. With all this in his adolescence years?? I can't believe he never tried to suicide. But perhaps nobody would have cared even then.

Then Voldemort tries to kill lily. He never intended to get Harry and James killed. He just wanted Lily alive. It was Dumbledore who had twisted his words to make it mean like That ( Dumbledore wanted to save him from the dark side). Only to see the child of Lily and James grow up, and put himself in danger (not intentionally Though!!). And finally die looking into the eyes of Lily, in James' face, reminding his failures.

Hope you understand. It is not always that if something looks bad from the main character's view, it is necessary bad.

Please try to understand, as Dumbledore would say, the bigger picture. And stop being immature. I am like 15 years old and understand what I talked about (unfortunately). "Please try tk understand it.

PS--sorry for swearing, I get a little involved into it when I write.

Thanks for reading.
