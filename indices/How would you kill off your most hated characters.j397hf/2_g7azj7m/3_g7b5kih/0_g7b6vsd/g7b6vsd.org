Dumbledore set Harry up to die in the untested hope that he might survive a killing curse a second time. I guess Harry was just lucky that Tom didn't use a different spell.

Snape was a bitch. He went out of his way to pick on Harry because he resembled James Potter, and Neville for no reason at all. What he went through, cry me a fucking river. He intended for Harry and James to be killed and for Lily to become his property. I take it back, he wasn't a bitch, he was a cunt.
