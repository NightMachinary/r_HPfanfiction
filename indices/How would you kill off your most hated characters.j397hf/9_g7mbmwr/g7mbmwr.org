First I will make the Dursleys(Not Dudley) drink Unicorn Blood, so they will live half cursed lives, then I will lock them in a Dark, dangy wet Cupboard with 10 Dementors outside guarding the Cupboard Cell. The Unicorn Blood is given to them regularly. The Dursleys will go Mad, they will have to live their rest of their lives facing and reliving their Greatest Fear, but not able to die.
