I had an OC who hated Bella their response was to basically slaughter and kill everyone/thing she loved, set a house on fire, peeled her nails back and had them crisscross and skin her alive, followed by burning with a poker, rubbing in salt, and a few crucios for good measure all while mocking her about everything before tossing her into Fiendfyre.
