Well during huge fights where deatheaters fight against the Order I always end up killing annoying characters that just have to be here because of canon-compliance! Like, someone I like just avoids a mortal curse out of skill or luck, and then, damn, too bad this guy died instead! I want it to be as realistic as possible, so that the reader cannot hate me openly :D
