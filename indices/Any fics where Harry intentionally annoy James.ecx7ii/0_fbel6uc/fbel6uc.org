I can imagine Harry being like that if he grew up with James/Lily. Just doing stuff to bother them, because he's amused by their reactions. Or even just because he's a teenager and that's what they do.

But I don't know of any fics like that. Honestly, now that I think of it, I can't think of a single fic where Harry is carefree enough to do things like that. I'm a huge fan of James/Lily being alive and have read loads of them but the base of Harry's character is /usually/ BWL or some equally high-pressure arc.
