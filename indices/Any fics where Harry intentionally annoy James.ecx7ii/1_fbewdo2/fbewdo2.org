linkffn(Time to Spare) is a time travel fic where Harry gets sent back to his parents time with Draco, but ultimately decides to ensure he doesn't befriend them because due to his experience in third year, he knows that time is a loop and it would be too painful to befriend them knowing nothing he could do could change their death. So part of that includes making sure James hates him.
