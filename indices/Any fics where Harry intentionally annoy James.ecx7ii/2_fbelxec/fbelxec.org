This gives me an idea. So here's a prompt.

A fic relating the first year of harry's life until Voldemort's raid, completely canon compliant.

Must be written funny and over cute (a nice and happy family, where the parents and their friends are all about their little child, somthing really attaching, with Harry already showing a taste for pranks and messing with the adults using accidental magic). Slowly grows darker in the latter parts, but kept in the background. Until, finally, well...

Last scene is Dumbledore putting the basket in front of the Dursley's door.

It seems deliciously underhanded.
