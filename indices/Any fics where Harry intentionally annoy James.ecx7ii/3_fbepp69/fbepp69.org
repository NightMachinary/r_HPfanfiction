There's one scene in linkffn(The Gates of Azkaban) where the main group of people mocked James by telling him how awful Harry was on a broom. The intention was to keep James from realizing who Harry is (his son, that is), but when it's obvious that he figured it out, they do this instead just for fun.

Harry himself wasn't around in the scene (he was asleep, IIRC).
