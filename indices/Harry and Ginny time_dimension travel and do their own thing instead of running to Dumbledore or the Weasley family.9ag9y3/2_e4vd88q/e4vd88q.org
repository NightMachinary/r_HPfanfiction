I read this recently written fic called Sling Shot where Harry ends up in his first year at Privet Drive I sure as to how he got there. It isn't until he sets off on the train that he realizes Ginny has also been sent back. They resolve to not have children get involved in a Wizarding War and change the timeline with unexpected results. The best bits are them trying to reason out how this happened, trying to solve the mystery
