  Their relationship seems healthy, and while a bit lovey dovey not unrealistic

That's awesome. My biggest gripe with post DH stories is that the authors always claim that the characters love each other but besides the words, there is no proof (and one of the main reasons I utterly despise Ron/Hermione since most authors have them do nothing but fight, but it's ok because they love each other).
