How about they go back in time and instead of changing things on purpose they do it because they didn't know they all ready did change the timeline....

That might have been convoluted lol.

Anyhow if you're interested The Amulet of time series is time travel on a giant level. Across four stories the heroes (Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione) end up in three different times: the founders era (Harry and Ron create the game quidditch cringe worthy maybe but you get my comment above now.), 1940's WW2, and the marauders era.

It's a VERY long story and Harry is shipped with an OC before being shipped with Ginny.

It doesn't quite fit your wants but if you're at all interested it worth a read.
