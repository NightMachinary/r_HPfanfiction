I totally love the concept of time travel in fiction, but I can't stand "let's preserve the timeline" plots. It's like, you have this amazing literary device and what you decide to do with it is the most boring, clich√© thing imaginable.

Suppose that Groundhog Day was filmed like this, instead of a guy taking advantage of his predicament he just had to repeat the same thing over and over to preserve the fabric of the universe or whatever. It would ruin the movie. As far as I'm concerned, the whole idea got old after Back to the Future and I don't want to see it again. Do interesting things with timetravel, for the love of Merlin.
