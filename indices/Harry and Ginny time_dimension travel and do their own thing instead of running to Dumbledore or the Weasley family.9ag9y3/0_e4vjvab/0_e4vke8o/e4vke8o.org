Like, for example, there's this blinding light and then Harry wakes up having sex in the dark and decides to simply go along with the lifelike "dream", only to wake up the next morning and to realise that not only he is apparently in the 70s (BBC news talk about something in the Soviet Union for example), no he has actually had sex with his mother/Bellatrix Black/Malfoy's mum/Hestia Jones/literally anyone from the past. And the first words spoken are "You are not James".
