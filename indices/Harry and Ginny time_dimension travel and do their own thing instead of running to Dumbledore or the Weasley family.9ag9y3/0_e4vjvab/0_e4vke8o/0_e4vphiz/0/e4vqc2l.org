I know that the biggest reason I wouldn't write this is getting the accurate BBC newscast for that day or something like that. I once spent two hours searching the internet for BBC 1 headlines for a specific day (breaking news was the Queen inaugurating the SIS building) because I wanted to use them in the story. Or half an hour searching for Finnish Weather archives dating back to January 1997. Or two hours trying to find out which planes were being operated on London -> Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the summer of 95.
