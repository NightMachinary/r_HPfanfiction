"Help the author"

From personal experience that is bullshit. I have posted several chapter drafts there, and have had NO helpful criticism. Then there are authors who post there, and NEVER AGAIN. The whole system of DLP is fucked up, and needs a complete overhaul.

That being said, it is the only place for fanfiction to get legitimate help consistently if they like your work. So for many, it is an undeniable resource.
