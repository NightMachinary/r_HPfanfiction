  WBA isn't early-access FFN. WBA is for the authors, not readers. Besides, the fic is going to be updated on FFN at some point. You can just wait a bit.

Listen people, the stuff in WBA isn't as good as the version that gets posted on FFN. Basically, the WBA chapters are the drafts, and then people help the author fix the chapters, or make them better. If you're not going to help with that process, don't bother.
