Well, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4gax5d/best_of_harry_ships/d2fz0nd][here's]] the wiki page for Harry/Daphne fics.

More that aren't there are:

linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW) - A long one, at 81 chapters and nearing the end.

linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord) - Complete. Super quippy, EWE fic. Lots of back and forth, very entertaining.

linkffn(Big Brother is Listening to You by Holz9364) - The HP version of the Big Brother reality show. Amusing.

linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement by TheUnrealInsomniac) - a WIP take on a marriage contract thing. Super amusing, hilarious Daphne. As Ron says "I need her in my life." Harry's a bit of a dick, but he realizes that.

linkffn(The Lies that Bind by Zephros) - Super dark, but super enjoyable.

linkffn(The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie) A marriage law fic. WIP. Not the best, and it's a typical James Spookie fic. So grammar and what not is good, characterization is ok and plot could use work. Actually, just go check out his profile. Has a bunch, and I don't feel like typing them all out.

linkffn(A Champion's New Hope by Rocag) A complete, GoF & OotP AU. Didn't age well.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) I've mentioned this in the Cult Classics thread. The H/D pairing isn't the focus, but is present. Feels very b-movie.

linkffn(The Reluctant Champion by The Unreal Insomniac) The first of a series. Second fic has just been started. A "James Potter lived" fic.

linkffn(Myrddin Emrys Returns) Probably the worst fic I'm recommending, but whatever, I do what I want.

linkffn(Uncle Harry by R-Dude) is a fun oneshot featuring Harry and his Pureblood snob wife Daphne visiting Dudley's family.

linkffn(Beltane Child by White Angel of Aurolan) is a piece where [[/spoiler][Harry kinda gets Daphne pregnant during an anonymous ritual to promote a good harvest because he needed a damn break during the horcrux hunt.]] Not the best.

And that's all I can really think of that hasn't already been mentioned here.
