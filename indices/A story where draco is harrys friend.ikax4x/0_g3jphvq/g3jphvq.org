This happens eventually in the linkffn(Innocent) series, for somewhat disturbing reasons (The Malfoys have two sons, so Lucius decides to deliberately condition Draco for Gryffindor, to hedge his bets in case Harry becomes important), although it's only one part of a very large story, and Draco has a brother who basically takes on the canon role of not-really-very-ambitious-or-cunning Slytherin nuisance.

For a more direct example, you could try linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series, where Harriet Potter is sorted into Slytherin and befriends Draco and Pansy. Note that this story is very AU, going far off the canon rails; Tom Riddle went into politics instead of starting a violent revolution, so the Marauders are all alive and well, Harriet lives with both her parents, but there are restrictive laws based on blood status, and Riddle is working to extend them. Despite that, Harriet has faced more trauma and mortal peril than canon Harry did, and she hasn't even finished fourth year as of the latest chapter.
