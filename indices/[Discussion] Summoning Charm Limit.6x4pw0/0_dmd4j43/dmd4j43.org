I'm in Hogwarts library and I cast "Accio book on horcrux", there is no reaction from Hogwarts library. Meanwhile, in a certain library at Durmstrang...

Okay. Let's see on harry's Fourth day. He casted "Accio Firebolt", without indication of it being his. Though, in his training for summoning and the event itself, if I don't mess it up with fanfic, there is a need for him to picture the concept of the object coming to him, the specific object.

Wiki says this, too.

  The Summoning Charm could not be used on buildings.[3] In addition, it will not work on living things, although they may be moved by summoning an object they are wearing or holding. It is risky to summon them that way, because they travel at close to the speed of light and may be injured in the process.[4],[5] The only known exception to the rule are Flobberworms, which were generally not considered worth Summoning.[3]

  The farther the desired object was from the caster, the harder it was to Summon. However, there was apparently some controversy over this claim, as Hermione Granger stated that it did not matter how far away the object was --- so long as the caster had it clearly in mind, they should be able to Summon it with ease.[6]

So, can you even picture the winning number? You have no knowledge of the winning number, unless there's an information from the future.
