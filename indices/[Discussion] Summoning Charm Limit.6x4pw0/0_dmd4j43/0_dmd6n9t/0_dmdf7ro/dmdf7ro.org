I disagree with the "afterthought" as well, for, like you said, the fact that Harry had to wait for his Firebolt.

However, I think you're overanalyzing the last bit (though it's a beautiful thought).

This is a world where wizards and witches can travel from place to place instantaneously, or a triple-decker bus can go across the country in a few minutes. I know "magic" is hardly an acceptable answer, but... If you're going to complain about after-canon reasoning by the author, there's quite a few during-canon story concepts that are begging you to bend over.
