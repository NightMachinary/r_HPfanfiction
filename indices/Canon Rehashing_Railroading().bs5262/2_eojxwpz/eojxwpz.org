Basically, yes.

While repeating some events (like Quirrelmort in Year 1, the opening of the Chamber in Year 2 or the Triwizard Tournament happening in Year 4), repeating all the events, even with different outcomes, count as Canon Rehash.

For example, with your proposition. Quirrel releasing the troll during the Halloween night is not really rehash, since this event, and the ones leading to it, happen outside of Harry sphere of influence, it would happen with or without him.\\
But now there are several questions who need to be answered :

- Fay Dunbar is the GWL, what changed? Considering her status, she has to be at least Half Blood, potentially Pure Blood, but what is her story? Is she a Half Blood who grew up with her magic hating muggle familly after her mother used "love" to protect her from Voldemort, or is her story completely different (is she a Female Harry with a different name or a true character on her own). How her, and the world around her, was influenced by her status during her uprising. And while we are at it, what happened to Harry Potter? (Dead with the Potters, or they live, is Pettigrew a traitor . . .).
- Since Fay is a different character, why is she in this situation? The trio confrontation with a troll is the result of several events (Ron badmouth Hermione to Harry -> Hermione hears about it -> she goes in the bathroom to cry -> troll happen -> the boys know she isn't there and go tell her about the troll -> confrontation). If you change anything about the premise (one of the character into another house, new character . . .) then the confrontation should not happen, or at least not as in canon (nobody comes to help Hermione, she dies or is hurt/ Troll goes to a different bathroom/ Hermione escapes by herself . . .).
- Wand in the nose. This event is really precise, and shows that the fight happen pretty much exactely as in canon. But in that case why brings a new character. Also, if the wand is stuck in the nose, when I guess someone else it there to do magic during this time. Who is it? Ron?

So yeah, this situation sound a lot like rehash. Though it is in 1st year though, some fic rehash so much that they manage to change everything in the fic will still keeping a very precise event (Like a genius, Slytherin Harry who is in neutral term with Draco, but still end up with the Half Blood Prince's book and use Sectumsempra on him in Myrtle's bathroom).
