Yes. It doesn't matter what the protagonists name is, if the same cannon events are happening to THE protagonist, it is +trash+ a rehash. The only way to keep the same events and not be rehashing cannon is to make your protagonist somebody ELSE then whoever the events are happening to.

For example, you could have a story with Fay as your protagonist, and keep Harry as the one who all the events happen to. She may or may not hear some or all of the details, but it doesn't matter because she's got her own plotline that is NOT just rehashing cannon. Of course, that requires more creativity then the vast majority of FF authors will ever see.

Different outcomes MAY squeak through as not quite a rehash IF the events that follow are in line with those different outcomes. For example if the protagonist saves hermione but isn't considered a friend, the hermione cannot randomly start tagging along anyways. Or more accurately, further events cannot serve to railroad the plot back to the cannon tracks if a different outcome has already changed it.
