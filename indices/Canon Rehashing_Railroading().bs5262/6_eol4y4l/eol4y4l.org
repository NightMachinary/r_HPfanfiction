There is such a wide spectrum of “reshash” I think. It goes from literally adding or changing a character and going through the same plot and quoting book dialogue (not my fave) to something as amazing as as the Changeling (a 7 year story following Ginny sorted into Slytherin full of new material and amazing character development). I recommended it to someone the other day and they said they loved it despite it “being a rehash” which I did not even think it was. But I suppose it technically falls into the category since it loosely follow the canon timeline even though it's AU.

Anyway long story short... when done well, rehashes can be quite brilliant. Canon compliant stories that fit neatly into canon but present new material are also often brilliant.

Stories where the same exact things happen with just a character switch... you need to really have a unique angle for something like that to work, I think. Now if you start with a canon event and then have a different outcome and diverge from there.... that will be great! :)

I was reading a time travel fix it/rehash the other day where Ron got the diary instead of Ginny in CoS and that went off the rails in a pretty satisfying way. Small changes can have big impacts.
