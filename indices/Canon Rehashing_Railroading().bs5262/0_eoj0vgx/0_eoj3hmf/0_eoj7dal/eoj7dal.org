This sub overwhelmingly favors entirely different plot.

I mean most of us know canon plot fairly well, we don't need to see it regurgitated thousands of times in fanfics. WTH is the point to read its endless repetitions?

There are some fics that repeat those canon stations, but with vastly different outcomes. One such example is the very popular [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106). The resolutions of CoS and TWT events are totally hilarious, and that type of â€˜rehash' is totally cool for me.
