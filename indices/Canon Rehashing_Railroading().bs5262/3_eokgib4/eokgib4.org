Bad rehashes are basically skippable - you can assume the reader knows about Diagon Alley, so if your alternate Harry goes there at the same time, with Hagrid, and buys the same things, there's no need to go into detail about it. You can brush it off and get to the good stuff.

If the scene contains stuff that happened in the books, but also contains important information that's new and different, then it's not a bad rehash. (IE if Fem!Harry makes a stop at a dress shop during her first visit, the whole event might tell us a lot about her, especially how she's different from canon Harry. That's an important scene to keep.)
