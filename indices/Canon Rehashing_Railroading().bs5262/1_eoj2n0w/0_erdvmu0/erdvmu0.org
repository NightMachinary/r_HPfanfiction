What would happen if the book storyline was happening, but other plots were going on at the same time? You know, like how a TV show usually has more than one plot going on at once every episode? (For example, on Friends, Rachel has her pregnancy plot in Season 8, but Monica and Chandler are trying to have their own babies. Or when they go to the beach and Phoebe's mission is to find her family, while Ross is trying to figure out what to do about Rachel.) In my fanfiction, the timeline is kind of playing in the background, but it's not the main plot. There are actually a few main plots (Harry has his own, as well as does Sirius, and a few other characters) but I wouldn't say the book's timeline is the plot of the story. Is that okay, or do you think it crosses the line?
