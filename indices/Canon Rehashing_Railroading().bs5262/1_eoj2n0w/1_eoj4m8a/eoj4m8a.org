That makes sense! I figured that you'd /have/ to add new internal dialogue, though - wouldn't you just be repeating the same character with a different name? The new character would naturally have a different view and voice.

It's definitely important to understand /why/ Fay would go off onto wild adventures. Thank you for the bit of advice!
