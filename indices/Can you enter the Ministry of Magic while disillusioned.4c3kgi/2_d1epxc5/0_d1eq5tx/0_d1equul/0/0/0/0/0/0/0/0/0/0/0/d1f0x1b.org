Thank-you. I like to have a solid understanding of how the mechanics of my story world are going to work before I write it so I don't make some error that requires massive rewrites - or worse sneaks through. Its complex with a lot of moving parts so I am working hard at keeping my eye on the ball.

I will be very happy to link you the fic once I get to a point its fit for public consumption. I'm currently under way on the first draft. If my Beta's crack the whip on me I hope to have the first draft completed by the end of April when Camp NaNoWriMo wraps up and start publishing shortly thereafter.
