Point-to-point communication (in the style of two-way mirrors or even the floo) is already pretty established in HP canon, so it wouldn't be a huge stretch. It would be pretty easy to handwave something that's basically the magical version of a wireless camera and microphone, there are plenty of reasons someone might want to be able to monitor a room without actually being in it.

Fitting the object into your world becomes a bit of a problem, particularly since you'd expect secure chambers to be magically protected against most monitoring methods, common or obscure. It needs to be something that's both almost entirely unknown and accessible to your character.

Or, hell, maybe the Ministry is incompetent. The spells protecting that room were supposed to be touched up but Fudge cut that part of the budget, the people who designed the Ministry's security weren't sufficiently worried about spying within the building (that could be a feature, since knowing what your political rivals are up to can be useful), the meeting was going to be in a secure room but someone moved it at the last minute as an ill-considered power play.
