Huh, that's an interesting scenario. I'm not entirely sure what to conclude about the overall story from the other threads you've posted here, but I really like the amount of thought you're putting into the various aspects of the world. I'm interested in seeing the fic once you're done writing it or start publishing chapters.

I do think that you're right that going for a super clever solution might not be the best route. The more moving parts a plan has the more likely it is that something will go wrong, and relying on a plan like that takes a special sort of person.
