It's the Death Eater trials following the fall of Voldemort/Battle of Hogwarts. So Fudge is long gone and so is Scrimegour. Kingsley is care-taking and I imagine trying to sort the ministry would be a god awful mess.

That said - this hearing has to be kept completely stumm. No one from the ministry wants the ramifications of it being general knowledge. I think even the Doctor from St Mungo's would have some spell/charm/hex placed on him to prevent him speaking about it. So its needs to be good enough the average sneaky animagus reporter can't get past it but not so clever it stops my fellow from getting in. Maybe the simplest plans are often the best.
