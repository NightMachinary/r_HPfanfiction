An insect (or other small) animagus form, in the style of Rita Skeeter?

Using some sort of remote viewing charm, in the style of Extendable Ears? Sneak it onto one of the members of the Wizengamot and let them bring it into the chamber. While the chambers are presumably screened for bugs beforehand they probably don't apply the same level of care to the dignitaries. Even if they do, if Malfoy were running late he'd just bully his way through.
