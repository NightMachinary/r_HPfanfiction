I remember when the horcruxes were introduced in in HBP several authors I was reading up and abandoned their current fics or made major changes to them to fit aforementioned horcruxes. It annoyed me. Several really good stories were suddenly tossed to the side because they didn't fit canon anymore. Really? Thats what the AU tags for.
