Oh you sweet summer child :)

I came to the fandom in...about 2001 or so? Not long after Goblet of Fire came out certainly.

There have been so many evolutions of common themes and tropes, based what new canon has just been unveiled. So many fics abandoned by authors when the next book was released and canon suddenly clashed with something they were writing or they got inspiration for a new fic.

Some fics you might be interested in would be linkffn(1657629), linkffn(979216), linkffn(3401052), linkffn(2107570), linkffn(2580283), linkffn(2856856), and linkffn(1291535)

Some of those have sequels, some aren't completed, but they're all good examples of the sorts of things that folk wrote back then.
