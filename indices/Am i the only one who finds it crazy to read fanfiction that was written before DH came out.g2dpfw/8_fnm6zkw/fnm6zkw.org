I've read some /before/ DH came out, which lead to DH becoming the worst book in the series for me. Of all the ways DH could go, JKR chose the Dumpster fire route. People die, but killing the majority of them off-screen? Really?

I've read some /after/ DH came out (years later, DH turned me off from HP for a while). It was confusing at points. Horcruxes being different, or in different locations. Places being different. Things happening differently. Things not happening at all.

I can't even remember any of the fics I read back then, it felt so long ago. Christ, it feels weird trying to remember stuff from ~15 years ago. Especially that time period, in and out of hospitals and doctors apointments? I was devouring everything I could read: mangas, light novels, fiction, fanfiction. ANYTHING.

OH! I remembered a few!\\
*A Black Comedy* - linkffn(3401052) Started before the release of Book7, finished after.\\
*Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor* - linkffn(2841153) Started before Book7, finished after. Erotic. Not totally explicit. But yeah... those types of scenes are skippable.

These two have different horcruxes, horcruxes in different locations, different final battle. And a Black Comedy has a "price" for defeating a Dark Lord. They both didn't age very well.
