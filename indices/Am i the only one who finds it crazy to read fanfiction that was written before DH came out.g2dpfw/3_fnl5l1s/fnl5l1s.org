Well, I never read fanfics back when the books were still being released (and, in any case, can barely recall the OOTP/HBP gap), but people were publishing actual books which speculated about how Book 7 would go. I remember flicking through one in a bookshop, for example.

As to the question of suggestions... I've come across a few pre-completion fics, but I don't recall any [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1881966/1/Reality][except this one]], which is an AU so it doesn't matter that the author didn't know how things were going to play out.
