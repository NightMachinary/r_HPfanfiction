I got into Harry Potter, as well as Harry Potter fanfiction, after all of the books had been released and when only one movie was left to be released. So pretty late in the game.

I can get into some fanfiction written before all the books were out, but a lot of the time it just takes me out of the story. Having Luna's dad show up as a normal ass dude with a normal ass name is just too jarring.
