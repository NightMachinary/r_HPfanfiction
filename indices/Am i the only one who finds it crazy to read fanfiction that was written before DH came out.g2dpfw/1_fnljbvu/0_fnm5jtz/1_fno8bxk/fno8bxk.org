I'm still awed till no how a humble phone supporting Java (and thus, the incredible [[https://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteREADER][Albite Reader]]) with a single 2 MB EPUB download can keep me hooked for /days/, and there's always more coming. Even now I could spend entire weekend without charging any device because the ereader just keep on going.
