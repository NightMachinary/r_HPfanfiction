I read the books for the first time in 2013 and only started reading Fanfiction in 2014, so I know /exactly/ what you are talking about when it comes to that vintage feel and whatever. In fact, for me linkffn(395212) is a perfect example of this, because the story reads like one of the books and yet goes on a completely different path. Same goes for linkffn(2242606), especially because, if I remember correctly Snape is revealed to have a squib son at some point.
