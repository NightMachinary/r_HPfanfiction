wow, that's sounds really interesting, it's crazy how long this series has been about really, i mean just today i saw a girl who looked about 9 with a hogwarts rucksack, there's generation after generation who are going to read it, and fanfiction along with that, new perspectives and fics will be written, and hopefully they appreciate a time before all the books were out
