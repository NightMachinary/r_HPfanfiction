  I'm wondering whether, if all Horcruxes were to do that, would that make the person mortal again but with (in Voldemort's case) eight bodies.

There's at least one fic - linkffn(Souls Abound by Robst) - that has that premise. I seem to recall that someone made an abortive attempt at rewriting it with a bit less Robstiness, but I can't recall author or any other detail right now.
