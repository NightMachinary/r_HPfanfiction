According to the books, the purpose of a Horcrux is to act as an anchor to your main part of the soul to the living world. As (I believe) Dumbledore puts it, even if his body is destroyed, the main piece of the soul remains on Earth. Now in Chamber of Secrets, it appears that Horcruxes can also come alive if they feed on the life energy of a person so I'm wondering whether, if all Horcruxes were to do that, would that make the person mortal again but with (in Voldemort's case) eight bodies.
