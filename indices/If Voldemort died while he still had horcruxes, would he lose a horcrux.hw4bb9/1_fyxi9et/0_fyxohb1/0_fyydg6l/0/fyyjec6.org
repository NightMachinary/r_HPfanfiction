  I really think the one to be blamed for Dumbledore's inaction is Ms Rowling, not manipulative!himself

Sure, from a meta standpoint JKR is to blame for all character inconsistencies and the implications for how they act. Is Dumbledore really manipulative or does JKR just write his character poorly and not understand the consequences of his actions? Does Harry suffer brain damage at the end of DH or does JKR not realize that Dumbledore and Snape were actually awful to Harry? Etc.

However, when trying to understand character motivations and actions you have to go by what's in the text itself, not what the author says. Death of the author and all that. If you want to actually criticize the author for how poorly they wrote the characters, then you can, but that's seperate.
