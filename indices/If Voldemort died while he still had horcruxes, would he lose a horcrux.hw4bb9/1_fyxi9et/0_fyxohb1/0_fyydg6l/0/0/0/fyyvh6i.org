That was an example, the point bring that they're two seperate conversations. You can argue whether or not Dumbledore is manipulative and whether or not JKR is a bad writer, but you can't say "well yeah he /seems/ manipulative in canon but that's just because JKR is a bad writer. He's not actually manipulative." You see what I mean?

Well, maybe you don't, since you went the opposite direction and said he's not manipulative /and/ that she's not a bad writer while providing many great examples of her poor writing ability.

  JKR first and almost only concern is the plot. Whatever is necessary for the plot and action in terms of characters, magic, or whatever else is provided
#+end_quote

In other words, she's making it up as she goes along and makes use of contrivances, deus ex machinas, and anything else that will move the plot along regardless of set up or how inconsistent it is within the world or with the characters. This is called bad writing.

  You have to suspend your disbelief and to enjoy the plot.

Nah, mate, you don't get to tell me what I have to do to enjoy the plot. Suspension of disbelief is completely subjective. Everyone has a different limit for what they can suspend their disbelief for. For some people, they won't be able to get past the fact that there's magic. For others, it's the fact that wizards have been able to hide from Muggles in the modern age. For some, it's easy to ignore everything and just enjoy the ride.

However, there's a huge difference between suspending your disbelief in a fantasy setting, and the story setting up rules and breaking them, setting up characterizations then throwing them away, plot holes, etc. Those can actually be proven, and regardless of how you feel about it or how much you enjoyed the plot while you were ignoring them, they are flaws and show signs of bad writing.

  she just honestly doesn't care that much for the world-building unless it serves her plot.
#+end_quote

If the plot relies on the world-building, then that. Is. Bad. Writing.

Also, for the record, I love Harry Potter. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. That doesn't mean I can't criticize JKR for where she went wrong, and just because I criticize her doesn't mean I won't give her credit where it's due for the good writing she's also done.

In any case, I'm not going to go through and criticize the whole series right now or anything. I will leave you with a fic that does a great (and humorous) job at poking through a lot of the holes that pop up throughout the series. Linkffn(Force Interrupt)
