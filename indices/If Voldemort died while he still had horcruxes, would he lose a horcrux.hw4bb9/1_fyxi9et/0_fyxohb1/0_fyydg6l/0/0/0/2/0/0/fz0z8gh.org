  if you could choose between the Harry Potter series we got, or a better HP series with no plot holes, consistent characters, better world-building, etc., which would you choose?

What I was trying to say is, that it is surprising that even after all these years in some aspects we don't have much which would be at least as good as her books. And that serial writing is evil (that's my /Carthago delenda est/), because “Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.” (that's by Michael Crichton based on similar older statements), because with serial writing you just won't make that seventh (or even third) rewrite.
