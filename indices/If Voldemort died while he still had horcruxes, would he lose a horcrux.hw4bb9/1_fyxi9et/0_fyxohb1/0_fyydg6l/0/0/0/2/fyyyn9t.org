  Well, maybe you don't, since you went the opposite direction and said he's not manipulative and that she's not a bad writer ...

I think this is the crux of the matter: how much it really matters? And not only that I am not willing to call JKR bad writer before I sell those many millions copies of books she did. I was again listening with my wife to the audiobooks with Stephen Fry (only! Sorry Americans but he is so much better than Jim Dale, it isn't even funny) and I found myself again and again really enjoying and smiling all the time. She may be horribly sloppy on this large-scale level (why, oh why, they even put Harry back to the Privet Drive after the death of Dumbledore, when it was just for very limited time and his recovery was obvious to be extremely dangerous? Whole Battle of Seven Potters is complete nonsense logically), but she is absolutely perfect on this lower level of individual conversations, small events, and everything.

I can understand that they have to strip all this which made her stories most alive in films (because of the time restrictions), but I have never read any fanfiction which would be this alive, low-level funny with the everyday life.

And perhaps this is what matter more than the bloody age line.
