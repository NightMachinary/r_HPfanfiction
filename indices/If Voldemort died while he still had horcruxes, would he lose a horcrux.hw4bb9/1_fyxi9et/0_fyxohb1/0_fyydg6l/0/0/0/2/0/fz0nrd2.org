  And not only that I am not willing to call JKR bad writer before I sell those many millions copies of books she did

That's you prerogative. You don't have to be a successful author yourself in order to criticize others. Success and making money doesn't equate to quality, and the inverse is true as well. Honestly I'd say it's embarrassing that such problems got past the editor of a major publication company but not a bunch of amateurs on the internet.

In regards to everything else you said, like I said before, I'm willing to give her credit where it's do. She does have some great writing in the series as well, most of the time the characters are well written, as well as the relationships between them. Some scenes, like the DOM duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, are excellently done, and for the most part the plot is well constructed and follows along logically. However, where there are plot holes, those holes are gaping. Where there are character inconsistencies, they're major inconsistencies. The world-building is almost like she's constantly introducing us to the world without bothering to expand on it, and what she does show us has pretty severe implications/consequences that she doesn't seem to realize exist, or just ignores.

Anyway, I'm rambling. Let me put it this way: if you could choose between the Harry Potter series we got, or a better HP series with no plot holes, consistent characters, better world-building, etc., which would you choose? Personally, I'd choose the better one. So why not point out these mistakes and learn from them? Why not call them out to show authors and script-writers that we do notice them and that they do matter to give them motivation to improve their craft? Why not be better?
