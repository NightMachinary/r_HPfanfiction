  Is Dumbledore really manipulative or does JKR just write his character poorly and not understand the consequences of his actions?

I think neither. JKR first and almost only concern is the plot. Whatever is necessary for the plot and action in terms of characters, magic, or whatever else is provided (e.g., no other means of magical transport other than brooms were properly introduced until Floo in CoS, so Dumbledore flew to London on his broomstick ... she just didn't think it was necessary to introduce faster mode of transport; hence all those complains about non-sensical actions of Dumbles in PS). When she needs it for the action, she almost frees Sirius, and then when it is not necessary (or because it was necessary in OotP) she just forgets about him and she lets him rot in the Grimmauld Place. That Dumbledore (highest judicial authority in the magical Britain) ignores all human rights of any Englishman ... Magna Charta (“jury of his peers”), Habeas Corpus (both were made law before the Statue of Secrecy, so they were supposedly grandfathered into the magical law order) is just completely forgotten, because it doesn't serve her plot. Phases of the moon are moving, three adults (one a married wife at that moment, IIRC) leave one year old baby outside in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b795vp/monthly_weather_report_for_uk_on_october_1981/][the English November]] et cetera et cetera. You have to suspend your disbelief and to enjoy the plot.

I don't think it is because she would be a bad writer, she just honestly doesn't care that much for the world-building unless it serves her plot.
