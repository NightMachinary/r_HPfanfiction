I understand that (and I really think the one to be blamed for Dumbledore's inaction is Ms Rowling, not manipulative!himself ;)), but whenever I read “we have to let him get resurrected in order to kill him” I grind my teeth.

Although, the argument can be made, that until CoS Dumbledore truly and honestly didn't know that Riddle made even one Horcrux (that is actually how the book put it).

Interesting titbit is that they probably /had to/ let CoS happen (at least Ginny be given the diary), because otherwise they really wouldn't get hold on one of the horcruxes.
