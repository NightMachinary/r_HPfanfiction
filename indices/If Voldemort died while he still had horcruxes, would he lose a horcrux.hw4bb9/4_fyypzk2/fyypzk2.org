Per canon, no. On Halloween 1981 Voldemort 'dies', all his horcuxes are intact and he becomes a disembodied wraith. Horcruxes seem to be designed to simply prevent death while resurrection is handled separately. Voldemort spends the next decade trying to get a new body. Simply having a horcrux actually kinda sucks if your minions don't know what to do after you're defeated.

The diary complicated things a bit though. The diary indicates Voldemort can be resurrected through the horcrux itself, with the caveat that the horcrux is a 'save point' and only resurrects Voldemort to the point the horcrux was created. The horcrux appears to be used up when using this method. And Dumbledore says the diary was likely created as a weapon, different from the rest. It's unclear if the rest could be used this way. Though given the effect the ring has on the trio during their camping trip, it would probably possess someone given enough time.

The diary nearly succeeds in using Ginny's lifeforce to resurrect a 17-ear old Tom Riddle. Not ideal, but certainly better than a 50-year old Voldemort in his prime. But this would have teenage Tom and wraith Voldemort running around at the same time. Do they not want to share? Do they seek to merge, Voldemort's mind in a fresh body?
