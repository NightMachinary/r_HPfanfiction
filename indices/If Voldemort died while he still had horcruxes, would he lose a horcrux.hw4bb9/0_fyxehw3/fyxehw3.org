Based on canon he doesn't lose a horcrux when he dies.

IIRC He created the diary, then the Gaunt ring, the diadem (all while he was at school), then the locket and cup.

He accidentally created Harry when his body was destroyed. But since he already had a horcrux when his soul left his body it became a wraith rather than pass on. But none of his previously created horcruxes were used up/destroyed.

In the graveyard when he was resurrected he did not do so using a horcrux.

So basically once you have a single horcrux you will not pass on. And IMO unless the ritual to provide your soul/wraith with a body requires a horcrux one won't be destroyed. If that created body is destroyed it will act like your original body did (eg your soul will just not pass.

So IMO he would only lose a horcrux if someone intentionally destroys it or it is needed for a ritual to return his soul/wraith to a body.
