linkffn(12744735) - The Last Peverell updates every 2 weeks. It's a time travel fic set in the Marauders Era.

linkffn(13247979) - Three Black Birds updates weekly. Starts off as one of the best WBWL fics I've read (first 15ish chapters). Recently (at Ch. 21 right now), the pacing hasn't been the best, but the beginning definitely got me invested enough not to care.
