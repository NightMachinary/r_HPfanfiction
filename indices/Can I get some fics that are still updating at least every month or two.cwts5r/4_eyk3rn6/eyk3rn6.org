Here's what I have in my follows that's been update recently: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Bodacious Bodyguard; The Green in the Grey; The Life He Leads; A Fair Life; Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass; Dawn of Darkness; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus)

I can't vouch for every fic in there, the only ones I've been reading as they update are Bodacious Bodyguard, The Green in the Grey, and A Fair Life. Dawn of Darkness and The Life He Leads I've read a good chunk of, and while they held my interest for a while I haven't bothered to keep up with them, but I've kept them on my follows since I plan on checking on them eventually. Grains of Sand and Sisyphus I followed after being recommended on here, I might have read the beginning but they didn't capture my interest as much as I would have liked. Still intriguing enough for me to follow them to read at a later date.

None of this is to say that the fics I'm not actively reading are bad, just to say that I'm not recommending them on their quality (as I don't know how great they are having not really read them), but on the fact that they're being updated. The three I have read have my full recommendation.
