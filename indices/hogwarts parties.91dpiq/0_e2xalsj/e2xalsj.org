Slughorn hosted more than a few parties, Harry even went to one.

I imagine the more popular students with birthdays in the school year had them though we didn't really see any save Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday party, the books were decent at not putting in too much filler save romances that didn't go anywhere like Chang.

I imagine the older students threw the wizarding equivalent of keggers- especially Griff's and Claws- their heads of houses were hands off to ignore/not help with massive bullying campaigns against Harry and Luna, they would have likely missed parties as well. Snape too I can't see caring all too much if it was his precious snakes partying as long as it doesn't reflect badly on him- IE don't get caught.

Edit: One fic that featured what parties might be like in every house that I recommend you read for research is linkffn(6966314) DOOM Day, one of my favorite crack fics, in which Harry gets stuck in a time loop on the day he and members of the DA go to the ministry to rescue Harry's Dogfather.
