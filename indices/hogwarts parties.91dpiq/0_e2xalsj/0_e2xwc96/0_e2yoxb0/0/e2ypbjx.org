I agree about fifth year for sure. But fourth year, Gryffindor was totally with Harry. They threw him a party the night his name was drawn. The whole "Gryffindor kicks out Harry" storyline bothered me because rather than exaggerate something, it blatantly contradicts canon.

Year 2 is hard to put a pin in, mostly because it's really overlooked how afraid a lot of people are. It seems less like bullying and more like a general distrust and fear of Harry
