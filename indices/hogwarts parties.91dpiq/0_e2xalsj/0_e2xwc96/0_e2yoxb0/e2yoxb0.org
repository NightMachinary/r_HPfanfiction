Year 2- Heir of Slytherin bullshit, and year 4, Triwizard tournament bullshit.

I suppose cannon wasn't as bad- fanfiction tends to exaggerate them both.

Of course, there's also the bullying from Snape and Umbridge to deal with, the later Potter's literally being tortured and gets told by his head of house to keep his head down and shut up basically. I'm not a fan of the cat lady or the midget.
