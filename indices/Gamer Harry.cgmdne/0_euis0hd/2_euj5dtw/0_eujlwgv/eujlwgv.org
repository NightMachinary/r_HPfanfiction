The gaming ability is not something that manhwa invented, you will find plenty of stories with game mechanics both in fanfiction and in original works, including plenty years before that manhwa existed.. Also, while many trash authors just copy that manhwa, others with actual imagination make their own stuff. Personally I liked those with pure RPG mechanics, but there are many that go full videogame with saves and even bugs, as shown by the example given by the OP, all of that is way outside of the manhwa's spectrum.
