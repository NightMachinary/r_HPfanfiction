There's a Harry Potter/Good Omens crossover on Ao3 that's exactly this. Can't remember the title, just search for crossovers between the two and you should find it.

Good Omens is a hilarious book cowritten by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchet about the antichrist being born and actually protecting earth from the apocalypse.
