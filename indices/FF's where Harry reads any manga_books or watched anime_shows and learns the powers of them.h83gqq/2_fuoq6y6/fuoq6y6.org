There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][/Lighting Dragon's Roar/ by Zero Rewind]], which has Harry inspired to learn Lightning Dragon Slayer magic from the manga, and eats electricity. It's also a massively AU crossover with several other IPs. it has not been updated since October of last year, though, as of this post.

There is also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9596404/1/Fairy-Tail][/Fairy Tail/ by Araceil]], which takes the same premise in a different direction, but unfortunately has been dead for even longer than /Lightning Dragon's Roar/.
