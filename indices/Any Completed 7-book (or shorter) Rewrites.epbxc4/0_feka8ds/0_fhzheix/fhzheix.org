Wow this is a super late reply, I do apologize for that. ADHD + Executive Dysfunction = "I'll get to that later" and I never do. As for "the Cupboard series", do you mean this one? [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895]]

It does sound interesting! I'll have to add that to my bookmarks.

In case commenting bumps this thread up, any other ideas?
