Because I almost exclusively read and write canon compliant stuff I don't think my perceptions have been skewed at all. But you only have to look at the differences between this sub and the main HP sub to see that you're right; there are a lot of very different perceptions of the characters and plots. I think people here appreciate a more adult, dark version of events.
