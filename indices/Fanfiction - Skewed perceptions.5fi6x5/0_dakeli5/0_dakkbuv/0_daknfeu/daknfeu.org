I believe the movies had a huge negative impact on people's perception of Ron and Ginny. Steve Klose shit on them pretty badly, and then a bunch of these viewers continued to shit on them in fanfics.

On the other end of spectrum, Tom Felton and Alan Rickman did well in their characters, and Steve Klose cut out lots of their meanest scenes in the Books. As a result, fandom (mostly girls) literally worshipped Draco and Snape.
