Some people think that Harry and Ginny could not have stayed together because high school couples rarely last long. Well, let's take a look at some facts from the books:

- Both were possessed by a dark power once and survived

- Both fought against evil terrorists bent on killing them since they were 11

- The guy went on guerrilla warfare, while the girl stayed behind enemy lines as underground resistance leader

- The girl was tortured several times for supporting her guy, the guy went willingly to his death to save his girl (and other loved ones)

- Finally, after a brief glimpse of the 'heaven', the guy still decided to come back to join his girl, what would the girl think of that?

- On top of that, they shared a common interest (quidditch) and many personality traits (wicked sense of humor).

Are Harry and Ginny your average high school couple?

In fact, none of the couples who fought at Battle of Hogwarts should be considered 'average high school teenagers'.
