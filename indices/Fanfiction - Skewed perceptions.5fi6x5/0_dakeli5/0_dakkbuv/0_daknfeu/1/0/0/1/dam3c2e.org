To be fair, though, the characters the books build up the most are Harry and ... Snape. And look, they aren't the canon pairing (although I'm sure some people would want that).

But yeah, I agree the epilogue makes the things look kind of weird. The first few books were a light-ish fairy tale, then the last few were dark, and the epilogue went fairy tale again which tastes like a sandwich with jam and pickles and oatmeal and chorizo (in other words, weird).
