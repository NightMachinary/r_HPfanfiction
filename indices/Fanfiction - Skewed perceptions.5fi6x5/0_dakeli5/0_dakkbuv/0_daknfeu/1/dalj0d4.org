  I believe the movies had a huge negative impact on people's perception of Ron and Ginny.

  On the other end of spectrum, Tom Felton and Alan Rickman did well in their characters, and Steve Klose cut out lots of their meanest scenes in the Books. As a result, fandom (mostly girls) literally worshipped Draco and Snape.

To be fair, I remember both of these perceptions existing in the fan community long before the movies started coming out. My opinion of Ron took a pretty steep nose dive when I read GoF (2000), which came out before the first movie (2001), and I know I'm not the only one that happened to. I also think Ginny is an extremely weak character in both the books and the movies and never really "bought" the Harry/Ginny romance. JKR really wasted her potential by not giving her enough page time to properly develop her.

Though I have never seen the appeal of Snape or school-aged Draco.
