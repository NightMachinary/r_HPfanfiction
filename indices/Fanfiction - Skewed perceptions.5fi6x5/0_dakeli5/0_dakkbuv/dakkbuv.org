I'm definitely more sympathetic and interested in the fringe characters and villains. Ron & Ginny are two of my least favorite characters, typically, which tends to blow peoples minds when I tell them. I'd also agree that readers on this sub definitely appreciate the less childish aspects of fanfiction.
