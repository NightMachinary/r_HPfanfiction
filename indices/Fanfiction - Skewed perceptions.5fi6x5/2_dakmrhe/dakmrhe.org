An aside, but one thing that's really interesting is that due to the nature of fandom and size of respective countries, I would wager that most fanfic writers are American; an audience that JKR would never have written the original three or four books with the intention of reaching.

One thing I find really interesting is that fandom view, as a hivemind, shaping major points accepted by the fandom and fanon points, is now American-dominated, or at least has a very sizeable chunk of influence. Partly because I myself am not American, and never read the original series from that cultural background and perspective, so it's interesting seeing what logical leaps American fans made and which direction their minds went in, which has now made it's way into baseline fanon.

Some things like the patriarchal society and witches being subservient, that another commenter remarks on not really being in the source text is one example; a lot of the ways gender is treated in fanon has its roots in a very, I feel, American perspective on stereotypical male and female characters. Another would be the attitude to government, or to crime and punishment.

I also feel that as the fandom has become more and more proportionally American, the prevalence of certain early ships like Wolfstar has gone down. I can't help but wonder if there's a link there.
