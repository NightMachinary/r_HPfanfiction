I'm just going by what I read in fanfic, for the last point. But you make good points there too.

Yes, as to your first point, that's a good one too that I didn't think of at first. Capital punishment is another one; legal in the US, not so in the UK. As well as the relationship between everyone carrying wands and everyone carrying guns; probably not a parallel JKR would immediately have thought of when first writing, since public gun ownership is completely illegal in the UK except for land caretakers in areas with wild animals and the like.

Certain things which for JKR would have only been in the province of fantasy are, for American readers, very real.

(US) fanon views of certain characters is also interesting to consider. I've heard before that Harry's British cheekiness and snark doesn't translate that well to US readers.
