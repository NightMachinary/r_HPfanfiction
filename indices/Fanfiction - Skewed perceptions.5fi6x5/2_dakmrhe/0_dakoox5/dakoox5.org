I have noticed that American writers are more likely to favor a hardline approach to Death Eaters and despise the stunners-only non lethal tactics.

I think it's quite understandable since most US counties allow residents to use lethal force against home intruders/burglars.

However, I disagree that American writers tend to think magical Britain as patriarchal. You just need to take a look at prevalence of female executives at major American corporations to know that when it comes to gender equality, America is pretty close to Europe. Authors from Asian backgrounds, with their long tradition of patriarchy and polygamy, are IMO more likely to write about those themes.
