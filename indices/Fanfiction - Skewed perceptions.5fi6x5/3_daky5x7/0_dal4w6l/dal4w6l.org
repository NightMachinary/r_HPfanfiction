I think Dumbledore was a "good" guy mostly because he was opposed to the clearly evil guy. That doesn't really change the fact that the way he handled and treated Harry was rather shitty. No child should be raised for the purpose of dying later at the appropriate time, regardless of the circumstances. I wouldn't say he was evil or incompetent, but he was flawed enough that I question his inherent goodness.
