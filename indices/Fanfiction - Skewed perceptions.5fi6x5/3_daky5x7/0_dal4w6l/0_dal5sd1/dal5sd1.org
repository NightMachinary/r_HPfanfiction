I think there was ample opportunity to resolve that though. I think that's also something that Rowling tried to do after book 5, but IMHO it fell short of a true change in character dynamic between Harry and Dumbledore. Dumbledore should have been truly repentant and stopped keeping secrets from Harry... Harry has already prove to be a hero and to corner him into a position in which he has to sacrifice himself seems unnecessary and cruel. In a lot of ways Harry is Dumbledore's ward and saying that a cancer patient shouldn't be told by his doctor that they have cancer so that they can live more happily seems wrong to me on every level.

I really think that this is just the way it is as a plot convenience (to make the resolution of book 7 more exciting...). To me it seems like a pattern that JKR often bent her characters in order to make the plot more dramatic (Hermione in book 6; Ron in book 4 and 7).

Authors that I really respect say things like "I wanted x to happen in my outline, but my characters didn't allow me to do that". Rowling didn't have any scruples there I think.
