  Molly Weasley for example. Fans of the books/movies love her as a character because *that is how she's intended to be viewed*. A motherly, if overbearing character type. I'd say most avid fanfiction readers no matter your genre or tropes have a vastly different viewpoint of the character.

You hit on an interesting point here.

I hate to say it (because even here some people seem to worship canon), but JKR was really clumsy with her characters... in each case it is incredibly obvious what she was trying to do, but often it doesn't come across when taking the text for itself. I'm not particularly fond of requiring outside explanations or meta-knowledge to interpret the words.

A good example of this is Dumbledore... I think in the last subreddit survey opinions on that character were a 50:50 split, but whatever camp you fall in, if one of the main "good guys" in your series is seen in such a cynical light by 50% of your readers you kinda failed. Again - of course - her intentions were great here, she wanted to add nuance...

I think it's fine when Fanfiction explores the consequences of taking the books at their word instead of going for the most beneficial author/pottermore-guided interpretation. I just wish there'd be more uniqueness (I don't need a millionth edition of evil!incompetent!worst-dark-lord-ever!Dumbledore). As long as it's still recognizable as "Harry Potter" I'm fine (JKR did some incredible worldbuilding and theming).
