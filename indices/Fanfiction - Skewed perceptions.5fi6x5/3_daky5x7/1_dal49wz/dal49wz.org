  if one of the main "good guys" in your series is seen in such a cynical light by 50% of your readers you kinda failed

50% of /fanfiction/ readers, already exposed to hundreds of Dumbledore/Weasley bashing circle-jerk stories. In certain fanfiction circles, it's like asking a Fox News viewer their views on Obama. Dumbledore is certainly viewed as a good guy by most normal readers. Some fanfiction readers cannot separate canon from fanon (as can be seen in this very thread), which makes their opinions on canon kinda worthless.
