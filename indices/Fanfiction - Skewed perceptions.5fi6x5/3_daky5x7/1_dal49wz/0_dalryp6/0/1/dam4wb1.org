To be fair, though, people forget that some love potions aren't very strong in their effect. For all we know, the kind of love potion she brewed might have caused the one dosed with it to see the brewer as if they were prettied up with some well-applied make-up.

The issue, of course, lies in the fact that we've seen a character dose another character with no real consequences (the Romilda incident), and we have no idea whatsoever what kind of love potion Molly is talking about so people assume and those who want to put the character in a bad light assume the worst possibilities because that helps their case.

Not everyone creates straw-men. But some people do, for whatever bizarre reason, feel strongly enough that they need to bash. I do not get it emotionally, but I can at least pretend to understand their train of thoughts.
