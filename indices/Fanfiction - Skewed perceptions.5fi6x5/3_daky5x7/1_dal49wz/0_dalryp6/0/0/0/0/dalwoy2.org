  using it at all? It could very well have been for Potions class, or merely to see who she finds most attractive

Sure. What's your point? It could also have been her raping and enslaving Arthur and telling it in a fun/innocent way for children. The only way we know for sure that this is not what she is supposed to be is from a meta-perspective (JKR surely wouldn't want Harry's surrogate mother to be a rapist).

When looking at the text there is actually very little characterizing scenes for her... mostly stuff like bustling around the household and shouting after her children - reinforcing her archetype. Because that's what Molly essentially is, a character archetype and we immediately put her into that "motherly" slot when reading and we drive our assumptions from that baseline. Really doesn't tell us anything about whether she's a good person or not (even the worst people on earth usually loved [their] children). The potion line isn't the only incident where Molly might have stepped out of line and fanfiction authors like to extrapolate from that.
