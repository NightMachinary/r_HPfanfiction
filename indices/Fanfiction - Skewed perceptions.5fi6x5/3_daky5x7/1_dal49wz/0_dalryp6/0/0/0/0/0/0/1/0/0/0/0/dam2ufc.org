  I've always seen this more as posturing than anything else.

She does plenty more to prevent Harry's and her kids' involvement in the war. She desperately tries to keep Harry, Ron and Hermione apart in DH so as to prevent them from making up plans and leaving, for instance.

#+begin_quote
  For that matter I can't see her being so cozy with Dumbledore if Harry were a huge priority.
#+end_quote

Why? Molly had no knowledge that Dumbledore had marked Harry as a sacrifice. To all visible signs, Dumbledore himself was trying to minimise Harry's role in the war until the end of OotP. When Molly learns in DH that Dumbledore had left him with the Horcrux mission, she opposes it fiercely and tells Harry than someone else from the order could do it instead.

#+begin_quote
  Is there even a scene between Molly or Harry where she asks him how she can help him instead of ordering him around?
#+end_quote

Not explicitly, no. But neither does anyone else. There are certainly many scenes where she shows to care for Harry - the previously quoted GoF scene, meeting with Dumbledore to have Harry stay at the Burrow, gifting him her dead brother's watch on Harry's seventeenth birthday. In contrast, there's /one/ scene where she tries "ordering him around".

*shrugs* You seem determined to hate Molly. You hate her for trying to impose her opinion on Harry, and you hate her not imposing her opinion on Harry strongly enough to keep him out of the war. This is disregarding the fact that the only time she tries to impose her view on Harry is when she wants him uninvolved in the war. You hate her because you think her flaws are not meant to be seen as flaws, which is blatantly incorrect. You hate her because she is close to Dumbledore, because you think she shouldn't be close to Dumbledore for reasons I cannot understand. You (presumably) do not hate other characters, despite them being close to Dumbledore /and/ supporting Harry's involvement in the war (Sirius, Remus) or being just as bad in imposing their opinions as Molly (Hermione, and she's 17 by the end. Not a child. And many of her flaws are infact, not seen as flaws). You do not seem to be particularly well versed in canon, and often use fanfiction to defend your stance on canon. Your views are bizarre and hypocritical to me, and while I do not grudge you your opinion, I cannot respect it either. This is all I can say in the time I can afford for now.
