  When she completely oversteps any lines of normal social conduct (like in Grimmauld place) we are just supposed to accept it

Really? Go back and read the scene in OotP. No one supports Molly. Not Sirius, nor Remus, not even Arthur. She doesn't get her way and Harry sits in the war council thing. She's clearly meant to be seen in the wrong in the feud with Fleur, given that she ultimately changes her mind. She is meant to be seen as wrong when she is against Fred and George's joke shop - given how successful they are. I've no idea where you're getting this "supposed to accept it" from. They're shown to be flaws far, far more often in Molly's case than Hermione's, who almost always ends up in the right on a technicality.

  I know for a fact that any real parent who puts the welfare of their child first would get Harry the fuck out of Britain at some point no matter the cost/consequences.

This is ironic because this is pretty much what Molly wanted. She did her best to prevent Harry from getting involved in the war as much as she could - but everyone, including Harry himself, opposed her fiercely. If it were up to Molly she would've put Harry and her kids under a fidelius until the war was over.

Also, the Molly and Hermione comparison: Molly is perfectly within her rights to oversee her kids' involvement in the war, because they're her kids (this includes Harry). Parents always have rights on their kids, at least until they come of age.
