  It makes me incredibly angry that this woman - who interacts with Harry a few weeks per year - dares to tell his friends, who faced live and death situations with him, how to properly take care of him,

Alternatively, this woman - who Harry views as his mother figure and she views as his surrogate son - takes responsibility for him and presumes to know what is best for him.

  “It wasn't your fault. Harry,” Mrs. Weasley whispered.

  “I told him to take the cup with me,” said Harry.

  Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look away. Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. *He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother.* The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her.

Because Hermione doesn't presume what's best for others just as much, if not more so, than Molly?
