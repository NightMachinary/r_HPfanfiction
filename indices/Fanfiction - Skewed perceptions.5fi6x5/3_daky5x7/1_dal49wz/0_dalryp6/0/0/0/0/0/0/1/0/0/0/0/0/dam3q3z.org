  Why? Molly had no knowledge that Dumbledore had marked Harry as a sacrifice.
#+end_quote

Uhm she doesn't need to know that though. Dumbledore is the Headmaster of Hogwarts and Harry has brushes with death multiple times a year... Maybe it's an age thing, I don't yet have children, but if my child would go to the school of that guy I'd have a hard time being civil around him. Not to mention he's also the person responsible for letting Harry starve at the Dursleys (for the sake of argument I'll accept that the Dursley Household is the safest place for Harry... doesn't mean he has to live like a house elf with bars around his window and a cat flap for food. There's a million things that a great wizard like Dumbledore could have done to improve his living conditions).

  she opposes it fiercely and tells Harry than someone else from the order could do it instead.

More posturing.

  /shrugs/ You seem determined to hate Molly.
#+end_quote

That's the thing... I don't hate her. I get into the same argument with people who say I hate Ron. I'm just not very fond of her - and yes - there's a big difference. Lucius Malfoy or Pettigrew are people worthy of hate, Molly Weasly is quite far away from that...

  You do not seem to be particularly well versed in canon, and often use fanfiction to defend your stance on canon
#+end_quote

Have another scene directly from canon then:

#+begin_quote
  “Beds empty! No note! Car gone --- could have crashed --- out of my mind with worry --- did you care? --- never, as long as I've lived --- you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy ---”

  “Perfect Percy,” muttered Fred.

  “YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK!” yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. “You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job ---”

  It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.
#+end_quote

This is from Book 2... Fred, George and Ron have just rescued Harry from *being starved* behind bars (some people seem to have desensitized over the years about the incredible abuse Harry suffers at the Dursleys) and what is Molly's reaction? She wishes they were more like *Percy*! This by the way is one of the reasons why people actually like the twins, because they do stuff to help. For Molly it's all about her, she doesn't want to worry, she wants to hug Harry to ensure herself that he is fine, she wants to order everyone around because it makes her safe and secure.

Her posturing becomes even more blatantly obvious later:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't blame you, dear,” she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. “Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really” (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), “flying an illegal car halfway across the country --- anyone could have seen you ---”
#+end_quote

Isn't that convenient? Not for a second do I buy this crap. She would have done nothing. That's why Ron, Fred and George did it in secret... if they had asked her she'd have said something like "Oh don't worry, I'm sure he's fine, after all Dumbledore told me...". *At best* she would have flooed Dumbledore to ask about Harry.
