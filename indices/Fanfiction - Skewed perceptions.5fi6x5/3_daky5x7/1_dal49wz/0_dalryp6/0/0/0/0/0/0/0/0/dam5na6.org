Props for responding to this... the discussion has kinda become a convoluted mess ;)

  but I do know enough people who are just as flawed as Molly's character, if not even more so, and yet they are good people.

I can't disagree with that. It seems to me like we shouldn't be limiting ourselves to an "emotional range of a teaspoon", where there is just enough room for either loving or hating someone. I said it before somewhere in here: I don't particularly like Molly, but that doesn't mean that I hate her. IMHO there's a very simple explanation that I don't particularly like most of the adults in Harry Potter: The protagonists in those books are all children. If the adults were competent there wouldn't be anything for them to do... so JKR had to contrive all kinds of reasons to make adults useless or worse hindrances.

That's why I have a big problem with fics who try to make the adults more competent/likeable but remain Harry Potter centric. I've recently been trying to read "Home" and Harry is just a useless child most of the time who messes with shit that he doesn't understand. Yes, this is realistic, but why do I want to read a story about a child bumbling around and screwing up all the perfect plans of the adults?
