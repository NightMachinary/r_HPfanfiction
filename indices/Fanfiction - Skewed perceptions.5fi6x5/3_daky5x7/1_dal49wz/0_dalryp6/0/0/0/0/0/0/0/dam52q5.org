I'd say it all boils down to the fact that people aren't perfect. She has her flaws, sure, but that's the case for every person ever. Admittedly the fact that Madame Rowling plays a lot of characters as plot devices or archetypes does make it a bit harder for some people to see them as just human flaws rather than something ... different, but I do know enough people who are just as flawed as Molly's character, if not even more so, and yet they /are/ good people.
