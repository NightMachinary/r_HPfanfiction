  Go back and read the scene in OotP.

I'll do that. Maybe I'm projecting because of the more fervorous of Molly apologists.

  This is ironic because this is pretty much what Molly wanted. She did her best to prevent Harry from getting involved in the war as much as she could - but everyone, including Harry himself, opposed her fiercely. If it were up to Molly she would've put Harry and her kids under a fidelius until the war was over.

I've always seen this more as posturing than anything else. Harry sitting in the war council and being more informed certainly doesn't put him into more danger than he already is. For that matter I can't see her being so cozy with Dumbledore if Harry were a huge priority. I think there's a reason why there's so many fics with Harry having a parent and that parent yelling at Dumbledore... even if that Dumbledore in the fic is wizard-Jesus otherwise. Just putting on all the bells and whistles isn't anywhere close to enough ("Think of the children!!!"). Serious question: Is there even a scene between Molly or Harry where she asks him how she can help him instead of ordering him around? Like, an actual conversation that someone trying to take care of an orphan would have? Like... instead of "You need to eat some more child"... "Hey, weird, why do you always seem so scrawny after summer break. Maybe we can smuggle some food to the Dursleys for you? What do you need? How can I help?"
