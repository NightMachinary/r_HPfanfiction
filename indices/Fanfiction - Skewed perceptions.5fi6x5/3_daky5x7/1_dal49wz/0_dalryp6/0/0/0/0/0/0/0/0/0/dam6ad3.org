Thanks. I like to think that I try.

Going to the reply proper, yeah, the treatment of most adults in the series is weird. and ... not really good. I'd say it stems from the fact that it all begun as a fairy tale with children and for children and when it became darker and more adult Madame Rowling did not want to take the focus from the characters it all by that point was about, which made some things really weird; I'm just guessing, though.

In fact, it's probably the same reason as the one for why Tom is just sitting around and doing nothing and being incompetent. He should have recruited some first-year slytherins.

And I agree about the “emotional range of a teaspoon” comment. I'm really unsure why some people can only love or hate characters, it seems ... simple-minded.
