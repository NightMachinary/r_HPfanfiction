You're right, that "worst case" interpretation is certainly too much, but there are shades of grey. Even if the comment on love potions was completely innocent, I don't think it should be treated as a joke in front of children.

I'm not saying Molly is literally Hitler (though I get some enjoyment from fics painting her in such a light - mother hens like her have annoyed me since childhood), but there's more than enough material in the books to look at her in a not so favourable light... simply denying that, because she is "supposed" to be good and amzing is exactly what I'm talking about.

I can literally pick a random scene (just searched for Molly in GoF):

  “Harry! Oh Harry!”

  She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.

  “Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,” he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, “you may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.”

  Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear? He needs quiet!”

Urgz. Horrible, presumptive... no wonder that all her children can't seem to wait to get away from her. It makes me incredibly angry that this woman - who interacts with Harry a few weeks per year - dares to tell his friends, who faced live and death situations with him, how to properly take care of him, while just a few seconds earlier almost assaulting someone who just had a traumatic experience. That's consistently her modus operandi: Barging into a situation and presuming to know what is best. If I were Hermione I'd be unable to contain my rage (and seriously reconsider having Ron as a romantic interest on the basis of having her as a mother in law alone).
