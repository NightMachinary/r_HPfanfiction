  Really doesn't tell us anything about whether she's a good person or not (even the worst people on earth usually loved [their] children).

Molly loves more than just her children. She took care of Harry because he was an orphan, when she'd nothing to gain from it. She demonstrates care for Remus and Tonks when they were struggling with their feelings.

There are plenty of characterizing scenes for Molly. Infact, very few other characters have complex dynamics with as many characters as Molly does - Molly/Harry, Molly/Sirius and Molly/Fleur are three of the best relationship dynamics there are. She takes her archetype and completely owns it, and the Molly/Fleur feud is about Molly learning to grow out of faults traditionally associated with her archetype (hasty judgement of foreigners with foreign traditions). As is Molly killing Bellatrix, which breaks through the passivity traditionally associated with homemakers.

  It could also have been her raping and enslaving Arthur and telling it in a fun/innocent way for children.

No, it couldn't. Even without the fact that it goes against her entire characterisation, Arthur's been shown to disagree with Molly on multiple occasions, so it's trivially false.
