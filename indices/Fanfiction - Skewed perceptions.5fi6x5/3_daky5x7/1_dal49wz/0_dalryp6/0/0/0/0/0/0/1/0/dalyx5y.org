  Because Hermione doesn't presume what's best for others just as much, if not more so, than Molly?

Of course. Hermione is *a child* (for most of the series). Even worse: She's a single child who barely got to socialize with other children her age before Hogwarts. Her overcoming these character flaws is a major part of her character arc and they are acknowledged as /flaws/ every time they come up.

Molly on the other hand is a grown woman with 7 children. When she completely oversteps any lines of normal social conduct (like in Grimmauld place) we are just supposed to accept it, because she's motherly or something like that and that's that. I dare say if Rowling had allowed other characters to confront Molly, Dumbledore or others that are often bashed and allowed them to voice such concerns we'd see less of that in Fanfiction. Basically the whole genre of "independent" Harry fics is born from the idea that if Harry doesn't do it himself, no-one will. Honestly, even in the most-flattering interpretation of Dumbledore it is ridiculous that he takes on a Guardian role for Harry while also being the de-facto leader of a War in which Harry is one of the most important chess pieces. Even a three year old should see the obvious conflict of interest. Is Molly bothered by this? Or is she just virtue-signaling "children shouldn't be involved in a war!" while secretly being happy that the-boy-who-lived is going to save them all? I know for a fact that any *real* parent who puts the welfare of their child first would get Harry the fuck out of Britain at some point no matter the cost/consequences.
