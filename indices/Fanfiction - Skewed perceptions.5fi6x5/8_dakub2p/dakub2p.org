Hrm, I'm a bit half and half with this. I feel more like FanFiction has expanded my perceptions, rather than changing them. Which has actually made reading the canon books more enjoyable for me. The Dark Lord is a perfect example. When just reading the canon books, the Dark Lord is a very one sided character. He is pure evil, a murdering madman that tortures his followers and kills babies. Yes, they show a bit of his back story in HBP, the orphanage and whatnot. But really, you never see his motivations, what made him into the monster he became. But FanFiction has done so much with him that has made the Dark Lord into a truly sympathetic villain for me. I've read about a confused boy that grew up with powers he couldn't explain, picked on and unwanted until he found a way to make the bullies fear him. Constantly forced to hide what he can do for fear of ending up in an asylum for the mentally deranged, dealing with the ongoing muggle war and all the fears that came with that, his childhood was frankly miserable. Then Dumbledore shows up and he thinks that his world is going to change for the better, only to be disappointed once again. He goes to Hogwarts as an orphan mudblood Slytherin, the beggar surrounded by the elite. Sorry, that started to become a rant. My point is that FanFiction has flushed out some of the more one dimensional character, but for me, it hasn't changed how I view those character (in most senses) but more answered a lot of the "why"s.

There is one thing that has completely changed for me because of FanFiction. Several of the character's sexualities. It is my absolute headcanon that Harry is a closet gay man that stayed with Ginny for the kids. There are a few others that I had put in the "straight" box growing up that have changed to gay or bi in my head. Admittedly, my mom was a bit of a homophobe, so it wasn't something we talked about.
