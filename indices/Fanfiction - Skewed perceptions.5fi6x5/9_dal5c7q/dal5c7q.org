I have been reading fanfiction for 12 years also and think my perception of characters is still true to canon. I love the characters JKR intended and dislike the ones that weren't intended to be liked. I pity pettigrew and love dumbledore as a manipulative yet grandfatherly character who sometimes gets ahead of himself. I love the Weasleys, including Ginny, even though I read Harry/Draco as a guilty pleasure. I don't even like Draco as a standalone character but I like slash and he's popular there lol
