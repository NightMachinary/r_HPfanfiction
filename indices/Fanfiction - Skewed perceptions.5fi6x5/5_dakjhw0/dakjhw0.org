Oh, I'm definitely skewed. The gap between GoF and OttP led me to reading a ton of fanfiction. And when I read OttP I realised I enjoyed some of those fanfics a lot more than the fifth book.

JK's statement that Sirius died because "Harry doing things alone is more interesting" just put the nail in the coffin.

For me, definite canon is books 1-4, maybe book 5. HBP and DH only offer gimmicks (horcruxes, hallows, spells, new people). Characterization and character development I ignore completely on the last two books.

*EDIT*: A rebuttal in Rowling's favor.

We talk about enjoying FF more than the last books - without perhaps considering that JK also read a lot of it. I know I would never be able to resist reading stuff based on my work.

My hypothesis is that, after reading so much of it, JK had a minor existential crisis - perhaps a lot of the ideas she was considering had already been written and fleshed out (a few even in excellent quality). I think, fueled somewhat by panic, she decided it was mandatory to put out content that no fanfic writer had thought of - and that's why the later books sometimes feel as if they came out of nowhere.
