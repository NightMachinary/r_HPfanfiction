  My hypothesis is that, after reading so much of it, JK had a minor existential crisis - perhaps a lot of the ideas she was considering had already been written and fleshed out (a few even in excellent quality).

My hypothesis is that by the fourth book the series had become so popular that her publishers cared more about getting the book out than they cared about getting a good book. It is obvious just from the size of the books that the latter half of the series was sparingly edited. Horcruxes and hallows had been built into the story from the beginning, and I think they would work well if the rest of the book were reduced by half.
