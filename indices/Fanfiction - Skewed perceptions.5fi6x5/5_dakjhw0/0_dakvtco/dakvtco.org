  Characterization and character development I ignore completely on the last two books.
#+end_quote

Pretty much the entirety of character development in the series comes from the last 2-3 books. Of the six main characters in the series (Harry, Hermione, Ron, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape), 4 of them (the last four) owe at least 80% of their development to the last two books. The next most important character, Draco, owes 100% of his development to book 6. Slughorn is 100% book 6-7. Fleur was nothing more than a stereotype before book 6. 70% of Sirius is from book 5. Neville, Ginny, Luna, Molly, Bellatrix, Umbridge, Petunia, Fred/George, Kreacher are from the last 3, heavily leaning last two in Molly's case. Hell, most of Harry is book 5-7.

What characterisation for you is "definite canon"? Because I'm seeing almost none of it. Most characters were caricatures before then.
