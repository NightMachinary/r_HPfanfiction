I'm with you, I have not read the canon in years (I find the info for my fic either on Pottermore / wiki). And I think my idea of head-canon got warped with the amount of fanfiction I read. (I genuinely thought Severus Snape was Draco's godfather, even though it makes no sense, and Dorea and Charlus Potter will always be Harry's grandparents in my head)

I think, with the amount of writers and tropes out there, it is impossible for anyone to remain with the starting ideas of characters, if only because some of them were HIGHLY archetyped and they are not plausible.\\
In fact, the Dursleys appears to me as nicer in cannon after the fest of ExtremeAbuse!Dursleys I stumbled into.\\
Also, the fanfictions have read spend more time elaborating on groups or characters (ministry, Death Eaters, Malfoy Family, Snape, Slytherins in general) that, as they are depicted from the biased Hero Standpoint, appear with seemingly no redeeming point or other reason than "being bad" to act as they do. Can I still hate them with a fierce passion? Oh yess. Do I still believe that Slytherin house is full of bigoted bully? No.

But it is not about being more knowledgeable, since you base your perception on a non-existing canon. Fanon cannot justify acts or psyche. It may give you idea on how to construct your characters in your own fiction, but the fact remains that canon is the only source that can make someone more "knowledgeable."
