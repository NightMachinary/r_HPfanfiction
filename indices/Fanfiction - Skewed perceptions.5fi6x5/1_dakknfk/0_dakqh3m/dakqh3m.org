I have a different perspective on some of these.

- Greater Good Dumbledore: he rejected the philosophy, yes, but we still very much have Chessmaster!Dumbledore. His whole plan in HBP and DH shows that. It's just that he now considers the consequences of his actions to others (even though he still makes mistakes).

- Pacifist Dumbledore: I've come to the conclusion that this is actually "pacifist" JKR. Note that Molly killing Bellatrix is the only time in the books where a good character is confirmed to kill an evil character (well, besides Nagini), despite ample opportunities and motivation in a real war. I suspect JKR didn't want her teen protagonists killing people in a YA series.

- Bad Ron: I agree that Ron is a good guy, but immature, while Hermione is definitely the most vindictive of the Trio, something I've tried to play up in my fics. However, I think the biggest reason people hate Ron is when he leaves Harry and Hermione in DH. When I reread the books, even I was surprised by how much it hurt when he left. It's really easy to hate him then, even if you normally don't.
