Yes. But that was mostly triggered by the locket Horcrux. Ron regretted just minutes after leaving.

First of all, it was Harry's INSANE INSPIRATION to wear a Horcrux around their necks. What was he thinking?! He had as much to blame for Ron's leaving as Ron himself, IMO. Why the other two didn't object to that insanity was also beyond me.
