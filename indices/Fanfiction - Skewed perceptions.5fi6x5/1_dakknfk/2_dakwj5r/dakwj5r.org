I'm going through a bit of a crisis because... your first and third points I agree with and yet I've always considered you my friendly Dumbledore adversary. Are you telling me.... we agree on some things?!?!?

(as for your second point, I'm not sure what that means)

edit: okay, I get what you mean by stunners-only Dumbledore. I actually do think he is a stunners-only type of guy. Or at least, if there is any other option besides killing, then to do that before even considering taking a list. I think that is his entire philosophy on life and magical existence, to be perfectly honest with you. So we can happily resume our fundamental disagreements on Dumbledore again! The world has balanced itself!!

edit 2: Wait, are you saying he's a pacifist or isn't?
