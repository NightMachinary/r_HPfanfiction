  Wait, are you saying he's a pacifist or isn't?

No conclusive evidence in canon.

I agree with [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] that JKR is a pacifist or she just didn't want to get too realistic about wars in an YA story. Fighting a war against the likes of Death Eaters would be just as rough as fighting against Nazis or ISIS. I can perfectly understand her motivation, but as an adult reader, I'm not satisfied. That's why I enjoy fanfics such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] and [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] far more than canon Books.

The Dumbledore in both fics truly lived up to his reputation as a vanquisher of Grindelwald.
