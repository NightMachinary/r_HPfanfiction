I definitely agree with the first part, and I think it goes beyond it being a YA novel, and I realize it probably makes it worse in your book, but that's what I think is canon, not what I think is the most enjoyable thing to read. Basically, I don't think Dumbledore is killing people unbeknownst to Harry. I do think Dumbledore can be.... a difficult enemy however (whatever he did to Kreacher to get him to talk is probably the tip of the iceburg), but wouldn't /kill/. And my reasoning for that is less to do about young readers and more to do with my belief that magic and death are intertwined in this series and understanding death is necessary to understand the sort of magic involved between Harry and Voldemort and someone with that understanding would not be so willy nilly with ending lives, even, and perhaps especially, his enemies. Again, I understand if that sounds childish and/or making the world seem too perfect, and you're probably right, but that is what I see in the canon.

I don't, however, think this particular type of magic matters with the Order vs Death Eaters, only between Voldemort vs Harry, and have always considered the Order's purpose to be the army that needs to be willing to kill - like Lupin says after escaping Privet Drive. I assume he and many of his fellow Order members (maybe excluding the Weasleys) did kill, or at least were perfectly ready to.

I know you tend to think ending your enemy's life is always the best course of action (I think you've said that anyway, correct me if I'm wrong), but I don't think it's /always/ strategically useful, and Dumbledore staying his hand is often just as much about strategy as it is about pacifism.

Basically, I think Dumbledore's pacifism is just one contributing factor to his avoidance of killing.

edit: okay, I know I'm rambling, but I mean - I think he is aware and approves of what his Order needs to do to win, and he would do it to if he weren't so bleeding powerful, meaning he doesn't need to kill in order to over-power his enemies. If he did resort to killing, he would know, in his heart, that it was avoidable, meaning /he/ would know he did it because he wanted to, and not because it was necessary.
