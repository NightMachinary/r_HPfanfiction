I'm often astonished how common it is to cherry-pick Ron's mistakes, and not his great scenes. The boy risked his life for his friends more than once, and yet people call him a hindrance, a lead weight, and such. Contrarily, Neville gets lauded, even though he had about one good scene at the very end of the books.
