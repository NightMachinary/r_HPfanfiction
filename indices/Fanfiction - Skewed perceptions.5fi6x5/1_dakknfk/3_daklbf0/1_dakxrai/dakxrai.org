I think a lot of fanfic authors forget what 11-12 year olds are capable of, emotionally. That is an age where you can expect some level of self-awareness and empathy. At 12 Hermione was plenty old enough to realise that her constant showing off was not earning her any friends. These aren't kindergarteners, but pre-teens who should have had some basis of social skills built up by now.
