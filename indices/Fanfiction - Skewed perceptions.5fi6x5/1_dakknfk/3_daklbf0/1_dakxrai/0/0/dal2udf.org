Still, Hermione is usually portrayed as being the victim in that example, when it was just people reacting negatively to someone who was quite honestly an unlikable person. You can't blame Ron for venting over her attitude a bit. (and remember Harry also disliked her at that point but was a just bit more diplomatic about it)

Not saying she deserved to be attacked by a troll, and I can see why she'd be upset by their comments. What I mean though is she was plenty old enough to know to temper a few of her more abrasive traits if people liking her was a big deal. By that age, most kids know better.

If you want people to like you, you need to be a likeable person. Hermione was not a likeable person at that phase. Ron for all his faults was at least personable at times.

To be fair, both Ron and Hermione were some of my least favorite characters. Both of them are so riddled with personality traits that I downright loathe in people. Hermione even after all her character development is still a nag, and Ron for all his desire to stand out is too much of a passive follower. I don't like stories where they're bashed, but I also dislike how their fans tend to sanctify both of them.
