  I can see Hermione as being annoying now but when I first read the books I definitely thought the dislike was undeserved.

It goes both ways, though. If you think about it, really think, then what Ron said wasn't really that much of a deal. It was, if I remember correctly, “she's a nightmare, really, it's no wonder she doesn't have any friends”; not the most polite thing to say, but he isn't insulting her or anything but simply commenting on the truth.

And really, any person with the ability to read the intent can tell you that Hermione was not trying to /help/ others, but to show off the fact that she can do stuff. That's the kind of thing you do with someone who already is your friend, not to random people whose reactions you do not know. If Hermione didn't know that by then then either she was very sheltered or the kids she'd been interacting with were seething inside but did not do anything because their parents told them not to reject Hermione for whatever reason (likely because of her parents, though this very idea is unlikely to be true).
