Getting bullied or being disliked for nerdiness is definitely something I can see fanfiction authors relating to. It can be hard to see how Hermione was unlikeable when it seems like all she did was be a very involved student who didn't want to break rules and even helped her classmates learn! So authors stand up for her. And I think at 12 you definitely don't know how to temper yourself. I think middle school is the most awkward and regrettable time of most people's lives .. or is that just me? I can see Hermione as being annoying now but when I first read the books I definitely thought the dislike was undeserved.
