Maybe I was an unusually mature 12 year old? I don't know. I got bullied and I learned to not do the things that resulted in me getting picked on. I learned to project my /likeable/ personality traits and tried to connect with my peers on common ground.

And the way the books and movies portrayed it (particularly the movies) she didn't want to help her classmates learn, she was an insufferable know-it-all who was just showing off (Snape probably shouldn't have told her in that manner, but he was spot-on). It's not that she was smart, it was her constant /need/ to show everyone else that she was smart that made her unlikeable.

No one disliked her for being smart and reading her textbooks. They disliked her because she felt that she had to constantly rub their noses in it.
