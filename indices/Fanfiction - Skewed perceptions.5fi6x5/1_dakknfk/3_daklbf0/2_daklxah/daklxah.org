Kids are kids. My problem with Ron concerns him after the first few books. He never progresses as a character. I picture him as a hindrance for the most part. Supportive best friend was his one supposed "role" but to me he failed even at that in books 4 and 7. I do however really enjoy Neville as a character and wish he had been built up earlier in the books. Hermione definitely had a her pushy, bossy moments as well.
