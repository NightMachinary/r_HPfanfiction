Actually, he does. It's just that many of the darker things introduced later and shown to the readers do hit his weakest points. The 11-year-old Ron wouldn't have gone with Harry and Hermione for their camping trip, for example. And as for “failing” at his “role”, sure, but those were things with extenuating circumstances; Ron's deepest desire is to be /acknowledged/ by those around him as someone who isn't just a part of the background and for something that would be of his own making, which does not excuse his jealousy in book 4 but does actually justify his behaviour; likewise, the visions presented to him by the horcrux also make sense---by then, much of what he accomplished ties with Harry and Hermione, so if they were to live and denounce him he'd again be left with nothing---and he would have been right back had it not been for the snatchers.

The movies do him a great disservice by skipping around the issue of /that/ being his particular problem and by giving some of his better moments to Hermione. The perception of him as an utter failure of a human being is something that a lot of people carried from the movies and placed in fanfics, leading to the self-perpetuation of such an image of Ron. Is he immature? Sure, he is, he is just a kid after all. But he very much is capable of bettering himself and above all he is not above apologising for being an arse, something that for some bizarre reason many real-life people cannot do.

PS. I do not particularly /like/ Ron, I will add, for reasons related to my upbringing and other stuff, but I do find him at least tolerable and I am defending him here because I see it as what should be done.
