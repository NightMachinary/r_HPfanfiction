It depends what Books you focus on. Ron hasn't done much from Books 4-6, but he accomplished a lot in Book 7:

- Stunned Rudy Lestrange, potentially killing him, in the Flight of 7 Potters
- Prevented the other two from saying Voldemort and triggering Taboo
- Saved Harry from the pond
- Destroyed the locket Horcrux
- Disarmed Bellatrix at Malfoy Manor
- Took great care of Hermione in the aftermath
- Came up with the idea of using Basilisk fangs
- Opened CoS with fake parseltongue
- Saved Harry again in RoR
- Brought down Greyback together with Neville

--------------

BTW, Harry never apologized to Hermione for almost intentionally triggering the Taboo (he knew the Taboo by then and still yelled 'Voldemort' in an argument).
