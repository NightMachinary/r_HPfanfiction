As a character he never seemed to serve a purpose other than introducing Harry to the Weasleys. You could have easily made Hermione a Weasley and written Ron out entirely and lost nothing really. I guess the other purpose he served was to be even more thickheaded than harry, but that's not really worth a primary character IMO.
