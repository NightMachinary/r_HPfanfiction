  Some railed about Ron making Hermione cry after the 'Wingadium Leviosa' episode. But if you take an objective view, you will notice how arrogant and tactless Hermione behaved toward Ron.

I always imagined that as one hell of an overreaction. Hermione heard Ron make that statement right after charms, so roughly 2:15 in the afternoon. Regular dinner schedule is from 6-8, and I will assume the Halloween feast fell in that timeframe. So Hermione was in that bathroom crying for somewhere between 4-5 hours because some kid she didn't even like pointed out that she didn't have friends because of her habit of rubbing her accomplishments in others' faces.

Crying is freaking exhausting. At the very least she should have been dehydrated after all that.
