The first one is reeeeeeeeally reaching. Most people make harmless generalisations like this. Hermione herself has let out an exasperated "boys!" on multiple occasions.

You're leaving out the context in the third one. Skeeter's article accused Hermione of using /Love Potions/ to seduce multiple men. "Scarlet woman" seems a fine, if crude description.

The second one, yes, does not speak well of Ron. But do note that Ron's issue with Ginny dating is because his younger sibling has a love life and he doesn't, which adds to his "overshadowed by siblings" story. So while the way he frames it does sound sexist (and is rightfully slapped down for it), his thought process isn't. Also note (for additional context) that Harry also inwardly supports Ron's statement, but for an entirely different reason.
