Love potions might not be, but their usage, especially when it is either a prolonged usage on a single target or usage on a lot of targets over a short period of time, could be and I think likely is.

Dosing someone with a single dose of a love potion and that's it seems like a fairly pushy version of a love letter. Dosing a lot of people can imply ... things, and so can dosing someone for a long time. That's the context with the love potions; they might not be bad, it's how their usage in a particular case is seen that matters.
