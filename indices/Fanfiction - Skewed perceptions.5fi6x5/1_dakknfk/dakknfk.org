I'm sure these are fanfic creations:

- 'Greater Good' Dumbledore: he only believed in it until Ariana was killed.

- Pacifist, stunners only Dumbledore: at least there is no conclusive evidence of that in canon.

- Prophecy believing Dumbledore: he repeatedly explained to Harry in Book 6 that prophecy was a self-fulfilling thing.

- Purebloods were villains: in fact, the three biggest jerks in the Series were all half-bloods (Tom, Snape, Umbridge). Large portion, if not majority, of Voldemort's rank and file were half-bloods. The DA, ironically, had more than 50% purebloods which was quite higher than their demographic representation in magical Britain implied by JKR (30%). The Order also seemed to be pureblood heavy.

- Magical Britain was a patriarchal society: not true, they had female Minister as early as 1717. Magic was also the great power equalizer. They still had to take care of children though, which was perhaps the main reason why many stayed at home. But that didn't mean they would defer to their men, Narcissa and Molly definitely showed how much influence they wielded in their households.

- Ron was abusive: he complained more, but Hermione was definitely the far more violent one when upset. Some railed about Ron making Hermione cry after the 'Wingadium Leviosa' episode. But if you take an objective view, you will notice how arrogant and tactless Hermione behaved toward Ron. Afterwards, Ron only lashed out with bitter truth, which Hermione knew was true, or else she would have hexed him.
