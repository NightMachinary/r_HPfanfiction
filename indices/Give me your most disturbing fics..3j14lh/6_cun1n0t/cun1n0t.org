  Pairing: Snape/Voldemort, Snape/Tree

  Summary: A brief history of a damaged man. Part of the Severus Snape Fuh-Q Fest. Written in response to Tricky Pairing 57: Whomping Willow.

  Notes: Darkfic, slash, violence, S/M and adult themes. This is a version of Snape that's a little more damaged than usual. Thanks to Bernice for beta, much appreciated.
