  You see, all it takes is a bit of sacrifice. A little tit for tat. A bit of a 'you-help-me-and-I-help-you' sort of thing. And death isn't so difficult to conquer, after all.

Lovely prose which works well to add a layer of darkness and grit to this story. The narration is so despairing and grim; it's a lovely mix of melancholic and creepy.
