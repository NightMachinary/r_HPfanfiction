Huh. It is mostly positive, isn't it? The impact of technology and the effect of pre-Hogwarts muggle schools are often used in 'muggle-wank' stories. And if I had a nickel for every time I read that a pureblood (Draco, insertSlytherinloveinterest, Neville, the odd Weasley...) is shocked speechless by a cinema or an amusement park.

As far as criticizing goes... Mad_Fairy's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447?hide_banner=true][Mischief's Heir series]] does a whole bit around halfway through about muggle's ruining the environment and having to charm the pollutants out of their system and clean up landfills while it becomes harder to hide.
