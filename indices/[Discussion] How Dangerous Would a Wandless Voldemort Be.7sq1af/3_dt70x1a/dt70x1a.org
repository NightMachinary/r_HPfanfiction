Well, considering he only dies in the books because of Rowling's weird-ass Wand Lore system, then... immortal?

But not counting that, it'd be almost functionally identical. The only way you separate Voldemort from his wand is with a disarming spell, and if you can hit him with that you can hit him with anything else (i.e. you can't and won't)
