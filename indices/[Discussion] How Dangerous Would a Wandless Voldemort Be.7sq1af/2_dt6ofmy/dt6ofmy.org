I think what he did as a child could be a compulsion charm instead of the Imperio same goes for a pain curses instead of a full blown Crucio.

I am sure he can blow stuff up and move things around. Wandless Mindarts like Legilimency is within his power aswell. I always immagined him strong enough to swat away weak spells with a wave of his hand but that could be too strong.\\
I would rule out comlicated spells like the Killing Curse entirely and most other Dark Arts too.
