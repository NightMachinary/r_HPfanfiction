True... though I feel that "wandless magic" can mean two different things --- there's the "controlled magic", /Force/-style, that gifted children like Lily and Riddle could do; and then there's actual spellcasting done without a wand, which is what these African and North American groups seem to be using. The latter is what you're referring to and would indeed take hand gestures and incantations and stuff, the former seems to only take willpower and practice.
