Well...who knows? Wandless magic doesn't appear enough in canon to make an accurate assessment of how strong it is compared to regular magic.

Based on that Tom could control his magic as a child and that house-elves can effectively use magic without a wand, and that the wiki mentions African/North American groups using wandless magic, it presumably has SOME functionality.

Personally, I'd say...a wandless Voldemort would actually be stronger, but not as fast. For most spells beyond simple charms on objects, he'd have to gesture, sing, dance, make ninja-style hand signs, scream as he charges up an attack, et-cetera. Whereas with a wand he can shoot lasers to do things, which might not match his maximum strength, but would be a lot faster. Does that make sense?
