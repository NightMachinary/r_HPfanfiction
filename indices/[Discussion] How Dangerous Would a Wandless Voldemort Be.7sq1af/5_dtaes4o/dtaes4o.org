Hard to say, as we don't know much about canon wandless magic. He would hardly be defenseless, I think we can say that much from his use of magic as an untrained child at least. Another thing I would look as is what Dumbledore said to Fudge in OotP, about how he could/would escape Azkaban if Fudge arrested him. In such a situation Dumbledore would certainly be wandless, and while he might have just be posturing, he certainly seemed confident. Voldemort is of course of a similar tier to Dumbledore, so I would assume he would be powerful enough to at least escape azkaban.
