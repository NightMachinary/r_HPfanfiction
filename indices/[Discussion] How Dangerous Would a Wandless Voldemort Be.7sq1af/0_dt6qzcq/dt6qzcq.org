I don't think he was throwing around Imperius and Cruciatus Curses wandlessly as a kid. You would kinda need the incantation for that. It's more likely he just had some innate control of magic that he could manipulate to his will, causing him to perform magic similar to the Imperius or something painful, but not to such a degree as that of the actual curses.
