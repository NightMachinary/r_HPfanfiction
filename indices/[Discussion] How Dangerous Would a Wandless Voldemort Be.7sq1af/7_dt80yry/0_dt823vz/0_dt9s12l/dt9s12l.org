From the fact that almost every spell cast using a wand has some sort of 'effect' to signal its use.

Some people does seem like they can be cast without the lightshow, but not many.

Wandless magic, in my eyes, appears to function like the force. Meaning, pure domination of will.

Accidental magic is seen as the most common sort of wandless magic. That can be either a focused 'attack' against someone or an 'area of effect' kind of thing.

Dudley and the snake is in my eyes an example of an 'attack'. Harry made the glass disappear so Dudley would fall through.

Marge managed to get Harry angry enough to make the lights flicker. Then became a ballon through an 'attack'.

This is just random speculation. I don't know if I'm right.
