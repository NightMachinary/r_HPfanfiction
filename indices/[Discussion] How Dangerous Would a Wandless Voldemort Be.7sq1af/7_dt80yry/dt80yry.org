I would deem a wandless Voldemort as dangerous as one with a wand for two reasons.

1) Wandless spells does not seem to travel in 'beam' form over distances. They are just willed into being and then, immediately, affect the intended victim. This would lead into them being impossible to block or parry.

2) Voldemort does not use his wand for a lot of spells in the movies and is doing fine. Sure, many of them are 'party tricks', like spewing fire, making a storm of glass shards or controlling lesser minds. But this is still way more impressive than any other wizard. (I don't know if I should count Albus extinguishing some candles as 'impressive' or not.)
