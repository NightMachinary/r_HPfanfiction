I'm going to take a wild guess and say that Harry would have found the basilisk harder to kill with the fine motor control and great strength of an eleven year old.

I'm also going to guess that the lack of maturation, mental and physical, would really impact Harry's chances of survival in other situations in an adverse manner.
