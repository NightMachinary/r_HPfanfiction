Some things work, others not quite so. Obviously, the main advantage is more story and especially more time between Voldemort's return and his defeat, to make for a lengthier war... but the books are so focused in Harry's age that it would be difficult to adapt.

Laying it out:

THE HARD PART:

​

Book 1 (8yrs): Philosopher Stone plot can work

Book 2 (9yrs): The themes and plot of Chamber mostly work, but that final Basilisk fight does not. It was already a stretch at 12. Would need a new big baddie or move the basilisk and part of the plot to a later year.

Book3 (10 yrs): Could work... maybe some changes here and there but the PoA thing could still be used.

Book4 (11 yrs): Now it is a good time for Voldemorts return, not for being 11, but because we have spent some years with Harry already. However, the plot to get Harry to that graveyard would need real twerking to make it believable.

Book5(12 yrs): This is complex... in one side the Ministry problems have to be immediately after Voldemort returns... but on the other hand, OotP has the teenage Harry character development very much attached to it. It doesn't work on the same level to have an angsty 15yr old than a 12 yr old.

THE EASY PART:

​

Now here is where you take advantage of all the groundwork you already made. You only have to decide on Dumbledore's death, because that is going to set how you lay things out. Either you fresh out the war before his death, with Harry somehow taking part in battles while still attending school and you still kill Dumbledore one book before the end (heading into the Horrcrux hunt with more battles having passed already).... Or you kill Dumbledore earlier and make Harry on the run/Order for more than one year... either could work.
