If you reviewed it, it should be in your review history on FF.net.

I can't think of any story that fits your description fully, but was it maybe one of these two?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3312486/1/Battles-with-Basilisks][Battles with Basilisks]] by SnorkackCatcher, features a Lockhart who is actually as good as he writes he is.

Or possibly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]] (formerly 'Gilding the Son of Lily') by Publicola, an author self-insert as Lockhart but that's not a one-shot.
