This happens in shanastoryteller's fic, survival is a talent, Harry just knocks out the basilisk. In 5th year he returns to the Chamber and befriends her, her name is Theophania and she's basically reptilian Meryl Streep. She likes Luna the best

I also like the idea that Parseltongues are immune to the death stare, but I find it hilarious that this would mean Harry ran around with his eyes closed, tripping over his own feet for no good reason in CoS lol
