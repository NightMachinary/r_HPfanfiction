Maybe? It's hard to say, I've read so many fics between then and now that they start to blur. I am pretty sure, however, that this fic also had a devastating chapter written in one of the Weasley twin's POV and they share one mind but during the chapter one of the twins dies in battle and the other experiences being alone with his thoughts for the first time.
