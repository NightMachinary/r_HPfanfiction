There's not a whole lot of magic in them, until the story gets going a bit. Harry only really uses it if he knows he's in trouble, but he uses his knowledge of future weapons to create some pretty cool things. He's very much like Canon Harry, still has the saving people thing, is incredibly noble, well respected, and a badass General.

If you like Game of Throne and Harry Potter, you'll enjoy them.
