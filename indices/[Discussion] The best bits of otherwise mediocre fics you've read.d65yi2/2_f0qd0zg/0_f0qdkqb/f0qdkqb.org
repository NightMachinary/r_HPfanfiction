I stopped reading it due to my pedantic nerd rage at how they treated Hermione's OWL results.

I don't mind making Hermione smarter in fanfiction (though it is often done poorly, because apparently intelligence is used to justify superiority.) But this author takes her canon results of 10 OWLs and hypes them up to be unheard of.
