Actually, that's interesting to think about. Hermione started off taking all 12 classes, and she had to use a time-turner and it almost killed her. But multiple of Ron's brothers were able to take 12 OWLs. Is Hermione just not as good at school as them? But I would think that Ron would find Hermione less impressive then, since his older brothers were doing even more than she was. Or maybe they didn't take all 12 OWLs their 5th year, maybe did them later as electives or something.

I guess it's probably a mistake that JKR overlooked, as it seems to make Hermione look pretty bad.
