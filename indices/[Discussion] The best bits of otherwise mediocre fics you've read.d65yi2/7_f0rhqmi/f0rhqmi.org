Rune Stone path has by far the best mentor type relationship between Harry and a teacher I've ever read. The entire pureblood culture aspect sucks since its basically just an elaborate justification for a harem and drama, but damn, Babbling is a very good character in that fic because she is not overpowered like so many other mentors in ff.
