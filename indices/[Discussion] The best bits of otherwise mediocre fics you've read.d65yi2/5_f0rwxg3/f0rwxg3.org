Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool has a rather good scene with the Dursleys in interrogation. Hell, the whole fic is awesome. It's a twist on the back in time thing, where Harry accidentally slips sideways into a female version of himself.

He doesn't take kindly to the situation, gets loose, and brews a permanent ageing potion to get away from the Dursleys and the Wizards in general.

A Pink Haired Auror trainee /completely derails/ his plan to abandon the wizarding world. Hilarity Ensues in a Dry Deadpan.
