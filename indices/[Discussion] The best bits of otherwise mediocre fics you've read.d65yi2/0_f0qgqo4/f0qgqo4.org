I read a fic where an OC from our world who'd read the books wound up meeting Snape in a pub in his world and becoming his girlfriend, because he's just so sweet and kind and basically perfect boyfriend material, and also seemed to have completely forgotten about Lily for some reason. Some, possibly all of the fic's humor was intentional, as the OC spoke in a stereotypical American southern dialect full of colorful metaphors, and called Remus “Moonpie.”
