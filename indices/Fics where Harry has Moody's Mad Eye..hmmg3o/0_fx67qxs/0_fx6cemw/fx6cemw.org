There's I'm Still Here, which was mentioned by someone else here, and I feel like I've seen one other fic like that.

I seem to remember that Future!Harry was ridiculously mauled from battle... Peter-ish silver replacement flesh all over him.

But yeah, I haven't seen any that feature him actually using the eye.
