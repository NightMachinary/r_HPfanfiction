If you've ever watched the Hobbit movies, then think along the lines of Gandalf vs the Necromancer. If you haven't, look it up. We all respect and love Gandalf but he gets his butt handed to him by the Necromancer. Show impressive magic on both sides but Voldemort should be able to show the most powerful magic.

Also look up Galadriel vs Necromancer if you want the ultimate bad@ss showdown between two people who are extremely powerful.
