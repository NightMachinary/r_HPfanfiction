In canon they both have a lot of power, but Dumbledore has a lot of research credits to his name while Voldemort traveled widely in search of Dark Arts rituals and magic. I'd build from that and show Dumbledore as having deep knowledge of certain topics (transfiguration, alchemy if you can make it relevant), but Voldemort has a wide breadth of knowledge from all over the world. Dumbledore is able to hold his own because of the combination of his specialization (he's shown in canon to be to use objects around him to block killing curses, for example), quick thinking, and the Elder Wand. If he loses the Elder Wand, Voldemort would have him outclassed in power and he knows too much about magic for Albus to be effective in a fight against him.

It would give you the room to come up with some impressive battle magic uses for transfiguration, and also some really twisted magic for Voldemort to have learned on his travels.
