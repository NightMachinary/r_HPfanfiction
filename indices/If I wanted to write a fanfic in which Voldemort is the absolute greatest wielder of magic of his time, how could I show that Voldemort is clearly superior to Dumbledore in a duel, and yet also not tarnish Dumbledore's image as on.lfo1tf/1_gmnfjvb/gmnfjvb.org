Have dumbledore be on the defensive the entire time, after a scene where Voldemort absolutely /destroys/ everyone else. Like, vaporisation before they get their wands up, melding them into walls, huge waves of fire or bolts of lightning, killing curses like from a chaingun. Seasoned aurors destroyed in under a second, etc.

And then, bring out Dumbledore. He doesn't go par to par, not even close - but he's a significant step above the best auror in the force. He is on the defensive the entire time, taking a step back for every step Voldemort takes forward, but he /is/ defending himself and others, throwing up strange shield after strange shield, never quite getting the chance to actually attack, but also not letting Voldemort destroy him and those he protects.
