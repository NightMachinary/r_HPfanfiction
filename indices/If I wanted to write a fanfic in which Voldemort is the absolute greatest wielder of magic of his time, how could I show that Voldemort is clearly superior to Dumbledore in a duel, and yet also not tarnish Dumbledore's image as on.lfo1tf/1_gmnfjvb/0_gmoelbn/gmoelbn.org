I would suggest showing Dumbledore getting in 1-2 offensive hits of his own which Voldemort manages to shrug off quite easily while congratulating Dumbledore for his shots. This would show that Dumbledore did what nobody else could, thereby establishing his position as "One of the greats" but also establishing Voldemort as "THE Greatest".
