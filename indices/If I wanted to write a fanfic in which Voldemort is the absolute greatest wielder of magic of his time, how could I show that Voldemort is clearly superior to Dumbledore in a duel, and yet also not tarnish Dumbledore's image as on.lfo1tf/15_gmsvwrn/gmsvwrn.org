In canon Dumbledore crushes Voldemort and it was clear that if he wasn't holding back he could've probably straight up won.

You can see this when he dedicates two statues to Bellatrix and Harry instead of just killing Bellatrix. He doesn't use dark curses and only tries for capture, never for lethality which Voldemort remarks on. Still with all the handicaps he manages to force Voldemort into retreat.

So maybe you can have Voldemort at a handicap where he's forced to defend his minions and come out ahead against Dumbledore.
