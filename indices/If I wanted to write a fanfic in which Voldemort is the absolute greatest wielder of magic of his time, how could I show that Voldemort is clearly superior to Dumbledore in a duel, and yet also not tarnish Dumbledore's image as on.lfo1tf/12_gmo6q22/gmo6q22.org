Perhaps you should take their specialties and take them to the extreme, specifically transfiguration for Dumbledore and curses for Voldemort.

Make it so Dumbledore can literally terraform landscapes when he's serious. The ground, trees, stone, even the very air, make it so it's all like mouldable clay to him, to shape and wield.

For Voldemort have him use specific curses and spells that directly counter that. AOE curses that make it so magic does not effect an area. Debuffs that don't need to hit an enemy to have an effect. And curses that only someone with a truly dark/wild imagination could have created. Even better would be if you could have him use spells that are inspired by chaos gods and lovecraftian horrors.
