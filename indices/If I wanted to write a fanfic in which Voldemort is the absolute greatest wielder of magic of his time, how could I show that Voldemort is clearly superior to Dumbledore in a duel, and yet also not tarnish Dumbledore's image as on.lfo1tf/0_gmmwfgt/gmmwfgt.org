Depends on what you mean by 'Greatest Wielder of Magic'. Like, is he the best in every way? Or is he just the most powerful or most knowledgeable or most skilled?

If he's the most powerful, you make lots of notes about how Voldemort's magic effects the surrounding environment and has lots of 'This is Powerful Shit' type particle effects on it. Maybe his lightning spells cause ambient storms or his death magic kills nearby plant matter, etc.

Most knowledgeable, just give him weird curses and things to know.

If he's most skilled, emphasis his movements and dexterity. Think of how you might describe a really talented dancer or martial artist and follow those kinds of themes of description.

In terms of balancing out Dumbledore, the easiest way is probably don't compare him to Voldemort. Compare him to the other people going up against Voldemort. If the aurors get mowed down, Dumbledore can hold his own in ways that emphasise that he's barely holding on and only managing that because he's really good (eg. Voldemort takes down Dumbledore's shield in a single spell, but Dumbledore animates some transfigured crap to dance in front of the next curse to give him time to put up another shield).

It's generally pretty hard to make two Titans-of-a-Field-type characters 'balance' out like that (once two characters are geniuses, there's not much to distinguish them on), which is why a lot of stories starring OP characters experience significant difficulty. If every character is superman, then it's hard to make any character Superman, y'know? Comes off as very "Our protagonist, Random Schoolkid A, is the greatest genius of our time, and here we see him going up against Random Schoolkid B, the other greatest genius of our time." and such.
