I think the best way is to clearly show how both of them are (at least) a league above everyone else.

In Canon during the Battle of the DoM, the 1st reactions of the Death Eater to Dumbledore arrival was to try to flee. They didn't even try to put a fight, because they knew they stood no chance. You could try to create a similar situation to show the difference of strenght.

Maybe Dumbledore effortlessly defeated most of Voldemort Inner Circle before failling during their duel. Or maybe Voldemort managed to destroy a team composed of elite wizards, created to kill him, in mere seconds before Dumbledore arrived and managed to hold him off several minutes for the survivors to escape.

It's ok for Dumbledore to lose against Voldemort, as long as it is made clear that he could still fight most of Magical Britain alone, and win.
