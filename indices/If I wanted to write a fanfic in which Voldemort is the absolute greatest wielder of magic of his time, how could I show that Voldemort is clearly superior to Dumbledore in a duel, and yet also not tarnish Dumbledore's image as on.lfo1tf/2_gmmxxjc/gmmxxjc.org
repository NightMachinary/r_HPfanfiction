Give more power and control to his spells. e.g. An animation moving more fluidly, V's side of the fight looking somewhat more artistic and/or vicious than Dumbledore's. Give a stilted and rushed feel to Dumbledore's side, perhaps a bead of sweat to contrast a twitch of V's lips into a brief grin.

A lot of people instantly jump to Killing Curses and Fiendfyre to show V's superiour skill and power since they're commonly known to need a lot of power and/or control, but it often leaves the fight feeling lackluster and V feeling deranged/singe-minded.

Putting titan-esque Dumbledore on the back-foot should be shown as a feat, rather than an overload of 'unblockable' spells. There was a fight in The Black Queen's (I-forget-which-book) that showed an imbalance between the MC and Voldemort while still showing off the power behind each quite well(attack on Hogsmeade where Tonks showed up to intervene and showed her own profound skill if anyone else remembers?).

All said, I'd suggest a bit of wariness on Voldemort's part, given the Legend that is Dumbledore. It can serve well to show that he's maybe holding back in fear of Dumbledore underplaying his own hand and needs to be ready to counter an unknown.
