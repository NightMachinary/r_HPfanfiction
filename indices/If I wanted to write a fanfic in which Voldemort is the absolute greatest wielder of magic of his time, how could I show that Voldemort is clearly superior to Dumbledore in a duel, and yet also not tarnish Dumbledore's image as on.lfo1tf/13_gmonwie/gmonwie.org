It's all about feelings and consequences that each fighters envoke in others. LV magic would take away hope and instill fear in his opponents, also it destructs things in the area it lands. Meanwhile AD magic protects and inspires hope that there is a chance it will all be ok, it creates defenses by animating the surroundings to protect those around him. While LV is powerful and focused on the attack, AD is all about control of the battlefield and protecting others. His knowledge shows up by using a lot less effort to defend than LV uses to attack. Still you should show it to the reader that the LV's power is enormous and he could go on and on, sort of unstoppable force meets unmovable object.
