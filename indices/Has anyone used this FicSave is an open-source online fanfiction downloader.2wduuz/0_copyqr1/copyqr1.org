I actually asked awhile ago on [[/r/FanFiction]] what peoples preferred methods were to backup fics. The most amazing seemed to be using Calibre with the fanfiction plug-in to download and convert stories to epub files. Lots of neat little things done by it too like updating stories and having a bunch of metatags. I liked it.

Edit: You can download multiple files at once. Yesterday I downloaded over 300.
