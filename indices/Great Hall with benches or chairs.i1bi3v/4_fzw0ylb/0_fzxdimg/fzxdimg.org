I've always had my own issues with the disproportionate number of students to wizarding community size. Even with the smallest possible number of students per year, the idea of just 4 long tables to fit everyone felt odd to me. Making the room so long in one direction seemed ill fitting too.

I'd like to think there were still long tables, but like more than one row for each house. Or they were broken up every so often. Leaving room between them to help traffic flow. Otherwise, if you were on one side of the table and needed to get to the other side, you'd have to walk /all the way/ to the end of the table to just make a U-turn and go back.
