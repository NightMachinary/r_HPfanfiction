I think this comes down to numbers.

First, there are a lot of students and the Great Hall can ever be so big. So, the movies choose benches as the most practical option.

Second, as we have talked ad naseum before, the wizarding community numbers do not add up. If we were faithful, we would have sorting of over 150 kids each year, and 7 times that students on 4 tables. so we're talking about something over 130 students seated in each side of each table. It would mean over 100mts long Great Hall. And that's being low on estimates.
