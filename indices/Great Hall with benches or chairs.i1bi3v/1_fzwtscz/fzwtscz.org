This is from the sorting in PS. So chairs is canonical, but I think I generally prefer benches, for the reasons other commenters have mentioned. Potential to squeeze in between to people, scooch up the bench, etc.

I think I remember Fred and George squeezing in between people in the books, but that might not be right.
