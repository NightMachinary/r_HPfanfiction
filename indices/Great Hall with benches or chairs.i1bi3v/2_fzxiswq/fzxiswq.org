Someone offered chairs, I'll offer benches:

  They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, “Cedric Diggory.”

  “I'd forgotten Wood had left,” said Hermione vaguely as she sat down beside Ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her. “I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team?”

  “I's'pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite. “He was a good Keeper...”

  “Still, it won't hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said Ron.

  “Do mine ears deceive me?” said Fred, arriving with George and squeezing on to the bench beside Harry.

  “At least it's only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much. “It's not as if it's a dreadful punishment, really...”

And a few more. I'm not going to search for "chair" because lol, but given that benches appear only from the end of GoF, I suppose it could be one of the things Rowling changed her mind about. And yes, the teachers would have chairs (and perhaps even designated places) in any case.

Anyway, more important, if you want realism, is not falling into the looks/overhear trap. From trying this IRL, I can tell you it is extremely hard to tell if someone is looking at you from across the hall or not, and it's flatly impossible to overhear someone a few seats down if everyone is talking, never mind on another table.
