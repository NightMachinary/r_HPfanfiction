Benches do have a certain aesthetic to them and the possibility of a lot of different opportunities. So much easier to scoot around if there are benches- which is really cute. I think chairs have their own flair too. Like someone leaning on two legs too far and then ends up falling backwards. Someone needs to leave dramatically or in shock so they knock over their chair loudly and draw the hall's attention to them.

*edit*: We don't have benches in any of the dining halls at my Uni. We have tables with chairs and some booths, but no benches. Only had benches in middle and high school.
