I prefer benches for the aesthetic (reminds me of uni!) and for the possibilities in writing - if they're sitting on benches, you can have a character sliding closer or further away from someone, a character squeezing themselves in between two others, sitting in all different sorts of positions that's more difficult on a chair... loads of things! It's also easier for the poor house-elves, moving a few benches back into position is quicker than hundreds of individual chairs, even with magic.
