I like chairs. you can still squeeze next to someone and sit on their chair with them if it wasn't a chair with arm rests, but a more simple one. which would make sense because of the amount of them. benches are just not very comfy for longer period of time. like feasts. and when you go sit, you need to overstep the bench. wizards wore robes. they would be kind of hard to manage. and girls have skirts and what not. it's easier to just move the chair to sit on it. also, you can't move the bench, but can move the chair, if you want to sit closer or farther from the table. you could still move away or closer to someone... with the chair. I guess I have benches in my head too because of the movies. I need to reprogram.

to the great hall, it was pretty big in the books. not so much in the movies, I think the tables would need to be divided too. and not be just one continuous table. also, it would need to be even longer than how many students there are so they could always choose a seat and not sit where there is an empty place. unless their seats are assigned or at least divided by year. which is not in canon. every year having their own table in their house and the next year the table next to it and so on, would make sense.
