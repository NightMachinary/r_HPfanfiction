A prophecy that could have been hogwash (at least if you operate under the assumption that the divination teacher is a fraud - for all we know she could have taken a time delayed potion to spew nonsense at Dumbledore or someone could have had her under the imperius etc. etc.)) - hell, for all we know it was/is! It was after all a self-fulfilling one (maybe Harry's mother really did something (some ancient sacrificial protective magic for example) because I refuse to believe that Lilly is the only mother that stepped in front of her child in order to protect it in history!)) and it's not like either (Voldemort and Harry) couldn't have stopped fighting each other (they didn't have a time-limit and Voldemort could have - probably - been killed by anybody after his horcruxes were gone!)

It also makes sense for two first generation magicals (come on Harry is more or less a muggleborn because he doesn't know anything about the wiz-world just like they do) to refuse to participate in this fight (let the "good" and "bad" purebloods wipe each other out and just stay out of it - disappear for good (or leave the country!) if you can!), even winning it does mean nothing (at least that's what I think the epilogue shows: The magical world didn't really change - with the Malfoys walking free etc.!) because they won't gain anything!

ps: It's not like their pure- and halfblood friends can't just surrender (the muggleborns should have known better an left!), Voldemort will not wipe out people he can lord over (why kill if you can control? You can't rule a pile of rocks, you need people!)
