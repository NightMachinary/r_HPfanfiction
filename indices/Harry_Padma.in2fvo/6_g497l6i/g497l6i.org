There is a Harry/Padma alternate four year story, with no triwizard tournament, (but there is some other mystery thing, I think something with time stopping? maybe). Anyway it was abandoned but I remember liking Padma's characterization a lot and the H/Padma romance was great & believable. Unfortunately I can't locate it in my favorites list. If anyone knows of it do post.
