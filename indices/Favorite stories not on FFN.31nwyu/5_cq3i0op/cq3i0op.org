So since you mentioned H/D and Snarry...

I'm still really bummed that Mirror of Maybe was abandoned. Have you tried the [[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion]] series? It's also been abandoned, but there are 5 completed 'books.' Very good! Also there's an incredibly long(but finished) [[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_sushi.html][Civil War series]].

Anything by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/faithwood/pseuds/Faith%20Wood][Faithwood]] or [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/femmequixotic/pseuds/Femme][Femme]]. Also here's the full link to Ivy Blossom's [[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_ivyblossom.html%5C][popular trilogy]] as only Origins seems to be on AO3.

The Harry/Draco Big Bang was the official Big Bang challenge and has quite a few awesome stories that are archived on their own site, but I'm not sure if the individual authors posted on ffn.
