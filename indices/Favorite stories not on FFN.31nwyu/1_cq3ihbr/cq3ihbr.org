[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300?view_full_work=true][The Very Secret Diary]] by Arabella : A classic for the ages. It is basically an account of all the conversations between Ginny and the Diary horcrux. The last few chapters as Riddle slowly drains Ginny of her soul are truly horrifying.

/Albus and Rose, brilliant but opposing minds./

/He is cold, cruel, and nothing like his father. All she wants is to save her brother./

/War looms, magic consumes, and lines between right and wrong blur as they egg each other down a path no wizard has dared to go before./

/This time, it's not just about saving the world. First you have to survive it./
