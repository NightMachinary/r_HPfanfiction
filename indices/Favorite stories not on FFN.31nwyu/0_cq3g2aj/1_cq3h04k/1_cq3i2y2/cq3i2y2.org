In order to access stories posted in Work By Author (WbA) on DLP, you need an account. Signing up is free and I believe it lets you see WbA threads as soon as you join, but there is a slight delay before you can post while your account gets moderated to make sure it's not a bot. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but I think that's how it goes. Either way: free, no invite needed.
