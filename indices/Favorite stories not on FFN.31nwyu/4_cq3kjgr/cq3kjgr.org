Apologies for the slight derail --- and please don't take this as criticism of anybody's tastes --- but looking at her fics reminded me of something... There is this pattern for Harmony fics where Harry is whisked away in his early childhood to be raised by Sirius (usually). In 1995±1, he returns to Hogwarts (which is usually when the fic begins), and

1. Harry's gotten a massive upgrade relative to canon, e.g., a champion duelist, an animagus, a potions prodigy, an occlumens (all at 15±1), who has been able to cast silently since he was 12, etc.: a total badass who is also a perfect gentleman.

2. Hermione's only achievement of note has been to get very good grades (but her academic achievements also pale in comparison with Harry's, if he's ever been formally assessed). If she is lucky, she might have a friend or two, and if she is not, the whole of Hogwarts student body is lining up to bully her; and, if she happened to have had a relationship with Viktor Krum, she will have been used and her heart broken --- and that's if she is lucky.

A variation on this theme is when they get sorted into different houses and don't properly meet until 1995±1, and the divergence has resulted in Harry becoming a badass, and Hermione... not.

--------------

*The Question:* Are there any Harmony fics with this setup (Harry gets whisked away or they get sorted into different houses, and they don't meet until later) where neither Item 1 nor Item 2 hold, i.e., Harry's capabilities ans achievements are comparable to those in canon at the time, as are Hermione's? Or, alternatively, Item 1 holds, but the divergence also results in Hermione having had her own set of adventures, resulting in someone whose capabilities and achievements are comparable to or greater than those of Harry?

I know of exactly /one/ fic that comes even close to that, /Snow Queen/ by [[/u/Darklooshkin]], and that one features a Fem!Harry, whether there will be any sort of romance is unclear, and it's a heavy AU, so I don't think it really counts.
