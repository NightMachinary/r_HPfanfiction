Probably. Both ff.net and Ao3 have all those features. Both have A much larger user base the wattpad, (therefore a large audience, and more potential feedback) and if Im honest, both have a more powerful search and filter engines, alowing users to find content they want.

The main downside, afaik, uploading stories to ft.net can be fiddley with some of the formatting, and Ao3 has issues with its tagging system.

I will give wattpad the edge in UI, if only because the off-orange, black and white colour scheme looks a lot cleaner then ft.net, but it's close, and really comes down to user preference.

Tldr: may as well cross-post to ff.net and Ao3, if only to reach a wider audiance, and gain greater, more nuanced feedback. Nothing is stopping you from using all three!
