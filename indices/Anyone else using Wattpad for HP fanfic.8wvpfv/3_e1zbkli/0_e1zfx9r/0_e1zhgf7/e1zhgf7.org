Seems like you know a lot about this.

Last I checked, Wattpad had 65 million active monthly users, but that's for all genres... Hmm. ff.net is obviously dedicated primarily to fanfic. Makes sense to go where the readers are. I've been feeling lately like Wattpad is not where the Potterheads are, so it's adding up now.

I think the only thing stopping me from posting to all three sites is laziness at this point. ha
