Well in stories that's not exactly a bad thing. It depends on how it happens, and how does it affect the persons way of life. I mean if the person has a constant, ready supply of Wolfsbane, or maybe learns with the native americans how to accept the animal spirit, or even if it's a different type of werewolf, but I get what your asking for. Sadly I don't particularly like angsty stories, so no idea.

Thanks,

Warryn.
