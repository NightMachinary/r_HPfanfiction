[[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=81213&chapter=0][Dudley Dursley and the New Normal]] might be what you're looking for, as long as you're okay with it being from Dudley's POV. It was apparently removed from fanfiction.net, but I managed to track it down. In it, the Dursleys were attacked by a werewolf while in hiding during Deathly Hallows with Dudley being the only survivor. It's about him learning to live with being a werewolf and adjust to his new circumstance.
