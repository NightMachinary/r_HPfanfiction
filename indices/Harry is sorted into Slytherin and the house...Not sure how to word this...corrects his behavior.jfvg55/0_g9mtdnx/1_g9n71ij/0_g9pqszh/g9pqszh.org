He doesn't need to lose the suicidal bravery though, he needs to keep it because the future of at least Britain, and possibly a larger chunk of the world, depending on Voldemort's ambitions (because he absolutely could have taken over the world, he has the power and skill and magic is pretty terrifying), safe. He's got to fight Voldemort, and that's something that needs suicidal bravery because the guy can fight Dumbledore to a standstill while Dumbledore has the unbeatable Elder Wand, so fighting him really is suicidal.
