#+begin_quote
  When he's little, Harry discovers something Very Special: he can make his wishes come true. Literally. Cue the chaos.In which a young boy discovers a way to slide under the radar and the profound consequences that follow. What happens when you've taught yourself to become untouchable?Tone changes from childish to mature as Harry ages. Rated M for a lack of moral conscience, the occasional murder, and a graphic dark theme here and there (because why not?). Happily Ever After, Voldemort style.
