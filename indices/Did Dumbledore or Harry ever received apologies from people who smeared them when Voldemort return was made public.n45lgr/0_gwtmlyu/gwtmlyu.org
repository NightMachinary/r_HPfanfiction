Dumbledore got back all of his previous positions, and Harry went from "The-Boy-Who-Lied" to "The-Chosen-One" in the Daily Prophet, which may be considered as some kind of apology I guess.

But no, nobody ever went to Dumbledore or Harry and told them "Sorry I smeared your reputation all last year and ignored the return of You-Know-Who", or if it ever happened, it was never mentioned in the books.

From what we saw, the Ministry tactic's, along with the rest of the population, had been to act as if nothing ever happened and hope Harry and Dumbledore didn't hold grudges.
