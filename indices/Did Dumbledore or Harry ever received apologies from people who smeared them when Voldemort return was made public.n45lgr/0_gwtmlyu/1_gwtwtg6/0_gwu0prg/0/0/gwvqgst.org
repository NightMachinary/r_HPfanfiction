Even if we ignore all the things she may have done under Fudge direct's orgers (pretty much all the Educational Decree). Umbrige litteraly admitted being the one who sent Dementors after Harry and was second away of using an Unforgiveable on him. Not to mention that her Black Quill can't be legal, even if it's not directly mentioned as a "Dark Artifact" because she is the one who created the quill and nobody know about it, that's an item that suck the blood of the user and leave a scar on his hand, it should fall into some kind of blancket ban (like: if it use your blood = dark).

Anyways, the first time I read HBP, I was surprised that Umbridge was not in jail, let alone still working for the Ministry.
