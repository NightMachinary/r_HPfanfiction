Yeah i kinda wished He got smeared and lost everything.

I mean imagine if before Voldemort disappeared he thanked Fudge for antagonizing Dumbledore and Harry and for turning the Wizarding World against them and that without him he never would have gathered his followers.

Fudge would be ruined for the rest of his life. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if he was named as The Minister who started the 2nd wizarding world in the history books
