Right!!! Exactly.

I want justice especially because when you think about it, Dumbledore aside, they tried to ruin Harry's life???

Expelling him before his fifth year means he wouldn't have been able to take his OWLs and not taking your OWLs means you can't practise magic because you don't have the necessary education/qualifications to. They SAID someone was going to come destroy his wand that night. He would have ended up like Hagrid, it would be illegal for him to perform magic---and this is the boy who lost his whole family to the wizarding world and was constantly being pushed around by their rules. They were gonna ruin his life further just because they didn't like what he was saying üò≠

Now I don't know what the rules are like or if he would have been able to transfer to Beauxbaton or Durmstrang because if he could then this theory doesn't hold since he could complete his education there because his ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù weren't as severe as Hagrids. But the Ministry destroying his wand implies to me that it wouldn't have been like that and he wouldn't be allowed to do magic. Just another thing that makes me so mad about Fudge/Umbridge.
