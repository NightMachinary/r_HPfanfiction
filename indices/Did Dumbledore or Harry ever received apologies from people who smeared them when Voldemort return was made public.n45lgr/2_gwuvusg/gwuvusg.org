I think one of the reasons they didn't get apologized to is because the main antagonizers were Fudge ans Umbridge. One was unstable by the end of the year and the other quit/got fired so them being out of office meant they didn't have to do damage control or make statements. From what I remember, Scrimgeour took over as Minister like right away and because of his “clean slate” he didn't have to exactly apologize to Harry or Dumbledore in the way that we would have expected Fudge to, in the way they deserved. I think it was all brushed under the rug. It's really infuriating I get so mad that Fudge was able to just walk away from the situation after putting the entire wizarding world at risk for no reason.
