I've seen people do this with fanfics they love. There are services online where you can supply the text and they'll print it as a book for you and ship it to you.

I think [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/aigrte/printing_a_fanfiction_in_book_form/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][this post]] might help you look at some options of doing that.

That's the easiest option I believe. I have seen crafty people print out their own copies and bind it themselves if you're interested in that.

Edit: if you are going to pay to have it printed I would recommend getting it printed as a book by one of those services because at least then it will be book sized and comfortable for reading. Printing 8.5x11 size pages of the fic is also going to cost you assuming you'll have to pay for all the paper and ink you go through, but it would be weird to take a giant stack of papers with you anywhere you want to read it. Just my opinion!
