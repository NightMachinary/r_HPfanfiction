Sorry for the late reply, the author has actually made a printable version of the first book [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1Aygebqhd5kqLFsB0YIr78c3zCob8vV/view][here.]]

[[https://inverarity.livejournal.com/379402.html][Here are his instructions]] on how you can print out a bound copy for yourself. It will cost you about $13 at the cheapest (none of this money goes to him, it just covers the printing service).

Some people are in the process of helping him prepare the second book, but due to its size that book is going to be extremely expensive and maybe impossible for individual people to print out. He's said he wants to avoid any sort of legal trouble, so these are apparently just going to his family and friends for free.

As other people have said he has epubs for all his books available on a google drive linked on his website. There are also PDF copies for his books and of course you can always download an epub from AO3.
