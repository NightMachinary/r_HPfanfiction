I don't like it because the romance and plot are overly dramatic and angsty, with the "Will they, Won't they" completely overdone just for angst reasons alone.

It gets grating after a time, so I just skimmed over it, saw it continues like that for a long time, and then that it only seemingly resolves itself in the last part of the last chapter published.

Honestly, I use fiction to have and to escape from some of that stuff in life, so angsty, overdramatic stories that keep extending the angst just for the sake of angst are NOT my cup of tea.

PS: I don't even recall the grammar or if it's tropey, just this observation I made, it has been a few years a read it all, and it hasn't updated since.
