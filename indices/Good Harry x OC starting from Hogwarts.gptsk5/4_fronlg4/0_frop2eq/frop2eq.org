What are the reasons it is hated by a lot of the sub? It is always a 50-50 for me if I agree or not when this sub bashes a fic, so some info would be appreciated. It sounds for example like it could be really trope and chlich√© heavy, which would be a reason to skip it for me.

EDIT: Nevermind, I just read through some reviews. Gonna skip this one I think.
