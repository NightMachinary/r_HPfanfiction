Unrelated question: Why do you not capitalize your titles sometimes?

I notice some authors do this, and it doesn't really bother me I'm just curious if there's a reason for it? Is it some sort of statement, or just a stylistic choice? Or do you just.. not capitalize them because you don't capitalize your titles usually?

At first I took it as laziness, and/or improper grammar. After reading a few things that are excellently written, but still titled that way I've definitely moved on from that point of view. Now I'm just curious if there's a reason or if it's a 'fuck it, I like it this way' sort of decision.
