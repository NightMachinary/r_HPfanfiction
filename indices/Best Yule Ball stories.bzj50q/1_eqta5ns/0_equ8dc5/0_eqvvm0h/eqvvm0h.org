Not capitalizing titles (especially relatively long ones) has been a trend on AO3 for several years now. I don't know exactly why it started (my best guess is that it was an aesthetic choice) but it caught on and now lowercase titles just "look right" to me. Occasionally I'll give a fic a shorter, capitalized title, but that's definitely the exception rather than the norm at this point.
