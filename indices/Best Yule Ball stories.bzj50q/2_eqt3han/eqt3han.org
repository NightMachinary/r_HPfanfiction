The first doesn't focus on the Yule Ball, but I included it because the writer just concluded the Yule Ball. Very well written story. Hinny.

The second does focus on the Yule Ball, and after words. Uses a familiar set up of Harry asking Hermione out as soon as McGonagall tells him about the Champion's Dance. Harmony. Major Weasley (Ron, Ginny, Molly) and Dumbledore bashing.
