Well, assuming that Lily's parents were alive when James and Lily got married (I don't think Petunia attended their wedding, but I could be wrong), they could've shown her pictures of the wedding. And since Sirius was presumably James's best man, he would've been right next to James in the pictures. But this would probably be the extent of what she knew about him, outside of him being a murder.
