My favourite is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control by Anonymous58]]. Summary below. This is Crazy!Harry as well as Dark!Harry if I remember right. Unfortunately not complete though.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

Another favourite is the Denerian series by Shezza starting with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denerian Renagade]] and continued in two sequels, all of which are complete. Crossover with the Dresden files, but no knowledge of the series is needed. Summary below.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files
