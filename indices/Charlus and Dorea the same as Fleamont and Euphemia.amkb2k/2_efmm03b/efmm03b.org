What's the point? Either you acknowledge Rowling's words as extended canon or you disregard them.

And what you are suggesting sounds like you prefer the fanon concept but use the second names as "insurance" against people who might otherwise call you out on not sticking to canon.

I mean, you can do it, but I fail to see the benefits other than maybe avoiding an angry review.
