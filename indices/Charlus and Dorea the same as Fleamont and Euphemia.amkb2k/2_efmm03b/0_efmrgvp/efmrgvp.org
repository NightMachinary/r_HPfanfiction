I actually prefer the Canon Names, sort of. I had this idea because I like the character concept of Fleamont more than Charlus and I like Dorea more than Euphemia. So I wanted to go with the idea that it's Fleamont and Dorea. But then I thought it would tie things together more if I just combined the characters.
