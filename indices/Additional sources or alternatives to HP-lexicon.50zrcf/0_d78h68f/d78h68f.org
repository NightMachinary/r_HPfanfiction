This is a ridiculously in depth analysis of everything to do with Hogwarts and what can be deduced about its location, architecture, floor plan, realistic paths one can take between places, and the surrounding environment. It's almost too much information. Whoever wrote this used tiny clues such as the angle of the sunlight at a certain time of day during a certain season as mentioned in the books to figure out which direction the entrance needs to be facing. Just crazy stuff.
