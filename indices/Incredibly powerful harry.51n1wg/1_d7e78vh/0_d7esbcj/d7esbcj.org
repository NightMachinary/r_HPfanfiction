It looked interesting but then i got to the hp/dm and all interest went out the window. It's not that i don't like gay couples but that it's very hard to picture harry with a guy let alone draco. I don't like the idea of him and draco if he was gay i would expect him to go out with neville all things considered, They have more in common.
