[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]] - Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10997165/1/The-Widow-and-the-Wizard][The Widow and the Wizard]] - "Would you like to come with me?" Harry stared at her eyes, big and green like his.

It's just the two of them at first, until she picks up a couple of extras on the way. Fem/harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9348546/1/Ink-Stains][Ink Stains]] - In which Harry was sealed inside Tom Riddle's diary during his second year and tossed into another world, upon where he finds himself in Bruce Banner's lonely hands. With the life Banner leads, he supposes that he shouldn't be surprised by this "Harry Potter" being. Really, there wasn't enough coffee in the world to deal with this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10835321/1/Behind-the-Shield][Behind the Shield]] - It was a good thing the new scientist, Dr. Harry Evans, was working out so well. Because nothing else was going Fury's way. And that was before Loki made off with the Tesseract and some of his people. Maybe AU to Mortem Cantor by Kyandua.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8750290/1/Moved-by-the-Law-of-Probability][Moved by the Law of Probability]] - The probability of Harry Potter living a completely normal life was low, but that was okay.
