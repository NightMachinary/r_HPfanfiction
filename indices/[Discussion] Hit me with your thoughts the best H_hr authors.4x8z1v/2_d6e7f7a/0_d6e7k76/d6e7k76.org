Pretty good recs all around. Not sure MADHarmony really counts as she's only written one thing, which isn't even finished.

Also, shameless plug: I hope one day requests like these can show up on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]], once I finally get around to fixing the CSS/finishing the sub manifesto.
