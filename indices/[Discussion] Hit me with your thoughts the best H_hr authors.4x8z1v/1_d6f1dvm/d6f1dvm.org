She also does Harry/Draco, so read the summaries. And she tends to go pretty AU. Soulmate Bond is epic-length, most of the others are significantly shorter.

I just like her way of coming up with different scenarios, she puts in a decent amount of non-juvenile humor, she generally makes Harry a badass (which I like) - although not at an unbelievably young age, and she comes up with some interesting twists on the universe - I love all the parselmagic stuff in Soulmate Bond. Her OCs are pretty well-rounded - and she tends to re-use them in different stories, which I kind of like - someday I'm going to forget they're OCs. The relationships in her fics don't seem to come out of nowhere, have their bumps, and seem believable and adult in nature. And not just in the sexual sense. The people, also, have their faults.

The Magical Promise would be a good shorter one to start with. It's post-Hogwarts (by 10 years, I think).
