I will NEVER recommend a Harry who joins Voldemort and his sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis:

My top dark Harry fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]. It's even canon compliant until the end of DH, but Harry and his friends eventually declare war on Wizarding Britain's incorrigible establishment. Good guys could only be pushed so far. Trio interactions are beautifully written in this fic, and George, Neville, Susan, and Fleur all get to shine here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]] is a fun romp involving Grindelwald, who breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. But it's the girls Hermione, Ginny, and Luna who are the most enthusiastic about this turn of event.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]] deserves a special mention. It's still the only non crossover "Wizards in Space" fic. This Harry qualifies in every way as 'dark' as he rules their fledgling space colony with an iron fist.

Harry is Head Auror in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]] and appears to be benevolent, but the last two chapters will show how ruthless he really is. Also, he manipulates the marriage contract situation with Daphne Greengrass fully to his own benefit.

Although Hermione takes the lead in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], Harry is fully on board with her. They are never open depicted as 'dark', but their actions speak for themselves. The real war begins after Voldemort's fall.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]] is a trope heavy, but nevertheless fun dark Harry/Ginny story. This couple is slightly sadistic and will often have rough sex after killing their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] has a 'Harry' who thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but only wants to teach DADA forever. It's the most popular fic on this sub.

Finally, the dark war epic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] features a very different world in which James and Lily beat Voldemort that night with a trap. They faked their own deaths, burnt down their house, and fled to continental Europe. This Harry was raised by his loving parents, never went to Hogwarts, and took on a very different career path.
