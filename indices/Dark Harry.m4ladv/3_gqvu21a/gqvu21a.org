Oooh I can finally rec something! I don't know if these qualify as dark enough (he is dark, yes, but not necessarily evil) but I adore these two:D

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589][Evitative]] by Vichan on Ao3 (222k) is a Harry/Draco story and is about Harry being resorted into Slytherin for his fifth year and how he ends up forming relationships with all the Slytherins- one of my favorites ever def read it

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17211539][Tainted or Saved]] is also SO GOOD it's by Neryx and Queen_Snake again on Ao3, 166k AND there's a sequel ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18030464][Serpents, Sunshine and Sickles]], 116k)- it's a Harry/Tom Riddle-Voldemort/Barty Crouch Jr fic (yes, an odd ship but is so good) where Harry ends up joining Voldemort in the graveyard instead of fighting him, therefore switching sides. It's so amazingly unique and I v much recommend
