Why? What is Dobby's motivation for canon happening the way it did? What does he get out of it? Eventual better rights for house-elves because The Boy Who Lived is a friend? Why not just have Voldemort win and then free the house elves? If he's powerful enough to control/manipulate Voldemort, why does he need to use him as a catspaw instead of accomplishing his goal directly?

Edit: How does he explain away a knife to the chest and being buried? (can't believe I forgot that)

Stories that have a puppeteer master villain who was one step ahead of the hero the whole time need to be airtight to avoid gaping plot holes and there are a lot of plot holes in canon already.

I'd read a crack fic of it though, especially if we find out that Dobby, despite being all powerful, still uses the house elf mode of speech, like some demented Yoda
