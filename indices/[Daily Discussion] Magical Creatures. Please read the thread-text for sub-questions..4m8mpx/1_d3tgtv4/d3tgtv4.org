  What is your favorite magical creature?

Gotta be Veelas. They have such wonderful personalities.

  Which magical creature is the most dangerous?

If not nundus, half-Veelas. I mean, any wizard or witch (including half-Veelas) can use Fiendfyre. Use that in a Muggle city--particuarly a densely populated one--without wizards nearby, and you get an unstoppable fire which will kill thousands.

Veelas. I do not feel as though this requires an explanation.

  Which magical creature would be the most interesting pet?

You may have detected a theme by now. That's why I'm gonna surprise you and say a phoenix, because they can teleport and--wait, wizards can teleport, too. I'm gonna have to go with Veela on this one.
