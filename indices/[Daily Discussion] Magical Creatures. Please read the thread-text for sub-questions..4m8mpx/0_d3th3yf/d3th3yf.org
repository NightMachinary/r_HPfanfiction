/What is your favorite magical creature?/

Nifflers sound so adorable and useful, I've never wanted an animal more.

/Which magical creature is the most dangerous? (Let's try to be more creative than nundu's and dragons)/ Lethifolds and Dementors both terrify me and are so tied up in traumatising experiences/mental disorders that I would argue that they can be more damaging on a wider scale than dragons.

/Which magical creatures sounds most delicious?/ Hippogriff... Like a really gamey chicken.

/Which magical creature would be the most interesting pet?/ Apart from Nifflers, I would like a Kneazle. I don't even like cats, but the idea of a very loyal one is lovely.
