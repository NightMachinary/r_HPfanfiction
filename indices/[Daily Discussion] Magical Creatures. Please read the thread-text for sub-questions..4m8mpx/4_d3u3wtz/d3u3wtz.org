What is your favorite magical creature?

I love thestrals, they are so intriguing. A creature that looks so dark and horrible but is actually a kind and shy creature.

Which magical creature is the most dangerous? (Let's try to be more creative than nundu's and dragons)

At lot of the creatures seem to be pretty dangerous. I feel like though, hippogryffs are pretty dangerous since you cant always track their intentions. You could be doing something exactly right but it could still be offended and attack

Which magical creatures sounds most delicious?

I honestly have never thought about it, and I dont know if I would. Maybe dragons, since I think hagrid had a steak of dragon meat. Maybe it would be kinda good.

Which magical creature would be the most interesting pet?

Back to thestrals, I seriously would love to have one!
