1. Boggarts. I think they would be incredibly practical in real life. Psychologists would have a field day and find out what people fear rather quickly. Not only that but their solution could also help patients.

2. Infieri sound incredibly scary.

3. Centaur Steak. Centaur Burger. Centaur Wrap. Mmm.

4. Owls. I know you said magical but these birds fly over countries and back in days. They're small little buggers. Pretty magical. Plus I think there's a difference between owls in the magical world and those in the muggle world.
