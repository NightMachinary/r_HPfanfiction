*>Which magical creature is the most dangerous?*

Ashwinders kill a fuckton of people, I expect. I mean, to look at they're not all that dangerous, but the worry is in their eggs destroying your fucking home.

I mean, on a domestic level, it's not actually dragons and Nundus that the average wizard has to worry about.

*Doxies*

We know doxies are venomous, though we don't know what general effect their venom has - I'm guessing that in the event of an infestation, though, there are a few deaths every few years.

I mean, they're only little bastards, but if you're cleaning out dead Aunt Mildred's kitchen cupboard and twenty of them descend on you when you've got no antidote to hand, you could well die on the floor.

*Puffskeins*

Generally they're not dangerous. I mean, they're fat little tribbles that stick their tongues into sleeping wizards' noses to eat bogeys.

But imagine an incredibly earnest puffskein with an overlarge tongue that just stiffens its tongue and goes for the brain. It'd be a horrible, terribly messy way to die.

I'm into it.

*Owls*.

Not in themselves, necessarily, but post owls can find virtually anyone in the magical world, so long as they don't cast whatever spell it is that makes them undetectable to them, so surely mail bombs and the like exist in the magical world.

I mean, you could obviously go for poison on the parchment or whatever, but surely you could just take a mail owl and train it to assassinate your chosen victims. Their value would be in the element of surprise and in their ability to find virtually any desired victim.

Go in and aim for the eyes, Hedwig.
