No particularly deep reasons for me, I'm afraid.

1) Dragons for the cool factor of flying scaled lizards that can breathe fire.\\
2) Canonically, Nundu are among the most powerful magical animals in HP if they aren't the most powerful bar none. So, instead, I'm not going by killing potential but by the amount of fear it induces. Lethifolds take the win, by /far/. I've always been terrified of wraiths of any description for no good reason. Dementors, too, but you asked for something more creative :p\\
3) Kneazels. It's just that name reminds me of kneading, which brings to mind the process to create bread, and bread... is fucking awesome.\\
4) Phoenixes.
