I don't think Hermione (in how she's written in canon anyway) would make a good main character for this series. The whole story of Harry Potter is we explore this magical world hidden in our own and we learn about it as our main character learns about it. This doesn't work with Hermione because she already knows everything about the world as she's the character that they go to for answers and how can we learn about a world if our main character never asks questions about it?I hope my point is clear because I find it hard to explain
