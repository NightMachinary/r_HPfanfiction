Agreed, Hermione reads so many books about this world that she knows stuff years before most students ever hear about them!

On the other hand, if we see her apply that knowledge (as long as you make her a little more sociable because as much as I hate Ron calling her a nightmare he was right!), it might work (substitute knowledge, which in the wiz-world really is power, for allies etc.? Hm...hm....)
