If you don't mind canon rehash, yes, they are very good.

In fact, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][its author]] always writes BAMF!Hermione.

More Hermione centric fics:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a canon re-telling in a non-magic AU, with several major differences though. I like it more than the original Books.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is a great, but highly underappreciated R/Hr story.
