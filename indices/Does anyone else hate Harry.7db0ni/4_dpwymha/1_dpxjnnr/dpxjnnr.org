As in, Harry Potter from Hermione's POV, or Hermione as the Girl Who Lived? Because the first sounds fine; I wouldn't read it because I don't really identify with her and wouldn't enjoy it. The second one, I feel as if the stress would break her early on. In the first few years, she'd worry and obsess until she was a miserable wreck. I'm not sure how much Harry and Ron would be able to drag her mind away from it.
