  Sure some love her but it simply points to her being a character that would drive a lot of people away.

I almost replied to [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]] about that line, and lo and behold, it's being quoted, so I guess I'll respond to you instead. Basically that's illogical reasoning because it asserts that fans loving Hermione are proof that she's driving people away, i.e., is why she's unpopular. Whereas people loving Harry means that Harry deserves to be the protagonist. What?
