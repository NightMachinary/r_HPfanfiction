Hi, sorry, I was away from the computer for most of the day. But yes, I looked at what you said. What you said is confusing and misleading, and it's a problem of sentence structure.

However, for me the real issue is that most Hermione-haters are blinded by their feelings to the fact that most readers don't see a joyless pseudo-intellectual nag. Most don't see a sparkly genius Mary Sue, either. They see Harry's friend, a bossy, loyal, bright, swottish, brave, irritating, socially awkward, and magically gifted girl who does some morally dubious things in the later books. There's a ton of ridiculous fanon out there that ignores the nuances of Hermione's character, but that's true right down the line of all the main characters. So. /shrug It's cool if you hate her, but I don't recognize your version of her at all.
