That's just silly. Would you like to cite sources to back up your opinion?

Look, I have no doubt that plenty of writers portray Hermione as prettier and more brilliant and more magically able than she is in canon. They do the same to Harry. They do the same to all the most popular characters. That doesn't mean there aren't perfectly decent portrayals out there, or that many readers don't love canon!Hermione exactly as she is, flaws and all.

For that matter, fic writers are only a small percentage of fandom, so the sins they commit in their amateur writing doesn't reflect how fandom and readers at large feel about the characters. Hermione is extremely popular. I will concede that if she happened to be the protagonist of a series, most male readers simply wouldn't bother. That has more to do with the fact that male readers, generally speaking, don't read books where the lead character is a woman (or in this case, girl).

ETA: To make this more relevant to the thread, I should say I love Harry. In fact, I love the Trio exactly as they are, flaws and all. I have some trouble with the way JKR writes them from time to time (plot requirements leading to repetitive stupidity), but their friendship is one of the major pleasures of the series.
