To be fair, every time Hermione says something is a bad idea it is, in fact, a bad idea. She always finds the knowledge that they need just in time for them to use it, and only ever had trouble with one spell iirc. It's been some time since I read the canon so I may be editing somewhat, but I can only remember her being wrong about one significant thing, which is that the Hallows are not important. And frankly I wish she'd been right about that because they were stupid.

So she's definitely usually right, if not always.
