As if she's wrong in canon...I only remember two instances where she fucked up:

SPEW (Houselfs don't want to be fucking free, with the exception of Dobby the anomaly!)

The Firebolt she snitched to the teachers about!

Sadly Hermione IS A MARY-SUE, so we are kind of lucky that she's not an active Mary-Sue most of the time (as in bossing Harry around so he does everything she'd do if she were the focal point!) or the focus of the story :(

I have no problem with academically enclined female characters (I love Samantha Carter in Stargate and she's a soldier and also a scientist with an almost superhuman intellect!), but if they make no misstakes then the story is just boring :(
