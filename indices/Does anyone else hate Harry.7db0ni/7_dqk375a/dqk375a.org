Hate? No - Dislike? You bet! But NOT becaus Ron (who's more like dead weight that kept Harry and Hermione back IMHO!) would make a better hero!

If I had to select a hero from the canon characters? Sirius Black!

As for Harry: Him not standing up for himself against Draco, Snape, the Dursleys etc. made me dislike him (I was bullied myself, but I fought every god damned time! I never gave up - well, at least not in public! I'd think about suicide at home, but I never made an attempt!), same for his lack of a sense of wounder at magic and lack of drive to be the best at it (especially after learning that Voldemort is still around!) :(

Harry is a slacker and that is an instant turn off...frankly that's why him and Ron are such good friends, because frankly Ron is even lazier :(
