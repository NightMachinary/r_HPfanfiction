Ron wouldn't have been as good. Harry had the world stacked against him. He was beat down and a proper underdog. Given his childhood he had your sympathy, his constant striving to do the right thing made him a good person. He was a hero who overcame the odds. Stories are driven by conflict, Harry has plenty, Ron has less.

Ron on the other hand, he's the most real of the characters. The one people would actually be friends with in real life. A prat with a good heart and your prat. He's too average, people wouldn't care. What is special about Ron? The Weasleys are special, exaggeratedly so. They're not just a large warm family, they're a huge loving family. Ron is meant to be average, he's meant to be the slight underachiever who knows he can't surpass his brother's deeds. He's too real and so he's not hero material in the same way.

Hermione would have been awful as the focus. Enough people, myself included dislike her already. Sure some love her but it simply points to her being a character that would drive a lot of people away. I would never have read past the first book if Hermione was the focus.
