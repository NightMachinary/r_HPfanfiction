Nope, I'd have unfriended him after him calling helpfull (if bossy!) Hermione a "nightmare"...seriously:

The girl was just trying to help you and you call her that? What's next, will you call her a mudblood (something Harry would probably not tolerate because of his mother!)? Leave me alone, don't talk to me - unless you have appologized to her!
