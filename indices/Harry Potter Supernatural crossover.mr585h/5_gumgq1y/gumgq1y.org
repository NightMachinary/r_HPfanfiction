Hrm, apparently nobody linked 'Illusions of Grandeur' yet. Skip over the abandoned sequel if you like, but IoG tackles seasons 3-5 rather well.

There's also 'Is that excitement?' which is a crack fic with (probable) very slow updates. What's there is pretty funny, however. Too bad it's pretty short thus far.
