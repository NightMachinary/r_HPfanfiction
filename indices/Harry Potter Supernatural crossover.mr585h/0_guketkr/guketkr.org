Back in Black by sakurademonalchemist Harry reincarnates as Dean Winchester 44 chapters long can be a little crackish at times but I enjoyed it

Jade Angel also by sakurademonalchemist 28 chapters. femHarry dies and is kicked out of heaven by I think it was Zachariah because ducks with wings and she runs off to America.

A Deal Made In Good Faith also also by sakurademonalchemist 42 chapters femHarry accidentally summons Crowley while cooking and gets adopted.

I'm tired so I'm not giving a full review like I normally would but I both read and enjoyed all of these and recommend them the shortest is Jade Angel at 65.9k words. Hope you like them
