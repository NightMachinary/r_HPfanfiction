She had it wrong often enough in canon:

- She was wrong about Lockhart

- She was wrong (or at least misguided) about house-elves

- She was wrong about how to handle Harry in year 5

- She was wrong about Draco in year 6

- She was wrong about the Deathly Hallows

- She was wrong about the horcrux in Hogwarts

Despite all that, her self-confidence never wavered, which means she kept believing in her logic and rejecting esoteric ways of thinking, for both good and bad.
