Godric's Hollow turned out to be a trap, after Harry wanted to go there and look for Horcruxes. Voldemort also lured Harry to the Ministry in OotP. Harry was right that Draco was a Death Eater, but didn't expect the invasion any more than Hermione did in HBP. Overall, Harry's hunches have a less than stellar track record, so while an argument can be made that she should have given him the benefit of the doubt, you could equally say that she shouldn't trust his hunches due to how that turned out last time.
