#+begin_quote
  She was wrong about Lockhart
#+end_quote

Lockhart fooled absolutely everyone. No person figured him out. Even Harry still believed he actually did those things until the very end. (he disliked Lockhart because he was a pompous prat who went on and on about fame, not because he "saw through him")

#+begin_quote
  She was wrong (or at least misguided) about house-elves
#+end_quote

There is zero evidence to suggest this. As far as canon is concerned she was right about them (though naive in how to act)

#+begin_quote
  She was wrong about how to handle Harry in year 5
#+end_quote

Harry was completely unmanageable in year 5. There was no way to "handle" him.

#+begin_quote
  She was wrong about Draco in year 6
#+end_quote

This was the only one that was a genuine mistake.

#+begin_quote
  She was wrong about the horcrux in Hogwarts
#+end_quote

While ultimately incorrect, her reasoning was perfectly sound. Harry was merely guessing at that point and had no idea either.
