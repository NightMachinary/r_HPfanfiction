I too have seen this annoying trope, it simplifies Hermione's character and reduces her to a stereotype. I think Hermione is victim to this more than any other character because she's the female protagonist in a fandom with predominantly female fan fiction writers. Canon Hermione's knowledge comes realistically, but fanon Hermione is a walking encyclopedia out of no where.

When I reread the books I notice that when Hermione and Harry/Ron disagree over something and she was right (Firebolt, Sirius, Half-Blood Prince), it was in an unexpected way.
