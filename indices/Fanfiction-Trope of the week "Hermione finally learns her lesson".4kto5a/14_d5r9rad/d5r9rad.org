Well, I agree with you that she's a strong female character, but defending the fact that she's unable to admit that she's wrong or has been wrong in the past (I mean come on: She was one of the Lockhart fangirls for example, not to mention that she follows the headmaster like he's a god (cutting contact with Harry for 2 holidays in a row whe he's just seen someone die for fuck's sake!) and did go behind Harry's back (the Firebolt incident!)) is WRONG, too!

Sure you shouldn't go over board with this, but her learning her lesson IMHO is necessary for Harry/Hermione to work (note: I think she wouldn't turn into a Yes-Girl - which is good! - but she might change her approach to things (she's intelligent enough to learn what works and what doesn't after all!)) because Harry hates being bossed around (he would sooner or later put his foot down) and he doesn't trust authority figures just because (I mean he's been treated badly by most authority figures in his life: From the Dursleys to Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall!)

Yes, she was right about the Firebolt, but that doesn't mean her approach to it was right (going to McGonagall was NOT the right thing to do - convincing Harry to turn it in himself would have been the right thing to do...or: Use it herself first (and take the bullet for her friend, if the broom had been cursed!)...but not go behind a friend's back, that's never right and never will be right! It's one of the few instances where I think Ron was right, even if it was only because he wanted to try the broom out himself!)

I think that "she's got to learn her lesson"-trope (which I think is a good thing, as long as you don't go over board and chance her character totally!) exists because in canon she never does learn her lesson! In fact people tend to worship her in the fandom (even her bad qualities like believing she's always right and that she's better than anybody else! Come on she tries to sour Ron's relationship with Lavender, despite it being her fault for not making a move first (she's a modern, strong woman so why doesn't she approach Ron if she wants to be together with him?)...not that I think her and Ron would work in the long run (I really question her judgement here, as Ron is her polar opposite and while that might be nice at the start of a relationship, it will soon get old and lead to more and more fights!)
