I really liked linkffn(9622964;10190118) where Hermione betrays Harry, but the author does a realistic job of having them work through it.

When she's portrayed in fiction of having the authority complex (where she instantly respects anyone in authority) it annoys me. As children, yes, we're taught to respect authority, but we're never taught not to question it. We just don't question it to their faces and it seems like canon Hermione never quite made that connection. I think some authors take it way to far to the next level and then demoralize and trash her character after the fact. It could instead be used for much better character building, I think.
