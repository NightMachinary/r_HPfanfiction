The crush isn't the mistake, the mistake is having lockhart as a teacher and not managing to understand that he's incompetent. Like, after he releases the pixies, doesn't she defend him or something sying like "Ooh, he just wanted to give us real experience" or some shit. And after that he spends all his classes re enacting his books. How is any of this the mark of a good teacher?
