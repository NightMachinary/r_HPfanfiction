I'm not saying that a crush is a character flaw.

I'm not saying being wrong occasionally is a character flaw (but it is a natural part of being human).

I'm saying that insisting that a person is highly competent when all evidence and truth points to them being utterly incompetent at everything but self-promotion, hair styling and memory charms (though it is /hilarious/ that the one time we see him actually use a memory charm in canon it backfires horribly) is an example of /being wrong/. Christ on a bike, being wrong, no matter the reasons (reasonable or not) is still being wrong.
