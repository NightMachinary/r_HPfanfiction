Harry doesn't always have the clearest judgement when it comes to people he has strong feelings toward, whether they be positive or negative. Hermione, on the other hand, almost always tries to remain level-headed.

For example, the trio almost unanimously dislike Snape - and Hermione has good reason to when he humiliates her for the teeth incident - and yet she insists they show him respect by referring to him as "Professor Snape."

I see that same logic playing out with Draco. If someone deserves condemnation, she needs solid proof, not instinct.
