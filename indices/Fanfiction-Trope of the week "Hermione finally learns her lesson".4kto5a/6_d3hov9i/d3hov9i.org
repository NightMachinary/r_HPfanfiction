I like this idea about trope of the week.

And fanon-Hermione does tend to suffer from the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrideBeforeAFall][Pride Before a Fall]] trope.

I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to have Hermione humbled. Her intelligence and arrogance naturally lends itself towards this trope and the eventual arc but most fanons just turn it into a bashing.
