A combination of dying for your pairing, and plain misogyny/regressivism. I've seen several fic where they talk about Hermione being too radical against a system that could jail people without trial and where non-magical humans are treated subhuman... and the author lampoons her for being too radical. Berates her for being too unwilling to bend to a culture where your success hinges on your family. It's a culture where you can be killed in a terrorist attack and the government is too incompetent to retaliate. You are literally unsafe in those kinds of circumstances. You have to fight or die! Why is she being shamed for this in these stories!
