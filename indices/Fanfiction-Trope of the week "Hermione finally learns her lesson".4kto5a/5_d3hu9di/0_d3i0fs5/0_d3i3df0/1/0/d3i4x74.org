I think the sides in HP world were pretty clear cut. British wizarding government was a shit hole full of bigotry, corruption, cruelty, discrimination, incompetency, injustice, and malice. It rivaled some of the worst muggle governments today.

Blood purity was a completely misguided belief that would lead to mental degeneration and magical degradation. The Books couldn't be more clear about that aspect.

There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING redeeming in the Voldemort and blood purity camp, just like the Nazis and ISIS, they had to be fought with utter determination and ruthlessness.
