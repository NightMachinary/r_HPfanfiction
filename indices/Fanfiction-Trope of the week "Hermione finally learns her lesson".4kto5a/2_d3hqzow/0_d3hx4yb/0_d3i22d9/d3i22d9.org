Kreacher definitely acted strangely, but this may be due to Regulus's order to destroy the locket, and the fact that he never liked Sirius and (probably) grudgingly accepted him as his master.

Taking this from Hermione's perspective, if Sirius was nicer to Kreacher, he would never have been ordered to "get out," preventing Kreacher's role in his death.

I brought up the slave comparison because iirc Hermione did so in GOF (correct me if I'm wrong) and technically the elves are bound to do the bidding of their masters.
