The typical being-wrong-about-house-elves trope is so overused and exaggerated when considering the books. The way I see it is that house elves may be naturally subservient, with exceptions like Dobby. This may be due to their nature or social behavior. But this obviously isn't a reason to mistreat elves and unnecessarily punish them. I think Hermione was shocked to see that there were elves who basically acted as slaves, and considering her Muggle upbringing, she was horrified by the parallels.
