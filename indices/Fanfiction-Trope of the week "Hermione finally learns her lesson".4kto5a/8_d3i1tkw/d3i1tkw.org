I like the trope. I mean, not the one where the character is subservient to her partner for the rest of the story, but the one where a character's flaws lead to a big mistake and there are consequences for it.

This is why my favorite characters in the books are Ron and Dumbledore. Both fuck up in a big way, there are consequences and both of them have to work hard to redeem themselves. It is also why I don't particularly like canon Hermione; out of the trio she has the most significant strengths, and yet she is the least flawed of the three. Morever, the magnitude of her failures don't come close to those of the other main characters. Ron leaves in the midst of the horcrux hunt, Harry's issues lead to Sirius's death, Hermione... fails at spew, I guess? I would have liked Hermione a lot more had she fucked up more and had to make up for it.
