I agree I feel like if Hermione had that one big fuck up it would have brought her more whole as a character. Im not saying she is a bad character though just that she would have look more human I guess. The way i saw Hermione in the books is a smart but socially stupid character and also sometimes bossy or pushy person. When reading the books i always thought she would get a little to much for Harry with his closed off self and him hiding his emotions. Because we can all assume that he was punished for showing jealousy or sadness to a situation at the Dursleys. So you couple this with her while good hearted but overbearing need to help him with his issues. I feel this would cause a rift between them and it would give both character but mostly Hermione a chance to reflect on themselves. With Harry realizing that she was just trying to help and Hermione realizing that she could back off a bit and be more gentle with her approach to these things.
