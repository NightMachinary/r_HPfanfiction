No the arguing isn't an expression of their affection for each other. It's the fact that neither of them take it personally. That's the distinction so few people seem to make. Ron and Hermione feel safe communicating with each other on any level and /that's/ why they fall for each other. They can be themselves and feel accepted, something neither of them find in anyone else in their time at Hogwarts.
