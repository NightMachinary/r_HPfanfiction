Totally agree that that's a distinction people fail to make not just here, but in real life as well. Not all of us "argue" with others just because we dislike them or think they're stupid or whatever. Quite often, these people want to hear /everything/ you have to say on the subject, even if they have to play devil's advocate. There's not necessarily anything personal about it.
