Yes this trope is usually handled with all the subtlety of a shovel to the face. It can probably trace its origins to the Firebolt incident and this scene in book 5:

  /“Whoops,” he said softly. “Another zero, then, Potter . . .” Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished. “I'm sorry!” said Hermione with her hands over her mouth. “I'm really sorry, Harry, I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!” Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridge's office again./

I find it's usually Dark!Harry fics that use this trope and I've yet to be impressed by a single one of those save "The Lesser Sadness" but that's all of three chapters. It's used as a way to destroy the 'Golden Trio' so Harry can move on to his new friends.

I remember reading an article that was defending R/Hr that tied into some of my issues with this trope. Basically both Ron and Hermione are combative in their beliefs. Ron because he's the youngest boy in a family of nice and being heard in that mess means having to yell. The author argued that Hermione was much the same, no doubt learning it from her parents. Harry on the other hand detested that kind of conflict, JK mentions it again and again through out the years. He struggles when Ron isn't there because Hermione has no one but Harry with which to spare. To Ron and Hermione arguing and being forceful means family, something you'd only do with people you trust. To Harry it brings up all the abuse and neglect of his childhood.

But no one using this trope seems to understand the above and what a dynamic shift in character it would be for Harry to be as domineering as he is in these stories.
