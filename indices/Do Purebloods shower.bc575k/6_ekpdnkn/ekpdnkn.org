Yes.

There are showers in either the Quidditch changing rooms or in Gryffindor House because Wood ends up staying in them for long enough that Fred and George think he's trying to drown himself.

Also the Weasleys seem to have one. Since apparently Percy sings in the shower and it sounds awful.

I don't think that those purebloods who fancied themselves upper class would have one. They'd have baths like the one in the prefects bathroom.
