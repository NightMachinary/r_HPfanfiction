If they do clean themselves magically, I would imagine it would be a sweeter, more comfortable variation of /Scourgify/, not just brute-force vanishing of the dirt and grime. If all the dirt and grime /had/ been vanished magically, though, I should point out there /wouldn't/ be any smell left; smell isn't some weird independent quality that remains in the absence of matter, you know, and unlike Muggle soap, there's no reason magic couldn't remove the dirt down to the last molecule.

But more seriously? No. For one thing, do not overestimate most grown wizards' repertoire of spells; there's every reason to think most forget most of what they've learned in Hogwarts, much like few adults in the Muggle world remember most of the maths they were taught back in middle school, if you will --- that's the whole point of Kwikspell. And since they believe themselves superior by nature, one would assume the purebloods would tend to be /particularly/ inept when push comes to shove. See Draco Malfoy and brooms, for example.

Also, Hogwarts has showers and baths, and we are given no reason to think they are an especially modern addition, nor one which caused scandal from the likes of Lucius Malfoy. A culture which regarded baths as a mere Muggle fancy wouldn't have hatched the Prefect's Baths, I think. Remember also that the Potter family got rich thanks to a hair lotion, so there /is/ a market for it in the Wizarding World.
