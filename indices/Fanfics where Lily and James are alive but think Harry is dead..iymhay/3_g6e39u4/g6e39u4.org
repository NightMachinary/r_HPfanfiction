This gets recommended all the time, but linkffn(A Black Comedy) has this. Harry travels to another dimension where he died but his parents lived.

Very little focus on his parents, but it is revealed at some point. Don't wanna spoil to much in the very unlikely event that you haven't already read the fic.
