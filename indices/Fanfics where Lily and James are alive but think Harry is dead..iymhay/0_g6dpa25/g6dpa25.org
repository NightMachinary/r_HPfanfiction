I've got a few. I love these types of stories as well! (Darkness Within is my all time favorite.)

Okay, first off is a story you may have read. It's the story that "Darkness Within" was based off of. It's called "A Shattered Prophesy." I will admit, I'm hesitant to recommend this one, because it is tragic. There's no special reconnection with Lily and James. If you are looking for a happy ending, then this is not the story for you.

Secondly, is a story called "Love and Love Again." I loved this one, but I will warn you it is NOT complete. I believe it was around thirty chapters in. It is unlike the others I am recommending, because Harry's backstory is different. He was not raised by Voldemort in this one.

Lastly, is called "Light up the Sky." Again this is NOT complete (sorry) but I enjoyed it anyways. It was really cute and nice.

Hope these are helpful. :)
