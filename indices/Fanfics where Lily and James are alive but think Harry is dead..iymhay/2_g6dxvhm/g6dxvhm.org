I'm gonna have to recommend linkffn(From Ruin by GraeFoxx).

It isn't complete yet (and probably won't be for a good while yet), but as a patron of the author I can guarantee they're still working on it. There's also a lot of it already written.

It's very dark, though. There are much darker fics, of course, but From Ruin gets pretty damn dark.
