It's sorta a reverse of what you asked for - Lily and James are alive in St. Mungo's with Harry being unaware of it. It's an interesting take on WBWL where the brother isn't a complete ass, and they make up when they meet their parents. It also contains Dumbledore bashing that doesn't turn the guy into a caricature - him just being a guy who makes mistakes and is really hated by Harry. And something that's even rarer - a Daphne Greengrass that's a character, rather then a walking cliche.
