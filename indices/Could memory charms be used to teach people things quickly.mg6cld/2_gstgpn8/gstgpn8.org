I'm not sure - the impression I get is that memory charms are imperfect, and provoke plenty of confusion in the people charmed, without crystal clear memories. So taking that view, it seems unlikely that the memory charm that implants fake memories would be able to do detailed enough ones to teach useful things.

Alternatively, it might be tied to the user's skill in visualizing the memory. In that case, your idea might work - though it depends on how many people at once it could be used on (if it's being cast on a bunch of people individually, it might just be easier to have a normal class). Though I imagine they might not be 'integrated' into our other memories as nicely.

Instead, what I think might work better would be transferring actual memories, instead. So for a mentor fic, say someone is struggling to, IDK, 'see' magic. The mentor might be able to 'transfer' a memory directly of what they experience when doing so - with necessary downsides to explain why a pensieve is typically necessary.
