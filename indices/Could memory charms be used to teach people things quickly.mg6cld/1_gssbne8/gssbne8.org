I remember one such fic!! Harry there put the memories of meditation in his head to boost his Occlumency. He also did the same thing with some other subjects. He was in the first year and then took exams and quickly advanced to higher years if I remember correctly. There was also something about Hermione? She wished to do the same? She also had an eidetic memory. Dumbledore was somehow connected to this. It was gen and pretty interesting.
