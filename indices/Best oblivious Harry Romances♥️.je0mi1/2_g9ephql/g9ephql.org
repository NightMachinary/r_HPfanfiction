I kinda wanna see this with someone like Katie Bell -- because more Katie/Harry is a good thing.

Although, I could see it as an amusing situation if, in some alternate universe, Narcissa gave birth to a girl instead of Draco.

Over time, other Slytherins and Gryffindors arch eyebrows when the she and Harry rant off about the other, with their noting that both seem to be obliviously obsessed with hating the other.
