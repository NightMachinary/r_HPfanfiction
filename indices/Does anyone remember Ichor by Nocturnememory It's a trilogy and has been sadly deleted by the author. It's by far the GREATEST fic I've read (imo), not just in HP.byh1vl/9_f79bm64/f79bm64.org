I am sooo thankful for this thread. I hope Nocturne sees it. I adored her writing, it was hard, soethimes unpleasant but it was beautiful and sooo well written and you could sense her pouring all her heart into it. It was so mature, so poetic, so stunning.

​

It is a shame that such a community as ao3 would treat one of it's own that way. I haven't seen it so I can't comment but apparently that was the reason of her leaving :<. Especially since she tagged her stories sooo carefully and her writitng was hardly in top 10 of unusulal HP tropes. She was sooo humbe and kind and I do agree with [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Pookingshet/][u/Pookingshet]] , I do respect her decision and it's heartbreaking that she did not feel comfortable in the fanfiction community :(.I wanr people to remember er, it is quite hearbreaking and funny in a way that stories ere, on the internet, can get forgotten and lost but they deserve to be remembered, for the next generation of readers/writers alike.

Nocturnememory, I hope you are getting better and we love you <3 take your time and we still think of you, your magnificent works, rememeber that :)
