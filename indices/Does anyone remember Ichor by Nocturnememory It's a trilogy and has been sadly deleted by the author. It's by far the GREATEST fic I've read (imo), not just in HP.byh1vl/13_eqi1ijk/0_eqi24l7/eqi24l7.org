Except it was all tagged and warned for, many many times so... If you haven't read the story obviously this post was not for you...so why comment? Also, petunia and Dudley are blonde, the whole point of changing Harrie physically was in an attempt to explain why no one in the muggle world looked twice at how out of place harry seemed in a family like the dursleys. Harrie looks more like petunia, thin and blonde, it made perfect sense.

I don't understand the hate on hair colour, I've seen so many creature fics, so many op!Harry where he's suddenly a Calvin Klein Model (actual words used too) or fics where he's another race altogether... Like what does it matter what he/she looks like, if the writing is good, if it can be made sense of.... Then who cares?
