That wasn't stated in the original post, so how was I to know that? I did qualify my statement.

Generally something like that would. Be changed for one of three reasons:

1. Lily had an affair with a blonde person, and the story is gonna have the whole 'your real father' thing
2. The story is gonna cast Harry as a similar personality as the other blonde characters in the series (stuck up Slytherin or dreamy ravenclaw).
3. It is to change how Snape acts toward Harry. (Not looking like father/mother to avoid the standard reactions).

I would consider the first two of those red flags for a fic. The third one is a bit more acceptable. It doesn't sound like the fic in question here went for any of these, but you wanted to know why it would be concerning.
