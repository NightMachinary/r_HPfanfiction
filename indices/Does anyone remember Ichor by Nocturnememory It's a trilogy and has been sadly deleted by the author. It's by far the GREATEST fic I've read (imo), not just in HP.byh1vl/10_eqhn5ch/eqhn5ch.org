I had a copy somewhere, but I'm not even sure where I put it. Whenever I mention that someone messages me to ask about it so I redouble my efforts to find it, but I don't know where it's gone and that makes me sad. I half suspect it was on my stolen phone...

Edit: after digging through fairly extensively, it appears Nocturnememory was very thorough with purging it from the internet, even requesting that The Wayback Machine exclude it.
