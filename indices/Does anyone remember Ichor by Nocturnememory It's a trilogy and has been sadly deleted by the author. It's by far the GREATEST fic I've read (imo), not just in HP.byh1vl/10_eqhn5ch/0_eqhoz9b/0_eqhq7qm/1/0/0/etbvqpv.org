I do indeed have /Yes, I have a thousand tongues/ and /Charity, thou art a lie/ in my archive - but 12702000 is a story called /All of the Cursed Characters: A Parody/ so probably not what you're looking for!

Both the first two are marked as in-progress though, with /Yes, I have a thousand tongues/ having 11 chapters, and /Charity, thou art a lie/ having 7.

If you want these, let me know and I can PM you download links.
