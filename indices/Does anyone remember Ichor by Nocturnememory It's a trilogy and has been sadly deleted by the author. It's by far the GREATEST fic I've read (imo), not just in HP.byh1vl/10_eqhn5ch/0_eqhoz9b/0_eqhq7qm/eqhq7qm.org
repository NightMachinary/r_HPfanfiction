I'm actually incredibly tempted to pay for personal access to one of the other archive sites, but I'm worried it'll be fruitless. Do you know of any of the illegal/grey area archive sites other than fichunt and fanfics.me? Fichunt had it removed, and fanfics.me doesn't have it.

I also searched through torrenting sites to see if it had been uploaded to no avail. I don't believe for one moment that it doesn't exist somewhere on the internet, the question is simply where?

Actually, I just found a near complete scrape of FFN that ran from 2013 to 2015, which means part of her stories are likely there, assuming she started one by about early 2015. I might download it and unpack it to see what's there, but it is very large.

I know that the bot offers ePUBs when called for fics, but I haven't managed to find a comment that linked it yet.
