In retrospect, this is absolutely hilarious and very desperate. It appears that the bot pulls ePUBs directly from the site, so that doesn't work. screenshots.com is the most common paid archive, and Alexa is another. I just found a scrape from the same guy who previously scraped FFN, so I guess I'll dig through that since it's more recent and from only a year ago.
