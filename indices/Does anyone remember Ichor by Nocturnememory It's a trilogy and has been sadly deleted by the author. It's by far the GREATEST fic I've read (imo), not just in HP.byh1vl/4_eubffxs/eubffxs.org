I loved the Ichor trilogy. It was beautifully written, and poetic and wonderful. It could be very emotionally heavy but there was something about it that I just kept coming back to. There's this line, and I can't remember the exact wording, where Harrie is clearly afraid of Voldemort but she lifts her chin and steels her spine and meets him head on. There was a resilience and bravery in her that just drew me in. I miss this fic so much. Like so much. I'm so sad for the hate that nocturne received when she obviously poured so much love and thought into her writing.

If anyone ever gets notice of her coming back around with her writing I would love to know.
