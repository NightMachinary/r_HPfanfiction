I actually don't know this, and thank you for pointing it out. The fic seems immensely popular as well (and has recently been updated too!) but since I haven't read it, I can't judge.

I respect your opinions on Ichor. It's not a fic that can easily be read or enjoyed by everyone. But we share the same opinion on Cursed Child. I can't take that Delphi bull crap.
