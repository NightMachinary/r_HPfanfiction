I don't know if I should laugh or not, but the way the other author said it is like she was treating Nocturne like a joke. She's just-- /whoosh/ -- cast aside. What's funnier is that it's still up. And really? Even the other fics? Like vowed, or the 'big bad wolf' where Harry thought Tom was a thief and she nursed him (forgot the title), or the mermaid one? Damn.
