It was Ichor and the one where harry meets Harrie, a whole conversation about not being afraid of the dark, down to repeated words and inflection.

I didn't like the story anyway, but that made it 100 times worse, because the author clearly used inspiration not just from nocturnememory but also two other authors and she only briefly mentions the other to /after/ nocturnememory told her she should credit where she gets her ideas from. I can't remember the author now, one is ellory, a bunch of her pureblood ideas and the other wrote a fic all about runes with a dark female harry, but I'm drawing a blank in the name. A lot was taken from others imo.
