Yeah, there's actually a whole comment thread where nocturnememory tried to get the author to acknowledge that she took lines, like direct lines from one of her other fics too, not even Ichor. And the author said she would 'reword' it so it wasn't so similar haha, which is just ridiculous when it was a straight up word for word copy of a conversation.
