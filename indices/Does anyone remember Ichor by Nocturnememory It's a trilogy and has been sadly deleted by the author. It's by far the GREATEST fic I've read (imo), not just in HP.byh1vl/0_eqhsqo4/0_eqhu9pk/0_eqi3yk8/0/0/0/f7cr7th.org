Is it taken from The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/samvelg/pseuds/samvelg][samvelg]]? Are you kidding me? :o I had no idea the author was so disrespectful/ ridiculous to actually plagiarize Nocturne. I myself read the story, although it couldn't hold a candle to Nocturne, it was, okay? (My tolerance is low, but one can't be too picky with as there are just few gems with this particular pairing, imo ;p)

â€‹

Is that common (as common as it can be I guess) knowledge?

Which is even more ridiculous as it is one of the most popular pieces of work with that pairing on Ao3 :___;

I always held that side in highest of regards, both the wide scope of themes there, the authors themselves moved from [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] :( this is just heartbreaking.
