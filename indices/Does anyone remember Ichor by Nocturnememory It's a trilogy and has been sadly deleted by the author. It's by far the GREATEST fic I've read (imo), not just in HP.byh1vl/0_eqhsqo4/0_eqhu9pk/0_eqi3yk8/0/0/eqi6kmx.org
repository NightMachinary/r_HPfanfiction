If you read it because you're jonesing for something that feels like Ichor, prepare for disappointment. Because not only does it poorly regurgitate Ichor's themes and imagery, but it uses a lot of the cheesey old Indie Harry tropes as well. Fem!Harry in that fic gets that Gringotts will reading and becomes Heir Potter-Black, and also gets a creature inheritance. Though I'd say the worst part would be the complete destruction of Voldemort's character, by making him a moral crusader instead of a selfish narcissist.

Chapter 22:

  "I immediately decided that the logical course of action would, of course, be to overthrow the muggle-loving government who was abolishing our traditions and in some cases even making them illegal, because safeguarding the Purebloods would have the dual benefit of protecting both the Olde Ways and the Ancient Houses. The hope was for it to buy me enough time in which to find a more permanent solution to the real problem of magic dying a slow and painful death."

  He gritted out between his teeth. "That this is a war for the fate of magic itself, and that the means will always be justified when the ends are so vitally important."

  She rubbed her face, unable to believe that a man as intelligent as Voldemort was really this appallingly thick. "I'm going to be completely honest, knowing what I do now about the Fade I'm not even sure that your winning isn't actually maybe, maybe a good thing. And I mean that is one hell of a maybe Voldemort. It's definitely something I'm going to have to sit down and think about, but only on the condition you stop treating 'saving magic' and 'not committing genocide' as if they're mutually exclusive!"

  "Muggles are the reason for so much of this mess and the most immediate and direct threat to our way of life." He sneered. "They are killing the planet with their pollution and their overpopulation and their greed, and if we don't find a way to deal with them then we're unlikely to make it another century before they've either decided to kill off either us or each other and indiscriminately blow everything away! You might have forgotten what it was like to huddle in a cramped air raid shelter night after night, listening to the bombs dropping all around and wondering if the next one was going to be the one that finally killed us, but I never have. They have to be stopped!"
