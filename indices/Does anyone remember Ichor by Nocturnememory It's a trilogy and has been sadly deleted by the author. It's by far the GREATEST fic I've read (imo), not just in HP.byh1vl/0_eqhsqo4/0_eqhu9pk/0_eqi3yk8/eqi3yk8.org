There was also an incident with another author writing a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14695419/chapters/33957573][similar themed fic]] (Fem!Harry shipped with Voldemort, who discovers they have shared souls), copying elements of characterization and imagery, and straight up plagiarizing a couple of lines from Nocturne, with zero credit. (Though I won't hesitate to say everything in the copycat fic is inferior. The author doesn't know how to use punctuation, and it's infuriating.)

The similarities are eerie.

From Nocturne:

#+begin_quote
  He wonders how she can place such importance on other people when she has his fucking soul in her chest. How much more of a home can one carve out in another person? How much more of himself---

  How infuriating it is to know the succession of her thoughts, the succession of affection she holds for other people when he---

  How much more of a home could that be?

From Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  /Now you need to accept us, all we are and are not, and accept that once you made a home in me. Open up your eyes and ears and your nose Harry, your heart and your mind and everything you are, so that I may in turn make a home in you as well./ He told her all this with solemn inevitability, holding the waiting dark in his red right hand.

That said, I thought the writing of Ichor was polished, but it was way too angsty for my taste, and I didn't like the characterization. Harry was okay, but turned into a punching bag for drama, via X_TREME Dursley abuse worse than canon, and later Voldemort abuse. I wasn't a fan of Voldemort's characterization either; the buff horndog Voldemort doesn't work for me, because I've always interpreted him to be asexual, or at least uninterested in working out or obsessing about his physical/sexual needs when he could spend his time obsessing about magical power. And pursuit of magic above all other considerations like body, soul, or afterlife, is what I consider one of his defining traits.

The reason I didn't like him in Ichor is the same reason why I couldn't buy the Daddy Voldemort of Cursed Child.
