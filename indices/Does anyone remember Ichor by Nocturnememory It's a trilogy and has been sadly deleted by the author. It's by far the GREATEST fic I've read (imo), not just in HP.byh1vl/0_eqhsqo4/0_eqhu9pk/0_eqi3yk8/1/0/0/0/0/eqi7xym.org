That's fine, obviously we have very different interpretations of Voldemort because I read most of those lines as Voldemort just being an egotistical, still insane, children's book character and the more human versions in fic are infinitely better than what we saw as they actually try to rectify who tom riddle seemed to be compared to Voldemort. You know, smart, cunning, willing to manipulate via looks and popularity... Anyway, I'm not a canon purist, obviously, but if I was, I mean... Voldemort did have a kid, lol. So the dude did have sex at some point, enough to get a kind with Bellatrix so...

There's that :)
