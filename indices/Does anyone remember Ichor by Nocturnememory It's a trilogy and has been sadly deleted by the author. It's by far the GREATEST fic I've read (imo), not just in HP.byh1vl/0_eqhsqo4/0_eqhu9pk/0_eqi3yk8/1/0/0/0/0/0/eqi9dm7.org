I don't disagree that Voldemort is an egotistical dickwad. My personal interpretation leans toward Voldemort being delusional enough to believe that he's transcended humanity, even when he hasn't. But a big part of his persona is being aspirational, which is why he rejects his muggle origins and re-names himself Lord Flight of Death, rejects his muggle father's looks, and tries to reject everything he thinks will make him weak, including physical/emotional desire. He's also hypocritical as fuck, because he exhibits greed and triumph, but it's what he thinks he is that's important.

I also believe that Tom Riddle and Voldemort are the same person, as shown in that line, "Voldemort is my past, present, and future". Tom isn't Voldemort's human side, and there was no point that Tom Riddle suddenly decided to become Voldemort. Tom was always delusional, narcissistic, ambitious, impulsive, egotripping, with no moral boundaries or limits, and that's exactly the same character traits that make Voldemort the monster he is. Tom Riddle is just someone with a handful of external limits preventing him from being as monstrous as he wanted to be.

Quoting [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s post on Tom Riddle:

  There's a common theme in fanon that Voldemort "lost" something when he stopped being Tom Riddle and became Lord Voldemort. Usually this is done to enable a Harry/Voldemort pairing, by making "Tom" more reasonable than Voldemort was. But this is just not how Tom Riddle was. Tom Riddle did not "become" Lord Voldemort. He was always Lord Voldemort, always cruel and sadistic and inhuman. He's a psychopath, simple as. "Tom Riddle" was the mask, not some kind of more rational, calmer person who developed into Voldemort. When I read about Tom Riddle at Hogwarts, I want to be reading about someone who is having to constantly hide and restrain their true nature in order to present a front to the world. If Tom is to develop into a person who is capable of living peacefully within wizarding society rather than practising murder as a hobby, then this is a development which has to be shown, not a characteristic which is within him from the start.
