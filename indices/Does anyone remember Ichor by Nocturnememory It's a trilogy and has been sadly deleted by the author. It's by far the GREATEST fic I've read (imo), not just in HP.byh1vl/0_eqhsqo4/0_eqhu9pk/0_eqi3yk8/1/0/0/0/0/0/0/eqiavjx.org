Except this is literally what nocturnememorys Voldemort is, minus the description of psychopath. He says it many times, he is lord Voldemort, he isn't ever referred to as Tom riddle unless it's actually dealing with Tom riddle. The only caveat that nocturnememory makes is that Voldemort, at the height of splitting his soul six times was not as intellectually sound as he was...which, completely reasonable imo. He went after a freaking /baby/ like...that is not a sound choice of an apparently incredibly smart villain, sorry, but no. Nocturnememory herself says that Tom riddle was the boy, Voldemort is the man. There's no difference between the two, only the amount of soul he had at any given time.

I, for one, don't believe he intentionally mutated himself physically, just like Grindelwald it was a side effect of dark magic exacerbated by his Horcruxes. He always thought he was above everyone else, even when he was a child, him changing his physical appearance was a byproduct not a goal. The last time we saw Tom riddle as tom riddle, he's still aiming to maintain his 'mask' by applying to the dada position, whatever goals he had, that doesn't scream someone looking to throw off their human form entirely. He can still be 'other' without looking it and it would seem, interpreting the text, he had goals to do so.
