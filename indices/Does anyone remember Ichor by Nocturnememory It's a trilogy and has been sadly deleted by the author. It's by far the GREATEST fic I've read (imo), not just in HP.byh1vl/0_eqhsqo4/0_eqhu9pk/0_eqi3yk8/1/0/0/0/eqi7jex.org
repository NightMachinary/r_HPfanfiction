Perhaps it's overdone in fanfic, but the reason why it's so pervasive is because there's a lot of evidence in canon. Voldemort might be human and complex, but he doesn't see himself as human, and chooses to reject his humanity (destroying his soul and becoming a snakeman) and human weaknesses (mortality, emotional fallibility, desire for friendship and kindred/familial connection).

  "Is that right?" said Frank roughly. "Lord, is it? Well, I don't think much of your manners, my Lord. Turn round and face me like a man, why don't you?"

  "But I am not a man, Muggle," said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. "I am much, much more than a man. However ... why not? I will face you ... Wormtail, come turn my chair around."

Voldemort rejects the things that makes him human, because they disgust him and remind him of weakness. Accepting and embracing his human desires, especially if they require the involvement of other people, doesn't seem like him. Voldemort hates the idea of depending on other people (even though he is forced to multiple times by circumstance) and that was the whole idea behind using horcruxes instead of relying on a potion for immortality.

It's all well and good for an author to write whatever they like, that's the beauty of fanfiction. However, reading Ichor was an extended session of suspending my disbelief, because it felt like I was reading a very out there AU interpretation of Voldemort. It was well written, but it was difficult for me to reconcile myself with the idea of the character /being/ Voldemort, and my immersion level ultimately affected my overall enjoyment of the fic. I am very aware that I'm a canon purist, and this wasn't the only thing that bugged me. Another was Ichor Harrie referring to her mother as "Mommy", in the American spelling.

Some people don't care, some do. Different strokes and all that.
