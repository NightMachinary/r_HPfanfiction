I respect you don't like voldemort, but I never understood asexual Voldemort at all. But that's me, it's so predictable and boring, just like labeling him a pure psychopath like most people do. He's complicated and very human in Ichor and they appeals to me. Something completely new that worked really well for who he could have been in a more adult book.

As for the abuse, Im pretty sure the whole point was to show how someone could overcome the things done to them, how someone else could grow as well in regards to their own choices, like yeah...it was a character piece, but it was human and complicated and they was the whole appeal of it and something, if you followed nocturnememory, would have seen was her whole reason for writing. A lot of het posts are still there on Tumblr, she really wanted to explore the characters and the consequences of choices and the whole Horcrux soul thing.... I think people really just didn't want to read what she was saying in her author notes, that all clearly stated it was primarily a story about those to characters and how to get them from one place to another.
