I think I'm going to disagree with you too, it's all there in the implication in canon, it's just that it is a kids book. I'm pretty sure if it was more adult, all of these things would have happened. Vernon yells and belittles harry, petunia swings at him and belittles him, he's harry hunted constantly and has zero friends until he's 11. Hes skinny and wearing taped glasses and hand me downs that don't even begin to fit. Hes locked in a cupboard. He doesn't get fed properly. He does chores that Dudley doesn't have to do.... Sorry, but I'm pretty sure the abuse is canon, it's just actually addressed in fic compared to canon.
