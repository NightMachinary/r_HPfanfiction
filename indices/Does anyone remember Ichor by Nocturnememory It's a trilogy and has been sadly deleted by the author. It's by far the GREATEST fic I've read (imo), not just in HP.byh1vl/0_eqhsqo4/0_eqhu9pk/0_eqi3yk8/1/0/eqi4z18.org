Yes, I did read it. They're like 25% rougher on her in the fic than in canon. Canon Harry doesn't get seconds but isn't starved until 2nd year when Vernon installs the capflap, and the Dursleys just tell him James and Lily died in a car crash. They make a point of pretending James and Lily never even existed, instead of trying mock him for being an orphan, or passive aggressively hinting about the magic.

  Bruises blossom along arms, old aches alight along a spine; her memories are doused in hunger, in half-remembered pains and the green and purple tinge of bruised skin. She's too thin, too pale, her hair is a tangled mop around her face, thick and golden like a gnarled halo. There's a faded bruise around her wrist and then the cold, snick of scissors that jab into hair, scrape her ears. The pieces fall around her eyes, like gold feathers floating past, settling like a defeat around her.

  Harrie learns the word mother at school, her aunt sneers at the word, she's dead, you don't have a mother... Trust she'd burden me with you, like she hasn't taken enough.

  Malnutrition is not something one would see in the middle of a suburb in Little Whinging. And Abuse, well, that belongs to the dark of a cupboard, doesn't it? Not to the bright of a London day.

And on the Voldemort abuse, yes, I know it was there and it was tagged. I'm not complaining about its existence, just the fact that the angst contains a lot of repeated emotional beats that may be a realistic depiction of abuse survivors, but in the context of a narrative, slows the pacing to the point where any sense of an act structure (beginning/rising tension, middle/building tension, end/resolving tension) or linear progress becomes muddled. The characterization of the story was thorough, but ultimately it read more like a character study fic than anything else.
