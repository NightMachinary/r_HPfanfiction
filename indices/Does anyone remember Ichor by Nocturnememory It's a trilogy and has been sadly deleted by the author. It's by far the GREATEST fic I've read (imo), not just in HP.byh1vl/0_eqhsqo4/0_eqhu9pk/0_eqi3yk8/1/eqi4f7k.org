There was no Xtreme dursley abuse, nothing outside of canon at all...did you read the fic? It mentions Vernon grabbing her and stuff, and their cruelty of ignoring her. The worst we saw was then locking her up the same way they did to harry, with the cat flap in the door of the spare bedroom.

And yeah, there was Voldemort abuse, it was pretty much the whole point of the fic...again, which was warned for, right from the beginning, I mean, it was based on a non-con fic and clearly clearly labelled what it was about and where the idea came from...
