People complained. A lot. First was because of Harry's character. It was genderbent, blonde (but the reason was actual good, and all fics had Harry [or Harrie] either red or black haired, so it's pretty refreshing), and in here she was slightly more aggressive, one who can bite and give snarkier remarks. They told her it 'this' wasn't Harry, or that maybe this was a self-insert.

Second was the rude comments posted on every update. Each of her chapters were very long, and to see harsh comments after posting something you worked very hard on? Not the best thing.

And third, I think she mentioned about comparing her fic to other fics, and she was tired of comparing. But I know she said this far before deleting it. Sorry this is so long, I wish you had read it before it was taken down :")) it was really good.
