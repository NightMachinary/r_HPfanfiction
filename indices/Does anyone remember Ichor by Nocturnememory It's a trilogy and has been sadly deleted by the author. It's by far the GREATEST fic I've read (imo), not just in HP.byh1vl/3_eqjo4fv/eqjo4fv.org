I'm a fan as well. Ichor was great imo, but I also really enjoyed her 1-shots. The selkie one, which I just posted a thread about the other day, as well as the 1 shot where Harry and Tom are at Wool's for the summer and something about Harry eating an apple gets Tom all hot and bothered... top notch in my book!ðŸ¥´

Even if she stopped posting stories, I hope she's at least still writing for her own enjoyment.
