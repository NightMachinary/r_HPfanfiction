The last time I spoke with her, she said even if she didn't come back to finish, she'd post the fic eventually, she just wanted more control who had access because she's also had a lot of issues with people copying lines directly from her stories without credit. I think people honestly just forgot she was a first time author who got a lot of hate for something she loved and put a lot of time in. I was part of a tomarry discord for a time and there were so many rude comments about the story and the author herself that I left. And then, even on one fandom rec list I saw, the recc'er went out of their way to mention how Harrie wasn't really harry at all... And like, I miss talking to the author on Tumblr, but I can't imagine getting that much dislike/flack for some choices you made in regards to gender. And every thing made sense!? Harrie and tom were the most Human versions of those characters I've ever seen, she didn't ignore Harrie's childhood or muggles upbringing, Tom wasn't just some cut and paste textbook psycho like he often is... It's just ugh. Annoying.
