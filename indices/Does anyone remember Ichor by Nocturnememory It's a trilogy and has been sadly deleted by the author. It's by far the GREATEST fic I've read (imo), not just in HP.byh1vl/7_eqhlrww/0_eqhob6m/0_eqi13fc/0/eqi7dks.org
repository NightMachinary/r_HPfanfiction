I just made an account on WordPress. Here's to hoping I get in? I can't believe people would plagiarize her work get more recognition than her. It's hard to see a sweet person get picked apart for something she loves and worked hard on. I was also a part of the tomarry discord, but only for a short while. They were very... Passionate. Don't have many words for them.
