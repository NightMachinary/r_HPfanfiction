Oh gosh I remember when Tom let her punch him in the face, AND HE WAS SO PROUD OF HER AND I THINK SHE LEFT HIM A CUT ON HIS FACE! Thank you for reminding me, I almost forgot about that. Do you also remember the lines where there would be something about ribs? It was so poetic, I was awestruck.

And that time they practiced wandless magic and stuff, when there would be goblins walking freely in diagon alley, Tom letting Harry have a go with her broom at the manor-- gods, it makes my heart ache. Those aren't even the most memorable ones but they're all I could remember.

I also sent her an email. I don't think we'll ever get a reply, but I hope she read it. All of our emails. I want her to know we're here to support her.
