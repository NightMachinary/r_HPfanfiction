i was also incredibly invested in ichor and i'm glad i'm not the only one. there are so many little charming parts i wish i could reread - the part where voldemort kneels to be eye level with harrie so she can practice throwing a punch at his hand. the horror when he finds out about the dursleys while they're training and she points out that she's used to taking a hit, and he just says, “i would never hurt you.” all the moodboards nocturne would post on tumblr. :(

i remember i'd check ao3 every day for an update and every time i saw one i was so excited, and then it just disappeared. i shot her an email ages ago but i don't think she will be replying. i hope she's doing okay! i have my fingers crossed i'll get to read this fic again and wholeheartedly share your sentiments, it's the best one i've ever seen regardless of fandom.
