It's not a wish. It is a spell that has to be cast together by two people involved in a moment of time. Voldemort convinces Harry to use the spell with him by saying that they can simply go back and look at what happened. Harry can see his parents again. If he doesn't want to change anything, he can simply walk away and the spell would dissipate and that would be that. But of course, once they get back there and he sees his mother pleading for her life, he can't do it. He prevents her from sacrificing herself so he can grow up with her.

At first, the new life is great. He has his mother (James had already been killed), Snape is his step-father and really loves him, he has a sister (half, with Snape and Lily), etc. But he and his family serve Voldemort, and with no "Boy Who Lived", the world is going to hell, which he just didn't think through in the heat of the moment.

So he tricks the diary into reverting it back to the original timeline, and then uses his knowledge from the alternate timeline to befriend Draco and Snape, and make changes for the better.
