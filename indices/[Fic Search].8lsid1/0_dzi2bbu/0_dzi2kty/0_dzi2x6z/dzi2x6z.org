Why doesn't he just wish for their parents not changing secret keepers? Or anything else that would be more reasonable? Or even better if he can make one change, why not change the prophecy so that he doesn't have to be the BWL? ... and if it absolutely has to be a stupid change, why not just make Lily run away one night before Halloween? The whole "serve Voldemort" thing just sounds retarded... why would Voldemort ever accept such a deal?
