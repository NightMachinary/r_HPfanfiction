I literally so not give a single flying fuck if some random person in the world is trans or not. The only thing I do t like about people transitioning is all the computer systems me or my team have to manually change because nothing has a "change this name" button. That's it. Let people live their lives how they like it, but don't comment on something that doesn't matter to you.
