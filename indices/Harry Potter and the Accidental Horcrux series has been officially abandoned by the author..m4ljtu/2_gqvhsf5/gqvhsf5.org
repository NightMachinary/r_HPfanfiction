I respect the authors decision. I have to say though, this is something I've noticed many times, (and I'm not trying to, like, brag) but I not only separate the author from their work, but have a hard time /not/ doing that. It's genuinely hard for me to connect the feelings/beliefs of an artist to their work, unless the work is about the feelings/beliefs in question. Am I alone in this?
