I feel the same way, but have made the decision to try not to spend money on anything that JK owns the rights to (and if I /must/ have whatever it is, then give equal amounts to trans rights charities.) I can understand an author deciding not to spend their time on something, even if JK wont monetarily benefit from it, she still has massive amount of power cultural.
