Not at all, I'll always love some of Orson Scott Card's works, for instance. But it does get harder when the author is still alive and constantly spewing new "feelings" and beliefs that belittle you personally. And possibly publishing new works- that might tie into the works you love- showcasing those insults. And everyone is constantly identifying them as the author of the works you like, and people are going back through the works you like to try and see evidence of the author's feeling influencing those works.

It sound like the fanfic author still has good memories of Harry Potter, but at this point it's just a constant reminder because the news cycle is always throwing the concepts together that "the author of Harry Potter hates trans people" so if you pay a lot of attention to Harry Potter issues and trans issues after a while the separation becomes more difficult- ever play one of those word association games? If someone said "Harry Potter" there's a good amount of people now who would blurt out first thing"-hates trans people!" because that's what they associate it with.
