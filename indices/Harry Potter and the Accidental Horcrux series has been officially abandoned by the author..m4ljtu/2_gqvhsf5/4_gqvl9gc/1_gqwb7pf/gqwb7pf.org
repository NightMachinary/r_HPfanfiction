The problem is that having dead animals contaminate the water is a real issue with real noticeable effects on the quality of the water. So obviously, everyone would care and not be willing to swim in a pool that has dead animals rotting in it.

A more fair comparison would be that you find out that the guy who owns the swimming pool made homophobic slurs. Like, that sucks. But it's not going to retroactively pollute the water.

For me, I like Harry Potter, I like Harry Potter books, Harry Potter fanfiction, Harry Potter movies and I want to play Hogwarts Legends. I get that it sucks Rowling is a terf. But that doesn't effect Harry Potter for me at all.

Besides, if you think Rowling is bad, try being a fan of Ender's Game. Welles really forced me to compartmentalize the work from the author.
