That's the way life is, mate. You have to get along with people despite their differences. At least insofar as this stuff goes. I mean, it's just Harry Potter for heavens sake. It's not like we're sharing toothbrushes and all.

If we like the same characters and we like the story, we can get along in that way. And so we should. I couldn't care less what JK herself thinks. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the books previously, it won't affect me now. Now if we don't like the characters and don't like the story, that's something else. In which case, well we can find other stories and other people to connect with. 7 billion individuals out there, loads of stuff to enjoy, with people we can find common values with.

And this is why I don't agree with the extremes of modern cancel culture.

But that might be off the subject...
