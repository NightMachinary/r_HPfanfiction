No you're not, and happy cake day.

There are so many different views in the world - publicly aired and not - that you will lose a lot of enjoyment if you cancel all the literature and art in the world simply because of the views their creators held.

The Sorting Hat said to get along. Sometimes that means getting along with people who have different views of the universe. Funny how, for a bunch of "fans", we don't really put that into action. Funny how, for a bunch of oh so celebratedly "tolerant" people, we don't seem to tolerate much.

Oh well. My 2 knuts.
