Personally, I'm someone who tends to do things out of sheer spite, and it's had me involved in a great many things that I otherwise might not have glanced at twice. This isn't the decision that I would make. But it's also a decision that I can definitely understand, nonetheless.

We don't control this human's actions, and frankly, I wouldn't want to be someone that tried to keep them active in a fandom that would only just remind them that there's someone out there they've devoted a great deal of their attention, time, and joy towards that doesn't believe they should live comfortably, or as themselves.

Something like that can be absolutely devastating to people, and trying to convince them to continue on with it /might/ end up with a bit more to read, but it won't change the pain that Rowling's statement left behind in them.

If leaving is what they've chosen to do, then so be it. That's fine. I only hope that one day they can find the same joy it once inspired in another thing, and that, someday, Rowling sees sense, and it won't hurt so bad.
