I come from the same perspective. I'm also a trans fanfiction author and honestly? The fanfic I'm working right now barely counts as canon. I've changed the magical system, the characters were mostly unexplored, I'm using all the open spots here.

As a kid, I thought the books were amazing. But re-reading since I was 14, I started realising world building errors, bad writing and a lot of things that could be edited and made better. So that's what I'm doing now, years later. I'm not fixing it, but exploring it to it's full potential. Expansive world building, new magical system, make it darker, explore the horcrux creations, explore the more mysterious and grimdark side of the magical universe. And, most of all, make it queer. So queer Miss Joke would try to file a restraining order against me.

So yeah. The big joke with my friends is that until I get a restraining order or a cease and desist? I'll carry on writing fanfic and putting every thing she thought was too dark out in the open. I just hope one day we all get to see the look on her face when she finds out there are trans authors that wrote fanfic better than she did her books and are more loved.
