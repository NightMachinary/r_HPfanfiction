Oh, I didn't know that the author was trans.

Yeah, it really sucks how many good fics have been abandoned because of JKR's comments. The author of Malarkia has really slowed down their update pace for similar reasons.

Speaking as another transgender fanfiction author, I've been doing my best to keep updating, mostly because I view my fics as defiling her work and there's no way she can stop me from making gender transition both a widespread and commonly accepted thing in the magical world. Hermione is gay, Harry is nonbinary, Tom Riddle fucks, and no one can stop me!
