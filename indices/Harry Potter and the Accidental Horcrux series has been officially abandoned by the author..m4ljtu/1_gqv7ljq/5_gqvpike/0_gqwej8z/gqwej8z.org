linkao3(Departure from the Diary) A slowburn, realistically paced romance between Harry and fem!diary!Tom. The two are forced to work together out of necessity following a different series of events in the Chamber of Secrets. Heavy themes of corruption.

linkao3(Scrambled Sorting) nonbinary Harry. It hasn't come up yet in the story, but that's how I write him. Also features several differences from canon, a Dumbledore who is both good and competent (if a bit wacky), an extreme large cast, and heavy themes of anarchy.

linkao3(Unseen Perspective) Have you ever wanted to read a fic where Voldemort is an unhip mom? She's dead set on mentoring Harry and has a moody teenage daughter. Harry keeos doubting his sanity because Voldemort keeps showing up at Privet Drive and taking him out to lunch and is constantly upfront with him about a lot of things.

Hermione is gay in all of my fics, though whether or not that's relevant varies.
