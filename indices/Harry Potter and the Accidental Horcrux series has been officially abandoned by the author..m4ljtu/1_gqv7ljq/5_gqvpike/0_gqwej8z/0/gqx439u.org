Scrambled Sorting is one, if not my absolute favourite HP Story, and I'm glad you're finally feeling well enough to update again.

NB Harry is something I'm looking forward to. That and more chaotic neutral Tracy and Neutral/Chaotic Good Dumbledore. I love those two; gotta be the best versions I've seen of both.
