I'm another trans author, and it has been very gratifying to see the number of people who have gone and said "Author's a terf? Well I'm gonna just make my story a million % queerer as a fuck-you."\\
But I also get where Imaginizer is coming from. It's just hard to muster that same sense of joy and wonder when it's linked to such a miserable person. I'd be lying if I said it hadn't factored into my own hurdles in continuing my fic, (though my writer's block is still primarily just laziness.) I'm still interested in HP as a fandom, but I'm not going to be spending any money on merch or at the Wizarding World any time soon.
