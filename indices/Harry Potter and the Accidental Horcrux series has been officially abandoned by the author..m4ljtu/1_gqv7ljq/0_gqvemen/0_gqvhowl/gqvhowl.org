I mean, I also come at fanfiction from.a very different angle than I think most do. Harry Potter is something I enjoyed a lot as a child but am fairly critical of as an adult. Between the Anglocentrism, poorly handled genre shift, and worldbuilding that feels half-assed at times, I get a media series that I once enjoyed greatly but see large room for improvement.

I do this because Harry Potter has a fascinating premise but fails to deliver in many aspects. I want to take that world and make something new and (hopefully) better out of it.

I also wasn't too heavily affected by the remarks because, being a transgender person in a lot of far left spaces full of other transgender people, there was already a decent amount of suspicion about her views regarding trans people. It felt more like a disappointing confirmation of suspicions than anything else. I do what I can go help combat ignorance about transgender people, because that's all that I can do at the moment
