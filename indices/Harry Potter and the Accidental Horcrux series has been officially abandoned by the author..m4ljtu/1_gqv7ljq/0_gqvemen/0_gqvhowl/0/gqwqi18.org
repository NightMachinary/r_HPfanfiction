Fair enough. It definitely wasn't a surprise when her transphobia blew up last year, and I do remember the reaction on [[/r/transgender][r/transgender]] being basically "We've known that for a while." She had a long history of tweeting suspect stuff for ages before it came out.

And you've said it better than I could in terms of seeing it as an opportunity for improvement. Most of the expanded canon is lazy or bad or problematic, but it can serve as a basis for fans to build upon or revise and not repeat her mistakes.
