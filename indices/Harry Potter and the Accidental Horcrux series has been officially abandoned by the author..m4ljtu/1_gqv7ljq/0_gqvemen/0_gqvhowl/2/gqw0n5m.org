Honestly, at this point I feel like HP is certifiable garbage dug right out of a garbage can... but it's sentimental garbage and people do a lot of really fun and interesting transformative work with that garbage.

Although I didn't see much in the way of suspicion of her transphobia before the whole twitter blow up, I definitely saw people pointing out the inherent racism and antisemitism in her work, so when that happen, it just... wasn't a surprise. It was more like "ah, you know, some stuff makes sense now." The biggest surprise really was how hard she went on it... but again this followed shit like the American Wizarding School houses controversy where she'd already made it clear she doesn't give a shit about who she hurts and doesn't care how much her fans /want/ to support her and help educate her and see her come back from an initially shitty stance.
