It's just more shitty world building regarding native Americans, basically. The four house mascots are completely taken out of context from wildly different cultures and additionally some (? Or all?) are sacred animals that culturally would not be used as a fun school mascot. There's also a specifically shitty history with American (school) sports teams using native Americans themselves as mascots for their teams, so it is sort of a poke in the eye about an already culturally sensitive issue.
