I went to an archery school competition with my team a few years ago and their mascot was a Native American man. I'm not knowledgeable enough to say what tribe the man was from and I doubt the depiction was accurate anyway. They called themselves the Indians and the entire team was disgusted. We never went to another one of their tournaments after we took pictures and told the school we want nothing to do with that.
