  I do this because Harry Potter has a fascinating premise but fails to deliver in many aspects. I want to take that world and make something new and (hopefully) better out of it.

This is what drew me to fanfiction.

I understand what the original author intended to portray. But /I/ don't like it. I want it to do something else. I wanted the author to have written something different. And fanfiction allows you to do exactly that.

I understand that JKR wanted lycanthropy to be some sort of AIDS metaphor. But I don't like it. With fanfiction I can go look for a fic where it's not (although finding a fic without abo is quite hard).

This is what allows me to completely separate the author from their work. I care not for what JKR says for I can /reject/ her canon. I can reject her and her words.
