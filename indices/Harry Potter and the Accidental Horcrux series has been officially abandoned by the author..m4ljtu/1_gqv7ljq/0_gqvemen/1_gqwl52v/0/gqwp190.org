Sorry if I wasn't clear- it's nice to see how many other authors have decided to have their fanfics be that much queerer and diverse in response to JK, but my fanfics were generally written before it all came out, so I'm not really part of that trend. My works are still pretty queer, but my most popular HP fic, Parselbrat, isn't really focused on that.
