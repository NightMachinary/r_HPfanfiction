Because sometimes when someone has painted an image of something (in this case JKR and her books) and that image breaks, like, completely shatters, it's completely normal to start having negative feelings towards things related to that no matter if you want to or not. Everything is associated to that shattered image and your bad feelings towards that and sometimes you just have to let go and move on instead of trying to work past things.
