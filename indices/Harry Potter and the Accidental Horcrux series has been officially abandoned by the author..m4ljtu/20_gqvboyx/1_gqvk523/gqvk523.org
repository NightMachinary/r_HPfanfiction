The book is just part of it, she has been super transphobic and also problematic in a number of other ways on twitter.

She is someone who wants people to think she is an ally, but she doesent really want to work for it. For example: "Dumbledore is gay" well cool, could you like do something with that, like maybe in the movie you are making... the one about young Dumbledore and his ex-lover (which would make an excellent plot point but is not even metioned in the movie (to my memory)) the one that you wrote the fucking screenplay for?

Man idk it is just so frustrating to look up to someone as a writer, who produced your favorite childhood series, literally the metric I judge books in the fiction genre by (at least for overall tone) and see they have let fame get to their head, and now just say shit to appear pc but wont fucking take action, or actually reasearch issues.

It is frustrating because she is famous, she says shit and people listen, she has the ear of the populus and she is filling it with TERF bullshit.

It is totally valid to say 'I can't support this person's work anymore', it is one thing to seperate the works from the artist, but she fucking writes this shit in books man.
