You are probably right here, I honestly don't remember much about the movie besides a snake woman and my dislike of it, however it seemed like (after rewatching clips) it was not the major plot point it should have been. The ideal would have been a movie without the Fantastic Beasts tie in that focuses only on Dumbledore and Grindlewald and actually doccuments their relationship, that would feel like much less of a sell out.
