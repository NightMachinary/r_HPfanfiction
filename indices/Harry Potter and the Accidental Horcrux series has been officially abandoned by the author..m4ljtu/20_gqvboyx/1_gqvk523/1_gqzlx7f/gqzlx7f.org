Note, I agree that it makes sense to be upset about JKR's transphobic comments.

However, I thought the second Grindelwald movie made it pretty clear that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were lovers in the flashback to them doing whatever ritual made them not be able to attack each other? I guess since I already knew they were gay it was clearer than it would have been if I didn't already know that, but that did seem to be what that scene was going for to me.
