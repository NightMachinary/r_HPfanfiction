We mostly don't give a shit about JKR's opinions. Yes they are hurtful, but so are many other people. It's a bit harder to ignore her because of how famous she is, but whatever.

No, the real problem is that she uses her considerable fame and power to convince many of her fans of her views, and thereby contributes to society as a whole being more transphobic, which is very harmful. She is not just some random idiot on twitter who has dumb views, she actively wages war on us.
