I've written on WebNovel, along with fanfic. I have seen people get so pissed when I write one sentence, saying that the MC slept with a guy(yes I did not give any warning, but does anyone give warnings for straight smut? Nope. And mine was just one sentence, it doesn't even count.), and literally got hate comments, bad reviews, and a lot more. Of course, there were supportive people too, but in the end I had to abandon the fic because I just couldn't do it anymore.

I'm straight, but I wrote my MC out to be bicurious, but straight later. They didn't like this, and I felt bad. I can't even begin to fathom what actual LGBTQ+ people felt reading those comments, or what the LGBTQ+ authors feel when they get such hate.

I haven't read The Accidental Horcrux yet, but you can bet I'm reading it tonight. Take care!
