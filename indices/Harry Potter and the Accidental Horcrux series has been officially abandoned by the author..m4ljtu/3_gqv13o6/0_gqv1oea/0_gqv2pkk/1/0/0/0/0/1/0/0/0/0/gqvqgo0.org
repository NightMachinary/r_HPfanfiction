Except when she says 'trans rights' she means, 'these are the rights they get, and they aren't the same as cis rights'. 'Trans lives matter, but only if they don't impact cis lives'.

Look, I'm sorry for your friend. But statistically, everyone knows at least one person who has sadly been raped. What does that story have to do with this? Are you saying your friends experience means you agree that any woman that presented as male at birth ought to be excluded from a woman's bathroom? A woman's shelter? Because stuff like that happened long before trans rights became a thing.

Also, no one was saying she's evil. Saying her attitude toward trans women is toxic isn't the same as calling her evil. Saying she's hurt a lot of kids who had looked up at her isn't calling her evil. And I'm sorry, who exactly are you to tell /actual transgender people/ that they ought not to be hurt? JK literally had a net worth of a billion. She's not getting hurt here. They are.
