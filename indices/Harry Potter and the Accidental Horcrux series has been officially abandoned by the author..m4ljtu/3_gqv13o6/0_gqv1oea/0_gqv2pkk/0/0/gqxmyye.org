  I don't even get TERFS or people who hate on trans people and what not
#+end_quote

You're potentially throwing a lot of things into the same bucket here. Most TERFs probably don't hate trans people.

The core message of TERFs as I understand it is simply that cis women and trans women are different in some ways that matter and have consequences, e.g. they believe that certain traditional women spaces should be kept spaces for cis women. That's neither hateful nor particularly unfair.

Sure, the TERF label can be used as a dogwhistle by those who really do hate trans people. But the core message is something pretty legitimate that ought to be allowed in the general space of discussion.

  Trans people don't hurt anyone

As a general rule, absolutely. However, every sufficiently large group of humans contains assholes. Which means that there are asshole trans people who *do* hurt others, and that causes backlash.

That backlash is likely overblown, but for an outsider it is hard to understand why the trans community explicitly or implicitly defends the assholes.
