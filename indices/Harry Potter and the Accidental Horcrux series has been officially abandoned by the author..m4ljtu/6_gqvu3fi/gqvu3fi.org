I completely understand - I've struggled with writing ever since grieving the death of someone close to me, and that's not even directly related to JKR/HP.

Having a trans friend and having seen what he has gone through, anyone making trans lives more difficult for their own sense of equilibrium is just pathetic. I hope the author and any other trans writers on here know that whatever JK says, we as the fandom still love and support you.
