I support fanfiction authors by what they produce and not so much as them doing a tribute to JKR. That said I understand this author. I had a senior colleague who painted me two very lovely paintings as a departure gift, and she is a kind person, but I can't bring myself to hang them because all I can think about when I look at them is the puzzlement I felt from one time where I was about to ride my bicycle home and it was raining and I was like "dammit" and her kneejerk reaction was "If you don't like the rain then why don't you just go back to your own country." That association has been made and you notice things afterwards that you don't like and you want to remove yourself from people like that.
