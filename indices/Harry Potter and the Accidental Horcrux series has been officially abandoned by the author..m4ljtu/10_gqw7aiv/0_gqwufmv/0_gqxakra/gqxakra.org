A direct statement from Hogwarts Legacy goes:

"J.K. Rowling is not directly involved in the creation of the game, however, her extraordinary body of writing is the foundation of all projects in the Wizarding World. This is not a new story from J.K. Rowling."

The general understanding is a few years ago she was handed a large sum of money to sign a contract that said they can do/tell whatever story they like in the game and that was the last she heard of it. I say a few years ago because the game was having leaks way back when JK was only starting to be controversial, so the publishers are probably patting themselves on the back for the good foresight.

Also, the recent news that the gender customisation will not be directly tied to the characters sex they pick, thus allowing non-binary/trans/everything players definitely feels like they did that to clap back at the association they have with JK.
