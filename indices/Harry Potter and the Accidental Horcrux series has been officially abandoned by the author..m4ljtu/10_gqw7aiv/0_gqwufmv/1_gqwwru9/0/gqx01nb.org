Because my only concern is that the money I spend doesn't wind up empowering Rowling.

I'm still a fan of the setting. I can't just put away a series that helped me survive a frankly awful childhood. It's why I'm still in the fanfiction community 15 years later.

So if I'm interpreting what [[/u/CGPHadley][u/CGPHadley]] says correctly. In that Rowling has already been paid for the rights and at this point only makes money off of preexisting royalties from the movies/books?

At that point, I won't feel any kind of guilt for supporting the game. It's already been used as a low-key selling point for the game that Rowling has had very little creative input and that alone is why I might be willing to buy it used. As there's no money whatsoever going into Rowling's pocket off of the secondary market.
