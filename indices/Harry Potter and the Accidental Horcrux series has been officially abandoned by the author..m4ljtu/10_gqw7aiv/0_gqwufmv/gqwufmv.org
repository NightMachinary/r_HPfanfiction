Could you go into some detail about separation from Rowling in the new game?

All of my friends are LGBTQ and while we were all excited for the game last year. Now we're... not.

I'm probably going to buy it at some point (Especially if I can get it used.) But as it stands being able to definitively point at Rowling not seeing any kind of direct compensation for our, potential, purchases might be nice for them as well.
