In a round-about kind of way, this is the reason I'm really hoping that new Hogwarts Legacy game does well. JK isn't attached in any creative way, the rights were licensed from her, which means the only money she'll be getting from it is what she's ALREADY got from it.

Its important the game does well because then it can show WB that the franchise CAN function without her. You can tell they desperately want to, but are just worried about fan backlash. There was once a time when her word was law in the HP fandom and they want to avoid another "only George Lucas Star Wars is REAL Star Wars" situation.

And look - continuing to enjoy a coming of age story about a boy with magical powers does not make you transphobic, we all know that, separating the art from the artist IS a thing, but for many of the general populace its (understandably) too close for comfort. Especially while she is still directly gaining from support of the franchise. In a lot of fan communities this attitude is becoming more and more common, people unwilling to accept you can both like HP and violently disagree with JK, to the point of where I have had to argue with friends about whether its ethical.

If WB can be shown the license can function WITHOUT JK Rowling, if she could be removed from the franchise and the two could stop being so closely associated with each other, that can go a long way in redemption.

(Kind of made this about the game and not the fanfic but hope my point still stands)
