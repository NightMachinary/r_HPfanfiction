To answer your question, no it's not. In this one, the Scarcrux is sentient and starts manipulating Harry from a very early age, positioning itself as his only friend. He comes to Hogwarts relatively naive but trusting of Tom and from then on it's him being pulled between Dumbledore and Tom's sides. Before the fic ended, it was shaping up to be a legitimate three-way conflict between Harry, Dumbledore and the original Voldemort, really the only instance of that trope that I enjoyed.
