Rowling was like "Ah yes, TERF time," so naturally I decided that I was going to write trans girl Harry and ignore anything she says about it otherwise. Death of the author by my own hand if need be. It's curious to me what she would think about how many trans fans, myself included, she has alienated from her work. At the same time, I don't want to waste my breath on her.
