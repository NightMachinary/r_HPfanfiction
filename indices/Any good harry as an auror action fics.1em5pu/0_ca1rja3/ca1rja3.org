In [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Winters after the war]] Harry works as an auror. It was one of the first fanfic I read. I found it quite good at the time, but I can't compare it to what I've read since then as I have pretty much forgotten most of it.

It is a sequel to [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Summer after the war]]
