[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8015874/1/Reflections-in-the-Silver-Mist][Reflections in the Silver Mist]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3824385/Rannaro][Rannaro]].

In [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][another fic]] the author took the character of Snape and wrote his entire story from birth until death. You mightn't like Snape, I didn't before reading it, but your opinion of him will gradually change as the story goes on. It's a bit long though. Luckily, if 648,043 words are too much you can just skip it and go straight to Reflections in the Silver Mist. That's told from Harry's perspective, a year after the war.

I'm not entirely sure where the author is going with it, as I'm only 4 chapters in, but Harry is an auror in training. Snape is dead. But in his memories, the ones he gave to Harry, there's something else, and it's alive. Or at least sentient. The author's summery is actually better than anything I can write, so yeah.

/"When Hermione conjured her flask in the Shrieking Shack to hold Snape's memory strands, what exactly did she capture? Harry is not certain at first, but he is determined to preserve it."/

Oh and both stories go seamlessly with canon, and are some of the best written fics I've read so far. Definitely worth your time.
