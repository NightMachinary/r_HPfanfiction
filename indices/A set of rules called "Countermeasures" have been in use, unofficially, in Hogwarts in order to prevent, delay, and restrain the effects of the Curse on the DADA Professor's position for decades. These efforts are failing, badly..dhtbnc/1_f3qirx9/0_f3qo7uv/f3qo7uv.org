DADA Curse is actually dangerous. In response to that, the students make rules for themselves to limit the damage from the curse, as well as delay it till the end of the year, or even prevent it from working entirely.

Just like in the anime I linked, things start to fall apart, perhaps due to some Muggleborn like Lily Potter going against the rules, or "Countermeasures", perhaps due to Harry Potter having actual consequences from his "Fear of the name" thing earlier on. This doesn't have to be due to the DADA teacher, it can be any sort of magical creature you can come up with that kills the DADA teacher in the end, or it can just be unnatural random occurance. Or, like in the title, the Curse got smarter, saw how people were dodging the Curse, and ramped up beyond the norm we see in Harry Potter canon, perhaps killing most of the graduating class.

As an example of some Countermeasures:

1. Defence against the Dark Arts shall be referred to as "Combat Magic", and change the class's title every time it is shown to stop working. People like the Weasley Twins, Hermione, Lily Potter, Snape, or the Marauders could probably make a curse to force people to say this.

2. Don't be alone with the DADA Professor, and if you have detention with them, schedule it so we have some idea of what is going on.

3. Don't refer to the Professor as "Professor", instead call them something like Sensei or Instructor. This could be rotated, and people like the aforementioned people could probably force people to say it.

4. Make the "DADA" teacher register as a Student by the Curse so that technically the class isn't being taught. This could be done by calling the teacher a Student's name and shunning the student that the DADA teacher takes the place of, to prevent them from being registered by the Curse.

5. Some student with political connections and considerable riches, such as one of the Malfoys, could probably buy the DADA classroom, thus making it "Not taught in Hogwarts" legally.

Of course, there are still the occassional times when the Curse strikes, and every time it does, they either throw out the old countermeasures for a new countermeasure, or come up with new ones to counter people breaking the Countermeasures, such as shunning Harry Potter when he takes an interest in Luna, the newest shunned student after Tonks left Hogwarts.

An "Official" Countermeasure could could be the Ministry shutting Hogwarts down. Of course, since Asgard is not a place, but a people, the same could be said of Hogwarts.

An unofficial "Official" Countermeasure could be Umbridge not actually teaching the class, which is countered by everyone considering it "DADA" without the students using any countermeasures.
