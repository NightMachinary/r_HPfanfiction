[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily were more paranoid here and didn't trust the Fidelius Charm completely. They laid another nasty trap for Voldemort and got him good. They fled Britain altogether after that night, and Harry never went to Hogwarts. Not your average HP fanfiction.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy showed more bravery and cunning after Voldemort's defeat in 1981. Dumbledore was forced to flee for France with his remaining followers, but they would have their revenge 18 years later. Harry was raised by Sirius and went to Beauxbaton along with Neville and the Weasleys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): Harry was blind and couldn't go to Hogwarts, but he had other, great, powers!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): This is a postwar adventure fic. But the background story is that Harry was raised by Sirius and never went to Hogwarts.
