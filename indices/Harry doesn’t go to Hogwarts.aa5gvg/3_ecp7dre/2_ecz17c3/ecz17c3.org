It's a good fic, but I'm reading it right now, and to my mind, it's more of a "here's my original fic, but I'll mention some connection to Hogwarts or Harry's life before he changed his name to something cooler every few chapters" type of thing. Still a good story, but it punches a couple of my buttons.

I have the same problem with linkffn(It's My Life by Fyreheart). I find the connection to "Harry Potter" to be marginal.

A couple that I like are linkffn(Harry Potter and the Irish Choice) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marcello School).
