Agreed.

As this fic proves, a good writer can take a walk into cliche-land, and still have a great story. A bad writer can be as novel as he wants, but the story will suffer from the same issues regardless.

It is all about how the author handles it. If we complain about cliches in our reviews, what we really mean is 'author, you are bad.'

By the way, this is a great recommendation.
