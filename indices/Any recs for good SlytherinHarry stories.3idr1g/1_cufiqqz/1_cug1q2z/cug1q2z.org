This one is good but I do have some fears for where it is going. Drizzle is doing some Dresden level of dumping crap on the protagonist, and I'm not sure he can work it out as well as Butcher.

Ginny is okay in this fic, but it's still upsetting that it seems to be heading towards H/G. Katie was nice, even though it was clear it was nothing serious - oh well, will just have to wait and see.
