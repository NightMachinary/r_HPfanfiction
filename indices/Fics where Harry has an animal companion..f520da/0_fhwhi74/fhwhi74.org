There's the fic "To Shape and Change"\\
Where harry has a Coral Snake that is very important during the plot, is not just some "Oh Harry has a familiar" and then forget this for the rest of the fic, here Coral is'nt just an aniomal, she's Harry's best friend and her magic is also very important to the history.
