I prefer separate universes as well. It's much more fun reading about character's wide eyed wonder at the new world, or their endless questions than to read about a know-it-all and it's all dreadfully dull.

Besides, how the hell can you explain something like the Elemental Nations being part of our Earth all this time? How does nobody know about an island full of god like warriors who house demons inside their bodies and can manipulate creation itself? And no, "it's hidden by magic!" is not an acceptable answer.
