I don't really have a preference either way. Like, I don't mind if an HP/ME fic just is simply just HP in the future. I firmly believe that a fusion is possible with most works, despite how contrasting the mechanics might be. That being said, I don't mind if it's just a new dimension either. However, for whatever reason, I don't like when it's the secondary story that comes to the first world. Like, the idea of Daenerys Targaryen coming to Hogwarts just doesn't appeal to me at all.
