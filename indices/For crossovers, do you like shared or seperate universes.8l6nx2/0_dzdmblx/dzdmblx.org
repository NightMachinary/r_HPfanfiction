Separated. I find shared ones are almost always clumsy. That being said, when I look at my tastes i see that what appeals to me is the magic of the Harry Potter world and its possibilities. I actually dislike several of the main characters, or at least their regular fanon interpretation. Having a separate universe means that there should be less characters crossing over. Post-battle of Hogwarts Harry can be almost anything. He's onto the next step of his life having finally stepped out of Voldemort's shadow and he's free to think about the future. It would be understandable for him to grow and change a lot which makes him incredibly flexible as a character. What I want to see is the magic of Harry Potter world put into somewhere else. Often Harry Potter magic would curb-stomp other universes, but that doesn't mean the conflict has to be Harry vs new universe. Wizards in Harry Potter can shape reality at a whim but are, for the most part, content to live out their lives as normal people. I don't see why Harry would be any different. What would it take for him to take on the mantle of hero again?
