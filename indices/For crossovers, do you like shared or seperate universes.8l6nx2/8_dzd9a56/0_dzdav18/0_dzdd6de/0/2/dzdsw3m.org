She'd be seriously OP for the setting and dangerous as fuck but I dispute that she would be worse than three dragons, especially *those* three dragons. Even in the Potterverse, where dragons are far more common and smaller than Balerion, Meraxes and Vhagar they still require multiple wizards to handle them.
