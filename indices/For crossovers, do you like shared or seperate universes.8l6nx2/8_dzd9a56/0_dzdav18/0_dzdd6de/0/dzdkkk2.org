But magic allows you to steamroll certain universes. For example, Bellatrix Lestrange would make Aegon the Conqueror look like a schoolyard bully and the Fields of Fire like a backyard BBQ. Or throw Hermione in the Hunger Games and grab a bag of popcorn.

Alternatively, throw Shepard, Garrus and Legion in the Harry Potter universe and the Battle of Hogwarts just became the Hogwarts Turkey shoot as a lance of superheated metal blew Voldemort's head off from a mile away.
