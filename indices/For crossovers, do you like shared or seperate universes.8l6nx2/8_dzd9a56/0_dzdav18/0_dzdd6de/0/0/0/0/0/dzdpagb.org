Hermione was not above crossing rules, laws or stigmas in canon if it serves a purpose (See Umbridge, Snape or Sirius rescue, just to name a few). And if you blow up a tyrannical government, perhaps the only innocents to die is the cleaning staff. All others are part of the system hurting millions. If she has the power to help millions, canon Hermione wouldn't be above getting her hands dirty. She was the second in command in the second war against Voldemort after all.

Hell, with apparation you can assassinate people with ease and be out without being seen. Magic might not be useful on the front lines of a modern war, but one witch could bring down the administration of an entire nation by destroying the bureaucracy.
