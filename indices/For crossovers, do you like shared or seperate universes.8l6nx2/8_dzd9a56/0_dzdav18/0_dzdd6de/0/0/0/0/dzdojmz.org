I think a fairly popular way to limit canon magic in fanfiction is to say that the properties of the multiplied object become more... I'm not sure what the correct way to phrase it is, but just stretched, I suppose? So like a slab of stone multiplied five thousand times becomes increasingly weaker and weaker and weaker, until it can't be multiplied anymore. In this case, maybe some of that multiplied gunpowder would have been multiplied so much that they couldn't even light anymore. Or something like that; I'm not a very science-oriented person, so forgive the vague and somewhat awkward phrasing xD

Basically, the end result is that the gunpowder wouldn't be capable of doing enough damage to take out the government.

Anyway, in that scenario, you'd have to be writing a pretty ruthless Hermione willing to kill a bunch of innocent people in order to take out the government. If you have a Hermione that has morals as strong as her canon personality, both the explosives and Imperius options are out. The latter because of the strong stigma against Dark magic in canon.
