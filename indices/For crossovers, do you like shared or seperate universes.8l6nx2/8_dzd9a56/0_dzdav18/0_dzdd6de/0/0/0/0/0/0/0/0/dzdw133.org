I'm not really sure how casting a Muggle repelling ward would help? But for the rest...

Animagus transformation depends on what form Hermione takes. If she's a lion, it's going to be pretty weird for her to just trot into the building.

Polyjuice is another one, but how far she can get on it depends on whose hair she can get, and the security clearance of the person whose hair she manages to take.

For invisibility cloaks, she could borrow Harry's, I guess. Unless Harry's cloak is inaccessible to her by one way or another; they could stop being friends, or maybe Harry died and his cloak vanished or something. I'm sure the disappearance of the cloak can be easily explained away. She'd be hard-pressed to find another cloak too, because we know that Invisibility Cloaks are rare.

Soundproofing: The two 'soundproofing' spells we see in canon are Muffliato and Silencio. I've seen Silencio used as a way to silence footsteps in fanfic, but in canon we only ever see it being used to silence voices. Muffliato creates a buzzing noise on people who are trying to eavesdrop on conversation. For both spells, they haven't been used in canon to silence footsteps, so if we run with the assumption that they can't, then that will make Hermione's job quite a bit harder.

As for Disillusionment, given how advanced the technology in Hunger Games is (literally creating crazy monster dogs in a day), if heat-sensing technology is incorporated into their security systems, that would make it harder for Hermione too.

Honestly, we could argue all day about whether HP magic is too OP. The fact is, HP's magic system is so vague that it leaves a lot of room to maneuver. It makes it easy to add restrictions or effects that could respectively underpower or overpower it while still remaining canon, which is the beauty of having such an undefined system.
