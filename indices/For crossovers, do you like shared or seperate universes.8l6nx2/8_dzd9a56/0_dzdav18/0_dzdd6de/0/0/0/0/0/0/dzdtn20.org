True, she wasn't above crossing rules, but blowing up an entire government building full of people and actually killing them is an entirely different matter. She's never shown an inclination to kill that I can remember, let alone an inclination towards the 'save a million lives by killing one thousand' logic. Either way, this is really down to how you interpret Hermione's character, hence I don't think it's really all that relevant to the discussion. I can see Hermione developing into the kind of person you're talking about, especially with the darker tone of the Hunger Games world, but I could also run with a moral Hermione and have her actions be limited by that morality. Both versions of Hermione are still plausibly canon, imo, so neither would be considered too out of place. As long as the author can make these versions of Hermione believable and not laughably OOC, how they choose to portray Hermione is their prerogative. It's fanfiction, after all.

Apparition would be an interesting one to play with. She could definitely do that, assuming she is willing to kill Snow. It would still be interesting to see her execute the mission, because she'd have to first infiltrate and find out when Snow is alone/what places are safe to Apparate into and won't have security cameras, lest she Apparate in at the wrong time and get discovered and gunned down by a bunch of people.
