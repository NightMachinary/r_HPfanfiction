Hmm, maybe Bellatrix Lestrange in the GoT world would be too OP, but I think I disagree with the idea that Hermione would easily win in the Hunger Games. She'd have an easier time for sure, but I think with careful world-building it could be quite interesting. For example, say the Statute of Secrecy was still in effect and the wizards/witches were more obsessed about hiding their world because of how twisted the Muggle society has become, not to mention how much more advanced their technology has become too. Then you could have Hermione struggling not to use her magic overtly, which means she can't just summon food from across the arena or put up wards that will render her invisible to everyone else. She'll have to be crafty about how she uses her magic. That way, she'll actually be in significantly more danger, and there will be actual stakes involved.
