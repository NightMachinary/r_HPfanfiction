I didn't say every universe could be forced together.

And that doesn't make sense to me. You could ask that about any universe (even ignoring crossovers) where there are multiple protagonists but they don't all show up (like marvel). At least with HP (if for some reason other wizards aren't called upon) you can blame the statute of secrecy. But you're kind of proving my point. You're saying a separate universe is better because otherwise Harry could just call on other wizards (easy way out of a problem the SoS creates).
