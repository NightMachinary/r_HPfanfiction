Seperate, the whole dimension traveling aspect seems fun, and its a good way to balance out Harry. (What can he/does he bring, etc.) And i always have this notion of "why have we never heard of this before?" Dont rehash canon ofc, but dont expect us to believe the 7 books were canon and this new fandom were never mentionen.

That said, some stuff works in shared univeses, avengers, supernatural, and buffy for me works. But the author has to explain properly why either storyline dont know of eachother before now.
