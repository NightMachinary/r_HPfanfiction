Honestly it depends on the universe in question. Some are similar enough to the Potterverse that making them separate universes is counterproductive. Some are so different that making them a shared universe would be more immersion breaking than 'somehow this character moved universes'.

If you are trying to make me believe that things like LOTR, ASOIAF or The Witcher somehow take place in the Potterverse's past or future or whatever then that's probably going to occupy more of my attention than your plot.

On the other I have the vague premise of a Tomb Raider/Harry Potter crossover where making them separate universes would be silly.
