I honestly like both. Of course, it's nearly impossible to pull a shared universe off successfully with most other fantasies, but there's no need for dimension travel when the other franchise is "all-muggle", and /some/ magics (Roald Dahl, /Beknobs and Broomsticks/, even some /Star Wars/) can actually fit pretty well if you blur the details on either side.
