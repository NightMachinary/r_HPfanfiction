Separate for sure, the shared ones I have read seem to spend too much time explaining how each universe fits together and excusing why problems aren't solved by the other fandom. It can be done well, but my preference will always be a character moving to a unique setting and then exploring the outcome. The best example I can think of is linkao3( There May Be Some Collateral Damage by metisket), where there is a shared universe but there is very little emphasis on that, it is all characters reacting to the differences. Also love Ron in this one, while there isn't much of him it is one on the few stories that I feel gets him right.
