Shared. There is nothing inherently interesting in a character jumping tothe universe which has different powersets. There are some good fics that utilise this concept (in case of HP it's Shadow of Angmar and... eee... don't know anything else), but usually it works only when it's connected to one of originals' canons (like Zero no Tsukaima).

On the other hand, merging universes require worldbuilding. The resulting new world is a draw in itself. How can you adapt, connect, twist various aspects of canons? There is a lot of potential here.
