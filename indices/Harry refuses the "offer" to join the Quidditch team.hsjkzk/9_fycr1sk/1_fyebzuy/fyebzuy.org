And YOU stop being a whining dunderhead. You're not the center of OP's universe, and he wasn't attacking you. He was asking for a fanfic on HPfanfiction. A perfectly reasonable thing to do.

For your information, many 11 year olds hate sports. I did, and still do. I grew up in a family who loves AFL, and Cricket, and found it boring. I much rather had spent my time reading fictional stories then, and that plus scientific papers now. Just, because YOU like something doesn't mean EVERYONE likes it too.
