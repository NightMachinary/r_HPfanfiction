It's just fanfiction, it's not like the author is saying they hate sports or something. You are taking this way too seriously. You're acting like the author is saying that we should remove quidditch from canon, when in fact they're just talking about fanfiction.

Also, not every boy wants to play sports. I never did, I was usually more interested in video games. Just because you and your friends liked sports while growing up doesn't mean everyone else does.
