I am not saying Harry couldn't plausiably make that decision, I am saying he will be relentlessly bullied for it.

He was offered to be the youngest seeker at Hogwarts in a century and was to cowardly to accept, that's the kind of stuff he would be eternally reminded of. Not to mention him refusing because of a lack of helmet, just try to imagine how kids Harry's age would react to someone insisting that they would only play soccer with a helmet on.

Also Quidditch isn't that dangerous, for one Wizards are clearly more durable than muggles and no matter the injury as long its not magical in nature in can be healed quickly.
