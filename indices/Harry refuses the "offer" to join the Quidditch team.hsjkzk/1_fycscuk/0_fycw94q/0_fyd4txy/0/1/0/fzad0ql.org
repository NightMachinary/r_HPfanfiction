Seconded. I don't think wizards are supposed to be more durable either; they just have substantially better and more convenient injury treatment, as well as the ability to save lives on the spot, that mundane medicine, even modern, would lose.

Basically, unless Dark Arts, healer incompetence or lack of necessary supplies are involved, the long-term consequences of injuries can be magicked away, and badly mangled people can be brought back from death's door (into complete and perfect physical recovery, no less) as long as there still is some life in them when help arrives.

Incidentally that must have been a hell of a foul, probably a serious curse, which nipped Minerva McGonagall's Quidditch prospects in the bud and left her with a lifelong slight limp and grudge against Slytheryn.
