Minerva McGonagall looked up from her paperwork as she was disturbed by a frantic, rapid knocking on her office door. She strode elegantly across the office floor with smile on her face. This was most likely Severus, unhappy at her recruiting young Harry Potter to her quidditch team. Despite their many clashes, she believed they both genuinely enjoyed the calm, simmering rivalry of sports over trying to quell their students' other extracurricular activities. Oh!, she was going to rub his face in-

Her train of thought was completely derailed when the person outside her office door was not Severus Snape, but a pale, sweating and positively shivering Harry Potter who immediatly started rambling faster than Flitwick after his third cup of wine and someone mentioned Animation principles.

"I'm so sorry, Professor! I promise I've learned my lesson! I'll be good, I won't mess around in flying class anymore. Just, please don't make me play quidditch, I was so scared. I-"

"Mr. Potter, calm down!" She decided to cut him off. "I'm sorry for raising my voice but I don't understand how your first practice with Mr. Wood has you this upset. What happened, one thing at a time". She said, trying to admonish the boy.

Harry gave her a queer look and took a few slow breaths. He was very much out of breath and had sprinted from the quidditch field to McGonagall's office. With some efforts he managed to order the whirlwind in his mind into the three things he thought she wanted to hear.

"I understand now. I broke the rules. First years aren't supposed to fly about. If they do, they have to play with the big boys who shoot cannonballs at them." He summarized.

"Bludgers, Harry." Minerva tried to regain a semblance of control after the dissonance of th words boy was saying and his tone threatened to vibrate her grey matter until it trickled out of her ears. "And your position on the Gryffindor quidditch team wasn't meant as a punishment, nor as the lesson you envision."

"Then why can't I wear a helmet during practice? Or let one of the big boys play the position that makes all the points? or..." He hestitated for a moment. "If it's not a punishment can I please, please not play quidditch?"

She could just imagine Severus' face once this made the rounds at the staff break room.
