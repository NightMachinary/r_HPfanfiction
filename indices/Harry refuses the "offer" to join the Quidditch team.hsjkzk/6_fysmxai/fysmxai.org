For everyone who says "he should have just said no, I would have" - you don't remember being a child at school do you. At real-world schools that have sport, it is generally compulsory, and children get very little choice about what sports they take part in. I had compulsory cross-country running, which I hated, but just refusing to take part never even crossed my mind. Nor did I even consider saying no to rugby despite having never seen it before and not knowing the laws. I had no choice but to go to rugby practice, no choice but to play for the school team, no choice but to play for my house in intra-mural competition.
