It's pretty bash-heavy for Dumbledore, and it's a horror/Creepypasta crossover first and foremost, but

Linkffn(Harry by Proxy)

Has this, even the reluctant acceptance, and the overall fic is pretty good too. Be warned it'll take a while to get to this, Harry is in ravenclaw for a small bit before Dumbledore forces a re-sort, and Harry refuses at first but eventually accepts bc people keep harassing him about it. And he only accepts on a trial basis at the current point in time.
