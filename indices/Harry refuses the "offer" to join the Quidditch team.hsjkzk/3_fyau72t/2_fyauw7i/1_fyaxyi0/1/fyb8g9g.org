I would have sated my curiosity for all things magical in the library - and then practicing in an unused classroom.

If I had particular curiosity for flying broomsticks, I would have bought one during the holidays and stored it in my Gringotts vault, if taking it to Hogwarts was forbidden.

Adventure? Not all 11-year-olds are the same. Harry certainly didn't behave like most 11-year-olds would, if they found out that they are insanely famous.

Sad? I, on the other hand, find it sad (or pathetic), when people have so little pride that they let others walk all over them, never saying no, no matter what they may want for themselves. There's no age too young to start learning to say no. But there probably is a point when it's too late.

Yes, it could be argued that it was something Harry would have wanted anyway. BUT: First, it was still unacceptable that he wasn't asked, as if his what he wanted didn't matter at all. Second, this isn't a discussion about canon. I was (and still am) asking for fanfics - meaning that Harry could easily have wanted something different than what he wanted in canon.
