I don't think that is what they meant; if someone signed you up for, let's say a swim team without your permission and then was all 'ok, in return for me signing you up for a commitment you don't have to do, you get this mildly better thing then you would have before- say, an expensive horror video game when they don't even know if you like horror or video games, just that you played a horror game once at an arcade and you won. Besides, I personally am pretty prideful and I would have been blindsided and pissed as hell, magical flying broom or not. Do not sign me up for things I don't ask for with minor compensation, I don't care if you know I would have liked it or not.

In summary, because I am a freaking idiot who has to explain every detail of her thought process, Quidditch isn't just a game in this case, it is a commitment with minor bonuses, like playing on the football team at school, I would say. Damnit now this is long too.
