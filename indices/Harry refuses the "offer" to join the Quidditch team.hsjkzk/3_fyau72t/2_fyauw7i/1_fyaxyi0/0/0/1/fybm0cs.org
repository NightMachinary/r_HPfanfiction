Oh, I would do pretty much anything legal-ish to get what I want, so setting my pride aside is not a problem. My point is in a situation where someone is pushing me to do something I'm not sure I want to do without consulting me. I can fly whenever after first year and in class during first year without having to worry about broken bones. For me, it's like if I got drafted without anyone asking me if I wanted, even if I do like (american) football. Being a fan of the sport and good at it does not mean I will risk CTE without even thinking about it and having the option to say no. In this situation, McGonagall is pushing an 11 year old into a dangerous sport where kids his age are not even allowed to participate just to win. If she did that to me even though I like quidditch as an spectator I would demand to be given time to think it over and if not allowed to I would tell her where to shove it.
