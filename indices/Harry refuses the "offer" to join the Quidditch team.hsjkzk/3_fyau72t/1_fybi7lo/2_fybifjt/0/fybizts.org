I thought the question was "In what universe do /you/ say no to playing flying football?", not "In what universe does /Harry/ say no to playing flying football?"

If it was meant as the second one, then yes, he wouldn't decline. It would have been such a non-MC move and the kids reading would have been very disappointed in his decision.

I still think he shouldn't have been pressured into it in the first place, but that wouldn't have been quite as fun to read.
