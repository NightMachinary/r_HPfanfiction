This was posted months ago so idk if OP still wants to find other fics, but I have been a fan of this rarepair for almost four years and I've got you. Here is a tumblr link to a Tuna blog with an alphabetized list of Tuna fics. [[https://tunavibes.tumblr.com/ficrecs]]; the author of The Astronaut runs that blog so it's also linked there.

I second Twelve Dark Moons, Into Your Gravity, The Astronaut, and anything by BellonaBellatrix (link for BellonaBellatrix's account since it's inaccessible on the blog: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052809/http://www.fanfiction.net/u/768219/BellonaBellatrix]]) . For one-shots or drabbles, kurojiri has you covered. Everything's in the link, really. Happy reading!
