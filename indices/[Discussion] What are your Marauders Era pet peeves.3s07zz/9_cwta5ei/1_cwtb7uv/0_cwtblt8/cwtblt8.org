I mean, it sort of makes sense for the books. But as someone who constantly reads that era and is writing a story in that era, somethings just don't add up. Another example of somethings that doesn't make sense is Dumbledore in PS. It makes sense for him to not have done more because he would have been a Deus Ex Machina, but a lot of things happened right under his nose that probably would not have happened without the most powerful wizard alive doing anything about it in reality.
