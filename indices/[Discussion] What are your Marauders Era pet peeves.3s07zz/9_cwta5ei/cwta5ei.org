Ah, my favorite thing to talk about. Regarding Pet peeves, most people have said them. Include Peter, don't make him "squeak" all the time, don't make him look like a mouse (James doesn't look like a stag and Sirius doesn't look like a dog. Peter's mouse-y appearance, in my mind, is due to him being a rat for thirteen years). Don't make them call each other nicknames like Jamesie and Siri. Padfoot, Prongs, ect is ok but don't too much of it. If you want a nickname other than their already established ones, Pete works great.

My biggest pet peeve though regards James. He is a teenage boy who is very popular and very gifted. Please don't make him sit around complaining about why Lily won't notice him and have the other three roll their eyes because he's "always doing this". No. No x10000. He has a /crush/ on a girl but if he was to always talk about it, his friends would laugh and tease him. They would do this because they were assholes, but most importantly they were /teenage/ /boys/. Have him snog a few girls in broom cupboards or something and don't make him always talk about Lily in their dorm room. When I read fics that make James out to be a whiny loser who's in love with the girl who just won't give him the time of day (at the age of 15, might I add) I immediately can tell it was written by a thirteen year old girl who doesn't know how boys act.

Now, let's get into the fanon stuff because that's what I love to talk about. Let's talk about the maruader era in and of itself. I hate it. I hate how it's portrayed in the books because it doesn't make any sense. And that's alright for the books because the Marauder Era didn't have to make sense, it was simply a plot device. James has been a troublemaker with practically no respect towards authority. But you know, he's been really good the past couple of months, let's make him headboy. Remus spends every day with confidant (yes, that's the nice way of saying arrogant) people who stand by his side no matter what. He's always with them and they treat him as an important part of the group. Let's make him still shy and not remotely confidant after years of being friends with people like James. Oh, and let's make him prefect despite the fact that he misses school a lot on account of him being a werewolf. Sirius is a fun loving joker who came from a bad family and bad childhood who stands by his friends no matter what and is completely thankful to them for giving him a sanctuary. But let's make him forget all that to play a stupid prank on Severus by telling him that his friend is a /werewolf/. And Peter. Oh Peter is the worst of all.

The boys are stupidly popular. All four boys are incredibly skilled with magic. And yet Peter hero worships James and Sirius? Peter becomes an animagus to help Remus when he transforms, showing great love and loyalty to his friends. But he betrays them to Voldemort? Why? Because it moves the plot along, not because it really makes sense in reality. There are many ways where you can make it make sense by filling in the gaps left, such as maybe Voldemort threatened his family or something. But the books make him a coward, which in my personal fanon is dumb. Peter should not be a coward, Remus should have loads of confidence, Sirius shouldn't be a bonehead by betraying his friend, and James should not be a guy who is a complete asshole, and then magically not an asshole when he is given Headboy. The four should be fairly equal, not James and Sirius being the marauders and the other two being tag-alongs as Remus sighs and says "oh no" and Peter giggles and says "good one, James. Can I give you a back massage when this is all done?" Yes, James is the leader (that's what the symbolism of the stag is) but all of them are gifted, popular, and loyal. You know, until they magically aren't.
