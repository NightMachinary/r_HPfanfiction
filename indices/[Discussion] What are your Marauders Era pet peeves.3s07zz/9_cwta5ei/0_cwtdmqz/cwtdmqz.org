A lot of this seems like dissatisfaction with the coherency of the characters than actual flaws within the narrative.

All four boys weren't popular, nor magically gifted, nor equal, nor is that suggested anywhere. It was James and Sirius. Peter became an animagus, but you can beyond easily say he did it because J & S pitched the idea, refusing would seem disloyal and he's better with them than without. He has more reason to than not to. He betrays them to Voldemort because they can no longer provide him the protection they did at Hogwarts. You can say he never cared for them as people so much as what they could do for him, you just don't find that reading palatable, but I'd argue it's the most canon. Sirius is an asshole, and careless. Of course he outed Remus to spite Severus. He was also a dick to Kreacher despite the 'treat inferiors' speech. Again, it seems like you just don't like how much of a careless asshole he is. You're also saying Remus should have loads of confidence because of proximity, yet those same friends were careless about his lycanthropy.

  He did not approve of their relentless bullying of Severus Snape, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.

Their relationship does seem like it would foster emotional dependency, if he's at least a little uncomfortable in this relationship where they're doing things for him. And Remus is relatively confident in most matters as an adult, just not his lycanthropy. Which he couldn't trust Sirius with.

Sirius loves and respects James for giving him sanctuary. He doesn't view Peter as an equal, though. And there's a power imbalance in his relationship with Remus.

'They were teenage boys.' I get what you're saying, but this is rationalising backwards i.e. you're trying to fill them in with a general mold as opposed to characteristics evidenced in canon. You can say 'Riddle is a teenage boy, don't make him release murder snakes', etc.

Aand, Sirius did say outright James ~always made a fool of himself when Lily was around. He was sketching her name in his paper. Severus found out at some point, which means he was talking about it. JKR contextualises his entire relationship with Severus as being in part due to Lily.

The Head Boy thing is ridiculous, though. Especially since we know they were pranking into seventh year. Though it's never mentioned anywhere else past from Hagrid, so you can say Hagrid's just an unreliable there.

Btw, I don't think canon is fully coherent. I just don't think some of your criticisms hold up.
