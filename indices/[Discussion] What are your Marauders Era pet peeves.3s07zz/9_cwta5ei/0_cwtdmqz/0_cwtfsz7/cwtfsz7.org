oh, yes, you are correct. I actually tried to say that but I couldn't figure out the proper words. It is a dissatisfaction with the coherency of the characters more than flaws in the narrative. But they were popular, it was one of the things that Severus and Lily didn't like about them. The fact that they were such assholes and yet popular. At least James and Sirius were. The magically gifted part comes from the fact that they did become animagi. While there is no established method of becoming an animagi in canon (at least I don't recall there being one) it can be assumed to be a very difficult magical accomplishment.

The equals was part of my fanon bit, because I don't like that the fact that three individuals who became anamagi together in order to help a friend did not see each other as equals. A lot of things, as I stated, make sense for the story. They make sense as cause and effect and they move the plot along and add a little bit of background to the characters. But as a stand alone story, I can't see how it makes sense for the four boys to be as close of friends as they were in canon without some semblance of mutual respect.

The "teenage boys" part was about how James shouldn't be always pining and whining about Lily. That's just not how teenage boys are. Yes, they may do it every now and then, but they aren't constantly doing it to the extent that the boys roll their eyes and shake their heads like "oh, james".

"Making a fool" would easily be being a bigger dick to people. And Severus could easily find out without James being a.... I really don't know how to describe it because most fics make James do things that really no body does.

But yes, you are right that most of it is a dissatisfaction with how the characters were written rather than a complaint about the narrative. My main point was that some of their actions wouldn't make sense as a stand alone story as main characters. It makes a lot of sense for background characters that were written as explanations for actions already written.
