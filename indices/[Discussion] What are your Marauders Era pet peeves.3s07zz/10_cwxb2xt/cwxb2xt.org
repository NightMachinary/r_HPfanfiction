Mine is Marlene McKinnon being a close friend to Lily and the Marauders, as well as being Sirius Black's love interest. Read Lily Evans' letter to Sirius Black and tell me that sweet letter about baby Harry's birthday with a brief mention of "The McKinnons" being killed is in reference to the death her BFF and Sirius Black's girlfriend, or even his ex. Lily said she cried all evening. If a friend was murdered, and you were talking about it to said friend's /love/, wouldn't it be a much deeper, more emotional letter and wouldn't you have been upset for more than a few hours? Would Lily mention his girlfriend's death in such a quick, callous fashion, not even referring to Marlene by her first name? Doubtful.

To me, the "McKinnons" were a family, older than the Marauders, and Marlene was the wife/mum in that family. If not, I still I imagine they knew her through the Order, and were not super close. Nothing turns me off a Marauder's Era story faster than seeing Marlene McKinnon as a main character.

Also annoying - Sirius acting like a dippy pre-teen, even when he's seventeen and has been disowned by his horrible family. Also the assumption that because he is attractive, he must be sleeping with everyone in the school. There is nothing in canon to suggest this - in fact, in the scene with the girl admiring him during OWLs, he is oblivious to her.

And writing Peter out of the story bothers me, as well. We know he's a jerk, but they didn't at that point, and he's a major part of their story.
