I highly doubt any of the Death Eaters to be where "evil" while they were in Hogwarts. For example, a lot of people write Bellatrix as already being crazy and demented, which is silly. She was most likely somewhat normal (callous, cold-hearted yes, but still normal), and only went crazy in Azkaban (as anyone would).

Similarily Lucius probably wasn't as good as a schemer as he was in Harry's time, it takes a lot of practice and experience to become politically savvy, I highly doubt a teenager would be a political genius.

Also, marked Death Eaters? I'm not sure if this is canon or not (it is my headcanon at least) but Voldemort only marked his inner circle Death Eaters, and to get into the inner circle you'd have to prove yourself either by combat or cunning, no teenager would ever get marked... And yes, I realize Draco was marked but that was an exceptional circumstance since Voldemort needed to keep an eye on him (figuratively) during his operation in Hogwarts, as well as to punish Lucius for his failure.
