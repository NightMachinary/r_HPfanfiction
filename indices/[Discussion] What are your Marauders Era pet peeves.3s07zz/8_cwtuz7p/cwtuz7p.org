James-bashing. I'm biased on this because many of the Marauders Era fics I've read are Severus-biased(Snape goes back in time and similar), but that's no excuse to make James out to be Dudley with good looks and charm. I've even read one seemingly well-written fic with good plot where James /rapes/ Lily. It's still in progress, so I'm holding out some hope for Imperius or something being involved(though even that is a flimsy excuse considering James /is/ Harry's father), but otherwise...even writing about it pisses me off.
