Not including Peter. He was just as much a part of the Marauders as the other three, even if Remus/Sirius would (understandably) prefer to retroactively minimize his role.

Making Lily a perfect angel rather than someone who is just as flawed as James. Also, making the Lily/Petunia thing completely one sided, where Lily is nothing but sweetly polite to her sister and gets hateful vitriol in return. Not that Petunia wouldn't be rude to Lily, but I doubt Lily would be blameless in escalating things.

When literally everyone is in Lily/James' year. There's no proof that Marlene McKinnon was in their year, and in fact, there's more [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3awc1c/marlene_mckinnon/][evidence]] to say that she's not. Marlene as Lily's best friend is so ingrained in fanon that I can let it go, but Dorcas Meadowes, Frank Longbottom, Alice Longbottom, and every single other character from that era is not nessasarily at Hogwarts with Lily/James. Dumbledore did not recruit the entire Order from the Class of 1978.

Don't forget that the Marauders are teenage boys, and should act like teenage boys.

Gratuitous nickname use. I can accept "Pads", and I can even accept the occasional shortening from Lily (she called Peter "Wormy" in her letter to Sirius). But Jamesie? Siri? Again, they're teenage boys.

James freaking out every time Lily is in the room. He's a popular guy with other interests besides Lily. Yes, he likes her. But he's not sitting around pining over her.
