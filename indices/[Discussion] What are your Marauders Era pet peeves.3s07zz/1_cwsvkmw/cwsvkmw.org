When Alice and Frank Longbottom are in the Marauder's year and Alice is Lily's best friend or one of them. This rant has been building for a while, so sorry :P Canonically, they were both 'well-respected aurors' and I don't think they would have had the time to become aurors, never mind well respected aurors, in the three years the Marauders finished school before Oct '81, plus have Neville, plus go into hiding for a year. It just doesn't add up. For the timeline to work, Alice would have graduated spring 1978, gotten pregnant some time in fall 1979 and gave birth July 1980. She would have only been an auror for just over a year, maybe a year and a half. I can't see her still chasing dark wizards after learning she was pregnant. After that, they probably went into hiding like the Potters. Frank might have had time, but I don't think it was enough. Tonks said it was three years of training and there was only three years between the Marauders finishing school and the events of Halloween 1981. There would have to be a lot of explanations for that to work out. I can buy Alice and Lily meeting in the Order and becoming friends that way, but not while in school.
