I would agree with this. The only possible exception I can think of is Caleb Nova's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3488634/1/That-Terrifying-Momentum][That Terrifying Momentum]] and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7355583/1/Vis-Insita][Vis Insita]].

I can't deny that I wish there was a bit /more/ focus on canon characters in there, but at this point I'm so sucked into the plot, and he's put so much into his OCs that I am totally okay with it.

(To be clear, I call it an "exception" because the OCs are pretty much first-class characters from the start, as well as having access to a...different... form of "magic" than the canon characters.)
