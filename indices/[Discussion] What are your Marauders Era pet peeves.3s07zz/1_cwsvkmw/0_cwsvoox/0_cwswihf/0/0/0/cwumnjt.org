I feel like there's a balance between Lily's friends/dormmates being a mixture of canon and OCs and then having them all be future OotP members or all OCs. Canonically we know there's a girl named Mary in Gryffindor at the same time who could be Lily's friend and then it isn't that difficult to take like, Marlene McKinnon or Emmeline Vance and make them another friend. It doesn't have to be Alice.
