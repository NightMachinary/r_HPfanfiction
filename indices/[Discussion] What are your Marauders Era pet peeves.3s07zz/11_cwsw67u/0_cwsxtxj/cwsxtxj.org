  Snape gave as good as he got
#+end_quote

Did he? No doubt he /wanted/ to, but from the first moment on the Hogwarts train, it's two against one (yes, Lily was there, but James and Sirius weren't targeting Lily), and in school it's four against one - or three, if you assume Remus usually sat on the sidelines pretending he didn't notice what was going on.

And yes, Snape was already dabbling in the Dark Arts, but it's reasonable to think some of his motivation was revenge and a desire to defend himself. No, he wasn't defenseless, I agree, but it's likely he was always outnumbered, and even if there were reasons to dislike Snape (his lack of social graces and his interest in the Dark Arts), the Marauders went after him mostly because they were bored and it was fun to torment another student - with the implication that Snape was vulnerable because he was poor, ugly, a loner, and didn't come from a powerful family. The Gryffindors were dickheads in that respect.

Snape wasn't a likable kid, but he wasn't always a Death Eater, either. I'm pretty sure the parallel is to the popular boys singling out the weirdo, confident there would be few, if any, consequences to them.

However - yeah, I don't think Snape would come out of it a more sympathetic character; it would just make him more vengeful and vicious with each passing year.
