Generally it boils down to three things:

- Know your timeline and the age of characters. Know who was and who was NOT in the same year as them. Frank, Alice, Lucius, Narcissa, Bellatrix, Molly, Arthur etc are all too old to still be in Hogwarts at that time. So don't include them.

- Their relationship with Lily and Snape. They did not bully "a poor and defenseless Snape" for no reason at all. Snape gave as good as he got and was actively dabbling in the dark arts in a time when Voldemort was killing Muggleborns. Portray it as such.

- Peter. It is my headcanon that Peter did not join the death eaters till after Hogwarts and even then he never did it because he believed their bigotry. So don't paint his as the death eater he will become but rather as the fun loving prankster he was back in school.
