  Their relationship with Lily and Snape. They did not bully "a poor and defenseless Snape" for no reason at all. Snape gave as good as he got and was actively dabbling in the dark arts in a time when Voldemort was killing Muggleborns. Portray it as such.

Snape wasn't a poor and defenseless victim. He was prejudiced, enamored with dark spells and kept the wrong company. But he was still a victim and the Marauders were bullies. James and Sirius attacked and actively humiliated Snape for their own amusement. A quote by JKR:

  Remus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. He did not approve of *their relentless bullying of Severus Snape*, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.

See? Relentless bullying. The fact that Snape wasn't a good person and later became a bully himself is irrelevant. There are no excuses for what what they did to Snape in his school years.

So, yeah, pet peeve: Portraying the Marauders as lovable pranksters that could do no wrong, and making out their dislike of Snape to be righteous when it was anything but.

(Of course, Snape centric fics show James to be as evil as Voldemort and as stupid as a mountain troll, and that it an equally ridiculous perspective of events. I think for all its faults, /Delenda Est/ handles their dynamics well for the most part. Most fics are biased to one side or the other.)
