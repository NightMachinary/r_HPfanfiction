Snape may have been a victim when they ganged up on him but Sirius states in OOtP that Snape gave as good as he got. I'm sure if he caught one of the Marauders alone he took full advantage of the fact. JKR may state something but that doesn't change canon, because if that's the case Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginny got divorced and Harry and Hermione got together. So the quote on "relentless bullying" doesn't change canon that Snape would/did retaliate. Sure make them bullies that get punished for it but Snape wasn't JUST a victim.
