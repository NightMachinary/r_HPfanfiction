Fair enough, but James one of Snape's bullies, saves him from the werewolf, and Snape later gets Lupin fired over a childhood rivalry. And Lupin may not have been innocent but why did Snape feel the need to get him fired? I'm not saying Snape isn't a victim. But people make James and Sirius into these ridiculously brutal bullies, yes they bullied him but he retaliated held a childhood grudge so is he's only slightly better then the Marauders. And we never see how The Marauders could have matured with James dying at 21, and Sirius being locked up at 21 for 12 years, if they had normal lives they may have changed.
