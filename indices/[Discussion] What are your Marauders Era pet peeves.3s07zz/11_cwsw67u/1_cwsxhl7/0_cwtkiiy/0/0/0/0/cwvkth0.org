Definitely both sides agitated the other and kept the mutual dislike through school.

Sirius was childish and never had a chance to grow, majority of his classmates believed he betrayed his best causing his death, went to prison at 21. And when he comes out he sees Harry as a replacement James and wants to be friends instead of a guardian.

James had to have changed for McGonnagal and many others to state he changed when/before he got Lily, does that mean he became a saint? No but he grew up some.

I believe the books say James stopped him and pulled him out before he saw Lupin.

But was it any different then having oldest friends replaced with a Death Eater and placing students under the Imperius? Lupin left the school around the time of the Full Moon. Snape tormented harry around potions which I assume is equivalent to chemistry. And was then allowed to teach students DADA where a cutter to an artery could kill? Sorry I'd take Lupin.

But this is supposed to be Harry's story as he knows it, no different if it was any other student.
