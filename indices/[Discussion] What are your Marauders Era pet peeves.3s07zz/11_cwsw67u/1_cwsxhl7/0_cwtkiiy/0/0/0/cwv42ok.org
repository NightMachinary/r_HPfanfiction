Oh, I agree. I'm not happy about James or Sirius-bashing at all, but I've seen too many fics where the Marauders' treatment of Snape is downplayed and shrugged off as "boys will be boys." Usually it's implied Snape deserves it.

Sirius, like Snape, is a complex character, and both of them have fairly extreme flaws and tragic fates. Sirius' life is basically destroyed, and his fortitude in surviving Azkaban is phenomenal, but he emerges a very damaged person. James - well, we have to take canon's word for it that he became a good man, even though we don't get to see it on the page.

And yes, James did the right thing in the Shrieking Shack incident, but I'm not clear how much he risked by doing so, since he could have changed into his Animagus form, in which (I think? not sure about this) he acted as a non-human companion to wolf!Lupin. But it was brave of him no matter what, and a sign that he hadn't crossed the moral boundary line that Sirius had. On the other hand, according to internal evidence in the books, Snape's Worst Memory occurs /after/ the Shrieking Shack, which means the Marauders continued tormenting him. Tormenting a boy who'd been traumatized by a close encounter with a werewolf and been forbidden to talk about it to anyone (great counseling skills there, Dumbledore). No wonder Remus didn't want to get involved.

Personally, I think Dumbledore was off his nut to hire Lupin as a professor. No way should a werewolf have been teaching kids, even with Snape on hand to provide Wolfsbane. The risk wasn't worth it. And Lupin /did/ forget to drink the potion. I could see Dumbledore arranging for him to receive a stipend while working for the Order, but the Headmaster violated the trust put in him by parents and students by hiring a werewolf. Also, he knew Snape and Lupin's history; Snape had good reason to be tense and angry in Lupin's company. IMO, Dumbledore's utter lack of respect toward Snape all through Prisoner of Azkaban would have justified Snape giving him a two-fingered salute and Disapparating the fuck out of there. Teasing him about wanting an Order of Merlin and condemning him for trying to get Sirius sent back to Azkaban - when Dumbledore himself hadn't done a thing to stop Sirius being railroaded into prison without trial and hadn't lifted a finger to prove his innocence in the 12 years following - doesn't really highlight his moral superiority.

But then, I view Harry as an unreliable narrator (because he's a kid who's denied access to crucial information), and I tend to look for clues about the motives of the adults - the behind-the-scenes story, as it were - by shifting the perspective around, because that's how I get ideas to write fic. I may be susceptible to over-interpreting.
