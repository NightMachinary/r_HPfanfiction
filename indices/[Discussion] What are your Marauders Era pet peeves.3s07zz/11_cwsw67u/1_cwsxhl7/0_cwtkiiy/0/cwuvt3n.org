Yeah, but Sirius is probably the last person whose word I'd take about anything Snape did in school. Sirius thought that tricking Snape into facing a werewolf was a mere "prank." And not just any werewolf, but a friend of his who probably would have been sent to Azkaban and the tender mercies of a Dementor's Kiss if he'd killed a 15-year-old boy while in beast form. I'm sorry, but Sirius' moral compass and perceptions are skewed when it comes to Snape. And we never see Snape seeking out the Marauders and attacking them in canon, nor is he referred to as a "troublemaker" by any member of the staff - although I could just be forgetting the relevant passage. I totally believe the feud raged on both sides - but I doubt Snape would have carried it on alone if the four Gryffindors had left him in peace.

(Sidenote here: I've always been curious about Snape's dueling skills and when he learned them. In response to his Marauders problem, perhaps? Because I can't really see Snape as an aggressive attacker on par with James and Sirius. Defending himself, yes. Losing his temper, yes. But otherwise, I'd expect him to use subtle spells, potions slipped into pumpkin juice, rigged jinxes that couldn't be easily traced back to him. A hex while someone isn't looking. But even when he's got Black and Lupin cornered in the Shrieking Shack, he doesn't hurt them, even though, as far as he knows, he's got an excellent reason to blast the shit out of Sirius. As a student, he's a brooding, scrappy, unpleasant child who's used to being attacked but isn't physically coordinated or strong or confident. He's not a jock; there's no evidence he played Quidditch. So you could say he studied dueling to get better at disabling his opponents.)

Back on track: on the other hand, I've always assumed that Snape created the Sectumsempra curse with James and Sirius in mind. The annotation "For enemies" implies as much, and it literalizes the kind of revenge fantasy you'd expect of a beleaguered kid who daydreams about cutting his enemies to pieces. I could see Snape being that kid, indifferent to potential carnage. Like Sirius, he wasn't big on understanding consequences.
