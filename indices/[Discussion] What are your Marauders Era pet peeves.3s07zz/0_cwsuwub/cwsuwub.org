Leaving Peter out of the story completely, or making him an inconsequential character.

Also another Peter related one. Whenever he does talk, it's always described as squeaking. "Blah blah blah dialogue," Peter squeaked.

Granted, I don't see that happening as much anymore, but that could just be because I'm much more selective with what I read now.
