The Marauders aren't a group of equals. James and Sirius are the leaders of the group, they do things without considering the others a lot of the time. (Remus was visibly uncomfortable in SWM, they didn't even look at him/gesture to him, even though they know he doesn't like their bullying. They're rude to Wormtail, etc. They talk about Remus' lyncanthropy out loud, Sirius outs him to Snape).

Also, their relationship with Wormtail was clearly unbalanced. He openly hero-worshipped them, they patronised him, Rosmerta and McGonagall describe him as such.

They don't know that DEs have the Dark Mark on their forearm, or that Severus became a DE.

Remus and Lily weren't close friends.

James/Lily dynamic:

  “I think that Lily would have been great for James because she wouldn't have put up with any of his rubbish. So I think he would have become a lot less spoiled.”
