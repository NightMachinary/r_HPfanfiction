Making all known Death Eaters blatantly 'evil' during their school years, or conveniently *all* in the Marauders' year. Lucius was like six years older than them, for example.

Having James *obsessed* with Lily, instead of just having a possibly obnoxious crush. Also, having James make a complete personality 180 in terms of going from bully to Head Boy- there needs to be some progression there. Don't make the reason Lily.

Making Peter some little tagalong. He was their best friend until suddenly he wasn't. Make him change over time. Don't just give him one line every few chapters when the other three are always chatting. And don't make him comic relief. He was one of them, you know?

Lily isn't perfect. Nobody is. She may have been talented, but the woman needs some flaws. After all, she was a teenager.

Just because we have a bunch of kids in 'Lightning Era' doesn't mean all their parents went to school together. We don't know that Alice and Frank were the same year. We don't even know Alice's last name. Shoving everyone into the same year or two may be convenient, but it's *too* convenient. There needs to be some variation. Make someone a Ravenclaw or something.

They were troublemakers. Don't let them get away with everything under the guise of Dumbledore favoring Gryffindors and having a sense of humor. He may let them off *easy*, but there are other staff members, and there are rules. Them not getting into trouble is just frustrating and takes away some of the fun.
