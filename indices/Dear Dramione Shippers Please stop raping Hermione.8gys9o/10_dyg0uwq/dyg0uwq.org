I honestly don't mind rape as a plot device in general. It can work, it's a powerful scenario that gives lots of opportunities to explore character growth and interaction.\\
I can even get behind whacky stockholm syndrome stories where rapist and victim end up "happily together", IF it's well written and actually uses the available opportunities.

It's so frustrating to see people just throw it in more or less randomly or as an excuse to overwrite a personality with something completely different just so they can keep the visual imagery of having it technically be that person.

As it stands, similar to lots of other cases of modern story telling, these rape scenes just scream low hanging fruit power fantasy/wish fulfillment with minimal thought put into plot. Just break the characters/set up the protagonist as the ultimate hero to force the desired dynamic in there. Whoo how creative!

Rape is a hot button topic, so people just mash that button until the label peels off. After all, for killing to be impactful we need t first care about the characters, which requires skill. For torture we need context, which requires thought. Rape just works for shock value and low budget empathy without even providing a real scene (or it acts as an excuse to write really gross rape scenes that are obviously power fantasies...)

The biggest red flag is probably if the perpetrator doesn't have prior characterization with a decent level of depth.
