I will start by saying that the world isn't a nice place full of rainbows and unicorns. Bad things, including sexual assault, do happen on a regular basis. Sometimes, they are predictable - for example, a man with historic temper issues and alcoholism stabs and kill his wife after she was caught cheating him. Sometimes, they are not - a girl is walking in broad daylight on a peaceful street and suddenly a man jumps on her, resulting in her rape. I am not saying that these acts (rape, murder, theft) are justifiable, quite the opposite. We, humans, instinctively know these things are wrong because they violate the Natural Law and the principle of non-aggression. Even so, these acts do happen. Some fictional writers reflect and use the real world as a basis on their writing, J.K. Rowling included. We see this in HP in various situations - the house elf issue, Voldemort's ideology, a complex and big State with various departments, monetary system based on metals and so on. It isn't hard to imagine that a world as similar as our own would have the same issues, so it's also natural for these crimes against humanity to exist in them - hence the reason for the Auror Corporation to exist or the war and the killings. Now that we concluded that they do happen on the Wizard World, the question remains. Should we, as writers, write about it? The answer is quite simple. If you want to do it, you do it. If you don't, you don't. I'll elaborate. You are not violating any Natural Law or harming anyone by writing about it - you could even argue that you are helping bring the issue up. Alas, I digress. The point is we cannot censor the stories that involve rape because the authors are in their domain and they are not harming anyone - the same goes for other issues such as under age sex and so on. You can boycott it if you find it offensive or simply don't like it, but again, you cannot absolutely prohibit someone from writing about it because that person is not violating anything. As you argue, we are in our right to criticize it to pieces if the rape isn't necessary to the plot - we can do it even if it is necessary. The point still remains - we cannot prohibit someone from writing about it or reading about it. My advice? Don't read fanfics like that, leave a nasty review if you do or downvote those fic search treads with these elements. But do not ever try to prohibit someone from searching about a story that contain it. That's just censorship.
