Oh god, why am I letting myself get roped into this social justice bullshit?

  but actual survivors hearing, "Hermione's too strong/smart to be "broken" by rape" implies that being hurt or affected by rape is somehow weak or stupid

I'm not responsible for actual survivors misinterpreting my post and if something like this sets them off they are probably not ready to engage with the topic.

No. What I'm saying is that it is stupid/bad writing to rape her in order to make her weaker, when authors are unable to write a romance with a strong female character. It's quite obvious that I'm not talking about literary award winners who try to portray a realistic and nuanced approach to the psychological consequences and subsequent struggles of rape survivors - this is [[/r/hpfanfiction]]. At worst, if I'm shaming anyone, I'm shaming shitty writers - and not even that was my intent.

  I'd even argue thinking that anyone should or could bounce back from most trauma based on their personality is troubling.

Why would I think this? No one has said this or even anything remotely close to this. Are you projecting or something?

As it comes to Hermione, yeah, I'd expect her to bounce back, but I can also see it going another way. It's not the "being a mess after rape" that I have a problem with, it's "putting rape into a story so I can replace a strong female character with a weaker one who needs male protectors".

Sorry for being so verbose, but I feel like I have to be extra specific now in order to avoid malicious misinterpretations. The next step in your script is usually to call me a rape apologist or something.
