You more or less agreed with me but somehow really skewed things here -- I made a general statement over stuff I was seeing in this thread and explicitly said it wasn't your topic but the replies to it, but I'm seeing an argument here to something that isn't happening?

  Are you projecting or something? ... The next step in your script is usually to call me a rape apologist or something.

I'd check a little better who's projecting here ;)

(P.S. I had upvoted every single comment of yours in here because I agreed with you so much, so I didn't think I was discussing anything worth that diatribe since we seem to be on the same page of "broaching thought." I'm sorry, I still am unsure why you took my comment so personally.)
