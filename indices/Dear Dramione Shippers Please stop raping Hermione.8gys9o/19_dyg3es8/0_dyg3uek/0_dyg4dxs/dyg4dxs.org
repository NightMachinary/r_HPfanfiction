Not your post specifically, but some of the comments. But a large part of rape culture /is/ actual people hearing some of the commentary that's happening in this thread. These characters are fictional, but actual survivors hearing, "Hermione's too strong/smart to be 'broken' by rape" implies that being hurt or affected by rape is somehow weak or stupid. I'd even argue thinking that anyone should or could bounce back from most trauma based on their personality is troubling.
