I am going to say: this thread has a lot of responses perilously close to victim shaming. Strong, smart women a.) get raped and b.) react in "not strong ways" all the time to assault. Hermione getting raped absoutely is an overused trope in many ships, but the issue comes from writers not deftly handling the issue or not delving into the different ways a character like Hermione /could/ react to rape imo. The trope becomes worn when it's just every writer throwing it in for shock value.
