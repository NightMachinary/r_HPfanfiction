For me, that's what it is when I do put in aspects of the plot that deal with sexual assault and abuse (child, domestic, whatever). It's me trying to outlet everything in my head over my own experiences with these things. It's like getting to...go back in time and write what I should have done, and would have done, and how I would have reacted better, or faster, or just been brave or strong enough to just stand up and yell to the world what was happening to me every day of my life. But I never did that, but I can at least make sure my characters get to do that for themselves.

Unlike the authors in this thread that are mentioned as being disrespectful and extreme about handling these plots, I don't think I am about it. I mean, even as a survivor I think it's impossibly hard to write down, to get across, to actually do and keep it...respectful and all that. But I'm trying anyway.

I think I'm doing okay with that. I don't make them the sole purpose of the plot, I don't use them to get people together, and they don't DOMINATE the whole rest of the plot threads I have going in my stories. They're just events and aspects in decades of a person's life, and even if the after effects do stay forever, they don't become their whole world. All that there is about them, or who they are. Like it doesn't me.

But anyway, these plot points, these events, they're there still, and I sort of need them to be there if I'm not going to go crazy in my own head here.

But I am sorry if it's too uncomfortable for anyone else to read about, regardless of anything else.
