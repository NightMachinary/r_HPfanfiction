I love the idea of Tomione so much, but something about that and Dramione are rife with authors who seem to get off on Hermione getting assaulted and going OOC. I've definitely read Snamiones that handled rape well (for both Hermione and/or Snape), and I'm conflicted because as an assault survivor, I admittedly like a Hermione that's dealt with my own shit. Bloodcult of Freud's "Tyger, Tyger" struck me as a fic that dealt with assault well because she literally wrote what I had thought and felt myself. It's just so rarely handled well in Tomione and Dramione. But then I spoiled myself reading Pygmalion as my first Tomione, haha (also the fic that got me interested in the pairing!).
