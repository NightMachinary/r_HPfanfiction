I really REALLY don't get the appeal. I've been told it's a way survivors can work through trauma, and that makes a certain amount of psychological sense, but I've basically stopped reading the pairing (and tomione too) because you're just going along and then, bam, sexual assault. And a lot of times, kind of disturbingly, the author doesn't seem to realize what she's describing is assault and if someone does that it's not romantic and not a reason to keep dating but a reason to get the hell away from the creep.
