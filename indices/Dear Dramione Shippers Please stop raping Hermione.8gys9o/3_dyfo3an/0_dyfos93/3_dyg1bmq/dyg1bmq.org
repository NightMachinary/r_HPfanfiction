I do kind of get the /potential/ appeal there. But for it to work requires really great writing skill and a lot of exploration of the underlying themes.

If you use this type of event the way nuclear war/natural disaster are used in post apocalyptic stories, but in a psychological sense, there are a few at the very least interesting and touching stories to be explored.
