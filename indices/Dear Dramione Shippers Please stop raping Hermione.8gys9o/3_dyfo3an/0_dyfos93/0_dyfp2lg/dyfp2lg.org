To be frank, anything involving Hermione/Any Death Eater is pretty much no go for me. It might as well be Anne Frank/Hitler and it is utterly gross. That aside, a friend of mine was raped in HS and I remember how hard that time was for her. These are nearly always gratuitous means to create angst which makes me quit stories with rape.
