IDK... I can think of a few good stories in that vain being told. However those do require the construction of a lot of new backstory, and modifying death eater ideology to be a lot more reasonable/less black vs white.

With canon history, death eaters and Hermione it's just stupid, unless that death eater turns into an ex-deatheater really quickly.
