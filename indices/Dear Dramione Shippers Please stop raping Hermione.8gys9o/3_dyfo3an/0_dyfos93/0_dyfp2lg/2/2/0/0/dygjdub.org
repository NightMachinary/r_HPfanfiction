Except at the same time you have [[http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2014/06/05/why-i-love-the-anne-frank-scene-in-the-fault-in-our-stars][other people]] who love the scene in question. You keep responding with very little in the ways of plurality. Not EVERYONE is going to interpret the same things from an artists work.

Some people are going to see the historical connection and appreciate the creator for keeping them in the conversation, others are going to accuse the creator of misusing history.

A creator can rarely choose the way someone is going interpret their work, even if they'd prefer others didn't. JRR Tolkien disliked the idea of his work being allegorical for anything, yet all you have to do is search for a few seconds and you'll have a ton of pages about how LOTR's is an allegory for one of the World Wars. Darren Aronofsky with his movie Mother has a specific allegorical connection in mind with the environment, yet the audiences created their own anyways.

I don't find it offensive because it's audience interpretation. I can't seem to find it disgusting that someone sees things in a specific way. If you're a creator of any piece of work you simply have to accept that people are going to interpret the work in whatever way they decide to.
