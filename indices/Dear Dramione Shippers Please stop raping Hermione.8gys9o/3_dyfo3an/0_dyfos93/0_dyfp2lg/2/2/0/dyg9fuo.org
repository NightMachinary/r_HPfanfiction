  I don't see how it's grossly offensive.

I find it offensive for the same reasons that some people thought that John Greene writing the main characters kissing in the Anne Frank house in /The Fault in Our Stars/ found said scene to be offensive:

  First, Justin Bieber elicited scorn for hoping Anne Frank would be a 'belieber,' then Beyonce was criticized for posting photos of herself from Frank's house in Amsterdam, and now box-office hit "The Fault in Our Stars" has left many scratching their heads for its use of the Holocaust landmark in a crucial kiss scene.

  The young-adult movie, based on John Green's 2012 book by the same name, shows cancer-stricken protagonist Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) inside the Anne Frank House --- on a recreated set in Pittsburgh --- sharing their first kiss, after a frail Hazel manages to breathlessly climb the stairs to the attic. Tourists around them break into applause.

  It was this juxtaposition of a couple sharing a deeply intimate moment with cheering strangers set against a solemn historic backdrop that rubbed most film reviewers the wrong way.

  "The film may get away with using cancer to tug the heartstrings, but combining cancer and the Holocaust is at least one trigger too many,” wrote Andrew Barker of Variety.

  Richard Corliss of /Time/ calls the scene "where a Jewish girl's descent into the Holocaust is straight-facedly compared to a teen's cancer," "egregious."

  [...] BuzzFeed's Ariane Lange and another colleague engaged in a thorough debate on the topic last week, with Lange taking issue with the fact that the two characters don't discuss Frank or how she died while inside the museum. Instead, Frank's story becomes a backdrop, a metaphor for suffering.

  "I don't think that human suffering should be a metaphor,” Lange told NBC News, adding: "I don't think that being murdered is the same thing as dying of cancer." [[https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/kiss-anne-frank-attic-did-fault-our-stars-go-too-n129116][(Source)]]

  "I guess I could say I felt the same way --- I also didn't read the book until after seeing the movie, and I only read the book *to try to comprehend the movie's ahistorical and callous treatment of Anne Frank*. I read the book looking for some kind of explanation, because it felt so out of place in the movie.

  Geographically, you're right; it makes sense. But they go to her house without really talking about her, or what happened to her. They don't really talk about her once they're inside the house. Lidewij says Otto was the only one to survive, and that's the end of the discussion. *Anne Frank in this movie is this cipher --- they don't talk about her history or how she died. She's just a metaphor for suffering, and I walked out of the theater angry, and I've been angry about it ever since.*"

  "I totally agree that it was a tad extreme of a comparison, and the Holocaust should never be spoken about lightly..."

  "I think saying they were 'dealt unfair cards' is a bizarre way of looking at it, to be honest. That seems to be what John Green thinks as well. (Since he and the filmmakers had no comment when I reached out to them, I tried to find other things he'd said about her.) An interviewer asked why Anne Frank was in the book, and Green said, 'Anne Frank was a pretty good example of a young person who ended up having the kind of heroic arc that Augustus wants --- she was remembered and she left this mark that he thinks is valuable --- but when he has to confront her death, he has to confront the reality that really she was robbed of the opportunity to live or die for something. She just died of illness like most people.' She just died of illness like most people. I*t's a callous view of the past*, and it really hits home in what you see in both the novel and the film: *The particulars of Anne Frank's death are less important than the vague idea of her suffering, and it's a disgrace to her memory.*

  ... they do not share her story. They don't talk in any detail about her life, and they don't talk in any detail about her death. And, I imagine, *this is because the metaphor would quickly fall apart if we actually confronted Green's assertion* that Anne Frank 'just died of illness like most people'.

  [...] She's not a metaphor for All People Who Die Young: She's a real, historic person who was murdered, and to say, "She, like Hazel and Augustus, is a person who died young but still lived a meaningful life" robs her memory of its true meaning, which is that this slaughter, Shoah, was a senseless tragedy, the result of deliberate evil.

  Lidewij says "Anne Frank," and the audience is just supposed to understand. And what we're supposed to understand is not "a teenager's emaciated body lying on the freezing ground in a pile of corpses." We're supposed to understand, "Ah, yes, Anne Frank, died young, very sad."

  *Cancer is heartbreaking, but it is not a genocide; it is not an organized mass murder, and to compare the two erases the intentional aspect of genocide.*

  [...] I don't know how recently you've read her diary, but I think to say Anne Frank made the best of a "bad situation" is not really accurate. She was just a regular teenager --- like, a huge part of her diary is devoted to how mad she is at her mom. *Anne Frank, the individual, is propped up as this sort of heroine, but that does a disservice to the memory of Shoah (the Holocaust)*.

  And the fact that Hazel and Augustus decide to kiss in the annex really underlines *that they don't think of this as a monument to human suffering; they think of it as this uplifting, carpe-diem place*. In the book, Hazel, the narrator, says she was "thinking that you cannot kiss anyone in the Anne Frank House, and then thinking that Anne Frank, after all, kissed someone in the Anne Frank House, and that she would probably like nothing more than for her home to have become a place where the young and irreparably broken sink into love."

  *She knows it's inappropriate, and then she clearly aligns herself with Anne Frank, and again, ignoring the actual circumstances of Anne Frank's death, she takes it upon herself to speculate as to what Anne Frank would have wanted.* Oh, Anne Frank, she loved love. So what you're saying, I think, is true: The book and the movie do take Anne Frank's house to be a place of inspiration for you to 'live your best life today,' and the reason they're able to do that *is because they don't take into account any of the Franks' actual stories*.

  [...] As for the victims, my point is that to call them heroes, to my mind, imbues their suffering with a higher purpose that I think is counterproductive. *Calling Anne Frank a hero takes something away from her*: She was a regular teenager who was murdered. It wasn't dignified, and it wasn't heroic, and that is what happened. *To remember it as heroic, I think, distorts it. It distorts the evil that actually occurred. And it's that kind of thinking that allows Anne Frank to be used as a prop.*

  [...] *To me, what would have been really great would be if Green didn't use Anne Frank as an empty metaphor. Or if the book and the movie weren't completely ahistorical.*" [[https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/anne-frank-the-fault-in-our-stars?utm_term=.doYW0zaKMY#.yoa67PLn23][(Source)]]
