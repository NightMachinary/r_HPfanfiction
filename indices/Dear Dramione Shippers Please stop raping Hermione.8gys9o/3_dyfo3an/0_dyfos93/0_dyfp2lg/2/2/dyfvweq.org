I don't see how it's grossly offensive.

Allegorical and metaphorical connections are made all the time from the reader of fiction to real life situations, many of which do involve WWII and Hitler. Finding a connection between fantasy and reality isn't something that inherently tarnishes the impact of reality, in a lot of cases it makes it something tangible that someone who wasn't in those circumstances could understand.

As for making this specific comparison, it does make sense. Hermione is a character who is apart of a minority being oppressed by a powerful political movement who would gladly see her "put in her place" or worse dead. Death Eaters as a whole believe in the superiority of the blood that runs through their veins. It's a fairly obvious historical connection.

This is the great thing about fiction though, we can put characters in unusual scenarios without necessarily agreeing with dogma coming from the characters.

People who are calling you a nazi are probably wrong (I don't actually know you so I can't say what your ideology is), but the idea that we shouldn't as the audience be able to interpret a story in our own way is wrong as well.

If you really want to avoid having people make connections like that you simply have to change the characters histories so the interpretation isn't really available to those who actually read and understand the story.
