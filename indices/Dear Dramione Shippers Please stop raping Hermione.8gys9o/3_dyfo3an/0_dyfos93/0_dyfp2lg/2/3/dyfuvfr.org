I didn't attack anyone, nor is the comparison disrespectful.

  "you're a Nazi, because that's like shipping Anne Frank with Hitler" at me.
#+end_quote

I didn't say you nor anyone else a Nazi. Nazis in general weren't exactly fond of writing about themselves in relationships with Jews.

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention fiction =\= reality.
#+end_quote

Wow, shocker. /s Also irrelevant. I made a comparison to a real life hypothetical, I didnt say it was real.

#+begin_quote
  you're as bad as a Nazi for liking that" does affect? Real people.

  It's inherently disrespectful of the suffering that millions of people
#+end_quote

Bullshit. JKR literally based the pureblood supremacy ideology on Nazi nonsense, the comparison is literally impossible to disagree with if you think JKR has any understanding of her own series.

I didn't say you or anyone else was as bad as a Nazi. I said shipping Hermione (or any other Muggleborn) with /Death Eaters/ was gross because of what Death Eaters want to do: kill all the Muggleborns, hence the comparison I made.

#+begin_quote
  fandom policing, and let people just enjoy what they want to enjoy. If they want to 'ship Hermione with a Death Eater
#+end_quote

I called it gross, I didnt police anyonr. You can ship it, but unless you just write away the history and beliefs of the death Eater in question, it's gross.

  Also see: Godwin's Law
#+end_quote

Oooh, wow, that's somehow a brilliant thing to bring up here. Godwin's Law is stupid if it's intended to be some conversation ender. The series main antagonist forces are incontestably magical Nazis.

Look, I'd normally be inclined to be more forgiving since people have their own experiences I'm unaware of beforehand that cause them to react in certain ways. But since you decided to be petulant, deceptive and overly defensive in your response, I don't give a damn.

You are are an asshole.
