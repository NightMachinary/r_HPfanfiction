  I was referring more to people's tendency in general to say the line I quoted from you in response to anyone bringing up a "dark" Hermione pairing. It goes back much further than your post today on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]].

Then you shouldn't have spent that entire post saying things that had nothing to do with me. Complaints of other people (hint: not me) calling you a Nazi just pisses me off because it just smacks of guilt by association. I didn't call you such, didn't imply it, didn't come in disrespecting you.

  And this is the point where I point out that it's important to respect other Redditors, even if they disagree with you

Yea that's nice to bring up after you come in putting words in my mouth and bringing up things I didn't do. I didn't call you an asshole (nor others like [[/u/colubrina_]] ) for shipping reasons. I did it because you seemed to be being deceptive as a means to make it seem like in was saying something awful by pointing out factual, intended comparisons between HP and real-world events, and why those comparisons make me find certain pairings gross.

I don't insult on reflex.
