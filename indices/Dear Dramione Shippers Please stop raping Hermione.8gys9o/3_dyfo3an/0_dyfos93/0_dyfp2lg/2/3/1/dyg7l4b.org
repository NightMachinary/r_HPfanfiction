  I didn't attack anyone, nor is the comparison disrespectful.

I was referring more to people's tendency in general to say the line I quoted from you in response to anyone bringing up a "dark" Hermione pairing. It goes back much further than your post today on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]].

  You are are an asshole.

And this is the point where I point out that it's important to respect other Redditors, even if they disagree with you. That's the entire point of my reply: people at-large being assholes to people who like "dark" Hermione pairings. How is pointing that out being an "asshole"?

Also, I would mention that the top commenter on this thread, Colubrina ([[/u/colubrina_]]), is also a well-known Tom/Hermione author. Is she an "asshole" for writing Tom/Hermione into her stories?
