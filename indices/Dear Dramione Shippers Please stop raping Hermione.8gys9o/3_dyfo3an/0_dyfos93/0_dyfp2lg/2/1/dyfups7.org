Claiming that you're a Nazi for writing a Tom/Hermione story is wrong.

Claiming that you can't compare Voldemort/Hermione to Anne Frak/Hitler is wrong. Voldemort is pretty much the Wizard Hitler. His ideology copies the German "Race laws" with half-bloods etc. And Hermione is the most prominent muggleborn - people Voldemort wanted to murder just for being born to muggles.

Now, they shouldn't exactly post that stuff in reviews to your stories - that's stupid, rude, and on the level of asking for hetero-shipping in a slash story.

But in a discussion thread? That's different.
