If you studied WW2, you'd know that the Death Eaters are wizard Nazis. Arrogant scumbags who believe in the superiority of their blood, blindly follow their leader and want to genocide those of "unclean blood" and take over the government a few years after a failed coup? Then proceed with their plans, starting to ban muggleborns from school, kick them from civil service and send them into camps? With some added hypocrisy?

Check, check, check and check - they are Nazis. Claiming otherwise is silly, stupid - and makes you look like you want to excuse Death Eaters or Nazis. Or think that wearing a different hat will make someone not a Nazi.
