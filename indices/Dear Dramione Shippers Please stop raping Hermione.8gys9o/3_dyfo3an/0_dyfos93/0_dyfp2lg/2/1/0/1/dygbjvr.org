A few things:

#+begin_quote
  No matter how much people claim that "Death Eater and Voldemort = Nazis and Hitler", or how popular an idea it is...it simply isn't the case. Rowling herself also notably got some things blatantly wrong about WWII and German history, including her claiming in an interview that Hitler was "half-Jewish" (he wasn't; this was something put out by Allied propaganda at the time).
#+end_quote

I don't think you get it. Rowling has said explicitly that Voldemort is intended to be magic Hitler (as if this really needed to be confirmed). Hemming and hawing about if she didnt every detail right correct is completely besides the point. Analogies aren't required to be perfect (they rarely are), they simply need to get the intended essentials (which JKR did). And just to quote her:

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort is of course a sort of Hitler. If you read books about megalomania types like Hitler and Stalin, it's interesting to find how superstitious these people are, with all their power. [...] I wanted Voldemort to also have those paranoid traits
#+end_quote

Both in terms of a preexisting view about an "inferior" group and how the DEs essentially engage in street warfare before taking over the government, Voldemort and the DEs are supposed to be Nazi analogues.

#+begin_quote
  When the people who write off any 'ship they don't like as "automatically evil / bad", it's not a discussion to begin with. You can't have a discussion with people who have already made up their minds, or who refuse to listen.
#+end_quote

If this was directed at me, well, sure I was stating my opinion, I wasn't trying to discuss it. Pairing a character with someone who is bigoted against them inherently is just gross. Now, one can write it in a way to get around that, which I didn't deny. But played straight it's extremely off putting, and it ought to be so.
