  Claiming that you're a Nazi for writing a Tom/Hermione story is wrong.

I'm glad that some people think so. Based on the response from some I've gotten on [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]], it would seem that a lot of people disagree.

  Claiming that you can't compare Voldemort/Hermione to Anne Frak/Hitler is wrong. Voldemort is pretty much the Wizard Hitler. His ideology copies the German "Race laws" with half-bloods etc. And Hermione is the most prominent muggleborn - people Voldemort wanted to murder just for being born to muggles.

Firstly, expressing a desire that "I wish people wouldn't do X" isn't claiming that people "can't" do something, They can do whatever they please, but I wish they wouldn't. They tend to forget that there's another person on the other side of the screen.

Secondly, I've studied WWII history, particularly in the case of getting historical accuracy right for Tom Riddle's character in the WWII era. No matter how much people claim that "Death Eater and Voldemort = Nazis and Hitler", or how popular an idea it is...it simply isn't the case. Rowling herself also notably got some things blatantly wrong about WWII and German history, including her claiming in an interview that Hitler was "half-Jewish" (he wasn't; this was something put out by Allied propaganda at the time).

This is why I mentioned people's tendency to draw false comparisons and equivalence between two things, especially WWII and /Harry Potter/. While they appear similar on the surface, the two are /extremely/ different in terms of context.

And, as always, context is always important. I'm going to quote a source as to why.

  The premise is quite clear as to how vital context is: without context, we immediately jump in our heads to what we want to say next, based on the very first few words we hear from the other person.

In this case, people have a tendency to (falsely) equate Deather Eaters and such with Nazism, saying they're the same. But they're /not/ the same...because the contexts in the two scenarios are completely different. As the saying goes, /"The Devil is in the detail"./

Also:

  *Contexts, however, are not static, but fluid and dynamic*,with important repercussions for both formal and informal learning experiences.

  [*Context can change.*] Professor Mike Sharples compares context to an ever-playing movie, "a continually unfolding interaction between people, settings, technologies and other artefacts" (Sharples, 2010). [[https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/mobile-learning/the-importance-of-context][(Source)]]

  But in a discussion thread? That's different.
#+end_quote

When the people who write off any 'ship they don't like as "automatically evil / bad", it's not a discussion to begin with. You can't have a discussion with people who have already made up their minds, or who refuse to listen.
