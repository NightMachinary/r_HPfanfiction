I really wish people wouldn't say "it's like Anne Frank/Hitler". That's a grossly offensive and disrespectful comparison to make, and I've seen people use that same line to attack people who are doing nothing but wanting to stay in their lane.

Case in point, someone wanted me to explain why I shipped young Tom Riddle and Hermione on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. I was nothing but positive, and I never attack anyone (even if I don't like their 'ship), but that didn't stop people from spouting "you're a Nazi, because that's like shipping Anne Frank with Hitler" at me.

Not to mention fiction =\= reality. People who claim that 'shippers can't understand this concept, or stereotype them as "just doing it because he's hot", seem to be just as much at fault as those they claim to disagree with, in that sense.

Too many people forget that these are fictional characters, whereas Anne Frank and Hitler were real people. It's offensive to use such a comparison to me, because I feel that it's a massive, false equivalence. It's inherently disrespectful of the suffering that millions of people (Anne Frank included) went through, as well as tarnishing the horrific scope and real-life impact of the atrocities that Hitler caused.

But you know what saying things like "you're as bad as a Nazi for liking that" does affect? Real people. Real people who just want to enjoy their fictional characters and pairings in peace.

I've seen so many people say things like "getting a Dark Mark tattoo is like getting a swastika tattoo, and makes you a Nazi" on [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]]. It's time to stop using Nazi comparisons, fandom policing, and let people just enjoy what they want to enjoy. If they want to 'ship Hermione with a Death Eater, or get a Dark Mark tattoo, then let them. It affects no one but themselves.

Unless they're actual Neo-Nazis...which I personally have yet to see happen...then don't tell people they're Nazis, or compare their pairing to "Anne Frank with Hitler". Just block the tag, or ignore and move on. Simple as that.

Also, no amount of non-canon 'shipping will change the fact that Hermione ends up with Ron in canon. That's just fact.
