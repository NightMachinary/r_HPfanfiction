  I've seen so many people say things like "getting a Dark Mark tattoo is like getting a swastika tattoo, and makes you a Nazi" on [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]]. It's time to stop using Nazi comparisons, fandom policing, and let people just enjoy what they want to enjoy. If they want to 'ship Hermione with a Death Eater, or get a Dark Mark tattoo, then let them. It affects no one but themselves.

You are free to ship whoever with whomever you want. If you bring it to a discussion forum I'm also free to offer my opinion on it (it's disgusting). If you don't want to potentially get criticized for your opinions it's best to keep them to yourself.

  Too many people forget that these are fictional characters, whereas Anne Frank and Hitler were real people. It's offensive to use such a comparison to me, because I feel that it's a massive, false equivalence. It's inherently disrespectful of the suffering that millions of people (Anne Frank included) went through, as well as tarnishing the horrific scope and real-life impact of the atrocities that Hitler caused.

Yeah, I mean, it's a comparison. That's what comparisons are for. Everyone understands that Hermione and Voldemort are fictional whereas Hitler and Anne Frank were real. When I say "A is to B as C is to D" it doesn't really help to point out that A and B are different than C and D and that they are very different letters.
