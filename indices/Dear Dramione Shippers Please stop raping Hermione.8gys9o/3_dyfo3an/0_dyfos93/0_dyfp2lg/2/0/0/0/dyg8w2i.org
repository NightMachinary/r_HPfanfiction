  To stay silent is to allow people's unacceptable behavior to continue unchallenged.
#+end_quote

Great, we are in agreement! Why did you complain about being criticized again?

#+begin_quote
  And I do, indeed, believe that commenting something like "you're disgusting / a Nazi for liking X pairing" to someone, who is clearly happy and likes X pairing, is rude, offensive, and disrespectful. The same goes for Dark Mark tattoos.
#+end_quote

Everyone in this thread told you it's wrong to call you a Nazi, just because you like a certain pairing. I haven't yet, so I'll do it too: It's wrong. And it's rude. Next?

#+begin_quote
  Also, in my view, the mentality (in general) of "maybe you just just stay quiet" isn't being fair, or considerate, of people with different opinions
#+end_quote

I told you to stay silent if you don't want to hear criticism (you were complaining about criticism). More power to you if you want to shout your favorite pairing from high heavens and convert others. Just accept opposition in good grace.

#+begin_quote
  And saying something like "shipping Hermione with Y character is like pairing Anne Frank with Hitler" is also completely dismissing the other person's opinion, even referring or equating it with being "bad" or "evil", without asking why.
#+end_quote

No. It's an argument/opinion. You're free to disagree. Some arguments are good, some are bad. Plenty people in this thread consider it to be a valid comparison (so do I). The only argument you raised against it showed that you don't understand comparisons.

#+begin_quote
  It's more than just a comparison, though. It's the false equivalence aspect of it that I have a major problem with.
#+end_quote

It's not an equivalence... it's an analogy/metaphor:
