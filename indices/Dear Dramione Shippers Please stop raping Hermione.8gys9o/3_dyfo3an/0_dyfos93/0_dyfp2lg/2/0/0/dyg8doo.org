  If you don't want to potentially get criticized for your opinions it's best to keep them to yourself.

I could say the same for those criticizing "dark" Hermione pairings. I'm not going to just going to "keep my opinions to myself" when people are treating others in a disrespectful way, simply for happening to have (or like) unpopular ideas. To stay silent is to allow people's unacceptable behavior to continue unchallenged.

And I do, indeed, believe that commenting something like "you're disgusting / a Nazi for liking X pairing" to someone, who is clearly happy and likes X pairing, is rude, offensive, and disrespectful. The same goes for Dark Mark tattoos.

Also, in my view, the mentality (in general) of "maybe you just just stay quiet" isn't being fair, or considerate, of people with different opinions. It's not giving those who disagree a chance to explain how, and why, they do so, and to explain their point of view. And saying something like "shipping Hermione with Y character is like pairing Anne Frank with Hitler" is also completely dismissing the other person's opinion, even referring or equating it with being "bad" or "evil", without asking /why/.

In other words, it's a knee-jerk reaction that doesn't bother to actually seek to understand the situation more. Disagreement is fine, but the implications of the line I pointed out (the one about Anne Frank) is more so trying to shut someone down, and strawman their position, then actually taking the time and effort to fully (civilly) rebut their position.

  Yeah, I mean, it's a comparison. That's what comparisons are for.

It's more than just a comparison, though. It's the false equivalence aspect of it that I have a major problem with.
