Don't bother with deep analysis.

Some time ago I made a post here about Riddle and Hitler.

The conclusion I made is that while it's not correct to put them on the same level, it's easy because Riddle is copied from Hitler and it allows to quickly mark Voldemort and his DEs as truly bad guys.

Also Rowling herself stated it in her interviews.
