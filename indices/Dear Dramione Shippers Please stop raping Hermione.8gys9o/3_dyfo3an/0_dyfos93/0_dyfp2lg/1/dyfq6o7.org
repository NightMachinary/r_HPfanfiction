Rape and Hermione are canon...^{^{What}} ^{^{do}} ^{^{you}} ^{^{think}} ^{^{those}} ^{^{Centaurs}} ^{^{did}} ^{^{to}} ^{^{Umbridge?}}

However, having Hermione get raped is just sooo unnecessary. I mean, the girl went through some "quality time" with Bellatrix Lestrange and came out slightly worse for wear. Do you really think that generic "Death Eater rapist" can do worse than Bellatrix "I turned a pair of Aurors into Vegetables and got of from it" Lestrange? (Or that he won't get incinerated by accidental/wandless magic?)

If you want Hermione dealing with trauma, just use that instead of piling even more shit on her plate because at some point it becomes comical rather than tragical (and not the funny type of comedy, but the cringeworthy one).

And even if she was raped, she would rather track down every person her rapist ever cared about and become Hermione the Impaler than become an angsty, scared woman. The girl was nearly killed by a monster snake and shrugged it off, she was tortured, fought in several engagements and was crucial to winning a civil war at age 18. Having her raped might lead to a dark path, but one that makes Voldemort look like a schoolyard bully rather than turn her into the helpless victim.
