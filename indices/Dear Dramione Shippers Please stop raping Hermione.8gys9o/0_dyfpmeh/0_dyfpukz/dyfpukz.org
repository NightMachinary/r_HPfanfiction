Yeah it's a bit unfair to single out Dramione... and you're right that it's generally a very common trope in all types of fanfics. The general idea is in any pairing where the love interest is "bad" they need something "worse", so that the bad guy can go "No, that's too far! Oh no, she's a human being after all!". Killing off her parents follows the same formula.
