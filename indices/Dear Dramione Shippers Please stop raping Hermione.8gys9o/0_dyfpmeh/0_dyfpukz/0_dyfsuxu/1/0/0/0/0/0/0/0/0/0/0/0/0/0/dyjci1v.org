They don't want to see her female side - they want to see her weak side. That's the issue. You don't even realise how sexist your argument about replacing her with "Herman" is.

You shouldn't quote Moltke if you don't have any idea what the quote actually means and where it applies to. It doesn't mean that every plan goes to hell, or that every ambush will fail - quite the contrary. There's nothing worse for military or other fiction than some shitty "no matter how stupid, they need a loss here, or it's not dramatic enough!" But, as I said - they didn't win everything anyway; I simply had them suffer losses when it was both logical and appropriate in the story.

Or, you know, people simply tolerate flaws because they have more important things to worry about. Much drama seems so convoluted and forced, like Indy!Harry blowing up at Ron for being jealous for a week or so, after risking their lives together for years. Some people simply want to see the female hero have a breakdown, cry and be emotional (and need a strong male shoulder to cry on), and everything else is "cosmetic."
