  Soldiers didn't fight Dark Lords, they fought other soldiers
#+end_quote

I think it's the most disrespectful to war veterans thing I've ever read in this subreddit. A good part of those soldiers went throw hell worse than anything Rowling or you put the heroes in.

  In canon, Harry won through luck, author fiat and a deus ex machina. I'd rather read about a BAMF with no weakness than about such a victory.
#+end_quote

It's strange, because BAMF is sort of deus ex machina no one can stand against.

Rowling let Harry win, but still he lost literally everything for that. Yes, her way is illogical, but let's be honest: there's no logical way for teenagers to win against the Dark Lord. This is something we have to accept, because without it there wouldn't be any HP books.

  That's the double standard. People expect a lot more weaknesses from female characters than from male characters.
#+end_quote

In stories about "Garry Sue" or BAMF Harry I saw a lot of comments about him being too perfect.

May people want to see he female side. What't is the point, if in the story "Hermione" can be replaced by "Herman" without affecting anything?

  I've had complaints about my characters winning every battle in "Divided and Entwined" even though in all those battles, the characters had overwhelming advantages

"No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy." In other worlds if you heroes win everything with little loses, you are definitely playing favourites.

  Further, some flaws simply don't matter much in some stories.
#+end_quote

And therefore they are cosmetic.

Character flaws may not affect the main plot significantly, but they play big role in character interactions. In your example it's alright when an officer to nag a green recruits, but if the same officer tries to do the same with another officer, or his/her fried, or spouse, the result should be absolutely different. If it doesn't happen, the author isn't serious about this flaw.
