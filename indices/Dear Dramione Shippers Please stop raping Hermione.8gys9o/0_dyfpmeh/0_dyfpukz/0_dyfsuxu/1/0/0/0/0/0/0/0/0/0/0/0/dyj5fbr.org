Soldiers didn't fight Dark Lords, they fought other soldiers. In canon, Harry won through luck, author fiat and a deus ex machina. I'd rather read about a BAMF with no weakness than about such a victory. It feels cheap and convoluted. If people like that - good for them. It's not for me.

No, the default for "strong female hero" seems to be "Mary Sue!" according to the criticism. That's the double standard. People expect a lot more weaknesses from female characters than from male characters.

And no, it's not easy to see when an author isn't serious about their protagonist's flaws. I've had complaints about my characters winning every battle in "Divided and Entwined" even though in all those battles, the characters had overwhelming advantages - they had days or more to prepare, picked the terrain, usually had the initiative as well and were up against unprepared enemies or at least had the defender's advantage. Unless you hand the characters the idiot ball or simply fudge things, then they can't lose such a battle. But that meant that the first time they had to enter a battle without much preparations, in unfamiliar terrain, they suffered greatly and the flaws - limited experience, dependency on set-piece battles - of the leader took effect. And the same happened later in a similar situation. But since they weren't acting like idiots, it took some time before they were forced into such a battle for the first time.

Further, some flaws simply don't matter much in some stories. Where for example, Hermione's tendency to nag people is a flaw, and could lead to trouble in a typical school drama, it isn't actually a flaw in a war story if she's a leader. As anyone in the army can tell, soldiers, especially recruits and green ones, tend to be lazy, and the noncoms and officers need to prod them - nag them - so they don't start to cut corners and your APC breaks down in the middle of the field, or you find that half the barrels of your M2 are rusted through.
