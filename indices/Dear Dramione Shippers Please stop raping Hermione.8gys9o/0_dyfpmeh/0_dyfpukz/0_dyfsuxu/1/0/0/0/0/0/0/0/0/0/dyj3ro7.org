If you want something in the middle, read all the slice of life stories. But if you have a story about heroes fighting villains, a protagonist either becomes a hero or turns into a damsel in distress - or is a side character, not a protagonist. If you're fighting the worst Dark Lord in Britain's history, you either shape up or become irrelevant - moral support, research robot, damsel in distress, etc.

Most people who complain about female BAMF aren't satisfied until the woman is weak and no longer able to kick ass. No flaws, no weaknesses are enough for them unless the woman starts needing a male hero to save her. Any flaw is waved away as not relevant. Any weakness as cosmetic only.

That doesn't happen nearly as often with male heroes. There, some flaw - hotheaded hero, weakness for girls, angst, whatever - usually is enough to satisfy those readers.

Because for male heroes, BAMF is the default setting.
