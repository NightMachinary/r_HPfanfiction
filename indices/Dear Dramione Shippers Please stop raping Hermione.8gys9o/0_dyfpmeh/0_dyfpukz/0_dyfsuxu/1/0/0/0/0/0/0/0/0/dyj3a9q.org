Where is the double standard?

Most of the HP fanfiction is about Harry. You can find almost any characterization of him just because of the number of the stories.

If you want weak Harry, a good chunk of HHr stories are about him being a doormat under Hermione's foot.

But it's not true about Hermione. A lot less authors write about her and because 90% of fanfiction stories are bad, there're very few of them where she's just a human with strong and weak sides.

As result there're two opposing camps: the first is damsel in distress and the second is BAMF. With almost nothing in the middle.
