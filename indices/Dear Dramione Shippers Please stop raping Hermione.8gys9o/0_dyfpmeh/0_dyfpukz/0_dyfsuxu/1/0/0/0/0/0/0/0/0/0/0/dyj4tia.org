I won't assume what others think, but for me you don't need to be BAMF to be the hero. Moreover our grandparents, who fought in WW2, or other soldiers in other conflicts aren't BAMFs, but they are Heroes.

In the canon Rowling managed to show just teenagers in the War, but she didn't make them BUMFs, and they are Heroes, because they're human.

Unfortunately very few who see it and even less who can express it on the similar level in their stories.

  for male heroes, BAMF is the default setting.

It's also true for “strong female” heroes.

  Any flaw is waved away as not relevant. Any weakness as cosmetic only.

Because mostly they are just cosmetic. It very easy to see when an author isn't serious about his hero's flaws and almost all authors with BAMF heroes have it in common.
