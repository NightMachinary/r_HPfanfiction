Is this really so much a Dramione thing? Attempted rape is depressingly common as a plot device, but I've seen it at least as often as a way to get, say, Harry and Daphne together, or doing it to Harry's already-girlfriend just for drama.

For me, the really annoying trope for Dramione, and really any post-war Hermione-centric fics is killing off Hermione's parents. I feel like there are more stories where Hermione loses her parents than where she gets them back.
