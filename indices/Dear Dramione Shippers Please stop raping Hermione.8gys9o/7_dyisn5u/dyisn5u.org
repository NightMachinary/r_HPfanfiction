Yes, please. Ditto Harmonians that have her be raped by Ron and/or WBWL!Neville.

More broadly, I seem to recall reading---though I can't find the source, despite googling some things I /really/ should not have googled---that the trope of the heroine being raped at the start of a romance novel was common as far back as the Victorian Era. It was a way around the traditional gender roles and expectations. In short,

1. A romantic plot along the lines of the hero asking the heroine's father's permission to court her, courting her with chaperones, them being duly engaged and married, and both being virgins until their wedding night does not make for an interesting novel. Therefore, the relationship had to involve some transgressions of this idealised procedure.
2. A man who did anything transgressive with a pure woman (i.e., a virgin) would be viewed as a villain corrupting the innocent, unless, perhaps he were equally innocent and pure (e.g., Romeo). Therefore, if the hero were someone more "experienced", the heroine in a romance couldn't be pure.
3. But, neither could the heroine be a scarlet woman, because then it would be viewed as pornography and not romance.
4. Therefore, the heroine had to be "deflowered", but not in any way that reflects on her character.

An easy way to implement this kind of plot is to have the villain of the story rape the heroine, and then have the hero come to her rescue and romance her.

It's been a while, and I couldn't find the source, so I could have gotten some details wrong, and take it with a grain of salt. I wonder to what point this dynamic is still in effect, especially if the fic writer is religious.
