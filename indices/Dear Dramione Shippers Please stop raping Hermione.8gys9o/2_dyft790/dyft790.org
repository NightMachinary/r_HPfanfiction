OK, this trope is not something I'd want to read. In fact it seems quite distasteful to me.

However, it seems kind of pointless to tell people what they should or should not have in their fanfiction. One of the good things about fanfiction is the freedom writers have to do whatever they want. That produces a lot of bad stories, but also stories that truly speak to you, and you can't have one thing without the other.
