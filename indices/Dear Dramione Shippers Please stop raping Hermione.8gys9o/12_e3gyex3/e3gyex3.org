As a trauma survivor it's really difficult to find a dramione fic that doesn't have some sort of sexual assault and it's really triggering. There's nothing worse than a scene with assault in it later in the fic when I'm engrossed in it. There was one that had Draco and I think Lucius incapacitated as someone attempted to rape Hermione in the next room and let me tell you, reading that is horrifying. Most of the time it isn't even done well. If you're going to make Hermione a survivor of a trauma like that, at least do it well because having her attacked then everyone's angry for about one chapter....???? It's bad. It's unhealthy. Also, I've read ones where Hermione is attacked by Draco and falls in love with him? No. That is not healthy. Stop having Hermione attacked and STOP ROMANTICISING IT. If you're going to include sexual assault, PUT IN WARNINGS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY AND USE ARCHIVE WARNINGS APPROPRIATELY SO NO ONE IS TRIGGERED 3/4 OF THE WAY THROUGH YOUR STORY
