Yall. [[/u/colubrina_]] is one of my FAVES and a gift to this pairing and this fandom.

I would recommend Rebuilding - it's long and deals with some heavy stuff but oh so good. I also LOVE The Die but I'm not sure if it's still up online? The Wrong Strain is an awesome trope subversion, and The Green Girl is a great take on Slytherin Hermione.

if you're looking for more recs I also suggest anything by olivieblake (especially Ride or Die, and, for a much slower burn, Nobility).

I've also got a non-rapey marriage law (shockingly uncommon!) fic called Don't Take This Sinner, if you're into that.

I have loads more recs if you want em (esp on the darker side, mostly post-Hogwarts, quite a few weird AUs) but Colubrina is the queen of this pairing and a great place to start.
