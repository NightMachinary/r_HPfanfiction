Meh. If you wanted to read any of mine, go for Unlikely Brothers. It's Harry/Tom as best friends, no slash, t-rated but with an implication that Harry is screwing almost every girl at Hogwarts because he's a reasonably attractive jock with questionable morals. I update that one at a snails pace, though.

For the dramione, ugh. Maybe Lady of the Lake? It's far more political than romantic and it's done. Pretty heavy handed Ron bashing, though.
