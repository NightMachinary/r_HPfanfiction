Green Girl has its issues. I could list a bunch off, though my problems with it tend to be writing stuff rather than basic story telling problems. Last time I looked at it I was reminded why I never look at old fanfic and shut it right back up again. I like to think I've gotten better at both mechanics and plotting since that one. It still entertains people, though (clearly, lol) not you.
