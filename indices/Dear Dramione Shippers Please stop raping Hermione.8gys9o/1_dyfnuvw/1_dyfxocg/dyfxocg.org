I mean, I applaud you for not falling into using rape as a way to get Hermione and Draco together, you simply rehashed canon, forced Hermione into Slytherin, even though nothing about her fits the Slytherin mindset, then simply bashed Ron and Harry for the rest of the story while ripping straight from the original book. Not only that but in the very first two chapters, you pretty much raped anything that goes with Slytherin.

I mean, Salazar Slytherin didn't have a basilisk to purge the school of Mudbloods... nope! We accept everyone! You're one of us, Hermione, and now we all love you! We're misunderstood, don't you get it? The rest of the school thinks we're evil, even though we are because I seem to repeat everything the book version of me said! God, Draco, so smart and witty!

Oh, look, the same, bland, boring plot just changed to move a Slytherin Hermione, who doesn't even act like a Slytherin, she's just superficial arm candy for Draco to fulfil your obvious wank-fest for her.

I mean... yeah...

I would prefer the rape fics, honestly. Less cringe, more original content.

P.S: Yes, I am annoyed by all this crap about Hermione and nonsense when the same authors that attempt to defend it do even worse shit. The only way for Draco and Hermione to work is if you change everything. You cannot rehash fucking canon and have it work. That's piss-poor writing.

I eagerly await my downvotes.
