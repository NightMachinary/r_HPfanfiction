So, according to you, people who have experienced a less sexual kind of trauma -- let's say, being beaten to within an inch of death -- shouldn't be afforded the same consideration you're giving to victims of rape because there's simply less of them? (which quite possibly isn't true).

Look, you can't say "don't use rape as a mechanism of driving Hermione and Draco together," and then turn around and claim that using torture is fine. That means you're elevating one pain over the other, and that's the worst kind of thinking. You either don't use either or allow both.
