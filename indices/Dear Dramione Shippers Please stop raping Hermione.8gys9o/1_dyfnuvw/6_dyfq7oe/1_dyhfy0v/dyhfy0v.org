Because it is entirely possible that you will go through your life never have to worry about being tortured. You will likely never meet someone who has been tortured.

Rough statistics say 1 in 6 women and 1 in 20 men will be raped or sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Rape has a distressingly high rate of PTSD resulting from it and there have been multiple public cases where rapists have gotten off with a slap on the wrist in punishment, if anything.

Of the two, rape or sexual assault is the one that most readers and writers are more likely to have experienced or know someone who has experienced it. And it is far, far more likely to be used as 'generic tragic backstory' for women. It's also far, far more likely to be badly written.
