Because there are many (not I) who would say there are a limited few cases where torture would be permissible (the classic "guy setup a nuke in the city and you're on a limited time table" argument). Rape is just literally unjustifiable, it can't even serve a further purpose that you could defend morally. It's intended to dominate someone by twisting what's supposed to be an intimate experience.

I mean, stories can incorporate it but nearly all of them fail to do anything beyond drama where the antagonist is made to be truly irredeemable (also often mixed with the assumption the woman is now "damaged goods") or to to show the hero in good light as he gets revenge for the raped woman.

Lots of stories cover people dealing with the murder of loved ones (I'd like less revenge murder sprees though, heh), many also do so for prisoners of war who were tortured. Not many do so for victims of rape dealing with their rape, that is often treated as something that the other characters react to as opposed to the victim having to live with and get passed themselves.
