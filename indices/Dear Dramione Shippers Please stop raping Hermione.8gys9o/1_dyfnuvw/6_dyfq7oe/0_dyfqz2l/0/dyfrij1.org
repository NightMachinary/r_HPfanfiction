You just described a scenario where one could find torture justified, and yet in the next sentence you claim rape is "literally unjustifiable". Do you not see the flaw in that logic?

Here, to illustrate, I will use the same example you proposed: nuke in the city. There's a nuke in the city, to get the information to disarm it, you threaten to rape the perp/associates of the perp/family of the perp. Boom. Rape is a form of torture. It's that simple. It is no better or worse than gouging someone's eyes out. It's all equally bad.

To your second point: yes, I can see stories using it as a lazy mechanism, poorly written, to move the plot. That doesn't mean it can't be written well or that it should be avoided at all costs. Blanket statements like "don't write rape" help no one. What are we supposed to do, pretend it doesn't exist?
