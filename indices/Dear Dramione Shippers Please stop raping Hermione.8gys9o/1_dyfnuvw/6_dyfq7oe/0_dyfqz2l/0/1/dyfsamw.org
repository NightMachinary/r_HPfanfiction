  you threaten to rape the perp/associates of the perp/family of the perp.

You'll notice that I said I'm not one who thinks torture is permissible in such a case (hence "not I"). But even then, your example suffers at least 2 problems: a factual problem being that such things have been tried many times and didn't work (hence why torture isn't defensible in my book) and secondly it's just inherently unlikely to work. If torture works at all (doesn't appear to given the track record of Guantanamo Bay, where threats of rape/familial rape were plentiful) then the most rational method would be to threaten the worst level of physical pain. So even there, it doesn't check out.

  That doesn't mean it can't be written well or that it should be avoided at all costs.

You know, rather than make a new response to that I'll just quote my previous post:

  I mean, stories /can/ incorporate it but nearly all of them fail to do anything beyond...

Don't misrepresent what I said, please.
