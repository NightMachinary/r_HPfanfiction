If your position was that torture didn't work in the first place, why bring it up as an example? And, yes, I understand, not /your/ example. I merely followed the logic of the proposed scenario, where rape can be used as a form of torture. It's not better than ripping off someone's fingernails, but neither is it worse. It's all bad.

And, if you're claiming that "worst levels of physical pain" are more effective in interrogation, then it would stand to follow that /that/ form of torture is more heinous than rape.

I don't like that logic. It's all bad. Which bring us to my original question: why is OP singling out rape?

And my apologies if you took that as a misrepresentation of your words. It was not meant to be. But the majority of your post seems to be defending OP's position, which is something I'm vehemently against.
