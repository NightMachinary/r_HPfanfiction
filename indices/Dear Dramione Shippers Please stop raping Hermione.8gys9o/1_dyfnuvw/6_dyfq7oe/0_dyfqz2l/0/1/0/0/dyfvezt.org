  If your position was that torture didn't work in the first place, why bring it up as an example?
#+end_quote

Because, as was said, some people do believe there are a few instances where it is, but will deny that rape has any such exceptions. And the idea that all torture is "all bad" makes all torture out to be equivalently bad. And given the nuke example requires utilitarian moral reasoning, its inconsistent to say that.

  And, if you're claiming that "worst levels of physical pain" are more effective in interrogation, then it would stand to follow that that form of torture is more heinous than rape
#+end_quote

...that was literally the point I was making. Because.of that, your claim that you're "following the logic" for rape being permissible in some cases if torture is permissible does not follow. Like, if the most successful torture requires maximum pain then rape isn't defensible.

  why is OP singling out rape?
#+end_quote

Because rape doesn't have, on almost anyone's view, exception cases where it's morally permissible. If torture is permissible, then rape in particular just becomes gratuitous. And if torture isn't permissible in certain extreme cases, then rape isn't even on the table as being permissible in any case. Rape is about domination, and OP is just saying it's use is just for drama 99% of the time.
