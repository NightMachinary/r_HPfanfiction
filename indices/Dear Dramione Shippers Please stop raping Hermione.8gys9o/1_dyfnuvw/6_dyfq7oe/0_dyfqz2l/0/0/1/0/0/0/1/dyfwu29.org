I'm not sure I can agree that rape carries additional connotations. At this point, it's all contextual and depends on the specific situation/individual. I mean, thankfully there are very, very few people who would be able to say whether rape or having, like, your eyes gouged out, is more or less scarring. I would say it's all terrible.

Yes, I can agree with part of your original post that many stories where Hermione is raped is just lazy writing, where, for example, Ron forces himself upon her and she runs away to find love in the helpful arms of Draco Mafloy, who just so conveniently forgets about his prejudices. Yeah. That's not great.

But, that doesn't mean it can't be. Rape is sadly a part of life and it can be explored in a way that is healing and supportive and actually makes you feel for the characters. Calling for a moratorium on writing it (which isn't exactly what you're doing, but it's close) is both an act of hubris and ignorance. I can't support it.
