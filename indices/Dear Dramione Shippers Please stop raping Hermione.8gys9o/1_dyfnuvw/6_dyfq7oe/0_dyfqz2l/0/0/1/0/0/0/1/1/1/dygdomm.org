  Furthermore I get where the OP is coming from, fics that just toss rape around willy nilly is the most annoying shit. It's really about how it's done, why it's done, and how it's handled. Not many do it well.

Yeah, that's all I want. Try to give purpose to a rape in a story and the significance the topic deserves. I'm totally going to forgive if it turns out badly, or mistakes are made or doesn't really work in the story, but at least give an effort. If rape is just your go-to response for everything I'm going to be pissed.
