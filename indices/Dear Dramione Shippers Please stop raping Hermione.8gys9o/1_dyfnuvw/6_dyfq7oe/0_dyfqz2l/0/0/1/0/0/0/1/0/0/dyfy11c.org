  Look, I get it, it's hard to bring Draco and Hermione together, but if the only way you can do it, is by having Draco be her hero and rescue her from being raped or sympathize with her after she was raped, you're doing it wrong. Just stop.

You're telling people to stop using rape as a catalyst for Draco and Hermione's development. Then you call it "tropey". And your title speaks for itself. I mean, you give yourself some leeway in the latter part of your post, which is why I said you weren't exactly calling for a moratorium on it, but I also don't see how I'm misconstruing your point.
