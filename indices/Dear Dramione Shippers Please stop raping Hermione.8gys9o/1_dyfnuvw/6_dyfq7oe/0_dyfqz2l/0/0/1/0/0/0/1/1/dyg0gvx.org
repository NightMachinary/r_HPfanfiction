Much rather have my eyes gouged out.

Alot of the issue is people who have never been raped downplaying it and saying there are worse things.

There is literally nothing worse.

A lot of people in the survivors support group I go to, and I as well, we do some public speaking. And sometimes the question comes up about what it's like, how bad is it. And in one case they brought up a news story, and the question was, "I mean whats worse death or rape? I'd think I'd rather be raped, at least than you're still alive."

Every single person in my group said they'd rather be dead than go through it again.

Furthermore I get where the OP is coming from, fics that just toss rape around willy nilly is the most annoying shit. It's really about how it's done, why it's done, and how it's handled. Not many do it well.
