  a magical world where you can simply erase memories, so psychological damage is a moot point either way

Assuming that removing the memory also removes the trauma. Chemical balance of the brain and interconnectedness may prove you wrong, but that's just speculation.

  but I bet that if you asked 1000 people on the streets if they'd rather get raped or have a finger cut off, 950 would chose the finger
#+end_quote

Having a finger cut off isn't automatically torture. Experimenting with torture is very dangerous, but people quickly realize that just being bound and utterly helpless (until they use a safe word) can have an incredibly debilitating effect on the psyche.

Just as an example here's an old clip from Mythbusters where Kari completely freaks out in a very controlled environment, testing Chinese Water Torture (dripping water on the face, drip by drip):

As to the original question about "how many people would rather be tortured than raped", then that really seems to depend on the type of torture and the severity/brutality of the rape, no? Not sure whether making this comparison in such vague terms is really helpful.
