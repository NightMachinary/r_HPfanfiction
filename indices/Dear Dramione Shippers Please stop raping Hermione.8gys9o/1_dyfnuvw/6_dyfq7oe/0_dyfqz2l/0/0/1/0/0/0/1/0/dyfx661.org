  Yes, I can agree with part of your original post that many stories where Hermione is raped is just lazy writing, where, for example, Ron forces himself upon her and she runs away to find love in the helpful arms of Draco Mafloy, who just so conveniently forgets about his prejudices. Yeah. That's not great.

You're massively straw-manning. No one here has said that there's absolutely no place for rape in a fictional narrative. In fact I said the opposite in my OP. I'm sure I have some favorites that contain rape.

That's not what this is about.

  Calling for a moratorium on writing it (which isn't exactly what you're doing, but it's close)

No, not even close. Only if you read nothing but the title or intentionally misconstrue everything else I wrote.
