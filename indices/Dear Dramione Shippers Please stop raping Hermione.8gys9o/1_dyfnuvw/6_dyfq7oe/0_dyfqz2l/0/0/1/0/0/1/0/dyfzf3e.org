  Rape is more damaging than simple torture (from a psychological PoV). You can fix a lot of physical injuries, especially with magic, but you cannot fix the psychological damage as easy as a broken bone.

Yeah sorry, I have to agree with Boris here. Making such a blanket statement is not right. Torture can have incredible traumatizing psychological effects. Making any kind of judgment call which of both is 'worse' for a person to endure in the long run seems unwise.

Why would you claim that after being tortured you'd just have to repair the physical damage and you're fine? Have you heard of waterboarding? There's near zero physical damage and it's horrifying. Do you think people just have to get over being repeatedly drowned for hours on end? Would you say the same to a rape victim ("just get over it!")? I know you wouldn't. Surely torture victims experience similar feelings of helplessness by being at the mercy of their torturer.
