I get that. I'm not asking you to make a research paper, just reconsider the usefulness of making the argument at all in that case. I could have just responded with "getting raped vs being flayed alive for months" and I'm sure >950 of 1000 people would rather get raped. Lets just not argue about this, it's leading nowhere.

Another important video about torture I forgot to mention is the attempt of Christopher Hitchens at waterboarding. He was a proponent of using this as an "interrogation technique" before undergoing the experiment. Lets just say he changed his mind.
