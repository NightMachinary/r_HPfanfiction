  And as I argued at another point, rape would not break canon Hermione either way. She withstood Bellatrix Lestrange, so the average thug would not break her either. If anything, it would unleash Hermione's unholy vengeance on her rapist and anyone connected to him/her. Hermione would probably "lie back and think of +England+ the most painful way to slaughter the rapist like a pig and then track down his associates and bake them into Frey pies". Having Hermione raped serves no literary purpose.

  BUT, most authors writing rape scenes have this weird ideas about hurt/comfort and dealing with emotional traumas. And sure, some people are traumatised for life by those experiences. But it is established by canon that Hermione is not one of those people.

In no way does canon establish this. Half of why I think Hermione and Draco and so on get so much coverage is because we don't get the same sort of mental insight into their characters. We can see Harry confused when Draco is pale and skittish all of a sudden, or surprised when Hermione occasionally cries, but Rowling has only captured 7 /adolescent/ years from primarily one perspective. Which is partially why I think the better fics that deal with the fall out of torture, rape, war, etc. are when the characters are older. Because most children aren't going to be reacting to things like rape, near death experiences, etc. like expected because they're not even able to fully process trauma yet.

Frankly, it's unrealistic to say any of the surviving characters wouldn't have some elements of trauma.
