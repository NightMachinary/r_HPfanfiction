Rape is more damaging than simple torture (from a psychological PoV). You can fix a lot of physical injuries, especially with magic, but you cannot fix the psychological damage as easy as a broken bone.

And as I argued at another point, rape would not break canon Hermione either way. She withstood Bellatrix Lestrange, so the average thug would not break her either. If anything, it would unleash Hermione's unholy vengeance on her rapist and anyone connected to him/her. Hermione would probably "lie back and think of +England+ the most painful way to slaughter the rapist like a pig and then track down his associates and bake them into Frey pies". Having Hermione raped serves no literary purpose.

BUT, most authors writing rape scenes have this weird ideas about hurt/comfort and dealing with emotional traumas. And sure, some people are traumatised for life by those experiences. But it is established by canon that Hermione is not one of those people.
