Ok, I can agree with a large part of that.

But here's what I don't understand. If we replace just one word in you last sentence, then we get this:

"But having a character *tortured* just so that you can show that the racist scum is reformed is just bad writing."

But OP is singling out rape. And that's hypocritical. Many forms of inflicting pain are just as heinous. So you either cut them all out, or you don't.
