  But OP is singling out rape. And that's hypocritical. Many forms of inflicting pain are just as heinous. So you either cut them all out, or you don't.

Yeah, that's also shit writing. But you can't deny that rape has additional connotations about power and dominance. Personally I have never heard of someone being raped for information. Torture is most often portrayed as a tool (unless employed by a true sadist), rape is more insidious as a narrative device. Particular when it is done to a character which is sometimes seen as "needs to be brought down a peg".
