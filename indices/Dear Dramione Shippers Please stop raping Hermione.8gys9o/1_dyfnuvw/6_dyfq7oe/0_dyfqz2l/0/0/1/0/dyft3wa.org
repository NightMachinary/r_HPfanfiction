The torture curse is an Unforigivable for a reason. Secondly, we are not talking about a terrorist's family getting raped, we are talking about a protagonist getting raped for the sake of drama.

I mean, I don't care one bit about Malfoy, and if there's a story where he ends up as the prison bitch for his Death Eater crimes, then fine (like Snape in "Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood"). But having a character raped just so that you can show that the racist scum is reformed is just bad writing.
