And threatening to kill or maim the nuke guy's family as a way of making him talk isnt...hurting innocent bystanders?

And, you say rape is an ineffective form of torture. Why? Because it doesn't get the job done? Because it's not as "painful" and doesn't create the same "incentive" to talk? If that's the case, then we return to my original point: why single out rape? Rape is bad to write about, but causing someone immeasurable pain via the Crucio is fine?

Doesn't that strike you as a tad hypocritical?
