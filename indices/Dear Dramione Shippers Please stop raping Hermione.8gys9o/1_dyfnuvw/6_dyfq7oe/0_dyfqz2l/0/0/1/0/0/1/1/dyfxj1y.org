Okay, I'm really sorry to put it this way, but what makes you qualified to state that rape is more damaging than simple torture? (And what does "simple" even mean in this case?)

Like, how can you even make such a blanket judgement? How can you say that forced penetrative sex is better or worse than having your finger nails ripped off, your eyes gouged out, being beaten within an inch of death, or, being forced to witness the execution of your loved ones, which carries no physical torture but heavy emotional trauma?

It's up to the specific situation there. Depends on the individual. And it's all equally terrible.

Regarding your viewpoint on Hermione: I fully agree. I see her character as exactly the same way. But, having her turn vengeful, dark and sadistic should not preclude the need for emotional healing. Which can be set up to happen through Draco. It can be written well. Yes, it's often not. But saying it can't is false.
