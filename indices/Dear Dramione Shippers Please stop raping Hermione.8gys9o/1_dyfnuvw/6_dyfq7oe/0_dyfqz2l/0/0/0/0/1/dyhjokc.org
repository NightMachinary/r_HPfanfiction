  And interrogators can usually tell if the person is just talking bullshit to make them stop, at least according to a CIA doc I've seen a decade or so ago.

IIRC, stats show that /well trained/ interrogators can guess something more like 10% better than random chance (55-45), but estimated themselves as more like 80/20 or 90/10. Basically, you /can/ get better-than-random intel, but it's /nearly/ useless, and not something you want to bet peoples' lives on. And in /practice/, torturers at e.g. Guantanamo aren't even trained - it's basically "I'm going to hit you with this wrench until you tell me stuff". They aren't even psychologists.

  I'm not the one advocating torture here. I'm saying that rape is even worse because it is not an effective interrogation tool.

Right, but that's a terrible argument because rape is /also/ useless as an interrogation tool. Neither work, both are abhorrent.
