  Rape is ineffective as an interrogation tool, simple as that.

So is torture - turns out that people are just as likely to feed you a plausible lie as the truth, to stop the pain, and if you don't accept their answer and stop the torture after they give you the actual truth, they'll "confess" whatever they think you want to hear and will make you stop torturing them. This can result in false information and has all sorts of problems itself.
