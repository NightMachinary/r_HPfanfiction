Writing a recovering from Rape story could be good.

Writing a recovering from Rape story as a plot device instead as the plot... bad.

Don't treat it as a way to change a character, treat it with respect. Don't make it a background issue because that just makes it... background. Either it takes over the story and it becomes a story about recovering from emotional and physical trauma...or don't do it...please...
