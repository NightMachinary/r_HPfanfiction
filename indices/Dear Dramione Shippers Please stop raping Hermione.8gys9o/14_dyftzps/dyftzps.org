While i whole-heartedly agree with the OP, candor requires me to admit I do not care for Dramione at all precisely because the two in canon are so diametrically opposed that people feel the need to go to such extremes to bring them together. I will say, however, that one piece made me see the pairing in a different light, if not a pairing I'd go looking for: The Stories That Weren't linkffn(5505664)
