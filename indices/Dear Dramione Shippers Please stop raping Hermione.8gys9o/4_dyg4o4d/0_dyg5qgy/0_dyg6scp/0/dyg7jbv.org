I am not one to say that fiction should be sanitized. Rather, I am saying that when people are learning to write, they need to be aware of all the narrative tools available to them while crafting narrative, so that they can learn to use them effectively.

I have few moral squicks when it comes to fiction simply because it's not real. No one is actually hurt if you write that Hermione gets raped, but even then, rape affects people differently. I imagine Hermione (based on her character) to overcompensate after sexual assault. She'd withdraw and try to fix her problems all by herself. She'd throw herself into studying. She would absolutely not dissolve into tears and be incapable of functioning unless some Dude was around to drape herself over.

That honestly sounds more like Lavender Brown.

The thing is, people can write whatever they want, but if they are ignorant and unable to learn, what good does that do them?
