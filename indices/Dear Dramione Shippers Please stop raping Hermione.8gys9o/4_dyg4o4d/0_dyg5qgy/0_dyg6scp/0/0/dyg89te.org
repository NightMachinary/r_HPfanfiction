  I am not one to say that fiction should be sanitized. Rather, I am saying that when people are learning to write, they need to be aware of all the narrative tools available to them while crafting narrative, so that they can learn to use them effectively.

I'm not sure how to interpret your earlier reference to teen girls who might see stories like this and think they're describing something real except as a desire to sanitize fiction.

Having said that, I agree with you that it'd be desirable for beginning writers to reconsider whether adding rape to the story improves its artistic quality, and to consider other possibilities. But I think that because I want stories to be entertaining, rather than because I think it's immoral for them to include rape. And I think even amateurish, non-artistic depictions of rape could be forgivable if they ultimately lead a writer to becoming less amateurish.

For me, the best thing about fanfiction is that it's a sandbox in which people can play with and deconstruct traditional ideas, taking them to unfamiliar places, or making familiar places seem strange. I'm afraid of efforts to make fanfiction a highly moral sphere because I think they'll reduce the diversity of different interpretations that authors can explore, when that variety is one of fanfiction's greatest strengths.
