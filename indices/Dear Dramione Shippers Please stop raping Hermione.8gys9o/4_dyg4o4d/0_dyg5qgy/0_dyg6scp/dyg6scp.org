I don't think writers should cater to the lowest common denominator of teen girls who think that Harry Potter is real and rape is romantic. When I talked about the urge to sanitize fiction, your mindset is exactly what I had in mind. I don't think it's necessary or desirable to try to minimize the risk anyone ever will be influenced negatively by a story. The only stories that avoid such risks are those that are safe and boring.

My feelings on fridging women are the same as my feelings on rape as a dramatic moment. The problem is never with the trope itself, only with particular deployments of that trope. Attacking the trope itself won't make bad writers any better. Some stories about how the death of a loved one influences a male protagonist are worth telling, and even made more powerful by inclusion of the trope.
