Honestly, I think that there's creative ways to use rape in fic, but it's often used as a shortcut similar to fridging female characters to make male Main Characters feel things.

The problem is that this doesn't exist in a bubble. There are literally teen girls reading this stuff and thinking it's real. Or worse, romantic.

I've written rape before and I'm careful not to make it “sexy” for just this reason.

I'm not saying that it should be banned, but I also think it's good to have a dialogue about how we use tropes, especially ones that break female characters for Plot Reasons.
