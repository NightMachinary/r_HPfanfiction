Tropes are tools. Don't blame the tool for its misuse. If the sort of people writing stories in which there's a gratuitous rape scene instead write a different scene, that different scene will still have a very low expected literary value. The only thing norms against scenes like this accomplish are making the constraints of the audience's moral acceptability tighter for legitimately talented writers. Legitimately talented writers have a very legitimate need to push the envelope and tell stories about things that are especially dark or unusual and I don't want to see them discouraged from doing that in an attempt to sanitize fiction. Don't like don't read should remain our rule of thumb.

I hate Dramione, so it's not like I'm speaking up out of self-interest in a favored ship or story here. I just think that when morality gets mixed with art it usually makes art worse, and don't want posts like this to form a beachhead for some kind of broader shift. Harry Potter is many things, but often it's a story about good and evil, and I don't want to see the possibility of depictions of evil go away. And I get that nobody's calling for censorship or anything, but writers getting unfair bashing or social ostracism is a real thing that leads to incentivizing writers to be more vanilla and more boring.
