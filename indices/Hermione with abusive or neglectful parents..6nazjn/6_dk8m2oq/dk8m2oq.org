I read a Harry POV story once in which he offhandedly mentioned that Hermione was such a overbearing perfectionist because her parents were functioning alcoholics. It made a lot of sense to me- even if your parents love you, the chaos caused by alcoholism can still mess a kid up. And canon Hermione arrived at Hogwarts with definite issues.
