There are plenty, but none that I can recommend with a clean conscience. A lot of people like linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll), but the pointless Dumbledore-bashing and Hermione becoming absurdly protective of Harry for no clear reason wore me down. linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne) starts out well, but becomes a pityfest and Dumbledore bash quickly.

Yes, there's a pattern there.
