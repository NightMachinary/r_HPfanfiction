It could have been amazing.

Consider: you have a brilliant and powerful (whatever that means), yet profoundly messed up student showing up at Hogwarts out of the Muggle world, and being sorted into Slytherin. Remind you of anyone? It would certainly remind Dumbledore of his second greatest failure.

What would he do? Would he try to preemptively cripple this prodigy, to prevent another Tom Riddle? Would he try to instill in her the caution about imposing his will on others --- that he himself has had to learn the hard way? Or, perhaps, teach her to fear of her own power, like he fears his own? Would he try to recruit her as an ally --- perhaps an eventual successor, since Voldemort would be a common enemy? Or, would that be risking replacing one tyrant with another?

Of course, what he actually does is stick lemon drops in his ears and dance around singing La-La-La. Because that's the kind of fic this is.
