I do recall one such story, where Hermione's parents are these overbearing people who are dead-set on molding her into the perfect girly girl and very nearly threw her book collection to the garbage pail once. As a result, Hermione snaps and, while at Hogwarts, decides to become a boy instead. That story was told through professors' notes and it also had an unbalanced Harry. I can't, however, for the life of me remember the title.
