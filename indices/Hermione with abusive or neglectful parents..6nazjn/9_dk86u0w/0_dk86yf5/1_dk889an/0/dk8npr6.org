I mean, that's not how being trans works... Our medical understanding of people who are trans isn't that great, but from what we can tell, pre-natal hormone exposure plays a significant role. Basically, if someone is trans, they're that way from birth. People notice at different points in their life and dysphoria manifests itself in different ways (I personally experienced very minor things as a child, and then dysphoria grew exponentially as I went through puberty, and on the other side of the coin you have people who don't really understand that part of themselves until middle age), but basically my point is you can't just say something in his life caused him to become transgender. It's not like schizophrenia that way.

That said, I haven't actually read the story, so maybe it's written that way. If that's the case I think that's a pretty glaring flaw in the storytelling.
