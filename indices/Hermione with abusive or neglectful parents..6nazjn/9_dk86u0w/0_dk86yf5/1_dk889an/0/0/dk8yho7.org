I'm no authority, but I think it varies. What you describe exists, naturally, but is it the case for all people who decide to become trans? I don't know. As a general firm believer in nurture versus nature, I'd tend to think that while natural /tendancies/ may exist, individuals always have free will on what gender they want to be.
