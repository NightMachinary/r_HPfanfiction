You know, I just realized this whole argument is somewhat unfounded either way because /Session Transcripts/'s Hermione is transvestite and transgender but not trans/sexual/. She just dresses and behaves like a boy, but there's no physical operation involved. And that level of commitment can easily be achieved by non-naturally-transgender people.
