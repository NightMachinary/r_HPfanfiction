Most people who are assigned female at birth don't under go GCS/SRS primarily because of cost limitations. While phalloplasties are an option and you can achieve results that are undiscernable from people born with penises, they range from just extremely expensive all the way to completely unrealistically affordable for the non-rich. Also, lots of transgender people don't use the word transsexual. You see it used more commonly by older trans people, and they are typically the ones who also make a definition between those that have had GCS and those that haven't, but younger (think like 30 and down) tend to use the word transgender for everyone regardless of how much or little someone transitions.

I challenge you to find a local endo or gp that will prescribe estrogen and an anti androgen or testosterone for you (which in and of itself can be an extremely difficult task) and take it for 3 months and still be of the opinion that being trans is something you choose. There are documented cases of people who are not trans undergoing HRT either due to medical necessity or because of another diagnosis causing fixation on being the other gender while not actually being trans. To a one the all begin to experience gender dysphoria as their body adapts and starts to change. I expect that very quickly you will realize that this isn't something you can choose.
