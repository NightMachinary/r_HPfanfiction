I want to keep this polite that there's really no other way to say this besides you're just wrong. Literally since before I knew there were differences between boys and girls I've been unhappy (to the point of daydreaming about self mutilation) with my genitals simply because my brain is wired to expect the other parts. If trans people had a choice in this none of us would be making the choice to be trans. We risk losing all of our friends and family, if we have a spouse then almost certainly them, we're discriminated against in public, the work place, at home, the bathroom, the doctor. We can't escape it. The legal difficulties are very extreme for many trans people all over the world. Every time I mention im trans to someone I'm interested in romantically I get to watch all the interest suddenly leave them, and usually disgust replace it. When that doesn't happen they often end up fetishizing me and are only interested in sex, and sex that makes me viscerally want to mutilate my own body at that, but that never stops them from becoming creepy, because they and you objectivize trans people into people who do this by choice and invalidate their feelings. When people don't immediately lose interest then I get to play the fun game of figuring out whether they're genuine or just want to rape me, or sleep with me but have no interest in dating, or even murder me.

None of this is exaggerated. Go look at suicide rates for trans people who don't transition vs those who do. It saves tons of lives, because this isn't a choice we get to make, it's something decided for us long before we're able to make any choices at all.

It's not something we get to decide, and when you say that it is you disrespect all of us.
