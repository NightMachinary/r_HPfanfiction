I like the idea of her parents being emotionally abusive ie your not good enough etc or ignoring her after they find out shes a wich its adds a bit of conflict to stories where she is one of the protagonists without the whole "im a muggleborn" and "smartwst witch of her age" being the only forms of conflict to draw on. Its why even though i despise the dursleys treatment of harry i understand why authors ramp it up in their stories.
