I'm not going to argue with your experience, but I don't buy that characterization of Harry's behavior: what was he supposed to do, spend his time meditating on the dreariness of Dursleys? And, throughout canon, various characters had risked and even sacrificed their lives for others.

On a more Doylist level, I don't think that Rowling meant to portray Harry as having been traumatized by the abuse. The Dursleys, those Muggliest of Muggles, both fearing the unknown and profoundly unimaginative, those bumbling "evil step parents", were not meant to be taken seriously and neither were their actions meant to be meaningful or consequential. One might as well lambaste Bugs Bunny for dropping an anvil on Daffy Duck's head.
