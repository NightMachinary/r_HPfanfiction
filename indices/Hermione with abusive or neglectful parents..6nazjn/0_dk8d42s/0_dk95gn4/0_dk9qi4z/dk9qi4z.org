My sense is that there is nothing in Harry's attitude in OotP that couldn't be better explained by him being a moody teenager under a lot of stress. For it to be considered an effect of abuse, we have to ask how many /non-abused/ teenagers would behave this way in that situation; and my sense is that many would.

And, well, when Hagrid comes to pick him up, he is easygoing and smart-alecky. I am not an expect on psychology of abused children, but it doesn't strike me as symptomatic of a history of abuse.
