  Canon basically does that with Harry being neglected by the Dursleys.

I'm going to disagree with that: Harry does have a lot of emotional issues throughout the series, the most notable being OotP, and while it could partly be inherited from his parents, a lot of it tends to be bottled up, because he still thinks people will scorn him for it. He can also act aloof a lot, which kind of shows signs of emotional abuse. Obviously the fate hanging over his head doesn't help, but I think saying the neglect and emotional abuse at the hands of the Dursleys didn't affect him is a bit ridiculous.

It's also important to remember Rowling timeskipped a lot, so it's possible a lot of this stuff happened off-screen. It would get a bit old reading about Harry trying to come to terms with that shit, the reason OoTP includes that stuff is mainly because it happens around important plot points.
