Viewing things more clinically, when a fic has an Abused!Protagonist, writers seem to fall into three loose categories:

1. No consequences: the character isn't really affected by it. Canon basically does that with Harry being neglected by the Dursleys.
2. Woobiefication: the character emerges as reticent and unassertive, and spends the fic as the proverbial damsel in distress. If the character is male, they are often 'shipped with another male character. (I don't like that stereotype, personally, but enough people apparently do that it's done a lot.)
3. Badassification: the character emerges as a scrappy badass whose main area of angsty contemplation is about how badly he or she should destroy his or her enemies.

As one might expect, for Harry, most fics go with 1, and most of the remainder go with 3 (though I may be working from a biased sample here). With Hermione, her being abused or neglected at home isn't canon, so there aren't many 1s (because authors have to go out of their way to point out that she has been abused or neglected, but then do nothing with it), and most of the rest are 2s. 3s are rare, and appear to involve Slytherin-worship and Dumbledore-bashing far more than they should.

Does anyone know of Abused/Neglected!Hermione fics where she's a scrappy badass, /but/ there is no Manipulative!Dumbledore and other Dumbledore-bashing or Slytherins suddenly turning out to be nicer than Gryffindors?
