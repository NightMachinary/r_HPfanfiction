I am finding the idea of mob daughter Hermione hilarious and desperately hope that such a fic can be located.

- Why is she so careful to follow rules and procedures? Because where she comes from, failing to do so gets you caught and jailed at best and tortured and murdered at worst.
- Learning about the mind arts and Memory Charms makes her alternately giddy and paranoid.
- A few days after Draco turns them in during the Norberta escapade, he's found beaten to a bloody pulp, with "snitches get stitches" written on a note next to him. Naturally, Hermione, Harry, and Ron all have ironclad alibis.
- "Why don't we just put a contract out on Lucius Malfoy?"
