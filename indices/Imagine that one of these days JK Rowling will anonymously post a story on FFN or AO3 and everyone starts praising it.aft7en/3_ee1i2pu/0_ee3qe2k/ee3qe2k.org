I came here to post that story as well. If someone told me that RRFang was actually just an account used by Rowling to post that story I would believe it. They have no account description, no favorites, they never wrote any author's notes, haven't been active since the story finished and the story itself portrays the characters and world of Harry Potter better than almost any other story I've read before or since.
