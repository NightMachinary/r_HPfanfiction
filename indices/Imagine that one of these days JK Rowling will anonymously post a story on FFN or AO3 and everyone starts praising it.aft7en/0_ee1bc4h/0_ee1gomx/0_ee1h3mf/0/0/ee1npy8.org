The people that wrote it and pulled it off had "connections" and pitched it to her, with a decent sounding pitch, probably along the lines of "There will be a bit of nostalgia when traveling back, but it will all be about the amazing character arcs of the next generation, where Harry's children learn that being a hero isn't easy".

She then probably discussed a few things with them, started to like some of their ideas, and the rest is history.

Yeah, they were essentially pitching fanfiction, but they were pitching it directly to her, in a totally different medium and were probably recommend to her by some of her friends.

I am 100% sure that while the writers of CC were talented and proven, they only got the chance because they were well connected.

And from what I heard the play is great as a play - it apparently just doesn't work well as a script.
