Cured Child is a great piece of fanfiction (I wish there were more stories of that quality frankly-it's readable, not a bad story and consistent within itself) but not a particularly impressive Harry Potter story.

If it were released as fanfiction, it would undoubtedly be praised.

Edit: I'll be honest I was hoping I would be able to stop this comment taking over the thread, but clearly not.

Firstly,

A) This is an unbelivably low effort comment. It's posted all the time and is /always/ tangential to the topic. So at /least/ post a response to the topic.

B) It's blatantly ridiculous. This is a fanfiction sub. The Cursed Child is no different to the majority of stories posted here. It would be praised because we accept different standards for fanfiction and Harry Potter stories.
