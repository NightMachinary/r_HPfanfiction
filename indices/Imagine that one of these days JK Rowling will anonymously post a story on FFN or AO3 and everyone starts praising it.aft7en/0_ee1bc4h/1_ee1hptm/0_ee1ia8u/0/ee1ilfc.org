Not as common as one would like the best authors, I'll check it out :).

Cursed Child is funny because it rather shows the difference between fanfiction and legitimate stories within the world. As fanfiction it's pretty good. Not excellent. But good.

As a Harry Potter story? It doesn't work. Fanfiction is allowed to play with the world and use time travel devices and have crazy plot twists. But a proper Harry Potter story has to tone it back.
