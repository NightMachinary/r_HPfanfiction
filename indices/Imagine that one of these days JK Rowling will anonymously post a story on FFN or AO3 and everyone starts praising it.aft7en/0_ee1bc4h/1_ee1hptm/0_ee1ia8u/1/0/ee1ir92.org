not a link but there's so so so many different books, a few series' on the marauders, one centered around the Wesley twins, quite a few characters have their own little spin offs of her main books which follow her own characters living their own lives throughout to Harry Potter timeline, I'd recommend the brotherhood, tightly knit and imagine dragons series' but there's plenty of others to chose from
