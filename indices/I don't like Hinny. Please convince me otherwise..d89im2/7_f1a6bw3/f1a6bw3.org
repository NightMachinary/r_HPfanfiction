I also dislike this pairing, and I found out the reason for it is that it always felt as if they were "meant" to be, not to mention the whole "Potter curse" stupidity.

That being said, a couple of the fics I've enjoyed with this pairing are linkffn(Gothic by Brennus; Harry Potter and the Nameless Man)

Yellow Submarine is also good, but someone already rec'ed here.
