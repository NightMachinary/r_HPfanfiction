I think you're referring to an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex][Oedipus Complex]].

I get so baffled every time people reference this (or anything about Ginny looking like Lily) as a negative, because:

1. We know nothing about whether they look alike beyond their hair color (and I don't see people out there crucifying 'men who prefer blondes' or anything like that)
2. From a genetic perspective, I wouldn't be surprised in the least if the type of features you're attracted to are passed down in some shape or form, though [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-more-attracted-to-people-who-look-like-our-parents/][there's been no evidence to support this that's stood up to even cursory scrutiny]]
3. Even if the Oedipus Complex were actually a thing and were shaped in part by the person BEHAVING like your mother/father and not just looking like them, an orphan is a case where that's NOT creepy. You're essentially saying "Hey, this random adult who you never met, barely knew anything about, and never saw a picture of until you were ALREADY in the middle of puberty, is your mom. It's creepy that you're attracted to her!" It's not like Harry has any familiar memories associated with Lily, so I don't get the logic behind it in this case...
