linkffn(Harry Potter and the Shadowed Patronus by deadwoodpecker) - This is a recent one, started and finished last year. The author does a great job with Harry and Ginny's relationship (along with the trio friendship), and puts a lot of effort into expanding the lore and making and interesting and suspenseful mystery. My number one rec to be honest, though fair warning, there are sexual situations.

linkffn(Taking Control by fake a smile) - A classic independent!Harry fic. An alternate sixth year fic. Harry is tutored by Sirius in the spirit world after his death and learns a lot of magic this way. My favorite part about this fic actually isn't the H/G elements (which are great, imo) but how Harry teaches the DA.

linkffn(The Thorny Rose by Brennus) - In this fic, Ginny gets all of Tom Riddle's memories after the Chamber experience. In Harry's fourth year, after Ron abandons him, she uses her knowledge to help Harry. Features a slytherinish Ginny that still has a heart, but is jaded by what she has experienced. It'd be easy to give Harry no agency with this premise, but the author does a good job of avoiding that for the most part.

Also, I've got to recomend Nightmares of Future Past, but it has been tragically removed from [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] by a bogus copyright claim that the website is refusing to acknowledge. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=9305][Link to the siye upload that is missing the most recent three chapters.]] Your standard time travel fic, but its done really well.
