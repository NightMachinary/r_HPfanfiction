hgfan111 was probably one of the best Harry/Ginny writers. She deleted her accounts, but I have an archive, I can PM a wetransfer link.

Yellow Submarine is quite OK, it's different from a usual Harry Ginny fic - linkffn(4464089)

Wendell that Wasn't is a must for a Harry Ginny rec - linkffn(4396574)

Aspirations is a very old fanfic, by megamatt, but it was one of the fics that set a lot of people on the Ginny/Harry train - linkffn(4545504)

Strangers at Drakenshaugh is probably the best canon compliant fanfic out there, the author has a whole set of fics - linkffn(6331126)

If you can help her - this is not a good fic, but it's old and it might be fun, it's basically a study of the old HP fandom - linkffn(2788096)

I think this gives you an overview of why people kind of dig Harry/Ginny. She's kind of hated by a part of the fandom, but this doesn't mean that there aren't any good fics with her as the protagonist.
