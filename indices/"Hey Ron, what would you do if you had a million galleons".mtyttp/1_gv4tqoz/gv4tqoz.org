"What'd you do with a million galleons?" Was the question at the Weasley table, that night.

The whole family was there, the table extended to fit everyone. A huge meal, made courteousy of Molly Weasley, filled with roast beef, green beans, carrots and peas. A nice chicken-flavored broth. Different drinks, alcohol induced and not filled the table.

It was George, who had asked. Causing people to pause, and ponder the question.

"I'd buy a land, create a moat, and build my own mansion!" George said excitedly, a grin on his face.

"Waste of money!" Percy muttered, under his breath. Rolling his eyes.

"Oh yeah, what'd you do with it?" George shot back.

"Invest it, most likely. So that way the money will triple" Percy announced, causing boos and napkins to be thrown at him.

"And most boring answer goes to!" George said, making a sweeping hands gesture to Percy.

"Boys, knock it off. It'd be wonderful to invest, Percy" Molly said, smiling at her son, who smiled back gratefully.

"I don't really need anything, myself" Bill muttered, a thoughtful expression on his face. "Maybe a vacation house set in France, for when we visit Fleur's family." He said, causing Fleur to squeal and give him a quick kiss on the lips.

"How bout you, Ron? What'd do you with a million galleons?" Bill asked, taking a bit of the roast beef.

Ron frowned, a thoughtful expression on his face. Unsure of how to answer. "I... now don't get me wrong, I know the two of you did everything you could to provide for us, and I will always appreciate that." Ron started, turning to his parents, seriously.

"But... if I had a million galleons, or something close to that. I'd try and start some kind of deal with Hogwarts, for families who are low income. So that way they can get clothes that fit right, their wands and books, and anything else that they need for school, so their parents don't have to pay out of pocket."

It was silent at the table. Everyone turned to stare at Ron with surprise. Most of them thinking that Ron would have said a joke answer like buying the Cannons, or having cheerleaders to cheer him on or something.

"Oh... Ron." Hermione said, her eyes shining brightly.

"That... that would be a good investment, son." Arthur said, smiling at him proudly.

Molly sniffled, and wiped her eyes on a new napkin. "That's just a wonderful thought, Ron."

Harry smiled at his friend, but then frowned, an idea coming to his mind. He had more money than he would ever need. What if he made Ron's dream, a reality? He'd give all the credit to Ron, he'd have to think about this.
