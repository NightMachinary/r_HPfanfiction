"Hey Ron, what would you do if you had a million galleons?" George mimed putting on sunglasses. "I'd probably blow it all on my own island somewhere sunny, someplace to put my feet up and knock back with Firewhiskey and a bevy of gorgeous half-Veela babes in bikinis."

Fleur swatted George in mock outrage, who smirked.

It was all a joke to George, but Harry shifted uncomfortably and kept silent; it was a question too close to home for him, having far more wealth than anyone else present, and nearly all of it inherited. Under the table, Ginny squeezed his hand sympathetically, and she sniped back on his behalf: "I dunno, George, buy you out probably. After all, he seems to have quite a flair for the joke shop business."

"Ronnie'd probably buy the Cannons first," said Bill.

Charlie snorted. "Complete bloody waste of Galleons, that." Ron hit him in the arm; Charlie gave him a don't-make-me-come-over-there look and shoved Ron back with one beefy, burn-scarred hand, nearly toppling him off his chair.

"Boys," said Mr Weasley mildly. "Please save the rough-housing until after dessert, thank you."

Everyone went back to the serious business of the Weasleys' weekly family dinner, which today was Mrs Weasley's roast beef with all the trimmings - new potatoes, Yorkshire pud, the Burrow's own peas and carrots - chunky pumpkin soup, Butterbeer, and a tremendous treacle sponge pudding. The conversation meandered elsewhere. Harry ate with one hand under the table holding Ginny's, who was sitting beside him; but he was sure he was being far more discreet than Ron, who was staring at Hermione with a fixed grin on his face as she exchanged Ministry gossip with Bill.

After some time, Percy said "Of course, if /I/ somehow obtained a million Galleons, I'd put it all in a low-risk investment fund with steady returns, rather than fritter it away in frivolous temporary extravagances..."

Nearly everyone else booed and hooted at this; Percy sank, grinning, under a deluge of crumpled-up napkins.

"Perce, you absolute bore!"

"It's a /game/, Percy, the whole point is to /be/ extravagant!"

Mrs Weasley came to the rescue. "Well, we Weasleys and Prewetts have never been spendthrift, and I trust all my children, all," she looked meaningfully at Harry and Hermione, beaming, "to continue to be prudent, now that you're finding your own ways after the war."

Charlie nudged Ron again. "Well, Ronnie, what of it then? Any big ideas? Open a pudding factory, perhaps?" he said pointedly, as Ron was making heavy inroads into his slice of treacle sponge.

Ron shrugged. "I 'on't 'ave an' ne'er will 'ave a million Galleonsh, 's not worth thinking about," he said thickly.

Everybody groaned and put their heads in their hands. Fleur poked George in the ribs and said, "Zis one 'as too much imagination, and Ronald, too leetle."

"I 'unno," said Ron, shrugging. "Got just about everything I want already, don't I? I'd probably keep a decent pile in Gringotts for myself, and give the rest to some poor bloke who needs it. Like St Mungo's, or house-elves, or Hogwarts maybe."

"Oh Ron, would you?" said Hermione, her eyes shining.

"Yeah, why not?" Ron shrugged disinterestedly. "Oi, George, chuck me another Butterbeer."

The rest of the night, Harry observed, it was Hermione who seemed to hang on to everything Ron said and did. And, shortly after the washing up, she announced that she and Ron were going for a walk, and disappeared somewhere with a gleam in her eye. Ron, thought Harry, might well have made the best of a million imaginary Galleons of anyone at the table.
