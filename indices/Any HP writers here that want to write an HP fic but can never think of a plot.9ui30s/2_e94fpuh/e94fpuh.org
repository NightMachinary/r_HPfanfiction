So I had the concept for a Harry as a werewolf raised in the states by Remus story right, LinkFFN(Wolf Lord)

Once I had that setting I asked, now what happens. Why does he wind up at Hogwarts, where does he go, who does he interact with.

I also have certain scenes I expect to tell, some already written.

Mass scale tranfiguring an army in the First Task A showdown with Fenrir Greyback in 1997/8 A compotent Peter Pettigrew

And such. I also have how I want magic to be bound, and great geopolitics of the magical world all in my head that I want to share through steady reveal.

IE - SubSaharan Africa was no down with the Statute of Secrecy but was violently supressed/conquered and forced to adhere. Then rebelled and tried to throw it off as Europe was drawn into war with Grindelwald and the aftermath of all that.

Once you have some stuff like that it is just a matter of stringing it together. How you do that is up to you. Also consider, as your characters develop they might do something you never expected. Accept it and see where that leads. Don't try to force them to be someone they aren't just for a plot point. Change it and see where it goes.

You have an SI/OC, okay where are they from Do they know the story What track will they take What do they have access to upon appearance in the HP world What year is it Is it following cannon or is the world slightly different Dumbledore? Work with, trust, don't trust There of their own volition or as a result of a magical accident Magical or no-magical If going to Hoggy Hogwarts What House What Friends What Classes/performance/specialty witll they have/develop What are their flaws? What limitations are there on them? Super powerful- unmatched characters are boring unless their power itself becomes a problem or it is a humor/crackfic If the foes is equally powerful it can work out.
