  How does everyone here figure out their plot?

You read stuff and then think something along the lines "I can do that better" or "You know, it would have been awesome if X happened at this point instead of Q".

It can be stupid ideas like "What if Hermione was stuck at the Order HQ early in the summer and ran into Tonks? Well, the obvious solution is fast food from Germany, teasing and a date", semi-serious stuff like "Pansy wants to get out of a marriage contract through a loophole but ends up married to Harry instead" or even completely serious stuff like "I want a Harry gets adopted story without the usual suspects or Harry banging his mother/sister figure. Family feels for days."
