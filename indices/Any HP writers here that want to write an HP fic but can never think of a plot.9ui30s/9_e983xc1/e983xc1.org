I have trouble nailing my vague plot ideas down into actually writable things. I also go through regular phases of self doubt that I'm not bringing anything new to the table.

By the first, I mean that I know what themes I want to explore, and I have an extremely rough 7 year timeline which I've nailed against Alchemical theory... but trying to get down to what actually happens in more detail and when is trickier. Part of the issue is the second thing, that I want the way my story goes to have something new and interesting.
