Hey, that's the opposite of my problem. I have a few (pretty original and well thought out) plot lines, but my English is lacking since it is not my first language.

Why don't you think of your OC and what kind of person you would want them to be and then think of how you could show (! not explain or tell !) the reader their personality.
