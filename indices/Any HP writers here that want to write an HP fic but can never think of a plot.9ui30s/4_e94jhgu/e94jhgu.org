Characters plus situation makes plot. Put the characters in a situation, write down what happens, what they say, how it all looks, sounds, smells as it happens. If you run out of plot, add a new character or a new situation. Practice long enough and eventually you also have a story, although before then you probably have a bunch of rambling beginnings that go nowhere.

Alternately, decide on an end you like, and ask what would have to happen to get there, and who would need to be involved?

In my experience, if you daydream before you sleep, it helps. Also, I personally can't plot at all unless I've eaten recently and had enough sleep.
