I typically have a plot, but am super bad at writing. Like I have this bomb idea where Harry has a pretty good time at school until 5th year where we find out the stone is in the castle, Riddle releases the Basilisk to cause chaos and Harry has to stop both in 1 night. In His 6th year, he is entered into the tournament. 7th year is a mild horocrux hunt with Dumbledore that ends with the latters death and Harry's appointment to the DADA position.

Some post school years where Harry is leading an Order like group to oppose Voldemort.
