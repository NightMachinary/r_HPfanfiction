I have the opposite problem. I've got so many plots that I'll never be able to write them all.

I used to have this problem though - I'd have an idea for a scene or a character, but no plot to out them in and you know what cured me? TVtropes.

Seriously, if you're just starting out, TVtropes is a wonderful resource.
