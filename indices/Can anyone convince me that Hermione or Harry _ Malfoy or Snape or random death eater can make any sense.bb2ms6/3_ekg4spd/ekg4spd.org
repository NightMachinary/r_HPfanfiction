Most of them are undoubtedly terribly written, but I have definitely read some good ones that convinced me at least Draco/Hermione and Draco/Harry can work (never personally read any Snape or other Death Eater)

I think you have to write Draco's redemption as truly convincing, a lot of them tend to have Draco as still being a prejudiced arsehole, which obviously isn't very convincing. There also has to be a justified reason for Harry or Hermione associating with him, such as forcing them to be reluctant allies against Voldemort. Draco rescuing Hermione from the abusive Ron that a lot of stories seem to do isn't convincing.

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run is a truly superb Draco/Harry story that sold me on the pairing. And Midnight is unfinished but also quite good Hermione/Draco.
