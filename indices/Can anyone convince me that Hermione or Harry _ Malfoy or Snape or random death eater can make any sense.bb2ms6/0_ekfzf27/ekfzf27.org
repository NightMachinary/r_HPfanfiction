The better ones diverge from canon earlier, or introduce the characters /before/ they become irredeemable.

If Draco Malfoy chickened out about the Chamber of the Secrets in Year 2, before he started spouting his "Mudbloods are gonna get it, haha!" lines, and tried to apologize and made amends with the trio after finding out Harry was a Parselmouth, then he'd be a better person by Year 6, where in canon he starts passing the Point of No Return.

For Snape and Regulus Black, there's usually a time travel aspect that sets the pairing up /before/ they joined the Death Eaters and taken the Mark (Snape at 18/19, and Regulus at 16). Before that, they're just regular schoolboys from abusive families who like Dark Arts, but haven't participated in criminal activities. Still moody and emotionally tortured, but the good kind of darkness that can be healed by the power of love.

The shipfics where the characters /have/ done irredeemable, illegal shit I don't get, unless people enjoy the taboo aspect of teacher/student and bad boy/good girl. I don't think they're meant to be realistic, or something that is encouraged for IRL relationships, but rather some sort of weird kink fantasy stuff.

Snape/Hermione makes as much sense as Harry/Bellatrix, yet the latter is more accepted in this subreddit. Weird double standards, man.
