At least Harry/Bellatrix has a smidge of an excuse where you claim that Bellatrix has always essentially been insane, so while it's not really okay for Harry Potter to fall in love with her, you can get some weird twisted relationship out of it. Never seen it done with this pairing, but once in a blue moon someone tries it with Harry Potter/Voldemort. I think I've seen like one actual success though, so there's that.

Regulus, because he's such a blank slate, does have an opportunity to redeem him at the point where he goes to retrieve the Horcrux. You can write him almost any way you want, and it's always possible to characterise him as full of regret and turning away from the cause, and retrieving the Horcrux is how he chose to go out and make penance for what he's done. I saw a fic like this recently that seemed fairly popular on AO3, but dropped it because the romance between him and Harry was too quick, and their personalities seemed too sappy.
