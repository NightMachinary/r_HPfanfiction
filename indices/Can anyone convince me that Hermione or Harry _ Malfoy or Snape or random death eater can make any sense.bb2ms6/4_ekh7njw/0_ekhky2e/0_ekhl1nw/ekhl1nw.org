  It's not easy being dead. In a post-apocalyptic nightmare that once was the shining city of Zootopia, walking corpses fill the streets and they are hungry for brains. One of these nightmarish creatures is a fox who, like the others, is always hungry. But after years of walking the decrepit streets of the city, he finds himself a bored and perhaps a little lonely. When a living bunny stumbles into his life, his whole world will change. This work is in collaboration with Katie Katastrophe, who has provided the artwork featured in this story!

  Harry's happy with his life twenty-two years later. He has his job as the Head of the DMLE (albeit with a bit too much bureaucratic nonsense for his tastes), his not-really wife (and her incorrigibly charming shit of a boyfriend), and his three children (plus Scorpius Malfoy, who's somehow become the fourth child in their brood). The only thing that's missing is a partner, though not for a lack of trying on his part. However, the assignment of one case to Barrister Draco Malfoy -- a polite and cordial acquaintance on the peripheral of Harry's life -- leads to a deep friendship and the slow realisation that the partner he's been waiting his whole life for has been standing right in front of him all along.

  Harry Potter is turning 50 years old and feeling lonelier than ever. Divorced, retired, and learning he's not quite as straight as he thought he was, Harry reluctantly accepts a birthday gift from his friends for a week's stay at an idyllic French vineyard. Too bad Hermione and Ron neglected to mention that the owner of the winery happens to be a certain quick-witted blond Slytherin...
