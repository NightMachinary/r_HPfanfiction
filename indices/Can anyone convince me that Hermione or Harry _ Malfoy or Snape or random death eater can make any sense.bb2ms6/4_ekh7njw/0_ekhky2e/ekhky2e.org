As I was thinking about it more after posting, I think there are two common threads in the Drarry stories I find plausible. Albus and Scorpius being friends brings them back into the same orbit, and Scorpius' personality and attitudes show that he wasn't raised the way Draco was, thus making the redemption of Draco feel quite plausible. And they address the tension and antagonism between them as boys as there having been some attraction there, at least on one side. In a lot of cases, it's Draco and that was a competing force against his father's indoctrination into Voldemort's opinions.

The first link is to a series where the first story is not long after the war, but it really is epilogue-compliant.
