I was originally of that opinion, but I've developed an exception for Harry/Draco fics that are epilogue-compliant, really show that Draco has changed, and don't bash Ginny in the process of putting Harry in a position where he's single again. (Infidelity fics of any kind need not apply.) I'm at work so I can't dig out links now, but I will when I get home. (As a shortcut, look for Teddy/James Sirius stories on AO3 --- some authors write both, and some of the better Teddy/James stories are also Harry/Draco.)
