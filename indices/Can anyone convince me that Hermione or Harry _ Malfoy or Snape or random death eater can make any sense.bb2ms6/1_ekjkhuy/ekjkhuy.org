A large part of canon Draco is a /child/. Children are impressionable and almost never irredeemable (psycopaths are, but that's a special case). I don't think 12 year old Draco during CoS truly understood the implications of what he was saying -- the fact that he was essentially wishing for racial genocide. Hell, he couldn't even kill Dumbledore when almost at his majority.

Give Draco better influences, and nothing stops him from becoming a good person who can realistically get involved with Hermione (or Harry if you swing that way).

Severus is probably the easiest Death Eater to redeem. On the whole, he's a very unpleasant person and a bully, and is mentally stuck in past grudges and loves. But when it truly matters, I never considered him genuinely evil apart from his brief stint as a legitimate Death Eater. What he really needs is psychological help to allow him to let go of the past, or at least time to let go on his own once the war is over, allowing him to stop being an asshole to everyone. However, no matter how good of a person he ends up being, shipping him with Harry is a really bad idea; his major connection to Severus' childhood love makes any relationship attempt very dangerous and is likely to be unhealthy (even moreso if this is fem!Harry of the "mini Lily with James' eyes" kind). Especially if the canon Severus-Harry antagonism still happened, because now they have an abysmal history on top of that.

Other Death Eaters need much more development than we see in canon to see them redeemed, but that doesn't make it /impossible/. Only psychopaths are truly irredeemable, everyone else can become better people with the correct influence.
