Fight scenes are all about action and are, by their nature, both short and fast paced. Try to choose your words to reflect this. If you have a choice between a short word and a long word, the short word will usually serve you better. For example:

She stabs him.

She impales him.

Both sentences mean the exact same thing, but the first one feels faster.

Leave out any extraneous adjectives. We know the knife is sharp. Knives are sharp. Calling it a sharp knife instead of a knife will not add anything to the story. If you do need an adjective, try to pick just one. You'll also want to leave out any wordy descriptions. There are only two times when the scenery is important: If your character is hiding behind it, or if your character is tripping over it.

Good fight description:

He trips on the worn rug. She draws her knife and stabs him.

Poor fight description:

There is a dirty old rug in the room that matches the blue couch. His feet tangle in it and he trips. She draws her sharp knife and impales him.

Now let's talk about dialogue. Sometimes, when people are fighting, they swear. Sometimes they insult their opponent. Sometimes they shout death threats at each other. Very rarely, they beg or crack jokes. What they never do is have long conversations about feelings or the power of friendship. They never monologue about their problems or their evil plans. They never try to talk their opponent down. When you are fighting, the time for long discussion is over.

Good fight description:

He trips on the worn rug. "Oh, Fuck."

She draws her knife and stabs him.

Poor fight description:

There is a dirty old rug in the room that matches the blue couch. His feet tangle in it and he trips.

"Don't do it, Mary Sue. I know that you still love me."

"I never loved you, Gary. I was just getting close to you, so that I could turn you over to the evil overlord! I'm going to take you in for questioning and when they're done with you, I'm going to kill you."

She draws her sharp knife and impales him.
