  There are only two times when the scenery is important: If your character is hiding behind it, or if your character is tripping over it.

There is an important consequence of this point: if you are going to have a fight scene in a location, make sure to visit that location earlier in the story to get your description done. That way when you have the fight later, the reader can imagine it vividly without you having to bog the fight scene down with pace-slowing description.

See:

1. Harry's trial at the start of OotP gave us a tour of the Ministry and a detailed description of the Atrium in which Dumbledore vs. Voldemort would occur.

2. In the Department of Mysteries, we got a good look around (in particular at the Veil of Death chamber) before the fight kicked off.
