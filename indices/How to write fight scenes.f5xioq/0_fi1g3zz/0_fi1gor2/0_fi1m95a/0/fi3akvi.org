  he stakes need to be high but not meaningless (eg a tournament is not very interesting and most reasons to participate are either contrived or relatively meaningless)

A Song of Ice and Fire has this in spades: Harrenhal is a tournament told in remembrances and stories, but was arguably the catalyst for the civil war that drives the entire plot of the books, while being basically just a party for nobles. There's intrigue, backstabbing, broken hearts, forbidden love... and it's just off the periphery of the main characters' minds.
