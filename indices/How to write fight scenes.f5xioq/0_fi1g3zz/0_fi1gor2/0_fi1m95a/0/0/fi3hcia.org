But the actual tournament had no high stakes. The winners got some gold and maybe a boost to personal prestige which enabled them to advance socially (similar to how Mormont got his wife a few years later). Yet the competition is of little relevance. Lyanna was not competing for the victory, she wanted to teach those knights and their squires a lesson.

Harrenhal got its stakes from the mad spectator king, not from the actual competition. The tournaments we see later on in the series also are more entertainment and the actual conflict comes from events surrounding them (eg Cleganebowl 1.0).

The trials by combat are a much better example of fights with high stakes.
