Yeah, I think the better example in aSoIaF for a low stake tournament is the one of the King's Hand at the start of the series - and that gets brushed through mostly, mostly serving as a way to introduce characters/dynamics.

I think a tournament doesn't have to be high stakes to be interesting - but you're right that it's difficult to do so, and usually isn't worth it.
