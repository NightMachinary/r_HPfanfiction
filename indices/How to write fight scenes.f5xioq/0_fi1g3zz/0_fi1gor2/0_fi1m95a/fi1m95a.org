Changing environments and stakes. The stakes need to be high but not meaningless (eg a tournament is not very interesting and most reasons to participate are either contrived or relatively meaningless) nor unbelievable because if they are too high (eg destruction of the planet), the readers will know that the MC won't lose. It also should not be forced, so random out-of-the-blue abductions are not really helpful in that regard. It works with Sirius in OotP because it has a solid back-up, but if Pettigrew randomly dropped a note that he abducted Hermione, that would feel forced.

As for environment, the easiest ways are for the combatants to change the terrain (transfiguration), force the fight into a different location (a chase) or have the surroundings change on their own (eg a slowly spreading fire or a building on the brink of collapse so that the damage from stray spells causes sections to break down wall by wall).

The effects of the battle (injuries), as well as collateral damage and casualties, can add flair. People screaming, bleeding out in agony and the like can be immersive, but unless you are going for the WWI vibe, remember to use that in moderation.

Also, interesting locations (caves, ruins, public places) make things more immersive if you can describe them well. If you want to use real-world places, Street View and photographs are the minimum, being there is much better. Travel guides are not sufficient, I'm talking from experience here.
