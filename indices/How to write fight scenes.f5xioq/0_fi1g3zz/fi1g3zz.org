Generally speaking, for larger fights, you want to set things up so that you have several simultaneous engagements which are different from each other (terrain/location, skill levels, size, preferences, weapons and so on). That way you can swap between them at will to keep things spicy rather than repeat the same three scenes.

For the smaller picture, avoid too many technical terms. For example, rather than "Harry cast /Avada Kedavra/", "Harry cast a killing curse" flows a lot better (the same goes for weapons, use weapon names very rarely or it sounds too technical).

You don't have to describe every spell cast with name, describing their effect ("a chunk of the wall behind Harry exploded, showering him with dust and debris") or how they look ("green curses flew back and forth"). Describe the feelings of the combatants, and what they can and cannot sense ("Harry could barely see the tip of his nose", "the smell of dust and blood hung heavy in the stale air of the dungeon").
