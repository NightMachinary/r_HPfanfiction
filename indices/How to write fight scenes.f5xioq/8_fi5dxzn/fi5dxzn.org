I think when it comes to actual words, rather than fight structure, the best fight scenes rely on a balance of three types of spell descriptions.

One is the actual incantations. "'Bomarda!' shouted Harry as he aimed his wand over the cluster of rubble."

The other is spell names. "Harry cast a blasting hex from behind the rubble"

The last is effect description. "Harry didn't look to see if his spell hit, but the fleks of shrapnel that flew over his cover meant that he had gotten the pillar they were hiding behind:

A good balance between all three keeps the reading interesting just as much as variable sentence length does for writing in general.
