This is especially important in my opinion. In the Battle of The Department of Mysteries the goal of the Death Eaters was to get the prophecy while the goal of the students was to escape. It makes sense for the violent and unhinged to see their goal shift to fighting for violences sake on occassion, but shouldn't be relied on.

If the ministry fight had all played out in the hall of prophecies it wouldn't have made any sense, and it wouldn't have been interesting to read.
