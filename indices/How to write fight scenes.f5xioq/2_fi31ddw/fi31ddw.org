Some good advice in this thread. One thing I would add, which I don't think has been covered: don't forget the combatants' objectives. Only very rarely will the fight itself be the reason for the people being there. Rather, each party is trying to achieve a goal and the fight occurs because their goals are mutually exclusive.

Throughout the fight, the combatants should still be trying to achieve that goal. If you remember this, it will give the fight a more dynamic feeling than a pure fight would. Further, the goal will invest the reader in the action - provided the reader also wants the goal to be achieved.
