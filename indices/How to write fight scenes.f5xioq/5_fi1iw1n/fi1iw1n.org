One thing I'd recommend is to look at someone who wrote a fight scene that you enjoyed, and try to break down how it happened more mechanically. Where the focus is, how the description happens, etc.

Mechanically, one tool that I find very useful in those is sentence length. The shorter, more to the point a sentence is, the more tense and action packed it'll make the reader feel. So playing around with those as a way to show when the duel/fight is growing tense, and when they get a chance to breathe, certainly can help.

As a few examples of fics that 'did it right', here's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8yu1so/fics_centered_around_duelling/e2e2zkn/][one from newcomb]] that Taure copied into reddit, and that does an excellent job of showing a duel. The fight scenes in the Denarian Renegade series were always pretty great in my opinion, though they obviously draw from some of the non-Harry Potter aspects (since it's a crossover). There's also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/78mhz3/brandon_sanderson_lecture_three_rules_for_fight/][this lecture]] by Brandon Sanderson on fight scenes that may be of interest - he does an excellent job with them in his books.

Particularly for you, one way to show the difference between experience and lack of it might be in the repertoire of spells used, and more of the tactics.
