Firstly, you need to look at what makes action scenes in books / cinema / comics engaging:

1. The stakes: Everyone needs a horse in the race for an action scene to be engaging. Why are people fighting? What do they have to lose? If your stakes are clear, it's not just gratuitous action, it matters to the story. Make the consequences of /losing/ clear and "action" becomes much more interesting.
2. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8czFGUedDJU&t=241s][Geography]]: You need to know where the actors are in relation to their environment. This is part of setting up the stakes. A duel with students surrounding? A battle on the Hogwarts grounds? A fight in the Forbidden Forest? Set up the geography so we know what options the characters have and what the scene looks like. We need to know what tools these characters have at their disposal, and you can surprise us, but surprises need to be telegraphed.
3. Ask yourself how this advances plot, character, or setting (or preferably all 3). New spells are interesting, new revelations about magic, a revelation about a character in the heat of battle, or raising the stakes are key to an interesting fight scene.
