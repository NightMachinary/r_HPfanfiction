Try to get inside your POV character's head. Always ask yourself: What do they see? People dodging explosions and curses generally won't be able to focus on the "big picture", even if they were able to see it in the fog of war. Tunnel vision is a thing. Apart from the likes of Dumbledore and Voldemort, few wizards and witches will be able to fight and direct a battle at the same time. In the same vein, people without extensive experienec and talent will stick to a few spells and tactics - things they have drilled and trained until they can do it half-asleep.

Don't write a duels unless it's a duel. In a fight, people, especially trained combattants, gang up on others. Fights, especially in close quarters, are chaotic and confusing - and bloody.

Keep in mind that hitting a moving target, even a man-sized one, is hard. Doubly so with a wand instead of a proper sighted gun. Even Voldemort missed Harry when the later dived behind a gravestone.

Don't get lost in detail. Someone scrambling behind cover won't notice the intricate pattern of the bricks in the wall, or the lone flower pot on the other side of the room. If they do, it's usually because they're in shock, or otherwise "taken out" of the combat. Few people manage to fight and talk, or even plan, at the same time. If you need your character to notice something, give them a breather - have them be behidn cover, looking around for the next target or way to advance, then have them notice something. Don't have them notice a detail behidn them while they are trading spells with the enemy.

Keep tactics and morale in mind. Few people fight to the death if they can retreat instead. That means a side trying to kill someone will cast Anti-Apparition Jinxes all over the place. Initiative matters - if you surprise the enemy, you're at a great advantage.

Keep it simple. A Three-spell combo might look impressive, but if you need to hit the same enemy three times with a spell to take them out, it's rubbish since there are lots of spells who do that with a single hit. If you use combos, use them in a way that doesn't make the reader ask "why didn't he just use... instead?"

And, finally, don't overdo it. Fights don't last hours. Keep it simple, keep it short. Sooner rather than later, a fight will be decided, and the losing side will either break and run, retreat or attempt to retreat in an orderly fashion, or surrender. In rare cases, they'll fight to the death or capture, but either way, don't dwell on that.
