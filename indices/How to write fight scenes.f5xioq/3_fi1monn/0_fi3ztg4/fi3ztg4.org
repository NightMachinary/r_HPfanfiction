I think it can be made to be a bit different, depending on how big a power gap the fic is using. In canon HP, you're right that experience would be the deciding factor - but one with more magical power/difference could have a reason to have the inexperienced one win a reasonable percentage of the time, even without other aspects like luck or being overconfident.

You're right as a rule of thumb, of course - but when writing it, I don't think some <25% chance victories are out of the question :P
