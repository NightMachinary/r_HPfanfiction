This may seem limiting, but inexperienced vs experienced should result in a loss for the inexperienced. Curb stomp fights are certainly controversial, but they can serve a narrative purpose(see Hulk vs Thanos). Snape vs Harry at the end of HBP shows the difference between experience and inexperience where Snape just toys with Harry.

With Harry Potter's magic, a single spell can be the difference maker. Even hitting someone with a jelly legs jinx can cause them to fall over which any competent duellist can capitalize on.
