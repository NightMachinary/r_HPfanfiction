Completely agree. I am just in the middle writing my own [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][story]], where I needed two small fight scenes, and I wondered how to make a realistic scene.

1. Two students (Harry & Ginny) and one Disillusioned Auror (Tonks) defeat Antonin Dolohov & some unnamed young Death Eater in-training. The young Death Eater is too eager and he shoots the Stunning Curse towards Harry too early, so Harry (with his good reflexes, that's the only advanced quality I was willing to give him; I hate super!Harry) manages to avoid and shoots the Cutting Curse towards him and by chance hits him. Wounded DE looses concentration and he is immediately stunned by Tonks, so we have suddenly a way better situation: Dolohov suddenly fights against Harry & Tonks, and he completely ignores Ginny, who hesitates for a moment, but when she sees that she is overlooked and she remembers Harry teaching them in DA, that one should not be creative in a duel and just uses the curse which fits her best. So, she takes her time until she gets an opening and the shoots the biggest /Reducto/ curse she can manage towards the torso of Dolohov. He manages to jump to side a bit, so he is not hit in his chest, but the curse scratches his shoulder, which bursts and his wand hand falls to the side.

2. Harry with Tonks and Dudley walk from the post office (where Dudley called to Vernon, to let him know 4 Privet Drive was destroyed by fire, but they are safe). Dudley walks a bit faster so he is alone when he sees a man in the black long coat raising up his wand and pointing towards Harry & Tonks behind them. The man of course did not recognize Dudley as a man knowing what's going, so when the Death Eater was surprised by his unexpected opportunity, he started his attack while Dudley was just a few meters away from him (he expected to /Obliviate/ him later). We are in the summer post the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, so Dudley has one year in Smeltings when he trained boxing regularly. He manages to put the Death Eater down by two blows with his fists. The second man sees how his colleague is put down by an unknown person, turns to attack him, Dudley runs to close the distance between them, the Death Eater in shock manages just raise the /Protego/ shield, and Dudley is thrown away when he hits the shield. He hits the wall and breaks his hand. However, in meanwhile, Harry & Tonks have time to react and they /Stun/ the Death Eater.

Both skirmishes were training for me how to make a fight where David realistically defeats a Goliath.
