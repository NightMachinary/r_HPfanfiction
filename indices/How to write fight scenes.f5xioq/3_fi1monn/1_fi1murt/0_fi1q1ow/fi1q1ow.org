If you want a closer fight between inexperienced vs experienced you can even the odds

Hypothetical example: the experienced combatant is an Auror who just finished taking down a terrorist cell after tracking them for two weeks. During that time, he's operated on limited sleep and his wand snapped and was forced to use another wand which is not a match. He's sustained a number of injuries and is recovering and is attacked by an inexperienced opponent while in his safehouse.

This evens the odds significantly. The Auror is hurt, sleep deprived and using a wand that's not suitable for sustained combat. Lets say he's forced to use a stolen Ash wand(which loses its power as it transfers between owners) or a Dogwood wand(incapable of non-verbal magic. Now its a much closer fight. The experienced Auror could lose in this case, or he's forced to outsmart his opponent who's got him reeling.
