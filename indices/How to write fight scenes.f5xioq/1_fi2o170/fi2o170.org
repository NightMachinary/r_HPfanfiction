I'm not an author, but I have many, many, many thoughts on action (and fight scenes) in media.

The most important thing to remember is that *fights are character development and character interactions*. Fights are situations in which two or more people will be interacting, under differing levels of stress. Two experienced wizards/witches dueling for sport will have their own styles they prefer. Perhaps one is straightforward, relying on shock and awe. Maybe another tries to be more subtle. How do these personalities mesh against each other? If it isn't a duel for sport, but for life, the characters should be more stressed, more frantic. A fight between an experience duelist and an inexperience but powerful duelist should show the difference between the two. The duelist may lack strength, but will be far more composed under pressure than the inexperienced duelist who may panic or freeze.

Let's look at two duels in canon. First would be the /GoF/ Harry v. Voldemort. Harry doesn't really get much magic done, but spends virtually the entirety of the fault moving around, diminishing Voldemort's attempts to aim. This shows his youthful energy, his panic and his inexperience. Voldemort, on the other hand, spends virtually the entire fight toying with Harry, showing us his sadism and arrogance. The second fight I want us to consider is Voldemort v. Dumbledore from /OotP/. I just read it and counted the distinct pieces of magic that Voldemort and Dumbledore cast.

1.  Voldemort casts the Killing Curse.
2.  Dumbledore apparates behind Voldemort, avoiding the Killing Curse (magic 1).
3.  Dumbledore animates fountain.
4.  Voldemort casts the Killing Curse. Interestingly, it hits a desk and the desk catches fire.
5.  Dumbledore casts a spell that causes Harry's hair stand on end as it passes by.
6.  Voldemort conjures a shining silver shield (note: a physical shield) to stop the spell (magic 5).
7.  Voldemort yet again casts the Killing Curse, which is blocked by one of the animated parts of the fountain (magic 3).
8.  Dumbledore casts a fire whip.
9.  Voldemort transfigures the fire whip (magic 8) into a serpent.
10. Voldemort apparates to the fountain.
11. While snake (magic 9) attacks Dumbledore, Voldemort casts the Killing Curse (blocked by a Fawkes intervention).
12. Dumbledore transforms snake (magic 9) into dark smoke.
13. Simultaneous to magic 12, Dumbledore causes water from the fountain to engulf Voldemort.
14. Voldemort posses Harry.

So what does this tell us about Dumbledore and Voldemort? Voldemort is far more aggressive and straight forward as shown by his repeated use of the Killing Curse. This doesn't mean that he won't use subterfuge (turning the fire whip into a snake as a distraction for the Killing Curse, and possessing Harry). On the other hand, Dumbledore is a bit more subtle. Animating the fountain creates protections for himself and Harry, as well as a means of restraining Bellatrix. He's less aggressive, as the animation was primarily defensive, the snake was transfigured into smoke and not something offensive and both the water and fire whip were both means of capturing/restraining Voldemort. However, Dumbledore is willing to fuck a bitch up (magic 5). Also, look at their demeanor while they talk during the fight. Dumbledore, while he is the one in danger is calm, but when Voldemort does his possession attempt on Harry, sounds frightened. This shows Dumbledore's greater concern for others than himself. Voldemort is angry (see the dialogue tags of spat and snarled)

As for character development, I honestly recommend watching this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiVtiVrXaBU][Rossatron video about the original Robocop movie]] for a discussion on how action can develop characters.

The next thing to keep in mind is that *fight scenes should have a point*. Why are the characters fighting? What does the scene add to the story? If there is no point to the fight, why have it?

Finally, *every magic fight in canon ends very quickly*. Both the battles during /HBP/ (when the Death Eaters are fleeing) and the Department of Mysteries are series of very short fights, the Dumbledore v. Voldemort involved 14 quickly done pieces of magic, Harry v. Draco 1 (/CoS/) was one spell ended by surprise Parseltongue and Harry v. Draco II (/HBP/) was 5 complete spells and one interrupted spell.
