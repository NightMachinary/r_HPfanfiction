linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy)

I can't remember too much about the plot, but I'm pretty sure it has the best Harry/OC romance by a whole lot. Also there was a ton of angsty drama between the order and Harry (a lot of it because they disapproved of his relationship). But yeah, the drama sort of worked, because the characters had actual depth and there were real reasons for conflict, instead of artificial bullshit.
