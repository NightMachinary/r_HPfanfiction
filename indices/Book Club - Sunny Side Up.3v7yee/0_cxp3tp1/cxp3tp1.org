Hoo boy. The characterization was pretty good... everything else was not. The romance was so unrealistic, and Mina was constantly angry about everything and for someone reason no one ever called her out on it. Like, her anger was supposed to be this tragic character flaw from her abusive past, but it never really got her into much trouble? And Sirius just randomly becomes infatuated with her after a timeskip? I could go on; needless to say, the only thing that I liked was how consistent the characters remained. Everything else was cliche or really unrealistic. :/ Mina really seemed like a Sue to me.
