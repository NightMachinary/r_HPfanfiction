  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

I know I read some great Fleur fics, but I really need to dig through all the shitty wish-fulfillment stuff.
