[[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1jnwcd/im_looking_for_a_good_harryluna_story/][This thread]] has several good Harry/Luna recommendations.

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] is one of the earlier Harry/Fleur stories. I found it a bit 'meh' but it seems to be recommended a lot.

Durararaaa's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel][His Angel]] is another Harry/Fleur of note.
