How about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters]]? I liked it. The author is also currently (I hope he/she doesn't stop) writing a Harry/Gabrielle fic, so you got a two for one there. I also love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7680982/1/Unspeakable-Beauty][Unspeakable Beauty]]. It's a Harry/Luna story and I love it. I think nobody on Reddit has mentioned it so please give it a try. It's got lemons though, fair warning.
