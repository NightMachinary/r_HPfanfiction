Aye, I actually started a thread a little while ago dedicated to noncannon pairings. Most of the noteworthy H/F and H/G fics are [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1u5d2k/looking_for_fics_with_unusual_or_noncannon/][here]].

In particular I'd recommend When A Veela Cries. Just give it a chance, it /really/ picks up at chapter 6, when there is a gigantic jump in quality from the previous chapters. It's not bad in earlier chapters, it just gets so much better post 6.
