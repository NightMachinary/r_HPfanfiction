Well, I'm a Harry/Ginny(/Luna) shipper, so it's nice to see someone of similar interests.

I'm assuming that if you've read a lot of JBern's stories and have been an H/G fan, you've almost certainly read [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][Jeconais's fics]], but he's got a couple of Harry/Fleur stories and Harry/Gabrielle stories that are lovely. Also lots of H/G, a Harry/Pansy classic, a Harry/Wednesday Addams crossover, and some nice Harry/Daphne Greengrass, so plenty to offer. ;-)

There's a lot of good H/L fic out there --- but a lot of it descends into Ginny-bashing, which seems needless. Of course, if you're going to hew at all to canon, in order to get Ginny out of the picture you've got to have /something/ happen. One piece that I love that does have a rather painful Harry/Ginny split but is ultimately about a really wonderfully drawn Harry/Luna relationship is Snegarochka Lee's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/31644][A Life So Much Less Than Ordinary]]. (NC-17, fwiw)

And if you're interesting in threesomes/triangles at all, there a bunch of great Harry/Ginny/Luna fics out there. The best place to find them is the LiveJournal community [[http://flamingnargle.livejournal.com][Flaming Nargles]].

Hope that's helpful!
