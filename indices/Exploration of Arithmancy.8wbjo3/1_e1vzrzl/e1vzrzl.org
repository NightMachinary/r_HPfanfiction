Read the numerological part of the second book of the Three Books on Occult Philosophy by Cornelius Agrippa (it's 1$ on Kindle). And if you are able to get your hands on them then read also: Introduction to Arithmetic by Nicomachus of Geresa and Boethian Number Theory: A Translation of the De Institutione Arithmetica by Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius.

This will present the numerology in the Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean framework which fits thematically well with how magic is presented in Harry Potter.
