At first I though divining future /from/ a name was a terrible idea. Since names and titles are /given/ by another. It would be like reading tea-leaves but ones that had been placed in a prearranged pattern.

But then I had a thought.

Obviously, people would attempt to game the system, giving children names to direct their future in a specific way, or enemies harmful titles. And obviously this would, 9/10 times, go horribly wrong.

The child given the name meaning 'finder of lost things' finds a lost place, but get's lost there. One given a name 'destine to take part in a great battle' is the first casualty as a wall collapses on them at the start of the battle. The enemy given a title meaning 'weakness' becomes adept at finding them in others.

Now that I can imagine fitting in as part of the lore.

It would also fit well with [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/naming-seers][Naming Seers]], who could predict the most suitable name for a child.

One thing you haven't mentioned is symbolism.

If you haven't already, have a look at [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/polyjuice-potion][this page about Polyjuice Potion]]. There's some very interesting talk from Rowling about the meaning and symbolism behind ingredients. Things like Lacewing Flies are used for tying and binding two things, because that's what laces do.

And [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Study_of_Ancient_Runes][this page on runes]]. Again, symbolism is very important. A Fwoopers four colours represent the number four, 'Unknown' represents seven, because 7 is a powerful magical number shrouded in mystery.

(Oh! While looking that up, I found [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Seven][this page about the number 7]] featuring various relations to 7, including names.)

Overall, while numbers play a very important part in magic, the symbolism and associative meaning of things can't be forgotten.
