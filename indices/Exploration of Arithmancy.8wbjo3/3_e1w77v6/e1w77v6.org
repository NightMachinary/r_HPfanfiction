So I want to throw some ideas I have regarding arithmancy. As I see it, Divination and Arithmancy are predictions about magic and its effects on the world. Much like how prophecy can be true but is not always true or the way people think it will be, arithmancy can predict certain effects of magic, such as spells, but one cannot design something like a formula or math equation. Some examples I can think of are:

- Arithmancy could be used to predict what life a wizard will lead based on the number of letters in their names. However, since wizards have more than one name, people rarely fall into one archetype. Rather, one can glean a hint of information about them from their title (like with Snape in PoS). This has pervaded mythical history, especially with the concept of the "true name" giving power of others over you (dating all the way to the time of Socrates and Herpo the Foul).
- Prediction through arithmancy is both more clear and more complicated than divination. Arithmancy involves considering the multiple aspects that go into magic (ex. location, caster or source, other affecting magics), and is thus difficult to utilize in practically as well. Traditionally, the simpler the question, the better the prediction (similar to Occam's Razor).
- Arithmancy can be utilize in many ways, but it requires determining a system that can work. This is far more difficult than is worth, thus its relegation as a lesser discipline. One example I have is that some wandmakers (such as say Gregorovitch) have attempted to find a "formula" for wand creation: attempting to find patterns of wands for different wand woods, cores, lengths and rigidity. Others (like say the Ollivanders) rely more on instinctual understanding, of experience and history of their family, to determine the type of person a wand will likely be suited for. Both approaches can have drawbacks and advantages (Arithmancy vs. Divination).
- You cannot create spells with numbers. BUT you can learn information from a spell by certain things: the number of wand motions, the number of letters and syllables in a spell, etc. An understanding of arithmancy can thus help you determine how to create magic that you are interested in. This is why Snape had many crossing out's of his "Sectumsempra" curse: he had an effect he wished to create, so he was trying different combinations of factors till he found the correct one. HOWEVER, nothing is concrete, and no spell can be truly predicted and thus requires either extreme determination and/or a deeper connection to magic than average people.
- Prime numbers have far reaching magical capability, and have metriculated through wizarding culture (or at least Europe and by proxy the Americas). Some view that the best spells are ones that invoke prime numbers, such as /protego, accio, depulso,/ and s/tupefy/ (which affects why they are some of the most useful spells). Conversely, it might be that certain numbers of letters or syllables in a spell are more effective on certain types of spells (ex. Transfiguration invokes combinations of four (/evanesco/), as greek philosophers speculated all matter could be separated into four elemental components).

Love to hear some thoughts that anyone has on these. I want to try and capture magic as canon-like as possible.
