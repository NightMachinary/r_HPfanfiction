Is it really, tho? My gary-stu-o-meter almost exploded while I was reading first chapters. It's decently written, but Potter here is so overpowered that I feel it's going to get very irritating and boring pretty fast.

Please tell me there is well written intelligent Loki with greater power or at least that Potter is the weakest Sourcerer in this universe or otherwise I think I'll leave it be and move along.
