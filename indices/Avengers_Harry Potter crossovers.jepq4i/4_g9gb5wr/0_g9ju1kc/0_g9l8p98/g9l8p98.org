Harry is absolutely overpowered, but still have flaws. He is the idea-guy and the prime mover for changing the course of the marvel universe. Loki starts out as an asshole, kinda like in the movies. But it changes later, prank wars anyone? He certainly have a central spot, but he is far from a main character. Sorry.

But everyone still own their speciality... stark run circles around Harry when concerning inventions, banner know chemistry and take that to a whole new level, dr. Strange... Spider-Man... Collected guardians of the galaxy ... black widow... hulk...nick fury... wolverine... death pool ...... everyone benefits and just get better because of Harry Potter. Sure it seems too easy at times but the setbacks and challenges still appear as the story unfolds.
