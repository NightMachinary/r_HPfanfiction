[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Enigmaris/pseuds/Enigmaris][Enigmaris]] has a couple, one completed and one still a WIP. The completed one, called something like "of punching gods and absentee fathers" is where Harry is Loki's son. The WIP is "Holly Potter and the midlife crisis" and is post Hogwarts with a FemHarry.

Linkffn(child of the storm) is one where Harry is Thor's son. Huge crossover with a bunch of fandoms. There's a WIP sequel as well.

Those are the ones off the top of my head that feature Loki in a significant way but I know of many more crossovers of you'd like more.
