The incredibly long trilogy by Green Gecko, starting with Resonance, has this a plotline. Harry travels to several dimensions and encounters his parents and a version of himself in a world without Voldemort. Dimension travel doesn't happen until book 2 or 3 (Revolution and Resolution). Technically, the work is incomplete, but the author posted the last few chapters on LiveJournal. There's only one minor plot that's not finished, the whole thing is worth it for how the characterisations are so close to canon (if you can accept Snape not being pure evil).
