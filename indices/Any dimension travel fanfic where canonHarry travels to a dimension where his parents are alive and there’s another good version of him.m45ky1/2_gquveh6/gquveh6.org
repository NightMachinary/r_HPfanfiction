Too Far From Home by story2tell is unfinished, last updated around a year ago so I still hold out hope it will be continued. A 14 year old Harry ends up in a dimension with living parents, a sister, and an older version of himself. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5757945/1/]] This one stayed with me. Well written and very angsty.
