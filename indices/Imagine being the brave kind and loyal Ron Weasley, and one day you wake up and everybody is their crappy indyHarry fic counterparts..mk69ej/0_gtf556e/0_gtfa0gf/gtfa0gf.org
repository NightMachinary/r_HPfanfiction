Ron is just /assuming/ he is in an alternative dimension. It kinda makes more sense to him than everyone going crazy.

Maybe he will pull two random sane versions of his friends if he manages to figure out dimension travel, like an Auror Harry and a time tuner user thirteen year old Hermione or a Minister of Magic Hermione and six year old Harry. Then he sends them back (in case of six year old Harry he just send him with adult Hermione to have a better life than the one he had at the Dursleys) and decide to better send himself to another more normal dimension. Landing in this other universe like a Deus Ex Machina before third year and saving the day.

Another end: He puts Harry and Hermione in therapy, he doesn't know what therapy is, but he has heard Hermione say that helps people with issues, and his friends /REALLY/ need help, so he asks a random muggleborn or Hermione's parents. Maybe everyone acting indy is a magical disease that Ron is immune and/or asymptomatic, maybe a magical artifact that Ron activate by accident caused it all, and being away from magic just reverts people to normal. Who knows?

I have more scenarios playing in my mind, but this is getting too long I have to sleep in half an hour because tomorrow is a test-day to me!
