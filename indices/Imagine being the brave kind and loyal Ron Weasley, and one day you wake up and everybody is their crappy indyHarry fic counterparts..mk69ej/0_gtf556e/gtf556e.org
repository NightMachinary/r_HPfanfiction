I once had an idea for a oneshot in which Harry goes indy!, but then it all backfires and he was wrong about everything, it was a good!Weasleys and reasonable!Dumbledore all along. He was just being a massive paranoid twat, and got suckered into a scam by the goblins.

So the idea of a normal and/or good Ron having to play the straight man to a bunch of indy! bullshit is pretty appealing. I'm not sure about the interdimensional travel part, though.
