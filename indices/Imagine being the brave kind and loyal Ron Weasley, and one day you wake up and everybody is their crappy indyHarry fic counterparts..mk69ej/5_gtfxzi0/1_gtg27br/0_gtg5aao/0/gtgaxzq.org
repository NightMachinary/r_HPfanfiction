Ron is /mostly/ a good friend in canon. And in this promt they are in /Hogwarts/ so the Horrocrux incident hasn't happened.

The worst thing Ron /did/ to the date was left Harry during the start of the Triwizard, and while I'm not justifying what he did I think he has a little of an inferiority complex that got the best of him.

In the Horrocrux business I can't say a lot to defend him, but I think the food was only /one/ of the reasons, the Horrocrux could have been poison him in others aspects other than /food/.

Let's not forget that Ron has something to go back to, like a loving family. He is a pure blood, so he knows that he wouldn't be treated too badly even if he is poor, and he's afraid. He can be discovered camping with the most wanted man in wizarding Britain and what would happen to his family?

I'm not saying that's Harry and Hermione were /not/ afraid, but what did they have to come back for? They were basically orphans fighting for people that the great majority of them were assholes to both. (Harry with public constant ridicule and Hermione in fourth year as basically a declaring her whore through the Prophet). The only thing they have to fight was their rights to live, which can be a pretty good motivator.

Like I said, I'm not trying to justify what Ron did, left them like that was a pretty shitty thing to do, but he was a kid, an afraid kid, and afraid people do stupid things, maybe the food was the last straw and he was just afraid and want to go home.

I don't actually like Ron, I'm just analysing his possible motives, but I don't think of him as a /bad/ friend.

In my fic I use the Horrocrux episode as a "I don't think I can trust you as much as before and I don't think I can still be your best friend, but I think being just regular friends is okay." before breaking they friendship completely with sending Ginny to Azkaban for a crime she didn't commit and Harry not defending her. (He didn't jump in her defense basically because his actual best friend commit the crime in question and Harry sticks with her rather than Ginny. Also, they were going through a not very friendly divorce. In my fic being the host of an Horrocrux let's lingering effects, emphasizing their worst characteristics and/or copying Tom Riddle ones. My Harry will let Britain burn and not raise a single eyebrow if you are not a very close friend of his and are in the burning pile.)

Note: I don't think my syntaxis is all all right, but me and my self study in the english lenguaje are trying.
