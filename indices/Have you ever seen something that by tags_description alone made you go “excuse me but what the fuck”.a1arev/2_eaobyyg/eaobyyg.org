Yes. I saw something along the lines of “Harry/Lily romantic pair” and clicked out right there. I read Game of Thrones---meaning I'm not so faint-of-heart that I can't handle incest if it HAS to be there. But this pair went completely against my idea of Lily's character, and I was annoyed that someone took a very noble protection spell and decided that was ground for a rare-pair. (No offense to anyone who likes Harry/Lily romantic, but no thanks. Not for me)
