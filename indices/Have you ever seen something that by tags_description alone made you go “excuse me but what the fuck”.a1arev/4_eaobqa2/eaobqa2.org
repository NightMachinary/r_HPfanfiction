I once stumbled across the Winnie Pooh fic while i was looking for crossovers and the sad thing is that the characterisations of Ron, Draco, Neville..as winnie pooh characters is really good and it has 11yo children acting realistically. The other half of the fic is just really fucked up sex slave stuff...wonder what that says about the mental state of the author?
