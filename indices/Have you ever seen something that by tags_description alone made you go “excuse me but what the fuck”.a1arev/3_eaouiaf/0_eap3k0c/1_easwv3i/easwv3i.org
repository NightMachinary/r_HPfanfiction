I feel like I'm the only person who loves ao3's specificity of tags. It is so easy to decide not to read something. I don't get surprised halfway through with harems I don't want to read, or crazy pairings that weren't really mentioned up front. It's safer than ffnet when I'm looking for something.

But yeah, it's definitely like 80% porn.
