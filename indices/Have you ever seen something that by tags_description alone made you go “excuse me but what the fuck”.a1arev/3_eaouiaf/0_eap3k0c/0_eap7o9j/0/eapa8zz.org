Amen to that. I can't count how many times I've read a summary or seen a recommendation for something on AO3 and thought it would be interesting, only to immediately close my browser when I see the pairings/tags.

And the interface really really really sucks. When I first started using it, I never noticed the proceed banners (I was on my phone), so I'd be clicking and wanting to throw my phone across the room because /nothing was happening/.
