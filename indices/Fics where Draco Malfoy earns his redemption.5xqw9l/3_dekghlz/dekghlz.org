Yes!

Check out [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3634826/1/Volunteers][The Volunteers series]] by Anna Fugazzi. The premise is that single-dad Harry and single-dad Draco end up volunteering together for a Beltane event in Scotland. Draco has been living as a muggle for years because of his probation after the war. All of the repercussions for Draco's involvement in the war felt really realistic and were some of the most well done I have read. He definitely earns his redemption in this.

Also [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164][Eclipse]] is a great redemption story of Draco that doesn't just skip over his transition from the dark side to the light. It's a classic too - written pre-OOTP I think. Linkffn(3634826), linkao3(327164)
