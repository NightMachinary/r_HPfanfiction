/Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of/ [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rule%2063][*/rule 63/*]] :

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Rule 63 is a rule of the internet that reads as follows: "For any given male character, there is a female version of that character." This rule's exceptions are only in the instance that A: the male character is already so androgynous that a female version would be basically the same, or B: the female version hasn't been drawn yet.
