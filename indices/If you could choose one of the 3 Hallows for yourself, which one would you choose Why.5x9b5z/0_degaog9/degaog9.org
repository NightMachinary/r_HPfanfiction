I am a muggle that means the Elder Wand wand is useless to me. I personally would take the stone of resurrection because it allows me to talk to the dead and have them give me advise on multiple things in life and allow great people to still have impact on the world. Imaginge asking talking to the likes of Einsteins or Newton. I could also recover knowledge that has been thought lost. And biggest strength and weakness is that it would allow me to talk to loved ones that have passed away. it would be really hard to avoid spending to much time with the people you miss.

I dont think there is a worst Hallow because it depends on each person and what they need. Even the Invisibility cloak would be extremely useful to people who want to figure out someone elses secrets. The Wand is extremely powerfull and I would have chosen it If I were a wizard but it would only take on of my future children inheriting it for people to notice that is the wand that makes one powerfull and the person who inheirits it would most likely end dead and the cycle with people murdering for the wand begins again
