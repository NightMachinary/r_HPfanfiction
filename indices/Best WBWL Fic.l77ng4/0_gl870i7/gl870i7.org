Ooh, fun. If you want to cry yourself to sleep after reading it, then there's linkao3(Antithesis by OceanBreeze7), completed at 400k. Very emotionally traumatising lol, this fic was heart-wrenching, brilliant writing.

There's the linkao3(Sarcasm and Slytherin) series, which is up to book 5 and possibly abandoned.

Then there's linkao3(Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos) which is pretty much the same premise as S&S. Pros: IMO, better writing than S&S and it's regularly updated, but Cons: it's only up to book 2.

You can also go through the WBWL tag on AO3, sort by kudos and exclude the relationships you don't want :)
