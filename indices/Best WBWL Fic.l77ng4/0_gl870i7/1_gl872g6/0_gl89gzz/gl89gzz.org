Okay good bot, but you got the bottom one wrong- my fault though bot, I didn't realise you don't link series! Also the second one is the /second/ book in sarcasm and Slytherin, not the first, but close enough.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the forsaken's ascension) should be book 1 of ashes of chaos. There's an audiobook of it too on YouTube.
