A completed story/series is the Last Mage series where upon being borne to Earth, Kal-El was found and blood-adopted by the Potters to replace their stillborn son.

The stories are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][The Last Mage of Krypton]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Rising From The Shadows]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][A Distant Storm]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][A Challenge Unexpected]].

The third one is noteworthy in that Voldie and Grindelwald go on a road trip and it ISN'T a crackfic!
