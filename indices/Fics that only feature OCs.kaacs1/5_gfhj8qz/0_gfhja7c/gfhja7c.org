  A few years after leaving the South Pole with his father and the tribe's men to join the war effort against the Fire Nation, Sokka is sent on an undercover mission into the Fire Nation's capitol city to gather information on the Fire Lord's family. When Sokka runs into trouble at a local bar, a handsome stranger with an eye patch comes to his rescue. Sokka unintentionally gathers more information than needed.
