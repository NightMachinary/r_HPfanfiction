linkffn(3964606) barely mention anything about Wizarding Britain, set in the 00s Wizarding America. It's really dark by the way, and while they use some spells in canon, ultimately the way magic works differ from canon.

linkffn(8596476) set in 1590 Britain, some name dropping of Muggle historical figure and Wizarding Britain prominent family. Too flowery dialogue for my taste.
