Highly recommend Inverarity. Alexandra Quick, which someone else has linked here, and *Hogwarts Houses Divided* are both extremely high quality and enjoyable.

Slide is another of my favorite fanfic authors, her canon-compliant *Anguis series* (a prologue +trilogy) starts at Hogwarts during the war, but follows four OC Slytherin characters. Her canon-compliant, next-gen *Stygian Trilogy* features Albus, Rose, and Scorpius as three of the main characters, but also a lot of well-developed OCs.

These are long series - AQ is currently sitting at around 1,300,000 words with books 6 and 7 still to come, and Anguis and Stygian are both around 800,000 words each. The writing is efficient, though - these are really stellar fanfics. There are definitely more stories that I thought of for this, but these two authors are really the best I've been able to find.
