I don't have any specific recommendations for y/n fanfic, but I think you should check out the Harry Potter/Reader tag on archiveofourown.org and sort by kudos, that should get you started! And for hinny, I recommend going to the harryandginny subreddit, very friendly community with tons of recs! There's also a harryandginny subreddit discord!

Good luck!
