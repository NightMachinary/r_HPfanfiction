There may be more, but the first thing that comes to mind is "so what?" From what we can tell in canon, what makes a good wizard is largely hard work and intellect.

Dudley would be about as good as Crabbe or Goyle - so he might hope to someday cast a Fiendfyre good enough to kill himself.

What impact would the addition of such a person have on canon? Change Vernon/Petunia's opinion is what most people say - either that or they hate Dudley too - and at that point he's already had the neglect/"abuse" for those that don't know just how acceptable such treatment would have been even just 20 years ago in Britain. So now the Dursleys are marginally less terrible and...that still has little effect on the Harry/Voldemort story that drives the books.

So what is the point? Why rewrite canon with this essentially original character who you've based off an unlikable bully - though reading that from a first person Dudley perspective would be more interesting than anything currently out there.

Tl;dr this is a boring premise that may be handled well with a good author, but decent authors generally have more ambition at this point in the fandom.
