Those aspects could be explored, but again most authors wouldn't bother because there is no larger story to tell. Bullies grow up, and even Neville has a wand that can be used to shut him down - but if the only change is the addition of Dudley I'm still left wondering "so what?"

At most I could see this done decently as a handful of scenes throughout the years - anything more is just a rehash.
