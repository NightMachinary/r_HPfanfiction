All great fiction is character-driven, there's no disputing that. And there are a hundred good "for want of a nail" stories that snowball from a supposed "single change".

Maybe it's because I've been around too long and have read too many of the damn things, but the prospect of seeing all the same shit I've already seen - this time with Dudley! - is just unbelievably uninteresting.

Time was I probably would have read it, but that was maybe back in 2006 when we didn't have as much stellar work that was infinitely more creative.

You want character-driven with an amazing plot? Enembee's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]]. Great example of how to take an interesting premise and make it great with fantastic characters all around.
