Personally, I find the aspect of how would harry feel about having such a major aspect from his childhood there with him. Unlike Crabbe and Goyle, Dudley saw himself as a leader among his peers, not a follower. If the sorting hat bases house on what you value, not what you have, he may well have been in griffindor too. How would this have affected Neville to have such a bully in his own dorm room? Would he have developed the bravery to stand up to voldemort and slay Nagini? Would Hermione have come out of her shell if she'd spent all her time being picked on by Dudley? What if Dudley had ended up friends with the twins? Would this have meant Harry no longer had a sanctuary at the Burrow?

For me, interpersonal relationships are what drives a plot, and adding a new character into the mix can be a very interesting thing to explore.
