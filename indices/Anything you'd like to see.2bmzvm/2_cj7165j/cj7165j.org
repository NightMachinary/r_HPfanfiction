By vanilla do you mean cannon-compliant or vanilla only in pairings?

I would like to see a good Redeemed!Dudley story, especially one where he interacts with the wizarding world. A time travel story where the founders come to modern Hogwarts would be cool too. Maybe they wont be sorted in their own house. I don't know of a Sirius-raises-Harry story where Siris didn't go to Azkaban and adopts him as an infant legitimately.

For cannon compliant, a good Neville-as-a-teacher especially one where he interacts with Draco maybe.
