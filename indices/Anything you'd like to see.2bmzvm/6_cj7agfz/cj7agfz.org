I'd like to see:

James holds off Voldermort for long enough to allow Lily and Harry to escape. So James is dead but Lily is alive with Harry, and Voldermort is still at large.

Lily goes into hiding with Harry in a foreign country, and lives as a muggle to avoid detection, but Harry ends up going to Hogwarts under heavy security, possibly not until the 3rd or 4th year when the ministry/order of the phoenix have gained a slight upper hand in the ongoing war. He's been home schooled in magic by Lily before then.
