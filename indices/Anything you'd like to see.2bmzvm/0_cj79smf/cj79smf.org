Nearly every Marauders era fic (that doesn't involve time travel) I've read is either Snape-is-evil or Marauders-are-evil. I'd like to read one where Lily is a sociopath, playing the Marauders and Snape against each other for her benefit. Someone once mentioned that plot bunny to me, and I've been looking for anything like it since.
