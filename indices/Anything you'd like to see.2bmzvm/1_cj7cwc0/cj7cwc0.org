Harry gets blackout drunk. When he wakes up, he doesn't remember anything, so what follows is him and his buddies going on a Hangover-esque adventure to trace their steps back and figure out what happened.

Insert lots of crazy drunk ideas. Riding dragons and such. Harry could also defeat Voldemort with his surprising drunken... wand ability, and not remember a thing about it. He could also splinch some body part and spend half the story looking for it.
