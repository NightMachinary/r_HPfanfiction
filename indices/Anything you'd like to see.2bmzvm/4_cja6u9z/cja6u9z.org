One idea that I've always wanted to do is have Hermione sent to Azkaban for kidnapping and blackmail of Rita Skeeter at the end of /Goblet of Fire/. The story could be told from Hermione's POV, perhaps being "rescued" by Voldemort during the subsequent prison break, leading to an early captivity in Malfoy Mansion. Or maybe Harry's, facing the difficulties of fifth year, Voldemort's machinations, Umbridge's abuses, etc. without her. It could even be a "picking up the pieces after the war" type tale where she tries to put her life together after Voldemort's fall.
