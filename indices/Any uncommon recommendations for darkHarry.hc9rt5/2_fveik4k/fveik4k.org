Linkffn(circular reasoning) - not frequently mentioned that I have seen.

You've probably heard of the downward spiral saga by BolshevikMuppet. But that one is less dark Harry and more just evil Harry.

Linkffn(out of the night by rememberfics) is a good one I don't see recommended often.

More recently, there's been linkffn(the birth of the nightmare man) by tiro. That's the beginning of them, but there's 3 or 4, I believe.

Linkffn(it's all temporary with a bit of necromancy) also has a dark Harry.

Linkffn(mistakes and second chances) was particularly good, if you haven't read it, you'll not go wrong giving it a go.

Linkffn(knowledge comes at a price) has a fairly dark Harry - it's a crossover with elder scrolls, though, heavily featuring the daedric princes. I like it all the more for that.

Linkffn(chained) this just got updated and I forgot what it was about, but I'm pretty sure Harry's a death eater. For some value of 'is' or 'a death eater'.

Linkffn(godling ascending) darkness is debatable in this one, but this one is one of my absolute favs, so I'm including it

Linkffn(dust and wonders) I think I remember this one being decent

Linkffn(dementors are not dogs) kinda weird, but I liked it

Linkffn(sanguine) also technically dark but adorable

Linkffn(the lesser sadness) actual dark Harry

That's all I can think of at the moment
