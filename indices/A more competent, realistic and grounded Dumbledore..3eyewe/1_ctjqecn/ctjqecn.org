All of these are legit criteria, and I shouldn't be judging people on their preferences, but this one is a peeve:

#+begin_quote
  Choose a more suitable childhood for a boy who is destined to kill or be killed.
#+end_quote

And what, precisely would be a "more suitable childhood for a boy who is destined to kill or be killed"? Raising Harry as a child soldier? That might give him more "power", but that would be power that Vodemort knows very well, and certainly not "power he knows not".

Not giving him to his closest blood relatives? Lily's blood protection --- which just stopped an unstoppable curse and slew one of the two mightiest wizards in the land --- would be forfeit. Who would protect Harry then? The Ministry, which is on its last legs from the war and has no shortage of Voldemort sympathizers? The Order, which has just been shown to have at least one Death Eater spy trusted by everyone?
