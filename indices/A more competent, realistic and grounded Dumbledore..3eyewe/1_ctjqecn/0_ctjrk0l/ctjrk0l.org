  Who would protect Harry then?
#+end_quote

Possibly someone who already has extensive experience with children. Someone powerful, with great knowledge of arcane magic. Someone who lives in a place with heavy wards -- the safest place in the wizarding world, ideally. Someone with teaching experience. Someone the Dark Lord himself feared.

How could Albus Dumbledore find such a person?
