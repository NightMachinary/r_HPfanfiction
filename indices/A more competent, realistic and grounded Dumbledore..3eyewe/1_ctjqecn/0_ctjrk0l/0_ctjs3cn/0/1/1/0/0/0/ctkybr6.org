    Being able to shift around competencies like that is called "specialization"
  #+end_quote

  Having a larger number of people involved in projects with each of them being specialized adds communication overhead and makes planning harder.
#+end_quote

It's still an extra resource.

#+begin_quote
  The thing that makes everything much easier in my story is that several people act halfway competent rather than being ineffable, baffling instruments of the author's will. (Of course, that's exactly what makes things much harder: Voldemort and the Death Eaters do the same.) Adding one extra member to the Order of the Phoenix, even someone who's completely trusted, is a minor advantage.
#+end_quote

Depends. Considering that DEs outnumber OotP, the marginal value of each OotP member is pretty darned high, especially if it's someone impressive enough to be Dumbledore's husband.

    Again, this is epic magic that works on holistic, conceptual level. Yes, it would stop all of these workarounds.
  #+end_quote

  I can't see how to justify things like this without also allowing for a huge variety of "I win" powers.
#+end_quote

Well, sacrificial protection is something that one can't really plan for or rely on, since it requires pretty specific conditions, as well as several often improbable actions from the attacker. If it happens, you use it. If it doesn't, you have to do something else.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, Dumbledore must be aware of the protection and its details in order for it to make any sense to drop Harry off with the Dursleys.
#+end_quote

Again, he doesn't need to know details, no more than he needs to know all the possible mundane ways to discover the secret when casting the Fidelius. Notably, he does understand it enough to augment it (since he refers to a "charm I placed on you") in OotP.

    Also, Harry Potter is important, but he isn't that important
  #+end_quote

  Quite possibly the only way to defeat Voldemort isn't that important?
#+end_quote

More precisely, he is just the one Voldemort believes in, which gives the prophecy power over him. But, tyrants create their own enemies, as Dumbledore explains out, and Harry wasn't the only candidate either. Also, a big factor contributing to his importance is the sacrificial protection that he carries, as long as he lives with the Dursleys.

#+begin_quote
  It's a bit more than a minor let-down if Voldemort wins. Voldemort would purge half the wizarding world and then start in on the Muggles. And he'd probably not be content with just Great Britain. It's a matter of thousands of lives, with a chance of costing millions.
#+end_quote

Yes. That's why if sacrificial protection (with some unpleasant relatives) weren't available, you might consider some security measures, even if you wouldn't rearranged the world to make it happen. However, sacrificial protection is there for the taking, ans it's the only protection that /nothing/ Voldemort or his agents can do to circumvent. Indeed, if Harry is that critical, it's doubly important to keep him at the Dursleys, because nothing Dumbledore can do can match that.

#+begin_quote
  Unless Dumbledore was a seer and had prophesied that Harry would defeat Voldemort for certain, and that that wouldn't require any special training, or unless he was a blithering idiot, he must have known it was woefully insufficient to shove Harry out into the Muggle world and give him no training to kill Dark Lords or survive against Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

The "Harry needs special training!" argument was already addressed in my original post. Harry has the potential to defeat Voldemort because he has the power that Voldemort knows not. Being better at violence is a power that Voldemort knows better than anyone.

Also, no amount of training given to a child who, while he is plenty talented, is not as talented as, say, Snape and Hermione, to say nothing of Voldemort and Dumbledore, can make up for forfeiting the sacrificial protection, especially if you are planning on sending Harry to Hogwarts.
