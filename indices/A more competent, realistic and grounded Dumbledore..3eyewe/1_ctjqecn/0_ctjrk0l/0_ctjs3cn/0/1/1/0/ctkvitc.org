  No. Bellatrix was at large for several days after Harry went to the Dursleys. Dumbledore forced him to stay there for sixteen years.
#+end_quote

Well, there you go. And then, a whole bunch of Death Eaters got off; and who knows how many avoided capture, not to mention unmarked sympathizers? (I'm pretty sure that we don't know of /one/ named Death Eater who disavowed Voldemort after his first fall and still went to Azkaban. All the named Death Eaters who went to Azkaban went there proud and heads-held-high. There were, presumably, some, perhaps many, who went to Azkaban after disavowing Voldemort; but we don't ever get to see them.)

    People who might, by the way, be compromised the way whoever betrayed the Fidelius was.

  That's what Unbreakable Vows are for.
#+end_quote

Canon does not give explicit reasons why neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort spammed Unbreakable Vows to enforce secrecy and obedience, but making them an "I Swear on my Magic" fanon type mechanism for making commitments and verifying truth would break the whole of the story and the setting, so there have to be some. Unbreakable Vows being used sparingly is as canon as their existence in the first place.

Even that aside, history shows that while the Boy-Who-Lived was a celebrity, the number of people willing to actually lift a finger to help him --- much less risk their lives by taking an Unbreakable Vow and serving as his bodyguards --- was very limited.

  I'm removing some of Albus's competence and assigning it to an original character.
#+end_quote

Being able to shift around competencies like that is called "specialization", a cornerstone of civilization as we know it. Say that I cloned myself and gave my clone my dish-washing competence, while retaining my Internet debates competence. Now, we could, collectively, debate on the Internet and get the dishes washed, at the cost of housing and feeding two of me instead of one. In the wizarding world, these latter costs are negligible. So, yeah, you're giving Dumbledore significant extra resources here.

#+begin_quote
  I could achieve a similar effect by having Dumbledore resign as Hogwarts Headmaster, promoting McGonagall, /and creating a generic Order of the Phoenix OC/.
#+end_quote

(Emphasis in the above quote is mine.)

Like I said, pulling loyal and competent characters out of a hat.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had an explanation after the fact for the Harry-burns-Dumbledore effect, but he didn't seem to understand what mechanism the protections would take beforehand. That means that, for any mechanism by which Harry could have come to harm, Dumbledore could not have rationally relied on Lily's protection to defend him from it.
#+end_quote

Yeah, epic magic is like that. It's sort of like the Fidelius Charm: it doesn't matter /how/ it prevents an attacker from learning the secret (except through the Secret Keeper). It just does, whether the attacker attempts to learn it by interrogating a non-SK, or by looking up the address in a phonebook.

#+begin_quote
  The primary protection Harry had was that the Death Eaters were stupid. They were too stupid to nab him when he left the Hogwarts Express. They were too stupid to follow him from the Hogwarts Express on brooms with invisibility cloaks to find where he lived. They were too stupid to look at Ministry records to find him, even when they took over the Ministry in all but name.
#+end_quote

Well, that, or, you know, epic magic that requires human sacrifice, cannot be invoked deliberately by the sacrifice, and is triggered by once-a-decade circumstances; epic magic of the kind that blocks unblockable curses and kills unkillable wizards, prevents them from finding hurting Harry, /especially/ when he's living with the Dursleys.

#+begin_quote
  A protection on his house would be pretty useless. The Death Eaters could easily have transfigured the sidewalk in front of his house into a deep pit and put a glamour on top so he wouldn't notice until he fell to his death. They could have set fires all around his house. They could have gotten a dragon and plunked it down on Privet Drive. They could have transfigured the surrounding neighborhood into a giant basin and filled it with water to force Harry out. They could have slipped Dudley a handful of cash to swap Harry's blanket for a cursed one, or one that's been exposed to someone with dragonpox, or to put a potted devil's snare under his bed.
#+end_quote

Again, this is epic magic that works on holistic, conceptual level. Yes, it would stop all of these workarounds.

It's telling that the only ones who were actually able to attack or endanger Harry while he lived at 4 Privet Drive were non-Death-Eaters: Umbridge, Durslesys, Aunt Marge. (There was also Dobby, of course, but he was halping.)

#+begin_quote
  In order for the protection to actually work, it has to have some sort of mystical effect that prevents people from thinking of ways to track Harry down and hurt him. I won't accept a spell that forces an entire nation to hold an idiot ball. It might even be canon (it wouldn't be too dissimilar from the canon Fidelius charm), but it's too powerful and too frustrating for me to accept in anything I write.
#+end_quote

Well, yes, if /your AU/ removes or weakens the sacrificial protection option, then other options might be better, just as you might have better options if you could conjure competent allies from thin air. However, that has nothing to do with what a more "competent, realistic, and grounded" Dumbledore would do in a canon-like setting, where sacrificial protection was the best option.

    And, if you want to have multiple lines of defense, remember that every line you add degrades and restricts Harry's childhood.
  #+end_quote

  When Dumbledore is available, they can go out, and Harry can enjoy Diagon Alley, parks, movies, playing with other children, what have you. Otherwise, he has to stay at one of several Fidelius safehouses (which can include the grounds as well as the house) with at least two guardians (who have taken Unbreakable Vows to protect him) and Fawkes (who is instructed to move him to an even more secret safehouse, or possibly to Nicholas Flamel's house, since Flamel has managed to protect a source of immortality and great wealth for five centuries). And we'll throw in three house elves if we can find them -- two on defense and one on evacuation.
#+end_quote

A Harry who grows up in the wizarding world grows up as a child celebrity and a political puck. Dursleys are highly suboptimal, but considering how little effect their abuse actually had on his development (I treat it as a literary equivalent of cartoon violence), a maximum security childhood interspersed with celebrity outings would have probably been worse.

Also, Harry Potter is important, but he isn't /that/ important, and would be even less so if Dumbledore were more proactive in other areas. Every one of these resources could be better used for some other purpose.
