  Being able to shift around competencies like that is called "specialization"
#+end_quote

Having a larger number of people involved in projects with each of them being specialized adds communication overhead and makes planning harder.

  Like I said, pulling loyal and competent characters out of a hat.
#+end_quote

The thing that makes everything much easier in my story is that several people act halfway competent rather than being ineffable, baffling instruments of the author's will. (Of course, that's exactly what makes things much harder: Voldemort and the Death Eaters do the same.) Adding /one/ extra member to the Order of the Phoenix, even someone who's completely trusted, is a minor advantage.

  Again, this is epic magic that works on holistic, conceptual level. Yes, it would stop all of these workarounds.
#+end_quote

I can't see how to justify things like this without also allowing for a huge variety of "I win" powers. Furthermore, Dumbledore must be aware of the protection and its details in order for it to make any sense to drop Harry off with the Dursleys.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Harry Potter is important, but he isn't that important
#+end_quote

Quite possibly the only way to defeat Voldemort isn't that important? It's a bit more than a minor let-down if Voldemort wins. Voldemort would purge half the wizarding world and then start in on the Muggles. And he'd probably not be content with just Great Britain. It's a matter of thousands of lives, with a chance of costing millions.

Unless Dumbledore was a seer and had prophesied that Harry would defeat Voldemort for certain, and that that wouldn't require any special training, or unless he was a blithering idiot, he must have known it was woefully insufficient to shove Harry out into the Muggle world and give him no training to kill Dark Lords or survive against Death Eaters.
