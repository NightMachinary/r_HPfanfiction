  In particular, IIRC this was while Bellatrix was still at large.

No. Bellatrix was at large for several days after Harry went to the Dursleys. Dumbledore forced him to stay there for sixteen years.

  People who might, by the way, be compromised the way whoever betrayed the Fidelius was.

That's what Unbreakable Vows are for.

  Well, yes, if you're allowed to conjure competent OCs on the good guys' side ex nihilo, things get a lot easier
#+end_quote

I'm /removing/ some of Albus's competence and assigning it to an original character. I could achieve a similar effect by having Dumbledore resign as Hogwarts Headmaster, promoting McGonagall, and creating a generic Order of the Phoenix OC.

    Once by hitching a ride on someone else's soul -- I'd be shocked if the protections anywhere else would catch that.
  #+end_quote

  Lily's sacrificial protection probably would. It worked against Quirrelmort, certainly, and 4 Privet Drive remained a perfect sanctuary from Voldemort and his followers until the moment Harry left it for the last time.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore had an explanation after the fact for the Harry-burns-Dumbledore effect, but he didn't seem to understand what mechanism the protections would take beforehand. That means that, for any mechanism by which Harry could have come to harm, Dumbledore could not have rationally relied on Lily's protection to defend him from it.

The primary protection Harry had was that the Death Eaters were stupid. They were too stupid to nab him when he left the Hogwarts Express. They were too stupid to follow him from the Hogwarts Express on brooms with invisibility cloaks to find where he lived. They were too stupid to look at Ministry records to find him, even when they took over the Ministry in all but name.

A protection on his house would be pretty useless. The Death Eaters could easily have transfigured the sidewalk in front of his house into a deep pit and put a glamour on top so he wouldn't notice until he fell to his death. They could have set fires all around his house. They could have gotten a dragon and plunked it down on Privet Drive. They could have transfigured the surrounding neighborhood into a giant basin and filled it with water to force Harry out. They could have slipped Dudley a handful of cash to swap Harry's blanket for a cursed one, or one that's been exposed to someone with dragonpox, or to put a potted devil's snare under his bed.

In order for the protection to actually work, it has to have some sort of mystical effect that prevents people from /thinking/ of ways to track Harry down and hurt him. I won't accept a spell that forces an entire nation to hold an idiot ball. It might even be canon (it wouldn't be too dissimilar from the canon Fidelius charm), but it's too powerful and too frustrating for me to accept in anything I write.

  And, if you want to have multiple lines of defense, remember that every line you add degrades and restricts Harry's childhood.
#+end_quote

When Dumbledore is available, they can go out, and Harry can enjoy Diagon Alley, parks, movies, playing with other children, what have you. Otherwise, he has to stay at one of several Fidelius safehouses (which can include the grounds as well as the house) with at least two guardians (who have taken Unbreakable Vows to protect him) and Fawkes (who is instructed to move him to an even more secret safehouse, or possibly to Nicholas Flamel's house, since Flamel has managed to protect a source of immortality and great wealth for five centuries). And we'll throw in three house elves if we can find them -- two on defense and one on evacuation.

If Dumbledore is often available, that's not terribly restrictive. If Dumbledore is not often available, that is moderately restrictive.
