    Having a larger number of people involved in projects with each of them being specialized adds communication overhead and makes planning harder.

  It's still an extra resource.

I suppose that counts even more since the Order of the Phoenix doesn't seem to plan at all or even communicate much. The overhead in planning and communication just vanishes when you don't talk to each other.

My disbelief in this far-reaching magical protection comes from the fact that the existence of such magic in a magic system is so unbelievably broken, and the ability of a character to rely on it is so damaging for a story's tension, that no reasonable author would actually create a magic system that gave everyone in an entire country the idiot ball. And even if you get past that, you're left having to write a ton of idiots. Assuming that's what Rowling intended and assuming that she wrote Dumbledore to realize the extent and potency of Lily's protection, it would certainly behoove him to put Harry with the Dursleys. I just can't credit it.
