A character's competence should be judged on what they did given the information and resources they had available (and had reasonable ways of knowing they had available) at the time. Ordinary magic available in canon favors the attacker over the defender. Only epic-level magic like sacrificial protection or Fidelius could have protected Harry adequately, at least given the information available to Dumbledore at he time the decision had to be made.

In particular, IIRC this was while Bellatrix was still at large. Dumbledore had no way of knowing that she would be caught torturing the Longbottoms. What if she weren't?

  His father, rather. Parents can have other people help out with parenting, and they can have babysitters for their kids, and they often have jobs.
#+end_quote

Yes. However, that would mean delegating Harry's protection to other, weaker people. People who might, by the way, be compromised the way whoever betrayed the Fidelius was.

It would also leave Harry in the public eye of the wizarding world, making him a political puck, and forcing Dumbledore to expend yet more effort protecting him from that as well.

  Which is why in my never-to-be-completed Dumbledore-raises-Harry fic, Dumbledore's husband is the politician. It's a much better division of power while still keeping that power relatively concentrated.

Well, yes, if you're allowed to conjure competent OCs on the good guys' side /ex nihilo/, things get a lot easier, and you have to make much fewer trade-offs. In fact, why don't you conjure a second Dumbledore while you're at it? Actually, why stop at two? :P

  With difficulty, cunning, and stealth.

You say it like that makes it something that a vengeful Death Eater could never do.

  Once by hitching a ride on someone else's soul -- I'd be shocked if the protections anywhere else would catch that.
#+end_quote

Lily's sacrificial protection probably would. It worked against Quirrelmort, certainly, and 4 Privet Drive remained a perfect sanctuary from Voldemort and his followers until the moment Harry left it for the last time.

  Once by enchanted diary -- that's an honest miss; the wards should catch dark artifacts.
#+end_quote

Brilliant idea! If only such magic were mentioned in canon and were easy enough to be used on all the ways items can come into Hogwarts! (The closest thing is Thief's Downfall, which is something only Goblins are shown to have --- and they have /one/ of it.)

*Edit:* Actually, it turns out that as [[/u/FreakingTea]] ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3eyewe/a_more_competent_realistic_and_grounded_dumbledore/ctlgyh3]]) points out and as [[/u/wordhammer]] ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3eyewe/a_more_competent_realistic_and_grounded_dumbledore/ctlmlod]]) quotes, Secrecy Sensor, a magical device that can, apparently, be used by a Squib, does exist. So, indeed, that may have been preventable with adequate security measures. Funnily enough, it might have failed to detect Tom Riddle's Diary, since Ginny wasn't actually /sneaking/ it in.

  That's three times over the course of five years, even when cherry-picking the most hectic period possible.
#+end_quote

Also, fake Moody in GoF and Sirius in PoA. I'm counting 5 times in 6 years. You are right, in OotP the infiltration was overt and lawful, so, perhaps, not /every/ year, unless someone got a ministry official with an Imperius.

As for it being a hectic period, fine, assume no successful infiltrations in the prior decade. That still means, at this rate, 2-3 successful infiltrations before Harry turns 11.

And, if you want to have multiple lines of defense, remember that every line you add degrades and restricts Harry's childhood.
