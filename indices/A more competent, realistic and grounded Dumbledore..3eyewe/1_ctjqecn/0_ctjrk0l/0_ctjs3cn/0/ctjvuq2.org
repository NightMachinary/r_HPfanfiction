  So, you propose that Dumbledore become Harry Potter's 24/7 bodyguard, babysitter, and tutor?
#+end_quote

His father, rather. Parents can have other people help out with parenting, and they can have babysitters for their kids, and they often have jobs.

  And a responsibility for raising the new generation of children to be decent human beings, while serving as an elder statesman in a myriad positions, counteracting influence of blood purists in politics, etc..

Which is why in my never-to-be-completed Dumbledore-raises-Harry fic, Dumbledore's husband is the politician. It's a much better division of power while still keeping that power relatively concentrated.

  Which, experience shows, gets infiltrated at least once a year.

With difficulty, cunning, and stealth. Once by hitching a ride on someone else's soul -- I'd be shocked if the protections anywhere else would catch that. Once by enchanted diary -- that's an honest miss; the wards should catch dark artifacts. Once via a vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement, and at that point Snape was installed as headmaster, which presumably gave him the authority and ability to alter the protections on the castle to allow a horde of Death Eaters and Voldemort himself in the front door.

That's three times over the course of five years, even when cherry-picking the most hectic period possible.
