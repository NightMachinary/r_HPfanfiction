Ok, so we've established that Harry must be left with the Dursleys to protect him from Voldemort. But why not give him sufficient protection from the Dursleys themselves? Have someone more competetant than a batty old squib to stand guard, have tutors visit and teach him. Give the Dursleys incentives to treat him fairly, whether financial rewards or monitoring of some kind (carrot and stick).
