That's a better question. My headcanon is that epic, conceptual magic like sacrificial protection can be finicky: how much pressure, monitoring, and magical interference would the Dursleys tolerate before simply kicking Harry out; and if they were coerced into taking and keeping Harry in, how could love-based protection survive that? Petunia did not like taking in Harry one bit; but she did it anyway, of her own free will. This is important.
