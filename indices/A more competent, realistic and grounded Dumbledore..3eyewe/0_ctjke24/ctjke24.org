Blueowl's fic The Trusted Hero linkffn(11155084) is excellent and demonstrates an intelligent and supportive Dumbledore but it doesn't quite fit your criteria as it takes place after Voldemort's resurrection. It's a spin-off from the fanfic 'The Hidden Hero' by Evebb (which I didn't really care for.)

Another competent, supportive Dumbledore is in White Lies (And Other Misdemeanors) by AzarDarkstar linka03(565778). It's also post Voldemort resurrection.

Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power by DisobedienceWriter linkffn(8215565) demonstrates an intelligent and cagey Dumbledore who has very, very good reason for the "mistakes" he makes and is quite clever in how he circumvents the issues and helps Harry.
