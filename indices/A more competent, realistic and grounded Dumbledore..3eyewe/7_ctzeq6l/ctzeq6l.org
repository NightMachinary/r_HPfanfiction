I wrote a Dumbledore in linkffn(Patron) who doesn't hire frauds, impostors or possessed people, kept Remus after year 3 as DADA teacher, doesn't let Snape abuse students, and didn't leave Harry with a family who hate magic (instead, they fear magic, but still try to love and care for Harry. He doesn't like it there, mostly because he knows he is scaring Petunia and Vernon, and yet his presence is needed to protect them, at least 2 weeks per year once he starts living with Sirius. Dudley though doesn't fear him.)
