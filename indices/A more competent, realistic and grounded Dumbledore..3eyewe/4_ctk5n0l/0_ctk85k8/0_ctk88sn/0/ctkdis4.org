I wouldn't be so put off by the story elements. Summoning a demon to help you fight a Dark Lord seems like a viable option. Even messing it up and then having a demon on your hands seems alright.

Its just this non-reaction by everybody. Also, the demon character annoyed me to no end after the first dialoge (and I highly suspect it to be a self-insert).
