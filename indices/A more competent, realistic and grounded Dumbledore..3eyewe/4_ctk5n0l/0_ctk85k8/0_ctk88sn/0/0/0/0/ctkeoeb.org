I was looking, and found something I'd totally forgotten about. Written in 2005, I present to you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] It's a cross between Hellraiser and HP, where Harry has the Lament Configuration. If you haven't seen Hellraiser, you don't need to, the fic has enough info there for you.
