Etna isn't an SI, actually. She's from Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. Eh, if you don't like it, you don't like it. Ah well.

Though now that you mention it, I would really love to see a story where they summon a scary actual demon rather than a nice one. Of course everything would then have to go to hell. Probably literally.
