I will, as I have often before, recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer. Dumbledore in that is an old man who has too much on his plate. He is reasonable, and rather likable, even if we don't quite like what he has done, he is willing to acknowledge mistakes and work to fix them.
