I know, it's just that modern Icelandic is extremely similar to Old Norse, and we can read that language no problem. The Norwegians cannot.

Of course, Icelandic has remained practically unchanged for almost 1200 years, and we supposedly speak almost the same way the settlers did.

Naturally, every language changes and evolves over time, but our isolation in the middle of the North Atlantic has protected our language from outside influence. Though it has been changing rapidly over the past three decades, or so.

Now, movies and video games seem to take some delight in butchering my language. Listening to Chris Hemsworth trying, in vain to pronounce words like: Mj√∂lnir, Bifr√∂st, Einherjar, Niƒëavellir, gives my ears the cramps.

And apparently, the leader of the frost giants is a guy named... Laufey. Perhaps he was the first transgender, because Laufey is absolutely, one hundred percent a woman's name and roughly means 'good fortune'.

There are more examples, but I think these might suffice üòÅ
