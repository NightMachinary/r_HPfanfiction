Out of curiosity, are you aware of a good resource for Icelandic pronunciation? I like reading translations of the sagas once in a while (and recently picked up a copy of '[[https://www.amazon.ca/Sagas-Icelanders-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0141000031][Sagas of the Icelanders]]' so I'm currently working through that - damn thing is bigger than a bible) and I'm fairly sure that I butcher people and place names far more than Chris Hemsworth ever did.
