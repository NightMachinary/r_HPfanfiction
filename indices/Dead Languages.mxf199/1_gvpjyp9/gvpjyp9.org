I head canon it as for wizards know a lot more languages than we do. Firstly, it is fun. Secondly, Crouch knowing over 200 languages, Dumbledore speaking Mermish and Gobbledegook and all of the visiting students in book 4 being fluent in English implies that magicals have an easier time with magic than muggles do.

Thirdly, and most importantly, witches and wizards seem to place great store in legacies from the past. This is seen in the 'family prestige' part of the pureblood dogma as well as the number of ancient artefacts, rattling around, like those used for the Horcruxes. Logically, given that Hogwarts, and presumably its library, date back to the end of the dark ages, some of that legacy would have been written words and possibly talking ghosts, portraits or other artefacts. None of these would have been in modern English. Even if the language (like various celtic dialects) doesn't have muggle written form, unless Hogwarts education has changed a lot, magicals have always been highly literate and as Hogwarts is not run by the Catholic Church I see no reason why they would have just stuck to Latin, so they could have derived their own scripts.

Hence I like to think that the children of old pureblood houses learn the languages of their ancestors at home as a mixture of a show of prestige (like knowing latin and greek has histroically been for the muggle upper classes) and to help understand their history. Or maybe that is what 'Ancient Runes' is.
