Normally, I would not have placed the rules like that, but I had a post a few days ago where the ONLY fic that was linked was Shezza's. Don't get me wrong, I love his work, BUT there are others as well. that is why I placed the rules as I did. So far I have read the first chapter of the first four fics, and they are all going on the list of To be Read. So thank you :)
