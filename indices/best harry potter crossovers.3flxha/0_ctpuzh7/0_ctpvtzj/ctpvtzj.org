  When the boggart appears, it takes the shape of this statue. But never changes back, for that which takes the image of an Angel becomes itself an angel.

That's a nice plot device, actually.

I never even thought to go looking for one, this is awesome. I hope it's written well.

All I, in turn, have to recommend though are these four:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & the Natural 20]] (W: 301,307; WiP) --- *HP × D&D* --- Good characters, good writing style, and very good D&D technical knowledge on author's behalf.
- [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]] (W: 355,026; WiP)--- *HP × Buffy × Addams Family* --- I'd give it a rating somewhere between 60% and 80%. One major drawback is that [[/s][spoiler]].
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][Ascension]] (W: 141,467; abandoned) --- *HP × Mass Effect* --- The author knows his Mass Effect lore. Unfortunately, the story doesn't get the chance to develop fully before it gets abandoned.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4990751/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slayer-Dimension][HP & the Slayer Dimension]] (W: 70,590; abandoned) --- *HP × Buffy* --- could've been good if wasn't abandoned at 70KW.
