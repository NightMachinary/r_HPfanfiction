I've read Ascension, and it was great. I might need to reread it. The two Buffy fics are on my list to pick up once I finish watching BtVS. I never actually finished HP & the Natural 20, but from what I remember it was very good. I'll take another shot at it.

As for Monster Lord, it's written pretty well. I couldn't read it a second time, but that was more elements of the story itself than the writing.
