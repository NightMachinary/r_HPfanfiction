Damn you. I just went through my whole list of stuff and you get all the good stuff. This took way too long.

First, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds the Image]]. Doctor Who cross. Harry once saw an angel statue that never moved, but was always closer than he thought. This terrified him. Far more then dementors. When the boggart appears, it takes the shape of this statue. But never changes back, for that which takes the image of an Angel becomes itself an angel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8187591/1/The-Savior-Child-of-the-Tardis-Son-of-a-Mad-Man][The Savior, Child of the Tardis, Son of a Mad Man]] Dumbledore doesn't know what to do with Harry, so he calls in a favor from a man he met once. The Doctor raises Harry. Lot's of world building. Also ships Jack with Salazar.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be thou My Good.]] The power he knows not is very frightening indeed. Hellraiser crossover. Don't need to know anything about it to enjoy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532363/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Source][Harry Potter and the Sun Source]] A crossover with the Destroyer Chronicles. Also don't need to have read source material to enjoy. In which Harry is raised by Korean assassins.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862543/1/The-Traveler-in-Black-meets-Harry-Potter][The Traveler in Black meets Harry Potter]] An interesting crossover with the Traveler in Black. In which people get their wishes, and probably wish they didn't.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste][Harveste]] Harry raised by the Addams family. Has several sequels, one for each book, but stops two chapters into book 6. I still don't know why.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] Master of Death!Harry in the MCU with elements from the comics. I thought it was dead, but it recently updated, so yay!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6370414/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-God-of-Death][Harry Potter and the God of Death]] Cross with Bleach, follows Ichigo in Hogwarts. Probably dead, but well worth the read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This way Comes]] In which a demon is summoned, but things are never that simple. The demon is from Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, and contains an arc in Silent Hill, some elements of Narnia are alluded to. Very good. One of my favorites.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292/1/Deal-with-a-Devil][Deal With a Devil]] Lash from the Dresden Files ends up in Harry's head. Different Harry this time. Eight chapters, but not yet in Hogwarts. Should be happening in a chapter or two by WoG.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5871255/1/Fictional][Fictional]] Fate/stay Night cross. Harry is summoned by the Throne of Heroes, but remains a fictional character.Very dead, but still good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10187441/1/Monster-Lord][Monster Lord]] Harry undergoes a power enhancing ritual to stop Voldemort. It works. It also turns him into a woman. Who is also half snake. Crossover with Monster Girl Quest.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]] Harry the Warhammer 40k Space Marine. That is all.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4826372/1/Harry-Mewter][Harry Mewter]] Harry's animagus form is Mew. Shenanigans ensue.

Enjoy.
