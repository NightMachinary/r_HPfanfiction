linkffn(Harry Potter and the Master Ball) is a Harry Potter/Pokemon crossover that feels a lot like the original books, and is fairly well-done.

It starts off slightly like a canon rehash, but drifts more and more until book 3 is unrecognisable (same characters, different story). I'm not sure if book 3 is done yet, it's been a while since I've checked, but as far as I'm aware it's still updating regularly.
