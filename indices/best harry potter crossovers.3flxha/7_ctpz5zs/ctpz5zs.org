Double Jeopardy by Ruairi J.L linkffn(6656240)

An HP/Inheritance crossover. Just read this one and it is very well written.

Also linkffn(4922483) A HP/Doctor Who crossover where Harry becomes the head of an wizarding agency that deals with aliens. The premise being that the Dr is Harry's friend from a very young age and due to Timy Whimy stuff their paths intersect at various stages. Also contains a psychotic Ginny who believes that Harry is delusional for believing in aliens and attempts to cure him through any means possible.

Retsu's Folly an HP/Bleach crossover. It is not needed to know the source material or have watched the show. Harry is accidentally sent to soul society and must fight his way out. Very well written and lots of fun. Seemingly abandoned though.
