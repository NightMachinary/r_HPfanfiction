[[http://ishtar.fanficauthors.net/The_Case_of_the_Missing_Wizard/index/][The Case of the Missing Wizard by Ishtar]] is a HPxSherlock currently being released once a week. It's very good so far.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins by Jeconais]] a HPxAdamsFamily(and others) that is pretty fantastic. Stories up to the start of 4th year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For by kathryn518]], a HPxStarWars that's in progress with irregular, but lengthy and fairly frequent, updates.

Speaking of HPxStarWars: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh]]. Fantastic, although a long time since the last update.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8750155/1/The-Girl-who-Imprinted][The Girl Who Imprinted by CCRevival]], a seemingly abandoned HPxTwilight that I'd recommend if you're into that sort of thing. One of the few good ones I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter]], a pretty hilarious HPxRanma1/2xSailorMoon with a sequel as well.

And what crossover list would be complete without: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon]]. A fantastic HPxFirefly story.

Should be something for everyone in there.

Edit: added links because the bot's being a bitchly
