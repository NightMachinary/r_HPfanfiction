I have a new fic that's very much a WIP; I figured I'd pop it in here just in case! It's a Hermione/Tonks fic, and very AU. Voldemort succeeds in killing the Potters in 1981, and subsequently takes over Wizarding Britain. The Order is largely dead or in hiding, and Voldemort rules with a totalitarian fist. Muggleborns are taken from their homes at a very early age and raised to be second class citizens with very few opportunities to raise themselves up. One of these opportunities is Requiem, a contest hosted by Voldemort each year. Linkffn(13530186)
