The Sun is Waning by StarlightAsteria - Series is a WIP last updated in June 2017, but the stories in the series are complete.Interesting next-gen series, with unsympathetic Dramione causing drama to Draco's children. This is definitely a sympathetic view of Pureblood life, but the tone is lovely, like Jane Austen. James Sirius Potter is a toerag and Hermione is a homewrecker.

A wonderfully detailed portrayal of Wizarding traditions/religion and magic--I hope more comes one day.
