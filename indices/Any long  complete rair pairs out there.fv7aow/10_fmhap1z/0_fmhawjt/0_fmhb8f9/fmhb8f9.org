I would say it's pretty mild if I went so far as to call it bashing. He's definitely not like canon or shown in his best light, but I think it fits well enough for what the author is doing and how a boy his age with a temper could act. It's like the author is using what negative traits he has to move the story in some parts- like his jealousy or distaste for Slytherins.

He does get his redemption, though.
