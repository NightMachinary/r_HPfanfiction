Choosing Grey series by Betagyre (Tom Riddle - Voldemort/Hermione) WIP

A Time-Turner AU with dubious antihero Tom Riddle, morally grey (but conflicted) Hermione, conspiracies, mid-20th century wizarding world politics, plenty of dark magic.

This is a long, involved AU in which Hermione gets involved with Tom Riddle despite her intentions, and eventually makes a life with him. She's not Dark, but has a nuanced view of politics and works to carry out her own plans and keeps her morals, mostly.

The BDSM aspect is my least favorite aspect of the story, but in this series it works for these two characters. Explicit.
