Dear Lily (Lily/Snape eventually, background Sirius/Remus, but mostly gen) WIP\\
Lily lived. James died protecting Harry. Harry survived the Killing Curse. A series of stories that explore how giving Harry a loving, smart and pragmatic caregiver could have changed his life.\\
I love the sense of magical place and the details fleshing out the greater world of magic. Slytherin!Harry and a nicer Snape (because Lily lived, natch).\\

Thirteen Gifts (Theodore Nott/Harry Potter)\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16702549]]

A Bit of a Rest (Harry/Charlie eventually, mostly gen), WIP - 12,000+ words\\
Last updated in April 2014, so while I would love more of this melancholy but comforting post-war story, I doubt I'll get it. Potentially Harry/Charlie but mostly gen till the end, so if you don't like the ship, you can still enjoy it. Unresolved past Harry/Ginny mentioned, but again, that's not the focus--Harry's healing is.\\
