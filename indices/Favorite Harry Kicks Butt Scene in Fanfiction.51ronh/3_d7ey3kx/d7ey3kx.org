I have a few... I live off of battle scenes they are my bread and butter. The first one that made me shiver in excitement was in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Defiance of the Hero) I loved the battle between Atrius (I think thats right) and Harry.

Yet the best battle I have read in fanfiction tho... that is a tough one. Especially if it is limited to Harry Potter. The last battle Harry Participates in during linkffn(Harry Potter and the Emerald Trance) I can't give more for fear of spoilers but.. yea that is it
