There are some theories that Harry would lose his ability to speak parseltongue once the bit of Voldemort is removed from him... but I think that Harry in the Cursed Child could speak it still, right? (I haven't finished reading it, but I think I've heard that).

Tom Riddle in the diary could speak parseltongue... he was a memory (and a soul fragment). Maybe it is through memory? So maybe Harry retains his hold on parseltongue through memory? How is memory connected to soul?

When a Dementor sucks the soul out of a person, they seem to lose their identity... their memory of who they are... maybe there is a connection there?

Maybe once a trait is carried into a person's soul through their physical body (blood, bone, flesh), it becomes embedded in their soul?
