Memory is likely. Maybe the gift of Parseltongue is just a package of information (basically a dictionary and how to pronounce the words). It makes a lot of sense actually. Because even if the horcruxes were made at different points in different points in his life, he had the ability to speak Parseltongue from birth. And each horcrux has the memory of everything that happened up until the point they were made. So power and traits are carried through blood, but then become who the person is and are embedded in the soul. But Parseltongue as it is essentially a language would be just a package of informations carried through blood and then committed to memory. The blood would just be a medium, able to carry magic. Then the homunculus must have had blood, but not Voldemort's (whose?). And the blood of Harry literally gave Voldemort's new body the power to channel magic. But then where does magic come from, if not from the blood. If it from the soul then then Voldemort should be diminished from having split his. Questions questions... But the memory idea is a very good one! Even if it kind of defeats every Parselmagic fanfiction (:
