Maybe Parseltongue is a memory of magical knowledge that is passed along bloodlines... and because Harry contains a bit of Voldemort, he is essentially a descendant of Salazar Slytherin? I imagine that the portion of soul lodged in his head contains more DNA than would be transferred through sperm, even if it contains the building blocks of his person.

Maybe it is similar to how genetic traits are passed from one generation to the next...

I'm also curious about this because in the fiction that I'm writing, Harry absorbs some qualities from the magical creatures that he imbibes... phoenix tears and basilisk venom. He also uses his parseltongue abilities a lot.
