I guess I think it is all tied together... inexorably linked. Who we are physically impacts who we are as people. I know it is getting into the nature versus nurture argument... but I think our physicality plays into how we develop as people... muscle memory and all of that.

I think about people who lose their memories from a brain injury, but can still speak the language they learned as children or perform tasks such as getting dressed or reading... the brain and the body and the soul are bound together.

In the HP universe, the ghosts hang onto an imprint of their physical body in the afterlife, even though their bodies have decomposed long ago.
