That's a very good thought that the blood protection could only do so much... that it couldn't prevent the horocrux from finding a host in Harry.

I would like to think that the blood protection is able to fight the invasion especially when new agents enter his blood stream.

Thanks for asking about my story: It is a WIP and very long - all of this about the interactions of the different elements isn't explored until much later in the fic (chapter 108).
