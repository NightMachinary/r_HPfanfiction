Interesting. The blood protection providing a strong protection that lies within Harry's blood. So when two magical components enter it, then it activates. The Phoenix tears are fighting the Basilisk venom, so the blood protection would use it and its power to fight back, and thus developing new properties. Then the venom would be neutralized so it wouldn't be venom anymore but a liquid carrying properties and trait of the Basilisk. The blood protection could tap into or copy the properties of those liquids, kind of like creating antibodies. I like this idea!
