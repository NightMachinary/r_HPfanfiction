That's great that it was already on your reading list :). Sorry for potentially distracting you from your exams.

I like your theories about Lily's blood protection and how the horocrux snuck past it.

It's interesting to think that Lily's magic was tied up in the wards, and so less able to protect Harry from the threats from his family. His own magic provided some protection from them.
