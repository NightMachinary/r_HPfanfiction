Interesting. I suppose that the horcrux entered Harry just as the blood protection went dormant, exhausted from deflecting the killing curse, so could not detect the foreign body. But now that it has been awaken and has strengthened, perhaps it could tackle the Horcrux. Breaking it down into power, memory, muscle memory... purifying the darkness with the goodness of the tears; dissolving the link to Voldemort with the acidity of the venom. It could heal Harry's mind and perhaps erect some basic blood Occlumency shield. Anyway you triggered my curiosity. Send me a link when you publish!!
