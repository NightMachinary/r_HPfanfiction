So you think by absorbing Phoenix tears and basilisk venom it would affect Harry at a chemical level, forcing Harry's body to accommodate, breaking the components into raw magic/magical properties and traits and giving him new talent? That's very plausible in the word of magic. Everything is possible as long as it explained correctly. Sometimes I read things that infuriate me, like Harry just gaining new abilities without any explanation :(
