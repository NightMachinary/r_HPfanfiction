Oh it was already in my reading list but I have been postponing it until after my exams. I'll read many the first couple of chapters tonight before going to sleep just to get a taste. Well, the blood protection is magic, powerful because of Lily's sacrifice, but ultimately magic and magic runs out. So it stands to reason that deflecting the killing curse would weaken the amount of magic greatly. To me, after deflecting it, it only had enough strength to tie itself to Harry's core to be able to survive and power itself for when needed. Thus it could not have been able to focus on the horcrux and when it had regained power, it could not detect it as it had been there for a long time. Let's keep in mind that the blood protection also powers the blood wards around Privet Drive. So when Harry is at the Dursleys it would be weak within Harry as it would focus its energy on the wards. The Muggle environment would be then detrimental to Harry but it's practically canon that Harry should not live in the muggle world.
