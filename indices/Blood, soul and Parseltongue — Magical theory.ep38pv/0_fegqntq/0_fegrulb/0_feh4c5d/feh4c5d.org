This is gonna sound weird considering I'm reaching into another fandom, but lemme just quote Buffy the Vampire Slayer right quick:

#+begin_quote
  Blood is life, lackbrain. Why do you think we eat it? It's what keeps you going, makes you warm, makes you hard, makes you other than dead.
#+end_quote

BtVS also plays with souls a lot (characters losing their souls, etc). Blood keeps you alive, but the soul is what makes you YOU.

Again, I know it's a different fandom, but I think it's still relevant. I think blood and souls are more closely connected than you're implying. Blood helps build the person, but the soul is who a person actually is. Basically, I think the blood gives the abilities to the soul, and then the ability is forever tied to that soul.
