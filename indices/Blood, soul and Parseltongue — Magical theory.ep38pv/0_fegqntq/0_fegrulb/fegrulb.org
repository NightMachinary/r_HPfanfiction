Yes, sure. The problem is that first it is an ability carried through the line of Salazar Slytherin by blood, so where does the soul comes into play in all of that? Then if it's in the soul, then how can Voldemort still access it? A soul is one. Voldemort splits it seven times. It is impossible that each shard of soul have the same property as if it was a whole soul.

A vase holds flower. You break the vase. The pieces of vase cannot hold flowers anymore. You glue them together and you can hold flowers again (probably less efficiently than before).

Harry Potter's story is one. You break it into seven books. Each book is a piece of Harry Potter's story. But you can't access Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. You have to have the seven books to have access to the entire story.

Now, Voldemort only has one piece of his soul, the others are scattered to the four winds, so how can he still access all of his magic and gifts? Is it possible that even if he broke his soul in seven parts, he is still able to access them from afar, thus giving him a whole soul as long as the pieces are not destroyed?
