I believe magic comes from your soul. Your body is a different kind of wand, a channeler of your magic. Your wand is a focus.

I think the Parseltongue is a chicken/egg thing.

If you learn it or earn it yourself, it marks your soul. Reincarnate, reborn, etc? The mark on your soul causes your magic to form your body into being good for parseltongue.

If you hail from a bloodline with the Parseltongue ability, and your body is born with the ability: Your body is a wand, so your magic channels that specific way which marks your soul.
