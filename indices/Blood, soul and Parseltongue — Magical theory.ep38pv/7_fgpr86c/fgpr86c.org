The Best answer is that there is a permanent connection between the Blood and the Soul, the Blood create an unique magical identity that has consequence on the Soul, when the body is destroyed the soul retain that magical identity which recreate the Blood when the Body is recreated by ritual. For the Horcruxes, I believe that there is an reflexive identity between the part and the whole that make each fragment of soul the same from a magical signature point of view.
