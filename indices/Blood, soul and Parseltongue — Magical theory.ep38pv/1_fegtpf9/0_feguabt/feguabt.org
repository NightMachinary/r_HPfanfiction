Sorry I'm a little fuzzy on the details. What with the films and the fanfictions I read. Absolutely correct. Inhabiting a homunculus he regained the ability to use magic. But then the ability to use magic requires a body of some sort. The problem is that the homunculus is a made-up body so probably no blood in it (or maybe someone else's). So we're still not clear about what carries magic and magical traits/gifts.
