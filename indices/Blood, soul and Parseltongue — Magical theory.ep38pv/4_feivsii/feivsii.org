Just a minor thing. His snakelike appearance was not a result of Nagini's venom being used in the homunculus creation. It is explicitly the result of his shredding his soul so much. He already looked like that by the time he went to kill the Potters, as we see in the flashback in Deathly Hallows.

Not a major thing, but when fanfics act like he looked even remotely human before he was defeated by Lily's sacrifice, it makes me twitch.
