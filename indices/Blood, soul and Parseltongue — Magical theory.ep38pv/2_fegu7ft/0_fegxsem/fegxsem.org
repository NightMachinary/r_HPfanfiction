We can assume that the ability to possess people and animals is a natural power for a wraith. After all, a piece of soul or a spirit is not supposed to be separated from the body so it is likely that it would try to find a host. We can refer the piece of Voldemort's soul latching onto Harry, nothing to do with Voldemort or his power, just a natural property of the soul.

What did Voldemort retained? If not the natural ability for a wraith to possess. He possessed Quirrell but he had to give him instructions, he didn't use Quirrell's body to use magic. Maybe except Legilimency when he was able to determine that Harry was lying about the stone in his pocket. But then Voldemort probably took refuge in Quirrell's head thus allowing the use of mind magic. When he left Quirrel and fled, he wasn't able to harm Harry at all, or possess him because of his mother's protection.

Most people don't know about horcruxes, yes. But if the information was available, I'm sure half the Slytherin would make one, probably a handful of Ravenclaw, and one daring and boastful Gryffindor (probably McLaggen). Hufflepuff students just wouldn't.
