  Voldemort was planning to make a seventh horcrux with Harry's murder, so the piece of soul was ready to be transferred

You have to commit the murder to split the soul. Needing to "ready" the soul doesn't fit when TMR used Myrtle's 'wrong place, wrong time' death to make the diary. That piece broke off because his soul was unstable. If Harry's death was to have been used for the 2nd or 3rd horcrux, it would not have broken off.

  It's a magical ability of a wraith not of Voldemort!

Voldemort almost possessed Harry in the DoM when he had a body.

I'm not reading that wall of text, but I got the gist. My point is that just because people know about a piece of magic, doesn't mean they're going to do it. You can be as curious and arrogant as you want to be. The average human is not murdering someone to achieve immortality and I don't know why you think the average person could do it anyway.

  We can only assume that after creating horcrux, Voldemort hoarded the knowledge not wanting to share the gift of immortality,

Why would we assume this when we know Dumbledore removed he books from the library and Hermione summoned the books after he died?
