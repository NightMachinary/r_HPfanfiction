Oh yeah. The timeline about Voldemort's horcruxes is unfortunately not clear but I think you're right. I re-read the chapter about the conversation between Slughorn and Tom before answering you. And in it, Tom asked how to make a horcrux, about what spell to use so I just assumed he went to Slughorn to learn about the process. But Tom was cunning and maybe concealed what he wanted to know (the number of horcruxes he wanted to make) presenting it as a theory question when he graciously accepted not being given the spell. So I think you might be right. But I still doubt that a Hogwarts book would contain the incantation. Personally I reckon that Tom reverse-engineered the spell, but I could accept being wrong
