Just a little quibble... I think that Slughorn didn't provide him with the information on how to create a horocrux... Riddle had already created one at that point with Moaning Myrtle and the diary... or possibly the ring and his father and grandparents... what he wanted to know was if it was possible to create more than one horocrux... that was the horror that Slughorn was trying to hide when he obscured his memory.

edited for clarity.
