Yes we can assume! No it is said that Voldemort was planning to make a seventh horcrux with Harry's murder, so the piece of soul was ready to be transferred. But when the spell rebounded and destroyed Voldemort's body, his soul departed as a wraith while the little piece he had planned to split latched onto Harry. This is like a magnet effet for the soul. The soul can't just wander, it has to be tethered. That's why, to me, possession is not something unique to Voldemort, proving that he kept his magic. To me it's an ability born of natural necessity for a wraith or a soul to be bound to something. If it's not bound to something then in a finite amount of time it simply ceases to exist and joins the Great Beyond. That's why possession is possible and even vital for a wraith.

I'm not saying it's not a magical ability I'm saying it's not something you are born with, it's something that can only exist out of necessity. It's a magical ability of a wraith not of Voldemort! Muggles can't create horcrux so they don't have the option to become a wraith (which is different to a ghost). So there is nothing that ties them to life. Their soul just fades away. While Voldemort couldn't die, so his soul was forced to exist without a body, which is not natural! But nature finds a way and souls that can't cross over have to have the ability to latch onto a living thing.

The only person Voldemort ever possessed was Harry and it was only because he could use his horcrux to tie himself to Harry's consciousness. It's not an ability of his. When he has a body, he stays in his body.

Moreover onto the horcruxes. Dumbledore didn't do it because of the Hallows. He didn't need one if he could unite them. The same goes with Grindelwald. Then Dumbledore reformed, leaving his ambitions and quest of power behind, feeling content of living a normal lifespan (as proved in Book 6 when he doesn't fight death). Grindelwald relied on uniting the Hallows, and being the owner of the Elder Wand didn't fear dying in the least so never really looked at the other options. Now onto Regulus Black, he was never described as arrogant but we know he had doubts long before finding the horcrux in the cave, if not he wouldn't have investigated the cave in the first place. Maybe he found the process revolting but I think it was more about seeing the effects it had on Voldemort and how he was a megalomaniac that should be put down (thus destroying the horcruxes was important). Now I'm convinced that if the process of making horcruxes was made public, then a lot of people would attempt it. Just look at us muggles that kill each other for essentially nothing and tell me that wizard wouldn't do the same for promise of immortality. The book in Hogwarts library probably didn't explain the process and just explained that « A horcrux is an object used to bound one's soul into the plane of the living thus making the owner invulnerable to the effects of death ». That's probably why he had to ask Slughorn about clarifications. It's Slughorn who tells him how to split his soul, by committing murder. He doesn't tell him the incantation but Tom is smart so he finds it on his own. The Slytherins (most of those portrayed in the books) have no qualms killing if it serves their interests, and if surmounting death isn't the definition of ambition, I don't know what is. The Ravenclaws (very few) would do it, seeing it as another academic experiment. Does it really allow you to evade death? Does it affect one's magic? Can you feel it? Does it prevent you from aging or dying of old age? I'm sure some Ravenclaws have no qualms about what they study as long as it's magic, and present a challenge. And as I mentioned the arrogant Gryffindor who want to duel everyone and make themselves a place at the top via fighting --- who wouldn't stand being defeated and would take steps to ensure they wouldn't.

We can only assume that after creating horcrux, Voldemort hoarded the knowledge not wanting to share the gift of immortality, and not wanting his enemy to stumble upon it. He wanted people to believe that he was naturally so powerful that he had mastered immortality. (He refuses to tell Malefoy in the graveyard how he was able to survive, just that he should have known better than to doubt his master). Pettigrew would have made one out of cowardice and fear. Lucius because of his survival instinct.
