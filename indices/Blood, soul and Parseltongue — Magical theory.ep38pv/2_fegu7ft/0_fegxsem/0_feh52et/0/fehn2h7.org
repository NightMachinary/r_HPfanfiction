I didn't think you had to murder an "innocent" to make a Horcrux. I thought the whole creation point was JUST the "cold blooded murder" itself, regardless of the target. And therefore you could create a Horcrux by cold blooded murdering a locked up serial killer or a pedophile, for example. I didn't think it was so specific to require an "innocent person." The target doesn't matter, the act itself does.
