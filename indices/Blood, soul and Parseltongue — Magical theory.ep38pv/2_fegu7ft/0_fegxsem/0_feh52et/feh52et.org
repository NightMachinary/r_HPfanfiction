Because he was weak. "I lost my powers" he said, but I already said he couldn't wave a wand. Regardless, possession is a magical ability only those with magic can do.

It was available in the Hogwarts library until Dumbledore became headmaster. Dumbledore himself was a daring and arrogant Gryffindor. Regulus Black, who was probably a lot like Malfoy and McLaggen, knew of it and was disgusted. Hell, Salazar and Grindelwald, who was experimenting on his peers, didn't do it.

It's pretty difficult to murder someone, especially an innocent. School aged children who aren't psychopaths aren't likely to do that.
