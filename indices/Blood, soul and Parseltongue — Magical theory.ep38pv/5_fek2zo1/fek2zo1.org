Well, here's what we know:

1. being a parselmouth is a talent that resides to the soul (or mind)

2. It is passed down through familial connections.

Blood has no real relation, because it's used more as a phrase than any sort of accurate statement. Blood-relatives, yes, but not literal blood, otherwise blood-brothers or people who have a transfusion from a parselmouth would suddenly be able to talk to snakes.

All this leads me to theorize something which may seem disconnected at first - having a child is somewhat like making a Horcrux. Perhaps the exact opposite in spirit, but very similar nonetheless. We know people have souls, and the souls have to come from somewhere - based on the fact that the Parseltongue is a soul-based talent, it stands to reason that a child's soul is in fact built from the souls of its parents, which explains why magic passes on through families, how Harry's patronus could be his father's animagus form despite not knowing anything about that and how there are rare magical talents like metamorphmagism and parseltongue, among possible others.
