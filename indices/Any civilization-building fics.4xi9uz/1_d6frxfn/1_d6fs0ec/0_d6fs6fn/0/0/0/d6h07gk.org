The story is complete in that it ends. Spoiler: [[/spoiler][Magic loses against muggles and only a handful of magicals escape. The plot (as in, the conflict between the two sides) is over and most character arcs terminate in a very definite way.]]

I never read the sequel - the author also says that it's not that good, iirc - and I felt the story was complete on its own after I finished it.
