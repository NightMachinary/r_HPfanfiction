It depends, do you want more the social side or the 'science' (use of magic) side? It might be worth looking through these threads: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xe42j/request_looking_for_fics_with_a_magical_exodus/][exodus fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4r5eee/lf_harry_potter_survivor/][survivor fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4t7lac/lf_fics_where_harry_has_a_space_ship_cause_why_not/][space ship fics]]

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/258048][The Ark and the Desert]] is about magical society colonizing a planet. A group of students uses a defective portkey in both [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire series]] (link to the series rather then just first fic) and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4014733][The ever-changing tide]] Temeraire and Naruto crossovers respectively, forcing them to build a community from the ground up. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/][Xerosis]] is a very well known example. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2320601/1/Under-Siege][Under Siege]] Hogwarts is locked down, and are forced to build a community. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3450026][The Wizard Beyond The Walls]] fits a little bit? It is abandoned before the heavy duty community building though. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3999286][FeS2]] was inspired by Xerosis and has a similar storyline but they take over a hidden world rather then the moon. If you are looking to branch out... In a circular sort of 'inspired by' cascade, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724291/1/Stand-Against-the-Moon][Stand Against the Moon]] by the author of Xerosis came about from FeS2, and has Harry as the leader of the non-human magicals in which they rebel. It has the same themes, but society is much more established.

[[/u/viol8er]] aka Cole Pascal's story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622535/1/][A Trek to the Stars: The Potter Files]] also has Harry interacting with an established magical society on a distant planet, and causing some major changes. He comes in later, but it goes into detail, so may be worth a go.

In Esama's Tumbling HP Crossovers [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3492878][Chapter 2: Because Why Not]] Harry ends up alone on an asteroid and has to terraform it, which is similar I guess? Likewise, in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3493007][Chapter 5: Forest Spirit]] Harry ends up creating a seemingly sentient forest on a distant planet. Harry and fellow student build a sort of society in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346][D.S.S. Requirement]].

There are a couple of Pitch Black crossovers which have Harry and others trying to survive on Hades before the crash. For example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5494295/1/Alpha-and-Omega][Alpha and Omega]], but it is both abandoned and way too short. Almost all of those stories are slash (and often pretty explicit) and most Harry is alone so if you are after social building it isn't what you want.
