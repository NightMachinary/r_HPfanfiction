Nice start to your story!

For the sentence: "'Are you sure?' insisted the loquacious Gryffindor" -- one doesn't generally insist when asking a question. And try to avoid the trap of referring to your character as something other than their name or pronoun. "Loquacious Gryffindor" is really over the top. Also, when two people are talking, the reader can generally tell from context who said what.
