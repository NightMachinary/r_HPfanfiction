I guess my headcanon was always that those traps were intentionally set to be passable for the trio because Dumbledore wanted to test Harry and also wanted to give him the opportunity to come face to face with Voldemort, knowing that Voldemort could not do anything to Harry. The witches and wizards that came up with those shitty traps were the same ones that performed extraordinary magic when they were protecting Hogwarts from the Death Eaters' invasion.

Realistically, I think that being the first book, JK didn't have yet a clear idea of how powerful she wants to make the magic and she also wrote that as a children's book. When I first read the book at 11, I thought the traps were pretty cool.
