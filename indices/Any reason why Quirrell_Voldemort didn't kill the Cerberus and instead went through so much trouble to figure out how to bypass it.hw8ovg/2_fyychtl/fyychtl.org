Yes and no. If Dumbledore was smart he had the traps built back to front. In other words, he prepped the mirror room, he then went and got Snape and he did the potion puzzle. Then Quirrell was brought in for the troll, then Mcgonagall for the chess set, flitwick with the keys, and then sprout for the Devil's Snare and finally Hagrid with fluffy. Basically Dumbledore would be the only one who knew all the traps and would have to get threw them to install the mirror with the stone.

If Dumbledore was smart he would illusion a long hallway so none of the other teachers would know how many rooms made up the trap as they were brought in to do their piece. Of course, if he was really smart none of the solutions for the traps would be down there in the trap. Eg all the potions were draught of living death, correct key not in the room, no chess game played just stone attackers, Devil's Snare as well as a plant that gets violent with sunlight. Of course, if he did that we wouldn't have three first years saving the day.

If Dumbledore did the setup like I described above then Quirrell/Voldemort would not know how many challenges were there nor how difficult they would be. If he kills Fluffy right off the bat and then hits a challenge he can't get through then he's lost the element of surprise and informed Dumbledore that Voldemort is in the school. By using stealth to try to get through the challenges he keeps that knowledge that Voldemort is there.
