Here are a couple you might try, both explicit. They're ship fics, so if you're looking for gay/bi Harry + plotty fic, these might not be for you. But they're good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/69622][Sadness of Eros]] by loupgarou1750 (Harry/Snape, Harry/Ginny) This posits Harry as more gay than bi, basically lying to himself and getting his needs met on the side. It starts with a glory hole scene, so heads-up for graphic description of dicks. Harry's married, which adds to his self-denial, and because he can't be honest with himself, he behaves badly to both Ginny and Snape. The fic is raw and often very funny, and it's a blunt look at the potential consequences of trying to suppress one's sexual identity. The ending is a little unsatisfying, as it was written to a deadline, but the fic makes it worthwhile anyway.

(Harry/Percy, Harry/Ron/Hermione) This fic pulls off a neat trick of starting in Harry's POV and going backwards in time, then switching to Percy's POV and going forwards to the original starting point and just beyond. It was written before the last book, so its reference to character deaths and other details aren't entirely canon-compliant. It's harsh and a bit poignant, and Harry's more worn-down and disillusioned than we see in canon. Most of the fic takes place in Egypt, where Harry and Percy both work for the goblins, and it's very hot and gritty and erotic and slightly kinky.

Neither of these fics is sentimental about sex, but they do make the emotional connections matter.

Re: "everyone is gay" - I don't consider it obnoxious - there are a lot worse things in fic than that, IMO - but it doesn't really work for me. However, I've heard other LGBT readers talk about it, and they /know/ it's fantasy, but it's such a relief to imagine a world in which we're not merely visible, we're everywhere and LGBT romance is as commonplace as straight people in the real world. It's self-indulgent, sure, but fanfic is the very definition of escapist pleasure, so it seems a decent playground in which to re-imagine an already fictional universe.
