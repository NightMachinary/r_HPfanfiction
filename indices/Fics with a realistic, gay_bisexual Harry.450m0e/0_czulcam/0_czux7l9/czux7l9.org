Huh, that's interesting. Did I get downvoted because someone here doesn't like the idea of gay/bi Harry, or because they don't like the fics? If it's the latter, I'd still be curious to know what they thought of the stories, since it's hard to predict what other readers consider "realistic."

If it's just because of the pairings, never mind, because ship hate never leads anywhere good.
