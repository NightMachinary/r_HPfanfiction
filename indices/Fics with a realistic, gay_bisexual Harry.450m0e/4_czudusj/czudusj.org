Only two stories in my memory that fit your request and are good enough to be recommended:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/The Sacrifices Arc/]] (W^{T} : 3,075,741; Complete) (Harry\Draco);
- maybe also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance][/A Switched Chance/]] (116,174 WL, WiP) (genderbent!Harry) --- depending on your views on what can be considered “gay”. Here he [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdLawOfGenderBending][magically starts fancying boys]] after getting stuck in a girl's body.

Oh, and I'd recommend staying away from Harry\Voldemort stories, since all of them I've seen so far had terribly out-of-character portrayals.
