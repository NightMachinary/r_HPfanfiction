The fact that nobody believed Harry when he said Draco was a death eater was unbelievable. The only problem anyone had about it was Dracos age. Like Voldemort wasn't the guy he tried to kill a baby and a 14 year old. If I was Voldemort I would be recruiting as many Hogwarts students as possible. He clearly doesn't care about ages.

Not to mention Harry is right almost all the time, and Ron rides the I Hate Draco Malfoy train hard too, but this is where he draws the line???

All your points are true too. I have too not think about anything just to slightly believe the story.

Like Hermione couldn't pack a bunch a tins of baked beans at the very least? She remembered every single thing but non perishable foods??

This all sucks because I have been a die-hard fan for nearly a decade. I want it to be good and I want to love it sooo much. But I just can't like the last couple of books that much.
