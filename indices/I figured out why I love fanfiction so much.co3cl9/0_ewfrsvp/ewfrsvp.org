The last two books are quite bad. Dumbledore is either self-delusional or utterly stupid, the idiot ball is passed like a bong and required for the plot to work (no one believing in Death Eater Draco, Dumbledore not doing anything about it, Harry not taking action on his own), literally no one considers that France is less than 50 miles from the UK and you could make that trip within half an hour on a broom, nevermind apparation or simply taking a ferry or plane. Harry and Hermione forgot about Tesco, which had more stores in 1997 than there were Death Eaters around (the random store in Leeds or Norwich could not be watched due to DE manpower limitations). The Muggleborns are systematically deported and hunted by death squads, the Death Eaters get a slap on the wrist at best if we go by Malfoy's fate (judging by Scorpius, he got at most 7 years). But sure, all was well.

I respect writers who try to make the best out of that dumpster fire, but IMO a fic pretty much has to diverge before 6th year in order to not be limited by the crappy arcs set up by Rowling for the finale.
