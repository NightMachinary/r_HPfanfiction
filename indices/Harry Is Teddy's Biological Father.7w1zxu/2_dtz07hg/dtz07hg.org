I haven't really seen anything like this. I suppose [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5903680][Anything to Help]] by NidoranDuran /technically/ qualifies. Although, it's less interested in the family Intrigue of figuring out who the father is than it is in being a plotless smutfic using surrogacy as an excuse for Harry and Tonks to get it on. And by less interested, I mean it doesn't show up at all. Teddy isn't even mentioned really, I don't think. I mean by the end of it, you won't have any doubt about the father of Tonks's children, but like I said, it only technically qualifies.
