Thanks! And I agree with your assessment of Dumbledore. I struggle with fics that portray Dumbledore as a “bad guy” because I think it ignores the really difficult choices he made in his attempt at protecting the wizarding world and ensuring safe access to education for all. He had a long life and I certainly don't agree with all of his moves but the manipulative Dumbledore trope takes it too far.
