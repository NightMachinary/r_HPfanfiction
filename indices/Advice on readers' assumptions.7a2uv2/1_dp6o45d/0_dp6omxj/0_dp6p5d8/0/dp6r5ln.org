Yeah!

Like, don't get me wrong, I totally think Dumbledore is manipulative and I really do want people to feel that whether he's right or wrong is up for debate, you know? I don't feel there should necessarily be a very obviously "right" or "wrong" reading of his choices, given that he's struggling with a very complex series of events, and I want that narrative ambiguity to be present across all the characters.

I think that a lot of the time, even with dark!Harry fics, there's this idea that the reader has to agree with what the protagonists are doing and so you need to narratively justify their actions, but I wanted to explore something a little more complex with this and make it clear that there's no right or wrong answers, just difficult questions.

And given that some of my other characters are people like Severus Snape and Narcissa Malfoy, I guess it's just a surprise to me that the one character people seem to hate most is Dumbledore!
