Thanks so much, this was really helpful, genuinely!

I reply to reviews now and then, but I always try to keep stuff vague as I don't want it to come across as either me desperately wanting to please or, alternatively, me going like, "Oh, well I'm the author and I think this, therefore my word is law," because that would just come across as awfully obnoxious, you know?
