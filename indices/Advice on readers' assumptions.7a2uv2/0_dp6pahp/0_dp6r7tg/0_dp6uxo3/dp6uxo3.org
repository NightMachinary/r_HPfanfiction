I'm glad you found it helpful! And yes, you always want to take constructive criticism and not be high and mighty because that's definitely a turn off. But, there's a difference between "That's an interesting choice you made for Dumbledore's motivations for turning Harry into a frog." and "OMG that's so stupid! Manipulative!Dumbledore would never turn Harry into a frog! UR dum!" One invites conversation, one invites derision.
