Reader's assumptions are just that and not anything you have to pander to. You have a story you want to tell, so tell it. It sounds like you have a good idea for DD, so keep with it and don't feel like you have to change it because of a comment from someone. It's up to you if you want to respond via PMs, but I wouldn't. That would make it seem like you are chasing reviews or seeking approval, neither of which you should have to do.

Readers gonna read or not. It's up to them to trust you on the journey you're taking them on.
