I skip them, because the majority of the characters in the fic (canon inlcuded) ignore it too. Christ, in canon the hat practically warns them every single time and tells them to get along, and they ignore it. And things get progressively worse.

I interpret quite a few of the songs as the hat chastising everyone for not living up to the name of their house. You have the Slytherins who aren't very cunning, the Gryffindors who shun the actual brave in their house, the Ravenclaws who don't show it, and the hufflepuffs who shun people for the flimsiest of reasons.
