Same, and a lot of authors like to write a lot of pages of Pre-Hogwart somehow, it always kills me to see stories with 100-200k Words barely into the second week of the First Year.

I acknowledge that you can write relevant and cool pre-Hogwart Arc but at some point the story needs to start moving forward in its plot or it becomes less interesting and people tend to drop this kind of fictions.
