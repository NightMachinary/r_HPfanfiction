There's at least one story (I don't remember which) where the Sorting Hat's song is basically a self-referential "Most authors either copy this bit verbatim from the books or do a bad job of making up a new song, so I don't blame you for skipping this bit".

It's the one time I remember /not/ skimming over the Sorting Hat song because it caught me so off-guard and it was genuinely funny.
