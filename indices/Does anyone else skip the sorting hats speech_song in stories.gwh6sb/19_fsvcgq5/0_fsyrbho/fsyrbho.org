Point of order, the word for "looks like Latin but is actually gibberish" is /dog/-latin.

Pig Latin is a specific argot - Away ullfay entencesay ofway igpay atinlay ookslay ikelay isthay*.

Otherwise, mostly agreed - I don't tend to care what the exact incantation is for a made-up spell, I care what the /effect/ is.

*translation: "A full sentence of pig latin looks like this".
