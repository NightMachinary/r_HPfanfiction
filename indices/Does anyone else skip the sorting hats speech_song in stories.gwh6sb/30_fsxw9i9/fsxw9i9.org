All the time. Legitimately unless the story mentions it afterwards because it is important for the story I won't read it. Hell, JK rowling only added the song when it was important if I remember correctly (First year to explain the houses, fifth year to beg the students to be united even though Voldemort was back) The only exception was year 4.
