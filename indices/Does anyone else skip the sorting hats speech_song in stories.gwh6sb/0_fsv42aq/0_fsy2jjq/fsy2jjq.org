Is there a reader of fanfiction which didn't read the books/see the films? I don't think so. So, why in the world there is this freaking need to repeat things which are in the books? Whenever I read McGonagal's speech on “There are four houses at Hogwarts ...” I start to scream, and the story is getting quite higher on my killing list.
