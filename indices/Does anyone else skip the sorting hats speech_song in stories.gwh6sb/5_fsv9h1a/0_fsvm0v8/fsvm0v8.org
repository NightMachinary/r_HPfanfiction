This is why I make my canon scenes in italics, surrounded by ~ symbols, so anyone can skip it if they remember, and read the scene if they don't.

That said, I have yet to publish a fic that copied a part of the canon, I think.

I have yet to publish a fic in general except that one fic and 2 one-shots.
