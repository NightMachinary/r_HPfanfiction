What I really really love, but is very hard to find, are things that look like the same but are subtly different.

It can be just a few details that will make a huge difference latter on. For example with the sorting ceremony, the sorting Hat take 10 seconds with Draco (instead of the decision being immediate), or with Neville (instead of taking a long long time).

Harry, even if he ends up in Gryffindor isn't so against Slytherin in his conversation with the Sorting hat. Or Percy, and the twins ignoring Harry.

Things you could miss if you're just skimming, because on appearance it's just like the books, but if you read it, you sees it.
