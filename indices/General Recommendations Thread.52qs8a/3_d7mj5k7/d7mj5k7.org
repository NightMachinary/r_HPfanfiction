Alright, so there is a new fic (only two chapters at the moment, but it was published Aug 25th) that I think has great potential, though there are a couple things at the start of chapter two that make me worry /slightly/. It's an HP/Elder Scrolls crossover called linkffn(Knowledge Comes at a Price by slayst). The premise is that [[/spoiler][Lily, using a bunch of outdated magical theories and a bunch of her blood, was able to reach out to Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora (Elder Scrolls C'thulhu, basically) and sold him her soul to save Harry. In front of the Mirror of Erised at Christmastime, Harry has caught Herma-Mora's attention because the Mirror is pimpin', and essentially becomes Mora's agent on Earth, finding knowledge that Lily didn't have, and is able to trade favors/task in for knowledge or favors of his own]]. Really, the only worry I have is in the early parts of chapter two, where it talks a little about wandless Harry Potter magic (though it doesn't really make it seem easy) because of a mention of magical cores, though there isn't enough to tell whether it is a mana-pool magical core, or just the ability to do magic. Even though it's only two chapters, better than all other HP/TES crossovers.
