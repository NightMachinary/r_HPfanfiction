I wonder how this would work.

My best idea for the story line to somewhat makes sense, as we cannot use "magic" as an explanation, and I like the idea of staying somewhat in the constraints of the Harry Potter world as laid out in the books.

- The kid in question is a pueblood.
- The parents are pretty proud of it, but not quite Black level proud.
- There is an aunt or uncle who likes the kid well enough but does not interfere with the parents "parenting".
- Still, this aunt convinces the parents the kid would be better off to go to a muggle school, she will even pay for it. And, hey, it's a boarding school, so you won't have to worry about having to deal with the child for most of the year.
- Thus the letter from the muggle school.
- From there on you have a fish out of water/ coming of age story where a young person slowly not only learns about or world from their very specific view of reality, but also about their own worth.
