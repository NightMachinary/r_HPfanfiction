Maybe shield goes around secretly recruiting squibs. They can get sorted into Stark House with Gemma Simmons and Leopold Fitz whom they befriend after fighting a rogue janitorial robot. The other three houses being Carter House, Souza House, and Mallick House.

Davious awoke much too early to a loud knocking on his bedroom door.

"Get up! It's time to make breakfast for everyone. If you laze about you'll never hold down a job. You need to learn or you'll die in the street."

It hadn't always been this way. Once Davious Greengrass had been a happy child with a loving mother and father. But over the years as his accidental magic failed to appear relations grew strained. And when his eleventh birthday came and went with no Hogwarts letters his life as he knew it was over. A squib was destined for a life of nothing but servitude, and his parents felt it was their duty to prepare him for it. He was treated little more than a house elf by them now.

Davious grudginly left his room and started making breakfast on the enchanted stove. By now he could make a passing example of a full English. It could be worse he guessed, at least they let him eat a portion.

After he had finished cooking the meal and set it out on the table he went to check if any mail had been dropped off that morning. He thought he had heard an owl flying away earlier.

Sure enough there was one letter. But it was made of a strange thin smooth paper, with a different feel to the parchment he was familiar with. And it was addressed to him.

He opened the letter and read it
