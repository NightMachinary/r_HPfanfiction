Something about Harry recovering, away from the magical world, from having to walk up to his parents' murderer and letting himself be killed, all because information was hidden from him until the last possible moment. Because that's not something you can just shrug off. There should be long term psychological consequences for it.

As an author put it, "/The ultimate problem was that the first few books imply that the overall story would be about a boy growing up to be a hero, and what we ultimately got was the story about a patsy who was manipulated into fulfilling someone else's overly complicated scheme to preserve the status quo of a society that didn't deserve salvation./"
