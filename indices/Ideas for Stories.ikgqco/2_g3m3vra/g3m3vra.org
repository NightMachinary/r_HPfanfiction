Technically not all Harry-Centric but should be easy enough to make them so:

- The Basilisk is dead when Diary Riddles re-opens the Chamber.
- Lupin isn't on the train during 3rd year, resulting in a significant number of students being Kissed
- Due to Crouch overpowering his goblet confundus the same name is picked for all 3/4 schools.
- Someone in Hogwarts gets hold of the Diary during the Philosopher's Stone year
- Harry finds Luna locked in a cupboard while he is being shunned for whatever reason and befriends her
- The first person Harry meets in Diagon is Fudge, who is rather baffled by oversized rags ands starts looking into it.
- Harry discovers the RoR during the Heir of Slytherin incident and takes to spending an inordinate amount of time there. One of the older quidditch players notice he's never around anymore and try to find out where he went.
