The war took a different turn, Grindelwald is released from prison and has an unsteady alliance with Voldemort. He is the one that sees the prophecy of Harry with his own Seer abilities and thus tells Voldemort it's him. In an attempt to change destiny, Voldemort orders Grindelwald to destroy the Potter family whilst Neville is dealt with by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. In turn, both of them are left orphans and both of the most powerful Dark Wizards alive died that night.

Humbled by such events and the weight of Grindelwald's memory leaving him, Dumbledore decides to run for Minister for Magic. In turn, the person that becomes the new Headmaster of Hogwarts is someone no one would have guessed, Gilderoy Lockheart.
