Hi!\\
You can explore an idea where instead of Tom Riddle becoming a Dark Lord, he becomes a politician.

This would mean that Harry's parents would still be alive, Sirius doesn't go to jail and so many other things would change!

You can make it Harry centric of course and create circumstances where Tom and he would meet or something and the former would use the latter in his political plots and stuff. IDK.

And as a huge Tomarry fan, I would throughly ship it. Or drarry, but those two are just my favourites :)
