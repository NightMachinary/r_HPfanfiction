I like single point of divergence type of stories. I would be very happy if you wrote something like these:

- Ginny doesn't steal Tom Riddle's diary back. (Maybe the scene where she sees the diary on Valentine's day never takes place.) As a result, Harry delves deeper and deeper into the diary, and Tom becomes a mentor-like figure to him. During the summer holiday, Harry has nothing else to do except to write to Tom, and becomes corrupted.
- At the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry escapes with Sirius. They both empty their Gringotts vaults and begin a new life as immensely wealthy fugitives.
- After the Triwizard Cup has taken Harry to Little Hangleton (Cedric convinces him to take the Cup alone), he grabs it again in confusion, and returns to Hogwarts before anything happens. Voldemort it pissed and decides to use the blood of a random other enemy of his, and returns without anyone learning about it. Also, Crouch Junior continues masquerading as Moody.
