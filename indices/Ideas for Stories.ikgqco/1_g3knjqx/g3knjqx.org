How about a Harry/Katie fic which starts out with cute friendship bonding over being the two youngest and newest team members. They certainly would have spent more than enough time together and don't really fit the same social circle as the rest of the team (most of whom are a year above them +Wood). Perhaps have Katie act as anchor for Harry since she's the one friend who isn't involved in all the crazy shit the trio gets up to.

Or how about Harry accidentally asking Padma instead of Parvati to the Yule Ball (as in "Parv - Oh, hi Padma.", not as in he does not realise his mistake until the ball). Who knows about Harry's infuriation with Cho and therefore does not expect it to be a date. However, due to non-existent expectations, they actually have more fun than expected and it turns into a date.
