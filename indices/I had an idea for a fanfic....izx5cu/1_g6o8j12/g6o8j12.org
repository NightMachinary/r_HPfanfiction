Clearly things did not go according to plan at the rebirthing ritual.

This prompt raises an interesting question though. If wand movements are an important component to casting, surely having the wand tip move in a 100 degree vertical arc as Tom's hand is guided so that the wand is facing Tom's own face... what kind of spell effect occurs?
