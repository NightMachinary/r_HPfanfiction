Completed fic, yes. There's sequel-hooks, but the main plot is completed.

Harry/Natasha, no. I won't spoil who he /does/ end up with.

Harry (and the Wizarding World at large) being there changes the plot quite a bit, though I'm trying not to spoil too much.\\
I will say that not every change is "Harry fixes things" - the crossover creates some new problems as well.
