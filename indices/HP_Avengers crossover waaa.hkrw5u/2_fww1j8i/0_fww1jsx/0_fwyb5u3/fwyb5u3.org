Before I commit myself to such a long fic, I have questions.

Is it complete?

Is Harry paired with Natasha? (Like every non-slash avengers fic seems to pair them and it gets a bit old tbh.)

Does Harry being there actually change the plot at all? I swear I cannot read one more fic where the same verbatim discussions are taken directly from the movies at every applicable scene.
