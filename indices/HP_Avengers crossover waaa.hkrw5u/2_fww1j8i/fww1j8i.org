Not /quite/ the same plot - Harry buys a building in New York and only really enters SHIELD's radar once the Chitauri show up, at which point he readily agrees to join up - but Heroes Assemble is probably my favourite HP/MCU crossover for being well-written and not having Harry solve literally every problem. linkffn(12307781)
