  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

#+begin_quote
  When Regulus volunteers Kreacher for Lord Voldemort's mysterious task, what he expects to be a vaulting honour crushes his world at its very foundation. Throwing himself into a whirlwind of research, he learns of the dark secret that changes the course of his life in more drastic ways than he ever could have imagined. Faced with death if he leaves, or death of self if he stays, Regulus makes a choice that shapes events to come, over a decade later.

  What if Regulus Black, and not Severus Snape, ended up being the turncoat Potions Master of Hogwarts? A not!fic written in bullet points, ignoring the Deathly Hallows entirely because they annoy me.

#+begin_quote
  Regulus agrees to be a spy for the Order of the Phoenix shortly before Voldemort's downfall. Thirteen years later, he's a reluctant potions master under the watchful eye of Albus Dumbledore, just trying to get through his days without cursing the meddling Headmaster. Now Regulus's estranged brother has escaped from Azkaban, and Dumbledore has had the grand idea to invite Sirius's pet werewolf to teach at the school.
