Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina, linkffn(8895954), Regulus survives in the cave, ends up on Marius Black's doorstep, and joins the war effort, aided by an actual Deus ex Machina that drives the beginning of the plot. Complete with a sequel that just started, but very much a self-contained narrative.
