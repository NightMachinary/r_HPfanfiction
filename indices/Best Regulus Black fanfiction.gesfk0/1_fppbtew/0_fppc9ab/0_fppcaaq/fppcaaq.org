  When Harry ran away from the Dursleys after blowing up Aunt Marge he never got on the Knight Bus or to Diagon Alley. Instead he found himself in 12 Grimmauld Place with Sirius and Regulus Black and boy do they have something to say about how his life looked up until now. Contains manipulative!Dumbledore.

  Gryffindor isn't what Slytherin sees in it, and the reverse is even more true. The Potters don't know they look different depending on where you're standing, the Blacks know precisely how they come across and like it that way, and Severus Snape isn't quite who anyone thinks he is---least of all himself.Britain, Spring of 1980. No one cares what's fair when their people are on the line, and truth would be subjective even if everyone told it. Brute-force bloody battles are how Gryffs (and Lestranges) think; when a sane Slytherin wants power it's all smoke and smiles, masks and mirrors. Roll up your sleeves, slip into your cloak, and slap that dagger on your belt. This is war, people---pick a side! ...What the hell. Pick three.Ch. 1: Hogwarts has a history, Narcissa has a party, Rodolphus shares a fun craft activity with a friend, and Severus is left with the body a bit of a dilemma. He thinks all the mysteries he's read will help him.Aha. Ha. Ha....Ch. 72: July 31, 11:45 pm:Potter vs Snape, round 993,234,546,878. Snape vs Potter, round 1.  Love this fic, hate it, or be totally confused: I solemnly swear that this is not a ride you've been on before.

  'I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--?' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all?'

  At the height of his power, Lord Voldemort employed another failsafe next to the horcruxes: his most loyal followers would be able to retrieve them and resurrect him with their help. As a result, Barty Crouch Jr. breaks his father's mind control early and goes off to seek his master.While he is unsuccessful in locating him, he manages to find surprising but welcome allies in the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather. With the support of the Ancient and Noble House of Black on his side, Barty needs to use all his cunning and guile to navigate the world of politics and Dark Arts. And so, four years after their first meeting, a different Harry Potter will arrive at Hogwarts: one who wants nothing more than to bring Lord Voldemort back and who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.
