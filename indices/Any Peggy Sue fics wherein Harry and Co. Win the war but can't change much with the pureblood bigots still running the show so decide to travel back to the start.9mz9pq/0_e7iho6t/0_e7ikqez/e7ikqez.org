Not OP, but is there one where the time travelers are just Harry/Ron/Hermione? I've read a bunch where it's just Harry, and Backwards with Purpose is Harry/Ron/Ginny, and I even saw one that was Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny/Neville/Luna, but for some reason just the trio seems rather rare.

Preferably no bashing, don't care one way or another about romance/shipping.
