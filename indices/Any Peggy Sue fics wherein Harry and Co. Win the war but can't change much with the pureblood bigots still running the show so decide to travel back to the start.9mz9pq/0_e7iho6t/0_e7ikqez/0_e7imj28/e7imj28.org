There is the "Bonds of Time" series (Harry and Ginny), but I would not recommend it despite being a million words long and decent from the technical side. And there are two good reasons. The Third "book" (years 5-X) is abandoned and you would, therefore, invest a lot of time in a series with no payoff. And even worse (and the main reason I hate it) is that the trainwreck that happens before the abandonment.

Basically, Hermione goes on her first date with Ron, gets attacked by Dementors and comes home to her lifeless parents. That is the set-up for the romance. It's one of the few cases where I say that Ron/Hermione was done even worse than by Rowling.

Also, the story has the official subtitle "Age of Consent", so there's that as well.
