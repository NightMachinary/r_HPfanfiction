Do you mind bashing? Because a lot of time travel fics involve either bashing or the time travellers shipping the kids (getting Ron and Hermione together is a big theme in Harry/Ginny time-travel, alternatively Ron/Luna).

Whom should your time travelling group include? Because the larger the group the fewer stories remain in the running.
