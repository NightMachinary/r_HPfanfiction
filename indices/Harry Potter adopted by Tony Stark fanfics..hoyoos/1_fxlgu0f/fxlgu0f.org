Mmm, here's one where Harry is raised as his younger brother (is actually Tony's nephew) - linkffn(12276084)

Note that it isn't in chronological order (there is an option to read it that way, however) and the punctuation is fucking strange. But it's good. Really, really good. If you want to read it in chrono order without hopping around a lot, [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ymJLwkDtVMHxHaLngh6ZvIi5ethz65SR?usp=sharing][here is a copy of the fic in both epub and docx]]. It also has the punctuation and odd grammar/homophone/etc mistakes corrected. Because I'm anal, apparently (it started off as just putting it in order, I swear!)
