I have a few! Some are better than others, hope you like them. The last one is the other way around, but I loved it!

The Stark Truth, [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/misteeirene/pseuds/misteeirene][misteeirene]], I'll give it 3/5

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2549801/chapters/5668883]]

#+begin_quote
  ^{Summer after 4th year Harry learns that James isn't exactly is father and Lily isn't his mother. Will his newly discovered family be able to help him recover from his violent, abusive childhood? Will he be able to trust again enough to find love?}

Jade Stark, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2118854/Children-of-Darkness][Children of Darkness]], Honestly can't remember...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7388508/1/Jade-Stark]]

#+begin_quote
  ^{Lily goes to America, and comes back pregnant. How will being someone else's daughter change the HP universe for Jade? And also, who were the real parents of the late Lily Potter? will include some things from the comics.}

3 Broken Hearts, [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/featheredschist/pseuds/featheredschist][featheredschist]], 3/5

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/668369?view_full_work=true]]

#+begin_quote
  ^{In a strange twist of fate, Harry ends up the adopted son of two of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Some folks of course, don't like this, wanting the Boy Who Lived to remain the ignorant bastion of light they need him to be. Harry's adoptive fathers want him to have all they never did.}\\
  ^{AU - Dark fic! Dumbles bashing (He is not a nice character in this story, fair warning}. Character listing is woefully incomplete, but most of the HP-verse folks will appear, and a goodly chunk of the Avengers will appear (comics verse).)

Lokijarson (Matronymic), [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/orphan_account/pseuds/orphan_account][orphan_account]], 4/5

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20218381]]

#+begin_quote
  ^{Harry's head hurts and his body aches and his thoughts and emotions are whirling and this whole evening has been even crazier than the usual end of year disaster he stumbles his way into. Voldemort resurrected and now this - a strange, non-human magic user claiming to be his mother?!}

  ^{“You can't be my mother - that's not biologically possible, is it? You're a man! And if you're my mother, who was my father? And I'm still not sure I believe you!”}

  ^{Loki laughs again; it sounds sad and resigned.}

  ^{“You have many questions, Hávarðr, and I will answer them for you in time.”}

^{This one is the other way around, but I loved it and want to share. 5/5}

My Dad, the Boy (*Man) Who Lives, by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TJB084117/pseuds/TJB084117][TJB084117]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13159671/chapters/30097362]]

#+begin_quote
  ^{Crazy idea. What if Harry was Tony's dad?}\\
  ^{Not in a million years would Harry thought that by letting Anthony be held for a moment by a woman whom just lost her baby, would let the press go wild.}\\
  ^{In under an hour, the whole city knew about his baby. And under a couple of hours so did the whole United States of America. And soon the whole world would know. The worst thing was that they thought Anthony was the Stark heir.}
