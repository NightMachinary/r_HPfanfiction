Just about any way it's possible...

Phone: browser app (using mobile ff.net with the reverse colors) Google Play Books (downloadable formats from AO3) Aldiko reader app (pdf downloads)

Tablet (all of the above)

Kindle (downloadable formats, transferred to Amazon library)

Desktop browser

I think the only way I don't read fic is audiobook or printed on paper. There are enough books to read in my house, I can't afford the shelf space to start printing fic!
