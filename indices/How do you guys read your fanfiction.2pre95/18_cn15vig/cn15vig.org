Wait for good recommendations, or read the first few thousand words in a web browser. Then download, and it sits on my computer in a folder until I (maybe once monthly) transport to my Kindle.

But I still have a dearth of fics I haven't read yet, including ones I know are good. So I can afford to wait around.
