I create PDFs of fics and use the app Voxdox (on Android) to convert them to audio files, and then listen to them at work, at the gym, when I drive or anywhere else that I'd normally be listening to music. The app actually works really really well. It's great to be able to "read" fics on the go.

I do read faster than that app speaks, but the app displays the text and turns the page in sync with the speech, so if I get a chance to actually sit and read, I can just pause the sound and read a few pages, and turn the audio on when I can't read anymore.

The app has a free trial of about 400 pages, but the lifetime subscription (It's like $5-$15 depending on what level of subscription you buy) allows up to 5000 pages per month.

If anybody wants to hear how it sounds I could convert a one shot to an audio file and sent it to anybody interested.

I'm currently listening to A Stranger in and Unholy Land. It's roughly 470K words which works out to about 856 pages in the app.

Edit: It isn't perfect. It does contractions really poorly, and usually spells them out. That being said the voice is really smooth and flows extraordinarily well. It even pronounces a lot of the spells decently, although the inflection is sometimes wrong. If you have high standards, it might not suit your needs, but I was really impressed.

Theres also several different male and female voices with both US and UK English. It also does translation, but I can't speak to the accuracy of the translation.

It only takes maybe 10-30 seconds to translate each page, so you can read as you download it.

Here's a link to download an audio sample I created with the app.
