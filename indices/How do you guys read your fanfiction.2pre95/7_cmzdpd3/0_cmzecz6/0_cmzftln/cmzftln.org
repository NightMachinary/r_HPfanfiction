It isn't perfect. It does contractions really poorly, and usually spells them out. That being said the voice is really smooth and flows extraordinarily well. It even pronounces a lot of the spells decently, although the inflection is sometimes wrong. If you have high standards, it might not suit your needs, but I was really impressed.

Theres also several different male and female voices with both US and UK English. It also does translation, but I can't speak to the accuracy of the translation.

It only takes maybe 10-30 seconds to translate each page, so you can read as you download it.

I'll upload an audio sample in a bit.
