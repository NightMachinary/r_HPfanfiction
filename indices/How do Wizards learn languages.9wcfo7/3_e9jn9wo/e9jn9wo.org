Probably the same way they manage learning /anything/ to competency with only 2-4 hours a week of each class. There are obviously memory enhancing potions or charms or /something/ that's used to improve the rate at which the children learn. If they didn't, there just wouldn't be enough time for them to cover the important things, and the grand majority of /all/ subjects would be self-study rather than actually being taught.
