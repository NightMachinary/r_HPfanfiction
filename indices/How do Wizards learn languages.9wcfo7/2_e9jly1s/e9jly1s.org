I think its interesting to set a foundation for whats possible without any aid of magic - without even having magic.

Polyglots, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNmf-G81Irs][as this link shows in a TED talk]], are a reality. There are people out there that speak dozens of languages fluently. Fun fact: Once you get into the swing of learning languages, any average human could reach ~10 languages easily. Its like a muscle you train.

So using that as our baseline, its possible that Dumbledore speaks all those languages because he learned them. Given that he is described as a genius, he may even had an easy time doing so.

Barty Crouch is, of course, a different matter. For a first, the top 100 most spoken languages on the planet are getting quite /obscure/ once you reach around the 50 mark (inlcuding several types of Italian, for example). We can also add to his repertoire that he probably speaks languages like Mermish. My headcanon for him always was that he is a magical polyglot. Like some people are parsemouths, metamorphs or what have you, he is a magical polyglot. I added this because for me it explained why nobody else seems to be fluent in several languages, making me think that it does indeed take a comparable amount of time to how long muggles take to learn a language.
