I like the idea that there are some people who are basically born with the ability to learn languages rapidly via magic. Essentially, it would be like "once they hear so much of it they're fluent."

And there have to be hundreds of magical languages, we know about Mermish, Troll, Gobbledegook, Giant (which probably has a lot of different dialects, and I suspect that Mermish does too since their appearance is so different based on where they live). So I always assumed that most of the languages that BCSr. knows are magical ones.
