Someone recommended Raindrops on Roses to me recently and I like it, but it doesn't really have much from Cursed Child in it (I think it was written beforehand, actually). It is, however, what I would have wanted /instead/ of Cursed Child; Albus, Rose, and Scorpius going about their lives at Hogwarts rather than only a few pages of Hogwarts before everything's taken over by complete wacky shit.

[Aside: I do think something interesting could be done with the characterizations from the first three of four pages of Cursed Child, which introduced the kids and then immediately leveled them up to fourth year. I can believe in an Albus who's oppressed by his parents' fame, though I still don't know why the hat would place him in Slytherin. Maybe he took his dad's words at the station too much to heart?]
