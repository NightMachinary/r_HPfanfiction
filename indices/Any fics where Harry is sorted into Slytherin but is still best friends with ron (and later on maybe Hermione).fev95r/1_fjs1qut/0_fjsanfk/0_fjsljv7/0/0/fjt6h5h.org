I have always seen Draco and Ron as two sides of the same coin. Both are prejudice and both are jealous. That is why I can't see Ron getting along with a Slytherin Harry. And you need to remember how he was raised. Imagine if you were an 11 year old and told that the guy you were friends with was a nazi. Would you stick around.
