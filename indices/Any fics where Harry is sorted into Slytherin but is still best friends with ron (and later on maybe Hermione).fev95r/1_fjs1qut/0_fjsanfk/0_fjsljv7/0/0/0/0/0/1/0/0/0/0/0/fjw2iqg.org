The concepts from the books are facts but the idea that Ron would reject Harry's friendship if he was a Slytherin is absolutely an opinion lmao. Even if he hates this house to death you can't know if he would have stayed with Harry or not, in your opinion he wouldn't but in my opinion he would. In my opinion he would be confused and would feel sorry for Harry but would never leave him, because he got to know him a little and he knows he's a good person.
