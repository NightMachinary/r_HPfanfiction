He wasn't told his friend was a nazi. Just a Slytherin. It doesn't automatically make Harry evil and this is not what Ron would think. And ofc he would stick with him, he knew Harry was nice. It doesn't matter if he was a Slytherin or not. And Ron is not as prejudice as Draco lmao. He wasn't raised to believe that all Slytherins are bad and there is literally no proof from the book that he even thought they all were. All we know is that he hated Malfoy and his "friends" because they literally bullied him for being poor and a "blood traitor".
