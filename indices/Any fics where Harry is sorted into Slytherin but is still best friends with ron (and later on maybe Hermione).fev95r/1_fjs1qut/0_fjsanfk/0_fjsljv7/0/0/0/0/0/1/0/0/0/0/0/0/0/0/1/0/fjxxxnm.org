Well, I am arguing because I do not like it when people ignore character details. Like Last Jedi pissed me off because it just made up stuff about the characters that didn't make sense. I think under a Hermione level event they would be friends. But I do not believe there is anything in the character of ron that could make them have a friendly relationship. I am not saying enemies, more like a Theodore Nott situation.
