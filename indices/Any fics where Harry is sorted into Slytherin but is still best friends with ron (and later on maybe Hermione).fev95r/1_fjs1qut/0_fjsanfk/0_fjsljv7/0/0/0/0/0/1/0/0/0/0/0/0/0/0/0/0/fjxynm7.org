An opinion is a view or judgment formed about something, not neccessary based on fact or knowledge. I am using a fact, a thing proven to be true, and simulation, imitation of a situation to predict or estimate that something will happen as a consequence. I have reason behind what I am doing and method. You have shown no evidence for your point besides feelings, if you ever want to sway someone's opinion you need more then that.
