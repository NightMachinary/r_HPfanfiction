But i don't think it's a fact.. i mean Ron doesn't even think that badly of Slytherin at least at the begining of the books. He's just scared of being sorted into that house (but he's scared of being sorted into Hufflepuff too if i remember correctly. And it's not because he hates this house. Just scared of the reaction of other people.) which is why it would make sense that he'd feel sorry for Harry if he was a Slytherin.
