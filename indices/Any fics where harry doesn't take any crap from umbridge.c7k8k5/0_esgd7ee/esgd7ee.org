I read one fic where Harry actually figures out Fudge is trying to railroad him and manages to convince the Minister he was hoodwinked by Dumbledore. As a result he gets himself in a position where he can cleverly blunt many of Umbridge's less-than-well-thought-out initiatives. I forget the name of it, though.

But I do believe as a result he manages to either get the blood quill confiscated or banned.
