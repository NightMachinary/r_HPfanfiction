Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

This one is pretty decent with a Draco who has a brother and tries to be different and befriends Harry (which the elder Malfoys want to get him on their side, but it goes the other way around). The sorting doesn't happen until the first sequel, and it's still in book 4.
