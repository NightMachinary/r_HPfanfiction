PART 2

As someone who had been thrown into one of the hardest subjects of magic by virtue of not wanting the other ones, Penny was not exactly in a good situation by the second week. Most students seemed bored (Arithmancy classes were not the sort taken by most students as a meaningless elective. Still, there were some students who had clearly begun their class believing it would just be a rehash of muggle math or something and they would get an easy grade, only to later be surprised when crazy jumbles of symbols like "∃x(Txp ∧ ∀w(Twp → (w = x))∧(Gx ∧ Px ∧ ∀w(Gw ∧ Pw ∧ (w≠x)→ Wxw))" suddenly showed up. They didn't teach them that in muggle high school.

Among these was one James Donarello, who was surprised as he walked the hallways of Greendale to know, and meet(in that order) Nur.

"--I'm actually only three-sixteenths goblin, due to one great-grandfather and one great-great grandmother. I know the nose is noteworthy, but otherwise I'm as human as everyone here. Most people think I'm half-goblin because they look at the nose and the ears, but it's actually rather strange a belief when you think about it, due to the height disparity between Goblins and Humans. I'm around as tall as you are, which couldn't be possible if I was a half-goblin, unless I was half-goblin half-giant, I suppose, but the logistics of such a union would likely be biologically frustrating unless the giant was the female... My name's Nur, by the way."

James shook Nur's hand. "Nur, nice to know you before meeting you, most people do it the other way around. Now, about my question?"

"Oh, uh..." Nur pulled up an old mechanical pocket watch and checked the time. "Five after eleven, when you asked."

A tall, handsome, fit man, James had the kind of smile that made men want to shake his hand and women want to... well, anyway, James had spotted a young woman as he walked with Nur.

"Nur," James said, ceasing his walking to look upon her. "What's the deal with the hot girl from Arithmancy? It's like she's an Occlumens or something"

"Well, I only spoke with her the one time to lend her a quill, but... she's a former Griffindor, she left Hogwarts after taking her OWLs to work in a Dragon reserve in Romania, she has two muggle brothers and one of them works with children who have a disease I might want to look up. She was late to registration so she hasn't been sorted, and that's why she's taking Arithmancy at all. She's doing two years at Greendale to get up to NEWT levels, and she's never taken Arithmancy before, so she really needs to focus and apologizes in advance if that comes off as inaccessible or unnecessarily brusque. "

James raised his eyebrows, gave a short nod and smiled. "Wow. Nur. I see your value now." He shook the younger man's hand before rushing off without so much as a good-bye. Nur's comment that it was the kindest thing any stranger had told him in his life went unheard.

A few minutes later, James arrived at Professor Greyfeather's office. After a quick response of "go away" to his first knock, James poked his head into the office and smiled.

"James Donarello, Wizengamot genius!" The professor cried with a grin and stood to shake James' hand. James made a nominal attempt at humility, followed by the professor insisting (as he knew he would), and telling him to "sit down. I still don't understand how you managed to connect the Battle of Hogwarts and the death of you-know-who to my recreational brewing of restricted potions... nor why that helped."

"Well... two-thousand and three was a simpler time..." James said.

"So what is my friendly neighbourhood DMLE advisor doing here?"

"Well... I am a student." James admitted.

Professor Greyfeather paused. "That cannot be a pleasant tale."

"Yes, the, uh... Wizengamot and the Department of Magical Law Enforcement have barred me from working within the DMLE until I get my NEWTs."

"Didn't you go to Hogwarts?"

"Yes. As a Slytherin. For three years." James said. "And I hoped that our... previous history would... confer me with certain privileges. You know, academic aid, spiritual mentorship... every answer to every question on every test for the next two years... I brought my schedule--"

Professor Greyfeather protested, as James knew he would, and brought up the integrity of Academia, as James also knew he would. It took little more than a nudge and a gentle reminder that James was responsible for his continued freedom as a man who was known have to and likely still both brewed and consumed restricted potions, for Greyfeather to fold and agree to "look into" the matter.
