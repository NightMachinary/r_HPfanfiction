I did this once already! Kind of. It didn't feature the trio. But hey, it might make you laugh anyway. Prompt by [[/u/not-working-at-work][u/not-working-at-work]]

*[EU] Everybody wants to go to Hogwarts, the most prestigious wizarding school in the world. For those who are less talented, however, there is another option. Tell me a story about the students enrolled in Greendale Community College for Wizards.*

Hogwarts, the most famous school of magic, was an institution for secondary education. This meant that children studied there, from ages eleven to seventeen, at which time they would graduate and go on to post-secondary studies, the workforce, or (specially Slytherins) organized and disorganized crime. It was a prestigious institution, where nearly every great witch or wizard of renown had gone in their youth.

Of course, some people bloom later than others.

Penny Sanchez was one of these late bloomers. Incapable of performing the simplest spell by age eleven, the Hogwarts Quill had simply skipped over her name, as it was thought to be an error. She performed no accidental magic, and had a relatively normal life until age 18, when (having recently graduated highschool), she somehow managed to set fire to her college applications in frustration.

This alerted the quill at Greendale Community College for Wizards, which promptly sent a letter. It was cheaper than every other institution she had been looking at, and not knowing what she wanted to do with her life anyway, she supposed she would accept it. Her grandfather--a wizard himself, and the person her parents had pointed her towards when she got the letter--was very proud her talents had finally manifested (though sad that she would not go to his Alma Mater, he had been a Hufflepuff and enjoyed every minute of it).

GCCW had a small campus. It was an old castle, of course, it had to be, but it was also a small castle. Student housing was limited to the towers, and Penny found her room in the East tower. She took the leftmost bed (by the window) and had barely finished taking out her things when another girl appeared.

"And you are?" She asked, looking at her as though she was a mixture between a bug and an ugly painting.

"Penelope. I'll... Live here?"

The girl sighed and rolled her eyes. "Very well. Keep to your side and we'll have no issue. What house were you in?"

"Pardon?"

"My name is Marcella Hagglesplat. I used to be a Slytherin but... Well."

"...Well what?"

Marcella looked at her with a raised eyebrow. "Well, I got kicked out, so now I'm here."

"Ah. Of course." Penny said, pretending that had been as obvious to her as the other girl clearly thought it should have been.

"And you?"

"I didn't go to Hogwarts."

"Really?" She asked with a smirk. "Where did you go, then?"

"Um... Saint Thomas Secondary school?"

Her curiosity vanished. "Oh. Well, I suppose we'll know when we're sorted what type of witch you are."

There was no hat at GCCW. The hat had been invented by the Hogwarts founders for... Some reason, and the founders of the community college had thought it was stupid to sort people into "houses" based on semi-arbitrarily chosen personality traits.

The sorting, then, simply determined which area you would focus the first year of your studies in. You could re-sort every semester, though, as with wands, the major chooses the wizard, not the other way around.

The freshmen were led onto the gym, which had various coloured flags distributed around it. There, two professors stood, and small crystal balls floated around to every student.

"Alright everyone! Alright! If you do not have a crystal ball, please lift your hand, we will get one to you..." One of the professors involved, a short Asian man, shouted. The students murmured around until everyone had sphere, at which point they were violently shushed by the half-troll professor. After being on the receiving end of her glare, nobody so much as shifted in their seat.

"Very well. The sorting process is rather simple. Focus your energy on the ball, make the ball your own, and you will see in the ball--Hey! Stop laughing! This is important!"

A couple of young men at the bottom of the stands did their best to muffle their snickering.

"Now, try to pour your magic into your balls..."

As the shorter professor explained, many students' balls began turning different colours.

"Very good! Very good! Now, everyone with blue balls, you go here for Arithmancy. Everyone with red balls, here for defense against the dark arts and offensive spells. Green balls, herbology and potions. Yellow balls, languages and education. Orange balls, healing...."

And on they went, with students going around to their respective colour groups.

After some twenty minutes, only Penny and a handful others remained at the stands. The two professors began walking by the stands and helping the leftovers with their sorting.

"Look, girl, just think about the ball. Imagine the ball. Picture stuffing the ball inside yourself as--"

Marcella snorted and the professor glared daggers at her among the group of people by the green flag before turning back to Penny.

"Look, kid, I'm Señor Chang, and--"

"Señor?"

"Yes. I teach Charms, Spanish as an elective and some potions classes."

"You teach Spanish?" Penny asked with a raised eyebrow.

"I am a Spanish genius!" The man screamed at her. "They call me El Tigre Chino!"

Penny frowned as she heard a Chinese(?) man speak Spanish with one of the thickest English accents she had ever heard. "I mean... Okay..."

"I can hablar Español very well, thank you."

"Um... Why would you--"

"It is none of your business why I teach Spanish!" He yelled again, causing some of the already sorted people to snicker.

"...right. Um..." At this point, Penny just wanted something that did not involve this man. It seemed to be enough for the ball, which turned blue.

"Ah, a math girl. Good. Go to your place, I need to help the other students having trouble."

And so Penelope Sanchez became an Arithmancy major.
