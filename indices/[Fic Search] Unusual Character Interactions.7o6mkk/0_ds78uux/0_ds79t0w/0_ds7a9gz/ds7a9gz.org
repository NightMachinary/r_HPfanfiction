It's my own story. I darehope it's not bad, but I'm unsure whether it fully fits what the original post is looking for because it's mostly a humorous story in the vein of /Like a Red-Headed Stepchild/ --- the character interactions are meant to be fun, but, for the most part, not /deep/. Still, this humble author prays you give it a try: linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)
