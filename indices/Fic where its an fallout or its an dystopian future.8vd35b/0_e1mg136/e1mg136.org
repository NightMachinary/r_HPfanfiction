Linkffn(The World I leave behind): the order lost the battle of Hogwarts, harry is presumed dead, and Voldemort is practically unopposed and a majorly frightening figure in Britain.

Linkffn(incorruptible: a dementors stigma): two words: zombie apocalypse.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the sword of the hero; Harry Potter and the defiance of the hero; Harry Potter and the soul of the hero): occurs in not one but two worlds in this trilogy.

Linkffn(Abraxas): about 2/3 of the way through, this fic takes right-heel turn like you wouldn't believe.

Honorable mentions:

Linkffn(The Prince of the Dark Kingdom): Voldemort took a different route here that is sort of like if Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on his rhetoric, but decided to reign it in and play the long game instead.

The Firebird Trilogy: a minor spoiler, but the witch-born are dying out essentially due to a magical version of sexual dimorphism .
