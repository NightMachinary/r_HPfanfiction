To quote Jimmy Durante, "I got a million of 'em!" Pairings listed are the ones in the contract, not necessarily the final pairing.

linkffn(The Greengrass Contract by christianr). Harry/Daphne.

linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement by TheUnrealInsomniac). Harry/Daphne.

linkffn(The Standard Potter Betrothal Contract by Marc the Unruly). Harry/Ginny.

linkffn(The Perils of Betrothal Contracts by offsides).

linkffn(When Fleur Met Harry by sheltie). Harry/Fleur. Didn't care much for this one.

linkffn(Harry the weapon by slytherinsal). Harry sets this one (with Bulstrode) up himself.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Greengrass Connection by Rumour of an Alchemist). Harry/Daphne.

linkao3(Betrothed by Methos2523). Harry/Daphne.

linkffn(The Book of Shadows by Sighned-Anonymous). Harry/Daphne. I didn't care for this one, but the author has changed names and is rewriting it, so it may be better than I recall.

linkffn(Harry Potter: Neko's Mate by Vance McGill). Harry/multiple.

linkffn(Maybe They Did Know What They Were Doing by ArielSakura). Harry/Pansy.

linkffn(By Right of Conquest by Kokopelli). Daphne/Voldemort.

linkffn(The Lady of Slytherin-The Marriage Contract by Nemesis13). Fem!Harry/Jarvis Selwyn.

linkffn(Don't Mess With Harry Potter Sir by JackPotr). Harry/Daphne. Feels rather slapdash, like the author had the idea, but didn't want to spend a lot of time on it.

linkffn(The Forgotten Contract by James Spookie). Harry/Susan Bones.

linkffn(The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic by Itsme66). Harry/Mandy Brocklehurst.

linkffn(The Contract by apAidan). Harry/Hermione.

linkffn(Marriage in Mind by Lady Azar de Tamarin). Harry/Daphne.

linkffn(Harry Potter: Whiskey Accident by gne4eva). Harry/Amelia Bones/Narcissa Malfoy. I haven't read this one yet, but it has a lot of favorites.

linkffn(The Marriage Contracts Redux by Clell65619). Harry/Daphne. There's an earlier version: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts by Clell65619).

linkffn(The Almost Forgotten Marriage Contract of 1763 by worldtravellingfly). Fem!Harry/Tony Stark.

linkffn(Lady Black, Lord Potter by MuggleBeene). Harry/Nymphadora.

linkffn(A Potted Black Rose by nobodez). Harry/multi.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Bride Wars by mmoondragon). Harry/multi.

linkffn(Unfortunately Unbreakable by Luan Mao). Harry/Pansy.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Surprising Marriage Contract by SoapBox Bill). Harry/Patil twins.

linkffn(Contracts and Legalities by fringeperson). Harry/multi.

linkffn(A Parody of Marriage Contracts by diresquirrel). Harry/multi. This one has Harry being told by the Weasley twins that betrothal contracts are for making friends, and Harry has never had friends before. I've read another story (the name of which I unfortunately can't recall) that starts the same way, but is a less cracky story with a Harry/Aurora Sinistra pairing. Basically, a girl gives Harry a blank betrothal contract, the twins set him up, it gets stopped somehow, but Hedwig takes the contract and slips it into Sinistra's paperwork stack.

And [[https://dukebrymin.livejournal.com/44597.html][here is a list of Harry/Ginny contract stories]].
