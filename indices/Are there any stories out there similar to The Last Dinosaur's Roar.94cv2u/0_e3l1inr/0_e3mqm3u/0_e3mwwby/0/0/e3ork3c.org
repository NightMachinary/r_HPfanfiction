Oh, and there's also this: [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/The_End/The_End/]]

It doesn't have any time travel in it, but it goes into quite a bit of detail (with Harry narrating) about the causes of the muggle-wizard war. I still haven't gotten around to writing it, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6fou0c/opinions_on_the_quality_of_draco664s_the_end/][but I have this idea to write a sort-of-continuation of it]], that would feature a unknowing muggleborn in a third-world country who narrates the state of the world (killer satellites, witchcraft hysteria, unnatural mist) until he encounters a dementor in the mists and soon after that encounters a time traveller from the past come to rescue him...
