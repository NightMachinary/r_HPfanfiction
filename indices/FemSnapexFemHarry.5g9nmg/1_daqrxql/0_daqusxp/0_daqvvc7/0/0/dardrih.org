Actually, you could probably write it all almost exactly the same if you make Fem!Snape a lesbian with a secret unrequited love for Lily and don't stray too out of character. Since you'd have all the same conflicts in place with the same personalities it would play out mostly the same overall. The most interesting bit would be how the author chooses to portray sexuality and gender roles in the Wizarding World and how Fem!Snape and Lily's muggle backgrounds mesh with that. For example the wizarding World could be much more liberal in those regards due to lack of religion, etc. than the relatively conservative muggle world. That sort of culture clash would mix well with the romantic antics of Fem!Snape, Lily, and the Marauders. Throw in some Voldemort Rising stuff in the background along with an ongoing prank war and that could make for a pretty good story.
