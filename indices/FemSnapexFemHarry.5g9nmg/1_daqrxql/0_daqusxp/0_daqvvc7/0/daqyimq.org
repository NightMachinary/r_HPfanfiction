If anything I think Snape would be much closer friends with lily as a female. And I think the antagonism between James, Sirius and Snape would be much less as well for 2 main reasons. One, as a female the interaction would be different. Males tend to be more competitive with each other (at least openly), and the dynamic between the sexes would come into play. Hell... James or Sirius might even think of Fem!Snape as more of a conquest then competitor. In addition, since it would not me a "male" friend of Lily, James would likely have a completely different view of the role Fem!snape had in Lily's life.
