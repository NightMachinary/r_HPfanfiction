You know, after thinking on that, I am surprised there has NOT been much if any in the way of Fem!Snape. I mean, apart from it being an intriguing twist, it also opens up the potential for a lot of interesting non slash pairings. From Fem!Snape/Voldemort to Fem!Snape/Dumbledore to Fem!Snape/Harry, and beyond.
