I agree with this review, a lot of people recommended this fic to me but after several chapters I just couldn't go on the author writes this as if he has the secret handbook to magic in the HP verse and he's teaching us the correct solution.

When in fact he's creating himself all the laws that allow Harry to do X awesome things.

Take the gold to silver to gold trick it depends on the goblins minting him silver coins at a cost of 5%, there is nothing in the canon about this as far as I remember the scheme only works because he has the goblins being idiots.

That's like when you're playing monopoly and land in jail you make your own get out of jail cards with pen and paper, that's not you being smart or funny that's you being a cheater and annoying.
