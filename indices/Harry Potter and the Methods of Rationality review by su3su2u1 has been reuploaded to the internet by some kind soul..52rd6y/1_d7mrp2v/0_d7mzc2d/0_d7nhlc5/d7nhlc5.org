Wasn't it decided by a contest? Either "if someone guesses correctly before time is up, given the available information, I post it" or "if someone solves my problem using the limits given in the story, and makes it plausibly foreshadowed, I post it"? ...huh, put that way, that really does sound more like an elitist guessing-game than a "find /A/ suitable answer" contest.
