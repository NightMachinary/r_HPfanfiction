I thought it was a joke. You can't use the "standard" solution /as/ a standard because it has a permanent cost that stacks (which Harry probably didn't yet know at the time, but Riddle did). You can use Riddikulus or stinging hexes all you like as long as it doesn't come too quickly for too long, but choosing to make fiendfyre the hammer you use to solve every problem is simply untenable. Laughably, even.

Note: In theory, you couldn't ACTUALLY use Riddikulus over and over again forever. You'd eventually be inured to everything you could possibly find scary. That's a problem with using poorly simplified examples to prove a point, though, not a problem with Riddikulus.

Edit: Chapter 107, so yeah, Harry knew. Sorry!
