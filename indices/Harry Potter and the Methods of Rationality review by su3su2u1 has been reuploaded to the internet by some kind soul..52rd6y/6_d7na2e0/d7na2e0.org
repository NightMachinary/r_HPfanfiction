I don't agree with a lot of this review, but I'm glad it still exists. People should be able to judge HPMOR and its critiques with all information available.

The snark and insults directed at the author are tiresome unless you share the su3su2u1's opinions already. I do agree with his points that actual scientific exploration of magic falls by the wayside in favor of Death Note--style plotting, and that the conclusion's stated reveal of "Harry was dangerously wrong the whole time and Hermione is the real hero" doesn't stand up against seven books' worth of scenes showing the opposite.
