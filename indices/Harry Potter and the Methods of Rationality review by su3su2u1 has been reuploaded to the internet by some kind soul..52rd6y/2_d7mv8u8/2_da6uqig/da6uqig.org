Parody and mockery of the original series done by someone who hasn't actually read the original series and who has to go off community collated info on the wiki.

He takes the piss out of 'clearly stupid' things in canon that he doesn't actually understand the canon version of.

It's also quite cliquey, especially early on. A lot of the humor of the first few dozen chapters is based on you understanding the science and logic that he's only barely and vaguely explained, which makes it feel like it's intentionally excluding anyone who isn't smart enough.

Basically, anyone who reads HP fanfiction is generally a fan of the original series. Anyone of that subset who is not particularly great at logical thinking or who has a very limited scientific background finds a fic which is intentionally and badly mocking something they love based on flawed assumptions, and which makes jokes that they can't quite get from the info in the fic. Is it really surprising that they react quite strongly and negatively?
