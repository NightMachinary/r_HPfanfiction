As someone who enjoyed the story despite its flaws, is there a reason why so many people seem to hate it on a personal level?

Is it one of those things where fans of HPMOR were mob like fanboys at some point? I genuinely want to know because I don't understand why I've seen several posts that seem to decry the story.

It's not perfect, and it is obviously self indulgent, but it's well written and if you can get into it or buy into its message there are some great moments to be had.
