I think if you don't enjoy it past the first 4 or 5 chapters your time is better served with other stories. HPMOR is not all time great that I would insist you try and soldier through because of how good it is.

If it clicks for you you'll love it, otherwise it'll either bore you or annoy like it has many others in the thread.
