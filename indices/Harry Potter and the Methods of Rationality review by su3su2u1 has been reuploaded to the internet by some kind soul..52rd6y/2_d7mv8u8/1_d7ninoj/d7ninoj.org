As someone who found this on my Goodreads recommended list, I was pretty curious when I read it like 4 years ago.

I liked the new flavour that the author had brought to the world of Harry Potter fan fiction, but when it started following canon 1st year, with Quirrelmort and what not, it lost its appeal quickly. Then, when you look at it, when you're 11 years old, you aren't mature. Your mind is still like that of a child -- magical, or normal -- and will not be able to understand the intricate meaning behind philosophies.

More than that though, the main problem that /I/ had with the fiction was that it never seemed to pull me in, draw me into the story. It was like the fiction was just focusing on dialogues and actions, but never anything more. There were no forms of imagery, no personal touches that would make the story memorable. So when you get back to the story after a break, it's more like you'll feel /meh/ and never get around to reading it.

I gave the book quite a few tries actually. It was recommended very often by many people on various sites, so I figured there must be something to it. But each time I tried getting back to the book, one thing kept putting me off.

The author is well read, that much we can see. But if he /is/ well read, then while he includes his little tidbits of knowledge in there, he could have as well improved on the plot. But all the author ever did was build upon the entire HP plot from the first book. His theory of magic may be something new, sure. But the author's work seems to give off the vibe of arrogance. He uses the plot from canon when he deems it's good, but when it isn't, he just turns his nose up at it.

I might actually give it another chance tonight and see if I can get past chapter 4, which is where I stopped because I couldn't be bothered to read any longer.
