  when you're 11 years old, you aren't mature

Harry's unusual behavior is actually an important plot point, which I won't discuss further because spoilers. Rest assured that it isn't a simple failure to write an 11-year-old, though. Whether his schoolmates behave credibly, judge for yourself.

  see if I can get past chapter 4

If you're struggling to enjoy it at that early stage, may I recommend [[http://daystareld.com/hpmor-remix/][DaystarEld's remix]]? It's a somewhat extended version of the first few chapters, with a slightly softer and more respectful Harry and more gradual introduction.

  when it started following canon 1st year, with Quirrelmort and what not, it lost its appeal quickly.

I can heartily assure you that HPMoR does /not/ slavishly follow canon :D! Yes, Eliezer sometimes used canon elements - though almost always in a very different way - and other times mocked them. It is very much its own story.

Personally, I found it to be an excellent piece of work - though not, I'll grant, for everyone.
