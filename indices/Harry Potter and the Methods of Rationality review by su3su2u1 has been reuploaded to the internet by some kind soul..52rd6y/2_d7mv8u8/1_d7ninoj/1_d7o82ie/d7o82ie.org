Unfortunately(?), most of them are like that. I really think only a few of what are considered good fics actually portray 11-13 year olds authentically (for example, Alexandra Quick). I'm reading Prince of Slytherin right now and all these 12 years olds talk like they're 30 and are taken seriously by people ten times their age.

Doesn't mean I can't enjoy it, I just need too... let it slide?
