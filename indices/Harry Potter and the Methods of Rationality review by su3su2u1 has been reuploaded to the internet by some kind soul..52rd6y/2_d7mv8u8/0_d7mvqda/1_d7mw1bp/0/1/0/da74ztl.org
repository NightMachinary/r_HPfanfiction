I think HPMOR is fantastic for what is is trying to be, a "trying to be Rational!Potter" tale. That doesn't mean it's fantastic on it's own. It fits its niche well, and that niche is not for everyone.

I've gotten more enjoyment out of fics like Harry being raised by The Doctor or Harry gets on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s nerves, but they too aren't for everyone.

But for some reason, it does feel that people hate on HPMOR... irrationally. (sorry...)
