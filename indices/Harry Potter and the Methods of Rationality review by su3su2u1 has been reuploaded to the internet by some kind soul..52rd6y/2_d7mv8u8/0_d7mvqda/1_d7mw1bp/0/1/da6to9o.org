HPMOR fanboy here.

In no way is HPMOR supposed to be realistic. Harry's behaviour is not meant to make sense in terms of realism or plot. Because it's fanfiction and EY does whatever, because he wants to shove some rationalism into our mouths.

I would consider HPMOR to be "the best" but in many ways, because it isn't conventional fanfiction, I would place it on a high pedestal, but not in the HP FF trophy room.
