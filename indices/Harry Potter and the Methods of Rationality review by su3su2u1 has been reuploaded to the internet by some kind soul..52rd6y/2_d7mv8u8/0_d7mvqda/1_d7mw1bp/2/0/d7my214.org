Maybe it's just been too long since I last read HPMOR, but from what I remember he didn't insult JK in regards to the dementors did he? Or at least not overtly.

He just had a different interpretation of their origins.

Unless you mean the fact that everyone else in the wizarding world saw them the way Rowling intended, and it's the fact that Harry came in with his "superior intellect" and figured them out.

In which case I see what you mean even though I didn't get that impression when I read through it.
