Ignoring the existence of the author notes, no, he did not do it overtly.

That said, as much as I did enjoy that story, I can say that it can be quite ... arrogant, yes, at times. And that one is one of those moments when what is but does not have to be seen as arrogance by readers combines with author notes about it being even more arrogant, and the end result is that ... well, his attitude honestly was quite insulting as far as many people saw it.

Don't get me wrong, I did find the concept of dementors as beings of death---not like HPMoR was the first story to have that twist anyway---and the Patronus 2.0 to be quite cool and overall fairly enjoyable, and had it been, you know, explored well in the story and played for something ... I don't know, less grandiose, I guess, than it got played for in the end, it could have possibly been great. But it wasn't, even if for some people it was enjoyable, all because of his (the author's) “I know better” kind of elitism.

And this elitism and that arrogance are the very root of the issue for many of those who say that HPMoR is bad. Too many things, instead of being played to benefit the plot in some way, enrich it, are instead played for ... some kind of “hahah, I'm right, you aren't” thing. Which is just sad because I've read some of Yudkowsky's other works and he could have done way better.
