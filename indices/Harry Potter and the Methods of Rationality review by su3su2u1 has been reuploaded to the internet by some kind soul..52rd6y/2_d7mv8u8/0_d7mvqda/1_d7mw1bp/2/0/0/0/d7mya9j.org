In authors notes? I don't normally read those so that could explain why I missed it.

That kind of attitude is one I'm fairly used to now anyways. I read a lot of Naruto fanfic, and with the way canon has gone over the years it's hard to find a story that /doesn't/ hold that opinion.

Personally I don't think his idea made any more or less sense that Rowling's, but I found it more interesting to consider.
