You quoted me saying that /I/ don't think his idea made any more or less sense. The author probably thought as much, but I was talking about myself.

And I'm seriously confused at your logic statement. Of course logic is still relevant even in fiction. It just doesn't have to line up with real world logic.

If Harry defeated Voldemort because he loves donuts that would be insanely stupid because it makes no sense, there's no internal logic there.

Logic isn't the be all end all, but it's hardly irrelevant.
