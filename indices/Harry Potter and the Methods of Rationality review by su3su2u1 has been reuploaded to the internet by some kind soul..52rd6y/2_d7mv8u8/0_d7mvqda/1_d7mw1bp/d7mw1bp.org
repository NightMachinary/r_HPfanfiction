Okay. I can see why people would be against it because of fanboyism. I think maybe I read it too late to get caught up in that.

I can also understand the arrogance thing, but that does also come down to how the reader personally interprets it. It didn't feel arrogant to me because I never felt like or considered the story to be speaking to me to begin with.

It helps that I knew nothing of the science so I couldn't assume that he was wrong about that.

And as for the departures from canon, I think I'm the perfect target audience for that kind of thing.

I know a lot of people prefer stories that either keep the world as similar as possible, or only experiment with small changes, but I'm part of the (sometimes perhaps arrogant) crowd that /prefers/ AU's that /fix/ canon.

So it probably appealed to that side of my tastes.
