I've read lots of FF that have departed from the canon in pretty drastic and even stupid ways, but I can enjoy them despite that. Almost every story is going to contradict canon, MoR just does so to fit in its framework of to "scienceify magic." Almost nothing in the books is really defined well. What fuels magic, what Runes are, what arithmancy does. Fic regularly take insane liberty with their characters and motivations. They're all just holes that writers use to make up a fun story.
