Well its obvious that magic does work to some set of principles in canon... when JK Rowling introduces new types of magic or spells, everything more or less feels consistent and nothing is world-breaking. The departures in HPMOR is a contrivance but only so when rationalist Harry asks "what are the principles that make magic work?" The results are consistent. Science, for Harry, is a set of methods for asking the question about the rules, not the rules themselves. If no such rules existed in canon, HP would be unreadable.
