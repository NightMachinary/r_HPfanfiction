The hype/fanboyism is definitely part of it.

But there's also a certain arrogance to the whole thing, like it's trying to tell you how much smarter it is than you, while being wrong all the time. Both about the science and about canon - it makes a lot of departures from canon that it never really sells to the reader, so it's more Hogwarts-shaped than just Hogwarts but with a different Harry.
