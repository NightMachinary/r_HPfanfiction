...I'm sorry, but how could you have missed that the whole point of that chapter was to show that Harry was willing to (either consciously or unconsciously) cut corners and do bad science in order to "awaken" Draco? I was nodding along to this thread until I came upon your critique, and now I'm sitting here thinking that the thread in fact may be full of people who either haven't read HPMoR too carefully or the author failed to convey the difference between what was going on in this episode and actual lessons on how to try and think more clearly and rationally about stuff. I mean, that is the whole bloody lesson here - that you don't just believe anything that sounds sciency and that you don't go around thinking that a bunch of people you know to be otherwise smart are being idiots on one specific issue just because you pattern-matched it to "dumb racists" in history.
