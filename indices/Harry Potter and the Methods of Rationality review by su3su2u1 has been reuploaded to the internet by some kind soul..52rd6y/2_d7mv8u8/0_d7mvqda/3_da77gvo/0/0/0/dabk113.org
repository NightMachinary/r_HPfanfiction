  or the author failed to convey the difference between what was going on in this episode and actual lessons on how to try and think more clearly and rationally about stuff.

Probably a major point, there.

If your way of teaching lessons is to give wrong information, you're going to lose credibility from anyone who can see through that. Since it makes it look like you don't know what you're talking about.

After all, wasn't the point of the story that Harry was supposed to be an avatar of rationality, and that we would see how a rationalistic perspective would have a huge effect on the wizarding world? That's how the book was sold - instead we got a lot of self-righteous intellectual circle-jerking disguised as wisdom, and the main response to any critique is "you just don't understand".

If you're trying to explain something, it's not the audience's fault when they don't understand you.
