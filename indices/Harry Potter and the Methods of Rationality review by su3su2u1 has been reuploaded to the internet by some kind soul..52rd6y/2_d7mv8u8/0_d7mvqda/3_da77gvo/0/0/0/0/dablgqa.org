What exactly do you mean by that?

I mean, the whole thing is narrated mostly from the point of view of Harry, and is is a series of repeated instances where he has a long internal monologue, arrives at some conclusion, and then is repeatedly proven wrong! It's not by accident that Harry is wrong about science and logic, it's by design (with the notable exception of the photons thing in chapter 95, which I assume was corrected in later edits).

Have you read it until the end, where [[/spoiler][Harry turns out to be a huge idiot that almost destroys the world multiple times, kills a bunch of people, realizes how much of an idiot he has been the whole time, how much more carefully he needs to think and act, and that he's at the very beginning of his journey as a rationalist and has only survived the whole thing thanks to Dumbledore doing all of the heavy intellectual lifting?]]

Edit: I actually found a quote from Eliezer specifically about the squib thing (transcribed from audio):

  And I will also observe, although Dumbledore had no way of figuring this out, and I think Harry might not have figured it out yet because he doesn't yet know about chromosomal crossover, that if there is no wizard gene, but rather a muggle gene, and the muggle gene sometimes gets hit by cosmic rays and ceases to function thereby producing a non-muggle allele, then some of the muggle vs. wizard alleles in the wizard population that got there from muggleborns will be repairable via chromosomal crossover, thus sometimes causing two wizards to give birth to a squib. Furthermore this will happen more frequently in wizards who have recent muggleborn ancestry. I wonder if Lucius told Draco that when Draco told him about Harry's theory of genetics.
