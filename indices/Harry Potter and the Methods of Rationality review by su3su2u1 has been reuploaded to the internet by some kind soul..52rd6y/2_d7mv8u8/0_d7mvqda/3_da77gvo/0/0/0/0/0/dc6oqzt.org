That's not how chromosomal crossover works. It doesn't "repair" genes, it simply passes them from one chromosome to the other in a pair.

Furthermore, chromosomal crossover only really comes into play when there are two alleles on the same "leg" of a chromosome. The fic states that there is only one gene (allele) responsible for magic inheritance (ie. straight-up Mendelian inheritance).
