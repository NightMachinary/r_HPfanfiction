Lots of Aristotlean logic and accepting things that haven't been proven. For example, the idea that he has a valid theory after asking 23 purebloods to admit to something they would be motivated to lie about and then working from there (birthing squibs) - and the theory doesn't account for the existence of squibs anyways. Because according to people who would be harmed by admitting to it, they aren't very common.

He does this /all the time./ It's bad science, since the margin for error in his "experiments" would be huge.
