I think most tropes were good at first. And they still are in a fashion. However at the start the revelation that something like that is happening was already interesting by itself. Nowadays doing a reveal that the Weasleys are using love potions on Harry and Hermione is no longer a surprising development. A trope now needs to lead to something more interesting or be developed in an original manner than the standard things.

For instance the Harry goes to Gringotts trope is tired and lots of authors that still use it aren't original with it and just use it as a convenient way to heap on money, inheritance and power onto Harry. But the basic idea of Harry going to the goblins and discovering something is not inherently bad.
