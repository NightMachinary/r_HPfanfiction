  I think most tropes were good at first.

I mean, if the popular tropes weren't good at first, they probably never would've become tropes in the first place. The first people wrote about Dumbledore paying off the Weasley's and readers thought "hey, that's a really interesting idea" so they started incorporating it into their own stories. If the reaction to those first stories had instead been "wow, that's stupid" then no one else would've used it and 99% of readers would've never heard about it.
