That's exactly what I mean. Older popular fics very often don't stand the test of time that well because they were build mostly on establishing new ideas which developed in what we now know as tropes. The writing was not that scrutinized because the concepts were all new and interesting. Reading about all the money Harry inherits and the magical powers he gets from his ancestors was a novel and interesting concept. But now that the trope is established you look back at those early stories and recognise the often bad overall writing around it.

  Good way of putting it. I think the HP fanfiction community is pretty unique in how exhaustive it has been in creating tropes in the continuity. Practically all the low-hanging fruit of key events happening differently, key changes to backstories or worldbuilding have all been thoroughly explored in all sorts of ways.

I think you are correct with this, but then again I still encounter fics where there are major events done in a way I haven't seen before. In a universe as expansive as fanon HP it's almost impossible to involve no tropes in your story (there are way too many), but finding original takes on those tropes, small additions or clever ways around them really can change an entire story.
