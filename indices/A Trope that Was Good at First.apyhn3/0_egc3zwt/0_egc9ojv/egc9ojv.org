Good way of putting it. I think the HP fanfiction community is pretty unique in how exhaustive it has been in creating tropes in the continuity. Practically all the low-hanging fruit of key events happening differently, key changes to backstories or worldbuilding have all been thoroughly explored in all sorts of ways.

Nowadays for a fic to stand out it's gotta go either /reeeeallly/ far out there to try something novel, or have excellent writing so readers don't care how similar it is to established stories.
