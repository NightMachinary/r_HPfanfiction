The one I really regret reading was FemHarry forced into sexual slavery to pay for the breakout (and a bunch of Death Eaters for being overall dicks). It had some graphic rape scenes, which I read in the hope of getting some bloody vengeance.

But no, instead of Hermione and Kingsley concluding that sexual Slavery excludes you from the Hague conventions and introduce the Goblins to the wonders of chemical warfare and flamethrowers, FemHarry develops Stockholm Syndrome and goes back to the Goblins after her "debt is repaid".
