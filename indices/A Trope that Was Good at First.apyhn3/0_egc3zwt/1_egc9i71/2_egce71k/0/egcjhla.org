No, give Harry the Bird of Prey (instead of the dragon) and have him rake Voldemort's forces with the disruptors during the battle. Make it completely one-sided. Star Trek is the Power he knows not. You are writing about teenagers getting warbirds. This ain't going to be serious, so carry the idea to its logical conclusion. Voldemort will get the buggering of the century. Everything else will be an asspull.

And if anything, the one Borg ship he could get his hands on is the Sphere from Enterprise S2E23/First Contact.
