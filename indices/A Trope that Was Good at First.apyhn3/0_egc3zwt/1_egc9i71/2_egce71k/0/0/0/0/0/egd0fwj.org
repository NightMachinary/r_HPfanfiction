"Harry, what exactly did you do to Malfoy?"

"It was an accident, honestly."

"How can you beam someone by accident?" Hermione wanted to know but Harry's mumbled reply was too quiet to understand. "What was that?"

"I said that I shot him, but I didn't mean to -"

"Explain, now!"

"I was outside of Myrtle's bathroom, when I heard sobbing. I - I went to see what was going on because it didn't sound like her. She was there, but she was talking to Malfoy about something. He was sobbing and - and then he saw me and attacked. He opened with the Cruciatus. Not even a stunner or blasting curse - Just an Unforgivable," Harry explained, not looking up from the floor. His hands were still trembling and he was paler than usual.

"So you just shot him?"

"I - I didn't had my wand out. I tried to draw it and the next thing I know, I'm holding a phaser and Malfoy, he just disintegrated."

"You didn't mean to kill him?" she asked slowly and put an arm around her shaken friend.

"I - I don't know. I wanted to find out what he was up to, prove that he was a Death Eater - And now he's dead. I saw that curse - I remembered how it felt like - "

"Don't - don't blame yourself. You did the right thing," she said and pulled him in a tight hug."

"But you didn't believe -"

"Harry, he tried to cast the bloody Cruciatus Curse. You know what punishment comes with that spell. No matter what he was doing, it wasn't good. And -"

"Hermione, I KILLED HIM!"

"Better him than you! And now we have to figure out what to tell the Professors - I thought that you had just beamed him somewhere - but this is so much worse -"
