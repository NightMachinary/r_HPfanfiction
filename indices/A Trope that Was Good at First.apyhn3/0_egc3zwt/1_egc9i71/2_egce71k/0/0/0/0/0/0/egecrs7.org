Hermione rolled her neck and cast her eyes across the bridge of the /Hedwig/. Harry was slumped in the helmsman's chair, his eyes downcast.

"Captain, if I may offer a suggestion?" Data spoke up from the Science Officer's station.

Hermione turned to him, "Data, I told you yesterday. I'm not the captain."

"Captain, I have an eidetic memory. You do not need to remind me of anything. However, after your assertion I queried Lieutenant Potter, and he forcefully asserted that he was not the captain and that he was 'good at flying but that's it.' I suggested that he therefore take the helmsman's station and the rank of Lieutenant. He was amenable. As the only remaining member of /Hewig/'s crew, that makes you the Captain, Captain."

Hermione let out a slow breath.

"I don't have time for this," she muttered. "Okay fine, I'm the captain. Let's hear your suggestion, then."

"If you were able to obtain a sample of Mister Malfoy's DNA, we could use the bio-replicator in the sickbay to create something that would passably resemble his body. You could then bring the replicated body into what you call 'The Forbidden Forest' and stage an attack by one of the dangerous animals therein. With enough damage to the body and the surrounding forest, none would suspect the ruse."

Harry's head shot up. His eyes, glistening from the beginnings of tears, held a feverish hope.

"However, I must inform you that my ethics subroutines would not permit me to carry out such an action myself."

"Why not!?" Harry exploded, coming instantly to his feet. "If the Captain ordered you..."

"Sir, I must..."

Hermione interrupted. "Data, Draco carried out an action that carries a life sentence in a prison designed to break a prisoner's very soul. Harry acted purely in self-defense, and you can see his remorse plainly," she reasoned.

Data cocked his head slightly.

He paused for just a moment, silence falling over the bridge.

"Very well."

Hermione let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.

"I shall proceed to the sickbay and start the necessary programming on the bio-replicator. The task will take approximately four hours, three minutes, 29 seconds."

Harry nodded along as Data spoke. As the android turned to leave the bridge, Harry pounded his right fist into his left hand. He spoke to Hermione, still facing the closed turbolift doors, "Guess we're staging a break-in of the Slytherin dorms."

"Do you still have that Felix Felicis?"
