Even something not being original doesn't make it inherently bad. I generally dislike Harry goes to Gringotts since it is very often an unoriginal, drawn out affair that has very little baring on the entirety of the story. Far too often it's a convenient way for the author to dump the premise on the main character (i.e. Dumbledore has been stealing money from him, he''s the descendant of all four of the founders, he has marriage contracts aplenty, etc.). So the execution of the Harry goes to Gringotts is often poorly done and unimaginative (which all too often sets up for other deficiencies in the rest of the story).

However just because the execution is often done so poorly doesn't mean that the general idea is bad. Gringotts and the goblins can make for interesting story elements. I don't even mind an unoriginal Harry inherits stuff scene, as long as it's not 10k words where the author is trying to amaze everyone with uncovering all kinds of amazing stuff that's not at all relevant to the story.
