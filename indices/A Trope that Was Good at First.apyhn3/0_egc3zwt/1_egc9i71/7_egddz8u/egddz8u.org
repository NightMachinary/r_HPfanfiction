"I actually needed to speak to you about that."

"Ahh, ahh. You have done the rites, you are my son. But you are not required to do too much. There are a few things if you're ever on Qonos or a colony world but nothing distressing to humans.

"I am sending you a copy of the rites." Harry nodded. "Now, I have an appointment with the Human ambassador."

"Of course! You told me they died defending you! Your parents died with great honor! You must only identify me as your father, you need not call me that."

Harry nodded again. "How difficult would it be for me to purchase a Vor'cha or K'vort class?"
