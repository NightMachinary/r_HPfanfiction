  But the basic idea of Harry going to the goblins and discovering something is not inherently bad.

Yet there is hardly anything which can reasonably be found at Gringotts which hasn't been done to death. You have:

- Money & Other physical assets

- The "keys" to some property/house

- Stock in various companies (Nimbus, the Daily Prophet, some apothecary)

- Magical Portrait

- Trunk/Journals

- Family magic books

- Connections to a different magical family/cheating mother (eg Snape is Harry's father)

- Some form of sex dungeon, possibly with sexual slavery

Short of a Prothean Beacon or a Klingon Bird of Prey, it is not original.
