Not so much a trope as a plotline, but Hermione travels back in time to save the Potters + Sirius/Snape/Remus (her love interest of choice). It's been done to death, and the whole premise relies on her being essentially the next Merlin levels of intelligent (often to Mary Sue extremes too). While I don't mind Hermione as a character, she feels like the worst character to gimmick into the next Merlin, because her personality is rather well defined and nothing ever feels fresh with the execution of her "genius". At least with Harry he's enough of an insert character that you can play around with his history and personality to get something different.
