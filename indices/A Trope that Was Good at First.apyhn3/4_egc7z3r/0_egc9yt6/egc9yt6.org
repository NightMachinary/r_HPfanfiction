I never really saw Hermione as intelligent - just smart. She isn't going to have a four layer plan with back up plans in a few minutes, but she does have the knowledge to do so. She can use that knowledge to great use, but it definitely isn't anything far above the norm. If I were to describe it with the useless IQ scale, she would be a 120.
