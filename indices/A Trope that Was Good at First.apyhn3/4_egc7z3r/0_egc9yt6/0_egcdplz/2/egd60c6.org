I don't like Hermione, but she's not just book-ish/book-smart. Book-Hermione is quite good at thinking on her feet.

When Dolohov fires that purple curse at her, she immediately silences him, and this is what prevents her from getting killed.

When the Snatchers find them thanks to Harry's stupidity, she fires a stiniging jinx to his face to mask his identity. She does this within seconds of hearing them apparate in.

In the Rookery, she covers Ron with the invisibility cloak when they jump down the collapsed floor - so that Ron is hidden (in order to prevent any action against the Weasleys), but the Death Eaters can see that Xeno was telling the truth about Harry actually having come there.
