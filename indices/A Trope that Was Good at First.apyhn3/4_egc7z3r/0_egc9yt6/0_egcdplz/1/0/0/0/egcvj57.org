Better off focusing on the Firenze thing because the other stuff you're mentioning are the things I was trying to say are trivial (and besides, outside if book 1 isn't it only ever Dumbledore doing the whole "Call them professor, Harry"?). The Lockhart stuff was, again, to save lives, while the Umbrige one was because the government was literally making their up and coming adults less able to defend themselves. Whether or not they believed Voldemort was back was irrelevant to that, they very likely messed up a bunch of 5th and 7th years by taking away their classroom practicals for a class designed to learn to protect themselves.

Putting quotes around the word necessary suggests it was frivolous, but you know as the reader why it was done. I ignore the fanon, boring Hermione because... She's boring, like an OP "Lord Harry". I think comparing the social niceties stuff with her willingness to break rules when people might die is a little ridiculous. The Firenze thing is better.
