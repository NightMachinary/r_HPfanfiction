It's the first example of Hermione's hypocritical thinking that I came up with. There are others, like her insistence on listening to and respecting the teachers, insisting that Harry and Ron address them as "Professor" when talking about them, not insulting them... But she'll trick them when it's "necessary", like Lockhart and Umbridge.

  ‘I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?' asked Parvati, smirking.

  It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.

  ‘Not really,' said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. ‘I've never really liked horses.'

  She turned a page of the newspaper and scanned its columns.

  ‘He's not a horse, he's a centaur!' said Lavender, sounding shocked.

  ‘Either way, he's still got four legs,' said Hermione coolly.

She also presents herself as a crusader for non-human rights... but then denigrates a non-human Professor because she's still salty about Third Year Divination. She's clearly very flawed, and while it potentially makes her an unlikeable character, it gives her some depth, and that's more than what Movie Hermione or Fanon Hermione ever get.
