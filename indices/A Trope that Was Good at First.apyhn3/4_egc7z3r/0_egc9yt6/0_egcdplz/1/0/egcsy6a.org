The rules thing is kind of a BS statement of how she is characterized. There's a difference between someone with a personality that makes them say "Hey, don't cheat in class" and "Don't break the law to save someone's life". Did Hermione ever criticize anyone for the latter kind of action? The only instance that comes to mind is the Malfoy and Cruciatus thing in HBP, but nearly everyone agrees all the main characters in that book became caricatures of themselves and focused on silly things when Voldemort was afoot.
