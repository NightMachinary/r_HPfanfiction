She's also condescending, self-righteous, socially awkward, petty, and hypocritical (tells other people to obey rules, but breaks them whenever she thinks it's "necessary).

All of this is absent in the movie's version of Hermione, which turns her into a badass genius who babysits Harry and Ron and makes you question why she even needs them if she can figure out the Horcruxes by herself.

And then this becomes Fanon Badass!Hermione who is equally flawless, likeable, sexy, and makes all the boys fall in love with her within a week, including Tom Riddle (who doesn't love anyone) and Snape (who loves Lily and no one else).
