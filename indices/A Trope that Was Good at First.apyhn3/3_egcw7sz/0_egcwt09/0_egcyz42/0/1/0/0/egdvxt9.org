I don't know how fair that is, honestly. I have no idea of the exact statistics, but most of the conspicuously bad fics I come across seem like they're written by super young kids who genuinely don't know any better. There's definitely loads of generic power fantasy fics out there, I'll admit to having written some in my teens, but I'd surprised if they were more common than novice writers dipping their toes in the pool, y'know?
