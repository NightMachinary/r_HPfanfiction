Even if that's not how they mean it, I still wouldn't like the statement because it's extremely misleading.

I don't think your example works. Luke gets super powers and a lightsaber.. which his enemies also have. They've had them for longer, and they're way better with both than he is. Then they get a Death Star too.

  For the Empire to be a threat and escalate the story in a realistic scale, they need the Death Star.

Come on. They did not /need/ the Death Star. An interstellar oppressive government with a far superior military led by two ultra powerful super powered baddies is easily more than enough of a threat. Luke was already facing nearly impossible odds, making them worse wasn't required.
