I see stories that abuse magical mechanics to be similar to gamer fics. They can be hilarious if they aren't taken seriously, but they fail otherwise.

As for OP!Harry, that's actually somewhat easy to pull off if you follow some principals. Don't tell the reader that he is powerful. I'm currently reading "Harry Potter and the Homecoming", and Harry is powerful. But the story isn't trying to tell me that. It just drops hints here and there without saying it. The biggest helper here is how much Harry thinks he is weak. He doesn't think he is too weak, but he doesn't think he's particularly strong. Show don't tell is important in those stories. It must be gradual, it must be explained, and it must be difficult.

One story with an overpowered character came from him being destroyed in a fight. X beat me. I need to counter X with Y. How do I do Y? The next fight he gets destroyed, but he gains the knowledge of how to use Y. He didn't use that Y in the fight. He just made a revelation. And the fights were consequential to the plot which made it realistic.
