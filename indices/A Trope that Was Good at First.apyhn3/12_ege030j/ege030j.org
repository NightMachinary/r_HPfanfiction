The first time I ran into a truly evil Dumbledore was excellent. I'd read stories where Dumbledore was antagonistic, mostly because he didn't want a teenager risking his life but Harry knows best, but none where he was actually villainous. Earlier this week, I read a story and thought "aside from the tired old MoB Dumbledore, this was good"

That said, I think [[/u/MartDiamond][u/MartDiamond]] was pretty on the money. The shock value/new idea will go along way to make otherwise mediocre writing seem much better.

I'll add that many tropes, when initially done well, were things that first, added to the overall plot of the story, rather than just something that was tossed in because the author liked it, or needed to check a box. Secondly, new ideas are scary, and so authors tend to take the time to fully flesh out new things. Once something's become a trope, it's really easy to just try to use the trope itself as a shorthand, instead of actually taking the time the idea needs to be good.
