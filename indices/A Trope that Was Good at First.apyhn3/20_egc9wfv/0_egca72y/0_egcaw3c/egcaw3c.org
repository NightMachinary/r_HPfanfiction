I think I just didn't appreciate your phrasing. It sounded like you were essentially calling anyone who used a plot twist you didn't want to see twice ‘uncreative.' I'm picturing reviews on the guy who came up with a neat idea that other writers chose to emulate looking at their inbox going ‘wtf?' cause you found their fic second.

At the same time I do think seeing multiple stories with the “Lord Potter” or “Lord Black” does end up diminishing their predecessors, heh.

Shock value plots do get old---almost any evil Dumbledore plot has me yawning nowadays. I just don't review them tho.
