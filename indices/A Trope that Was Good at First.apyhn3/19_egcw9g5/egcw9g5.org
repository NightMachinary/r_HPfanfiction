Personally, I like the Snily pairing, say what you will everyone has a guilty read, but I hate the Snape goes back in time trope. It's just creepy and has weird undertones of pedophilia in it when he a 37 yr old man is attracted to 16 yr old girl. Genuinely disgust me. I prefer to read Snily fics in the Marauders timeline.
