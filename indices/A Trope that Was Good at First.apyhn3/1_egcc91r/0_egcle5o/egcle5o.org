I think worse is when it turns out Harry's birth name isn't really Harry but /Harold--/or Harrison or Hadrian, but almost never the name that actually /is/ shortened to Harry and whom he was named after: Henry.

And this seems to be just to make his name sound fancier. But in doing so, they are both expressing the same prejudice as Petunia, and refuting her claim that Harry had a "nasty, common name."
