I agree that Henry is the better choice if you're going to change his name, but Harold is shortened to Harry as well.

  But in doing so, they are both expressing the same prejudice as Petunia, and refuting her claim that Harry had a "nasty, common name."

That's a mean way of putting it, but having something of an agreement with Petunia on one matter doesn't mean you're anything like her in general. There's nothing wrong with disliking the name Harry.
