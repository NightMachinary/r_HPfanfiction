A lot of these name changes have nothing to do with time travel. It's just authors fundamentally misunderstanding Harry's canon characterization, or ignoring it altogether.

They make him "Hadrian Jameson Peverell-Black" because a protagonist who is the object of prophecy, and the largest magical core in history, cannot possibly have such a simple name as "Harry James Potter". Writing characterization is treated like the player character stats screen on an RPG, where you can "build your own", including choosing a cool name.

99% of the time it's an OC, a "Harry by name only"... but then again, he's not even Harry. ðŸ˜‚
