How about a trope that was never good? Harry changing his name to sound more important, or more befitting of his new rank as Lord Potter-Black (Merlin-Le Fay-Gryffindor-Peverell). I give bonus points if Harry corrects Dumbledore, Snape, or his other teachers for calling him plain old 'Mr. Potter' in class.

Of course, all the names he chooses are terrible, but the main offender is *"Hadrian Peverell".*

I take it as a cue that the author isn't planning to stick to any canon characterizations in their story, as Harry in the books was just happy to be "Just Harry" when confronted with news of himself being special and magical. Harry has a different type of personality than Tom Riddle, who knew he was special all along, and /wanted/ to change his name to match that perceived status.
