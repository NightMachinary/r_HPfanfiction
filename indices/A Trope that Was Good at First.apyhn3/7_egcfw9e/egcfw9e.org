I remember reading a great soul bond fic back in like 07 and thought it was great, i still think the intro and premise were fantastically written, but I've seen so many poorly done knock offs that can barely stand those any more (it was also filled with tons of tropes towards the end that make it hard to reread, but i had just started reading ff and thought it was amazing)
