I give this a pass depending on how old Harry is when Snape "adopts" him. If he's an actual baby, then it doesn't bother me if he acts like one. However, some of these stories crank up the angst and make the Dursleys more abusive than they are in canon, so you get ultra Woobie Harry, and it's ridiculous at times.

I read one fic where one Woobie Harry kept trying to sleep in Snape's potions cupboard and broke the glassware and wet himself while in there, and Snape had to take him to his bedroom and rock him till he fell asleep. It happened multiple times, Snape getting more upset about the Dursley abuse, while it made Harry look like he was a kicked puppy instead of a human child.

The lesson learned: if one character in a fic is OOC, then there's a good chance everyone else is too.
