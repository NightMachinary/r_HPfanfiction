My problem is the converse. 80% of Severitus infantilizes Harry. Where canon Harry (perhaps unrealistically) overcomes his awful childhood and becomes a typical angsty teenager, Severitus!Harry always seems to be a crying little boy who needs to be held like someone half his age. That feels wrong regardless of who's taking care of him and just gross when it's Snape.
