I used to like it, then I re-calibrated my standards after realizing 80% of it makes Snape into a Woobie who was abused by his dad, James and the Marauders, Voldemort, Dumbledore, and life. Snape turning soft ruins the only appealing parts about his character. He should be a hardass no matter who is related to him, or who he mentors.
