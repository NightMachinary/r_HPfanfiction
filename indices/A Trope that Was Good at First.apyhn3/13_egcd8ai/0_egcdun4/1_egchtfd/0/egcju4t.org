The biggest thing to remember that Snape is a dick. No matter his role in any story, the baseline tenet of his personality is being a massive dick. Even to people he loves (like Lily) he will still lash out. To people on the same side (Remus in PoA) he will put his own grudges first. He's selfish and motivated by self-interest.

- The main trope that annoys me in Severitus is "Affectionate Snape", which waters down his dickishness. If he shows approval for something, he doesn't cuddle and hug. Nowhere in the books did Snape ever look like he was going to hug Draco, his canon favorite student.

- Snape also isn't an emotionless robot, and Book Snape isn't the cool and subdued threat of Movie Alan Rickman Snape. He has emotions, has trouble repressing them, throws tantrums, and hasn't reached the point of emotional maturity where he realizes holding onto 15 year old grudges and crushes is weird.

- Snape is competent and good at his job. He invents spells, brews advanced potions, and writes his own recipes. I am annoyed by Fanfiction Snape who spends all his time brooding around or looking after children's needs, instead of doing magical stuff. Show how intelligent and capable he is through using magic as an important plot device in a story, instead of just telling the readers this guy is clever.
