Your view on Snape is my view on Snape. I have been putting together a 'good' Snape and.... he's still, quite honestly entirely self-involved. If he offers a hug, it's so that he can drag someone off by forced side-along apparition. Although I don't have him ever being a murderer unless forced. He was too upset in canon at what Dumbledore asked him to do to have really wallowed in atrocities as a Death Eater, at least willingly.

I like to think that he's fairly dutiful towards his Slytherins though. That, /if/ you were a Slytherin, you'd see Snape as distant but someone reliable you could go to with anything, at least until the teenage stage where adults are all the absolute worst.
