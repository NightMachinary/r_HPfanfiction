I like them as concept, and there are some really great severitus and mentor!snape fics out there. When it's done well, it's so good. But I really hate that in so many of them Harry is infantilized and his agency is taken from him. So many severitus fics will amp up the abuse to 11, like what Harry's been through in canon isn't traumatic enough, and then make him a sad little angel, who is pathetically grateful to Snape for the minimul level of basic human decency (and sometimes not even that) and trusts him even though Snape still treats Harry like garbage. Like, Snape still heaps a ton of verbal abuse on Harry just like he always did (and even sometimes physical, which he didn't before), but now that's fine, because deep down he's beginning to realize that Harry isn't some spoilt prince and starts to like him. Deep down.
