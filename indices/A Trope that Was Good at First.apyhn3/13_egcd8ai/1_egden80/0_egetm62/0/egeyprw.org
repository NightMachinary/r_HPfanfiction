It's important to remember that Dursley still were abusive even if they didn't beat Harry black and blue, and emotional abuse can mess up a child just as much as physical.

  no Snape can't effectively abandon Harry for three days to finish brewing Wolfsbane and no the fact there's food in the house does not make up for the fact he's 14.

haha, I feel that it's perfectly in character for Snape. But whether this infantilizes Harry depends on how Harry himself would react to the situation. At 14, he has long been self-sufficient, and he'll do just fine for three days by himself.

Also, Harry is opinionated and sassy, and there's going to be some clash of personalities. He wouldn't just stand there silently, eyes downcast, while Snape shouts at him for being just like his father, for example, or maybe he would, but that would be a sign of a deep mistrust.
