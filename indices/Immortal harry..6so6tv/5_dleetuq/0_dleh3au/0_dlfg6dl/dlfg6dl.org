No, trust me this is very entertaining, and there is a reason it's over 300k words. I won't spoil it, but there is some dimension travelling, nation building, multiple personality aspects with one of them maybe being THE aspect of death, ducks with vampire teeth, and the best part is it's not a huge jumbled mess. It's actually smooth, and easy to follow along.

What i usually do is read the first 10k words per 100k words of story. So read 30k-37k, and if you don't like it by that point it's not the story for you, but in my humble opinion It's definetly worth a try.
