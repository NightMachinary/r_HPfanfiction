Fair enough. I only watched the first movie, and that was when my sister forced me too. I thought 'cool a new take on a vampire, immune too sunlight as well, sounds promising.' I regret that day so, so, so much. Why did they have to sparkle. In what world does a predator who sparkles make sense. Don't even get me started on the cardboard bella who shows no emotions. I'm upset that i even remember that much.

My theory was always that sunlight killed vampires, because something in it basically aged them hundreds of years in seconds without the bonus trait of forever looking young.
