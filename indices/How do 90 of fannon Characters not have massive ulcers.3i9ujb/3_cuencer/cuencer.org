If i see shouted or screamed more than twice in a chapter in a non sequitur fashion, thats an immediate ctrl w. it shows immaturity in the writing if the author does not understand how actual conversation works. People do not shout out of nowhere for no reason with no buildup. They do not scream at someone for disagreeing. They hiss, they spit, they grind out, but they do not scream at Snape for being mean to them in the middle of their first class.
