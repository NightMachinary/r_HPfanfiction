I feel this way though, from what I've seen, it has a lot to do with the overuse of exclamation points. I see it all the time and it just comes off as shouting even though I can tell that's not necessarily what the author meant and if they did mean that then it's just bad writing.

Those things need to be used sparingly, writers. In most situations, using an adjective to describe the tone would have been far more appropriate.
