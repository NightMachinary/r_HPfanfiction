It's not just you. All-caps can be VERY satisfying when done correctly. You have to be angry along with the character when he/she yells. Harry's breakdown in Dumbledore's office was so well done in my opinion.

Problem with all-caps, though: when done incorrectly, it's annoying and tiring. I once read a fanfiction where Harry started yelling five (relatively short) chapters into the story. Eeh, yeah, I'll pass. Threw me off the story completely.
