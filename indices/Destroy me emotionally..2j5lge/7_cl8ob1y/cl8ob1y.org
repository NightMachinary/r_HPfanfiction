[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/The-Double-Agent][The Double Agent]] is good (real tear jerker, that one) and so is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]]. They are both one shots, though, if a bit longer then usual. If you have /a lot/ of time, I'll recommend you read this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment it began]] I'm sure I cried at some points even if it's been some time since I read it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]] is also great. I just finished it a few days ago and it's still being updated.
