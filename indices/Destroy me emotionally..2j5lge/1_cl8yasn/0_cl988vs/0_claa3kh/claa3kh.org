You know the saying, there's a fine line between love and hate, yeah I'm on that line. I don't know whether to hate you for giving me the worst case of the feels ( I'm not going to lie I shed a few man tears) or love you for re-igniting my love for Hedwig and showing me an extremely well written fic.
