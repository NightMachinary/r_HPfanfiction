I've posted this before, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3461008/1/Survivor][Survivor]]. It's the only piece of fiction that has ever brought me to tears and I say that with genuine honesty. It's not too terribly wrong, but it is incredibly effective, dealing with themes like loss of a loved one and acceptance of death. I actually think that it is one of my favorite stories ever, to be honest.
