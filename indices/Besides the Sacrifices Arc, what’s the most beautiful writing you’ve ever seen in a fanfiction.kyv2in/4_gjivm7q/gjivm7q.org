If you like sacrafices arc, you will probably love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8873683/chapters/20344381][Broken Mind, Fractured Soul]] by sensiblyTainted. Harry Potter watched his mother die when he was fifteen months old, a piece of Voldemort's soul invaded his own, Vernon abused him, Petunia tore him to shreds with her hateful words, and Lockhart molested him throughout Second-year. After all that trauma, is it any wonder Harry created multiple personalities to deal with it all? In Harry's third year, Severus Snape decides to do something about it. He gives Harry therapy in secret, and this opens Harry up to a friendship with Neville Longbottom, another victim of Lockhart's perversions, and Draco Malfoy who can understand Harry's Slytherin alter better than anyone else. Even though the premise is very different to sacrafices, they have similar vibes, and styles of writing.
