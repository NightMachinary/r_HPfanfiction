surrogate by 17734 is phenomenal and elegant writing; my only complaint is that a few paragraphs feel like they're copied from a psychology/sociology textbook while Voldemort is explaining his views to others.

There is one line that really stands out to me in a different fic, Vacillation by fairmaidofkent. It's at the very end: "He would slaughter legions for her or no one at all; whatever it took to keep her by his side" idk something felt very disturbing but beautiful about that notion of love to me.
