I quit Sacrifices after the third book, so we probably have different tastes.

However, one of the most 'beautiful' stories I've read is Esama's /Death and the Boy/ linkao3(1115380). It's short, but I thought it was truly lyrical writing that was both effective and affective. The only thing I didn't respond positively to were the rather pretentious (imho) little titles throughout.

I think writing in the ubiquitously-recommended /Cauterize/ is also beautiful in its way.
