Well i'm not sure how many points i'll earn but how about Harry going back in time so he can give a diary to his 11 year old self just before his 1st year. He makes friends with Sally the Basilisk, hires mercenaries to take out the deatheaters, and doesn't end up with hermione or ginny (marries susan).

The story is called Diary of Time by joemjackson
