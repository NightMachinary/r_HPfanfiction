This is the one that got me into the whole time travel thing many years ago. MoD, powerful, morally gray Harry goes back in time and teams up with Voldemort. It's /technically/ Voldemort/Harry, but they are both too busy and too stubborn for that to go anywhere, so don't let it deter you if you don't like the pairing. Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw, has a whole new cast of friends. Screws with Dumbledore a little. (And with everyone else as well, really.) It's a really fun read.
