Try linkffn(Pranking the Tournament by Gardevoir687). Harry finds out that he was entered into the Tournament under the aegis of the Salem Witches' Academy and decides to run with it. Complete.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Descendant Covenant by Jim-ruggeri). I lost interest about a dozen chapters in. Harry gets gender swapped in 7th year by an artifact in DADA class. It looked to me as though it was heading towards a fem!Harry/Draco pairing.

linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter). Maybe not quite what you're looking for, but I certainly enjoyed it. Multicross with Sailor Moon and Ranma 1/2. Harry apparates to Jusenkyou by accident and falls in the Pool of Drowned Sailor Moon. Has a completed sequel.

Most of the others I'm aware of, I don't consider to be very good. I will mention these two, though:

linkffn(2 Girls, 1 Cup by Luan Mao). Crack. The Goblet turn Harry female because of a misspelling. Complete.

linkffn(Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived by Lord Jeram). Harry is male, but everyone sees him as the Girl Who Lived. Incomplete.
