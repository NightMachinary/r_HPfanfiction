The fuck kind of name is Yennefer?

Out of that list, the least offensive would probably be Evelyn. Sure, it doesn't have the flower name theme (but I hate flower names, so whatever), but it doesn't feel like a wish fulfillment name or utter nonsense.

I apologize to all Yennefers I have offended with this post. But not to their parents.
