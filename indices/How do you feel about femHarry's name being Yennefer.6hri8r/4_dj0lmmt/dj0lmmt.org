Most names given to fem!Harry either don't have the same "feel" that Harry does for me (ordinary name, classic, simple). They're easier to remember when they start with an "H" -- Holly, Harriett, Henrietta. The one name I'll give a pass to is Violet since it has the right "feel."

But, out of your list given, I'd go with Iris. It's not bound to confuse people like Lily is and it's a classic name, if a bit rare.
