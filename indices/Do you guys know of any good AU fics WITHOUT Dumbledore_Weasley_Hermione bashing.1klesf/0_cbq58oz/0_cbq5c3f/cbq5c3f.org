I don't really have a strong preference for how deep the AU, I just want something, plot-wise, to be tweaked. Maybe Harry's childhood is different, or maybe some events have different consequences. Additional criteria: I like both het and slash, and I like Harry/Ginny but I also like reading Harry paired with other characters. However, I do not enjoy Harry/Hermione (or Harry/Ron, for that matter). All that said, I also really like gen fics that don't focus on any ships.

Basically, I'm just looking for something where stuff happens differently than in canon, whether by a lot or by a little, but the trio are all still best friends, and the Weasleys are still good people, and Dumbledore is still Harry's mentor/grandfather figure.
