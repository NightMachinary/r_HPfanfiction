My all-time favorite fanfiction would have to be Lightning on the Wave's Sacrifices Arc. It spans out all 7 books and she creates a completely separate but believable world. I cannot recommend this fic enough, if you read any at all please read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][this]] one.
