Alright, some rather brutal honesty is incoming.

  The Wizarding World is too complex for [Palpatine]
#+end_quote

This makes absolutely zero sense. Since you are referring to him as Chancellor Palpatine instead of Emperor, he is at this time the head of the /Galactic/ Republic, composed of hundreds, if not thousands, of systems and trillions of life forms (composed of a vast multitude of different species). Wizarding Britain (which I'm assuming is what you mean by Wizarding World) doesn't even equal 0.0004% of the population of Coruscant, the /capital/ of the Galactic Republic.

  Palpatine himself feels very sad that he can't use magic and feels unworthy of Bertha's love, but he's still torn between his political duties and his new girlfriend.

I have /literally/, and when I say literally I mean in the primary definition sense of the word, never read, seen or contemplated a sentence I have loathed more.

Palpatine is a /Sith Lord/. The only emotions he allows himself to feel are anger, hatred, rage, and fury. Every other emotion is turned into one of these to fuel their power. As the Code of the Sith says,

  Peace is a lie, there is only passion.

  Through passion, I gain strength.

  Through strength, I gain power.

  Through power, I gain victory.

  Through victory, my chains are broken.
#+end_quote

Love, friendship, companionship, are all chains to be broken, realized through their strength. Also, as I've said before, he is a /Sith Lord/. What the shit does he need magic for? He has telekinesis, limited telepathy, empathic senses, heightened physical capabilities (senses, strength, reflexes, endurance, hand-eye coordination, agility), real time limited battle precognition, foresight, can shoot lightning out of his hands, mind control, and /the list goes on/. What the shit is he missing out on? The ability to turn a cactus into a pumpkin? Whoop de fucking do. Doesn't need to worry about the Unforgivables. No way someone who is able to dodge blaster bolts and /lasers/ will be hit by a Killing Curse, the Imperious Curse would be thrown off very easily, and the Cruciatus Curse is just going to make him angrier.

  Things go wrong when the UK is ambushed by Krall and his swarm

  They want revenge against the Wizarding World for the aurors destroying stuff on Altamid.

  now Palpatine, Sirius, Snape, Kirk, Spock, and Uhura team up and pursue Krall.

... Oh, I get it now. You're just fucking with us.
