The "complete" tag was only added to FFN a few years back. Anyone who wrote before that tag was added, generally stories from pre-2010, needed to log back in and mark it complete. If they have stopped posting, the fic will be forever unmarked.

Your best bet, usually, is to look at the chapter index. If the last chap is titled some variation of "epilogue" you are generally good to go. Sometimes you can do a quick check of the last chap too, as said in the thread.
