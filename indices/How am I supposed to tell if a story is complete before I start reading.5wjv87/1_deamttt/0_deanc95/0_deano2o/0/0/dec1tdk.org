Well you could always embrace the madness and just read incomplete stories. Endings are overrated anyway.

FWIW, I don't think many people survive among fanfic readers reading only complete stories. You run out of those eventually and one day, you just cave. It gets easier after the first.

Temporal Beacon is totally great, totally worth a read, and incomplete status be damned, it's fine anyway.
