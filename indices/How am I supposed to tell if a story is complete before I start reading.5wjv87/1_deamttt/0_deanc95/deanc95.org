Never been to AO3, I mostly use ff.net when looking around. But I haven't seen that marker, though I have noticed there are some story descriptions that state if it's completed. I don't think it's exactly 100% especially for stories that were long running or very long in general. But that's useful to know.

I guess I'd really like to know if HP and The Temporal Beacon is completed, that was what I was planning to read next; but like I said, I have trouble finding out.
