FF.net has a marker listing stories as 'Complete,' AO3 has the number of chapters be something similar to "20/20" if they're finished (whereas unfinished would usually be "20/??" or "20/30") and so on. Just pay a bit more attention to the stats and you'll be fine.

I don't deal with sites dedicated to HP fanfiction often, so I can't help you there /specifically,/ but my advice will still probably help anyway.
