Like everyone else has already said, there's a "Complete" tag.

But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's finished. I have read a couple that were marked as "Complete", and they just abruptly wrapped everything up in a chapter or two, leaving me with the impression that the author gave up.

The safest bet is to read the reviews, but they often contain spoilers.
