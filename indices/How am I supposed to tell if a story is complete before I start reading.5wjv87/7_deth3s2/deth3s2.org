I stumbled upon a lot of new fanfictions on AO3 who are listed as completed after a few chapters in but aren't actually (plot is unfinished and author's note clearly talking about the next chapter). I use the "complete only" filter a lot and I guess the author list it as complete so more people like me will find it.

Though I understand why someone would use this trick, it annoys me and I usually stop reading it.
