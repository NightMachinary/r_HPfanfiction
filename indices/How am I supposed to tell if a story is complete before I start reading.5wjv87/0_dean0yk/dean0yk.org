Fanfiction stories have a Status field that the author can set to Complete when finished. It's done manually, so there may be finished stories that aren't marked.

You might also check the last chapter to see if there is any indication that the story is finished.

Let's try an example: linkffn(11333287) - second line under the summary includes Status: Complete.
