I have seen that, but those are few and far between. I'd always just thought that it was the author changing the description at the top.

Also, I know I could check the last chapter, but that is dangerous territory for me. I'm pretty bad about accidentally reading something I'd rather not yet, and it's not always going to be painfully clear from reading the author notes.
