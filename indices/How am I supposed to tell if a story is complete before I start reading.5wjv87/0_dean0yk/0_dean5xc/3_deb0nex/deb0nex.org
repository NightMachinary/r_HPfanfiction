  I have seen that, but those are few and far between.

Yeah, it wasn't always there so if the authors didn't come back after it got added their stories aren't going to have it. It's mostly an issue with older stuff.

That said, you could always check the author's profile as some do keep a list of which stories of theirs are completed there. And there is always checking the chapter titles as finding one called “epilogue” or “the end” is fairly telling.
