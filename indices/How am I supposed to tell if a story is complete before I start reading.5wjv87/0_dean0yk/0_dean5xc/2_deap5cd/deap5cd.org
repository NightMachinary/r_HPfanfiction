As an add on, when filtering your search on FFn where is says /status: All/ you can change that to complete and it will remove all of the ones not marked complete. That way you don't have to scroll through all of the fics looking for the complete tag. You are missing out however on some of the better written fics, sure they aren't finished and that's frustrating but there are some gems.
