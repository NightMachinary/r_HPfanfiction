Ayyy, a wild self-promoter appeared! Haha, I'm happy to answer any follow-up questions, but I'll try to speak to your points in my summary.

I'm co-writing a fic right now where character development is quite literally our main interest. Characters have already changed and grown and we're not even a fourth of the way through what we have planned for the series... We're currently nearing the end of book 1 of 4. It's mostly gen angst/tragedy & mystery, with a sprinkle of romance here and there. Split POV, canon-divergent, no smut whatsoever. Eventual mentor/adoption Snape but currently he's an asshole (this won't completely go away, but at least he won't be /as much/ of an asshole lol). Large cast of characters, many of whom are OCs.

Uhhh I think that's the rundown? Lemme know if you've any questions. But if you're interested, you can find it on both ffnet and ao3. The latter has chapter images. :)
