I'm not entirely sure it counts, but I thought I'd throw it out there since you mentioned bitterness. In Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, she seems to be being consumed by tiredness(?) and the character development deals a lot with expectations, free will, and her own morality. I would say the shift really started after the trauma in her first year, but it hasn't been completed yet. Its perhaps less obvious and the fic is very absurdist, but I think it's well done. You mentioned human to god and in some ways it's an inversion of that.
