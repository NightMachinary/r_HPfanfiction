Characterisation: There's a couple of moments where Harry doesn't quite feel like Harry. The most obvious one is the underlying tone of the piece. Harry's emotions were mostly fear/terror/nervousness. It's not that someone wouldn't feel terrified by their wedding- but that Harry has always desired a family, and therefore there should be (at least) a small part of joy. This can be done by carefully selecting your verbs and adjectives.

Showing v telling: a couple of moments felt very exposition-y. Especially the bit about his memories flashing before him, his hands and the bits with Ron & Hermione. This is because the reader is given Harry's interpretations and thoughts rather than his reactions- which would have been nice if your piece was more focused on thoughts. Rather, I feel you should have focused more on Harry's actions and reactions and let the reader guesstimate the thoughts and feelings.
