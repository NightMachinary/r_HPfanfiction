Since Of Wizards and Heroes and Steve and the Barkeep are already mentioned....

Honorable mention: linkao3(17926664) - This one appears to be past the climax with only a couple chapters left, and it's being updated every other week or so. It's a really fun read. (Punching Gods) *Edit* - Today's update explains that there's 1-2 chapters, including epilogue, remaining. So this is safe-ish to read lol

(Btw: I'm not a huge fan of slash - there's a whopping 3 slash fics that I like - but Of Wizards and Heroes is one of them. You might want to give it a shot anyway.)
