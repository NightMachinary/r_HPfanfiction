Seems to be mostly set in transformers rather than hp. You might find slightly more purchase in one of those subreddits.

Id also encourage you to limit the amount of handwaving you do via magic/fanfiction. Just a little extra time to add in a dimensional gateway or something that comes back into play later will really help stabilize your world for your readers.

Of course, if youre just wanted to get fun ideas onto a page, then the worlds are your sandbox. Ppl interact with writing in very different ways, so you can really do whatever strikes your fancy.
