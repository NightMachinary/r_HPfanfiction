  By some twist of fate, the Hungarian Horntail takes an interest in Harry Potter, and thus, it decides to become his new mother, after hearing how badly he was treated at the Dursley's and also at Hogwarts. Nothing will ever make him feel unwelcomed or unwanted again. Not on her scales, and she would make sure of it! [Harry x Mother Hungarian Horntail]
