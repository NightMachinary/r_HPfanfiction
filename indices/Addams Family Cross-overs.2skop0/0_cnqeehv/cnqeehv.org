Jeconais has a great series 'Perfect Slytherins', with Harry raised as Wednesday's sibling. First through third year are complete, fourth year gets occasional updates. I think they're only on his site: [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/]]

Direct link to first story: [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/]]

I think you need to register there to read.

The only other fic I read and enjoyed that is still available is this one:\\
