I'm here with Naruto crossovers. Behold! ffnbot!slim ffnbot!directlinks

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15685944/chapters/36445827][Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds]] - from the "Lily and the art of being Sisyphus" series. Over 300k words now. Fem!Harry (Eleanor Lily Potter) is transported to naruverse and befriends Minato.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5852062][Multicolour Post Its]] - this one is my favorite. Master of Death!Harry is Kyuubi and is sealed inside Naruto. Also, Naruto once asks for the power to see spirits and Harry lets him, but later Naruto regrets it and wants it gone but it can't be reversed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7404024][Ninja Who Lived]] - after the final battle Master of Death!Harry wakes as ~10yo Naruto. I like the world-building around the "master of death" title and around deities, it's pretty interesting and what I like in MoD!Harry fics. He still can summon spirits, so he has Snape as his spymaster (who agrees because it takes him out of hell for a while) and Uzumaki Mito as his teacher. Pretty interesting fic, though by the end it was getting strange.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/554724][Find Me a White Knight Cloaked in Black]] - this one is very good, too. Only 23k words and abandoned, but it was still good. MoD!Harry is an adult and lives peacefully in Konoha and is famous around his neighbourhood for fixing broken things, breaking fights between shinobi and other things.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2429072][Loyalty]] - a complete one! Harry is transported to the naruverse and lives in his animagus form - a dragon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7357616][Harry Potter and the Cloaked Death]] - I started reading that, it was good. MoD!Harry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11247557][Konoha's Silent Death]] - haven't started but it looks promising and interesting. MoD!Harry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10672002][The Biggest Toad in the Puddle]] - haven't started but it looks promising and interesting. MoD!Harry
