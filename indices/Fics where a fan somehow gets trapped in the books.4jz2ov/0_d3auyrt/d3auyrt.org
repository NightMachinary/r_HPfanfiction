I've toyed with the idea of writing something LIKE this. I've never written any fanfiction (or any fiction) before. The book would be based off of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4fgmuc/youre_sent_into_the_hp_world_at_the_beginning_of/d290ssr][this comment]]. It would not be exactly what you're looking for, but it would be a person given this limited scope of knowledge. If I do it, I'm leaning towards it being less of a "person transported into the series" and more like a kid who wakes up with these words in his head but he has no idea what to make of them. I think it could certainly change the trajectory of the story and would have to really focus on this kid, his relationship with the main characters, and how this kid and his knowledge would reshape this story. Or I could give this knowledge to somebody already in the story, working with either a small side character (Dean? Ernie? Blaise?), a relatively larger character (Neville? Luna? Gred or Forge?) or one of the main characters (of which, the only one that makes sense to me is Hermione). The idea of an OC character is compelling because it gives me a lot of freedom but using an existing character makes it easier to show how the knowledge would make the story different, rather than the presence of this OC character and the knowledge makes things different.

The idea of writing though is extremely intimidating, not to mention near impossible with my current work schedule.
