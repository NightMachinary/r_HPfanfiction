I remember one where Snape ends up in charge of the sex ed lecture due to losing a coin toss with McGonagall. He covered the material correctly, but he clearly didn't enjoy it.

One quote I remember: "There are three methods of stimulation: manual, oral, and sexual. For best results, use in that order."
