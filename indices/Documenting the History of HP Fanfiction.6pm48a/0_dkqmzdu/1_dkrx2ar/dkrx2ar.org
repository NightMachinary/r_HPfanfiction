Yule Ball Fics reminded me that there was a period where Sex Ed class fic were popular. The premise often involved Hermione being horrified to learn that her classmates knew pretty much nothing, and pushing the staff to introduce a mandatory class where pairs of students were required to take care of the magical equivalent of those electronic babies. They were almost an excuse to draw weird ships out of a hat, but I remember Ron/Pansy being a very common side pairing.
