There has been Snape-defending from the very start of fanfiction, though usually it was more fangirl squeeing about how hot and sexy Snape was. Fics back then tended to tone down his nastiness quite a bit, and very many of them included an OC to be his love interest, such as the many female Defence teachers.

Luna, after she was introduced in canon, very quickly became the darling of the fandom and has pretty much remained so ever since. There was in fact a rather notable surge of Ron/Luna fics, in the time when Ron was still fairly well-liked by fanficcers... Luna was the perfect love interest to give to Ron, so that Hermione would be freed up for Harry. (Besides, the scene at the Hogwarts Express where she says she wouldn't have minded going to the Yule Ball with him, and then laughs hysterically at his joke, was enough for a lot of fans to cement the pairing.) As Ron's popularity sank, though, Luna's default pairing (aside from Harry) quickly became Neville.

One interesting fic to read if you want a closer look at the HP fanfiction scene pre-OOTP is [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=656&chapno=1][The Tough Guide to Harry Potter]] at Sugarquill. This is a parody of "The Tough Guide to Fantasyland" and essentially an alphabetical lexicon over characters, tropes and cliches that were common in HP fanfics back in 2002.

Some gems:

- Arabella Figg varied hugely in description since nobody knew whether "Mrs Figg" was the same character as the Arabella Figg mentioned by Dumbledore at the end of GOF. Everybody agreed there was a connection, but quite a few people thought "Arabella" was a hitherto unseen younger relative and a witch.
- Every single animal except Crookshanks had a tendency to be revealed as having been an Animagus in disguise all along.
- Harry was actually less likely than Hermione to be the main character of a fic (though I do think the fic underestimates his popularity among fans when it calls him "rather a secondary" character).
- Nobody knew if Blaise Zabini was a boy or a girl.

But a lot of things remain unchanged. For instance, Draco Malfoy still has the "bad boy" thing going for him, Hagrid is still often given a smaller role or not included at all, Sirius's characterisation still swings between several extremes (the petty bully, the fun-loving goof, the man who hangs onto his sanity by a thread...) and Slytherin still tends to be viewed as the "cool" house.
