That's a really great resource over at SugarQuill! Thanks! Hopefully that website doesn't go down anytime soon... It's been inactive for quite a while...

  Every single animal except Crookshanks had a tendency to be revealed as having been an Animagus in disguise all along.

And ironically, now we have the theory that Crookshanks was actually Regulus Black (despite the fact that Kreacher /saw/ him die - but since when have /facts/ ever gotten in the way of fan theories?). Back in the day, I myself wondered if Trevor the Toad was going to turn out to be Umbridge, but JKR had already used that plot twist with Scabbers/Wormtail in PoA, and I didn't think she was likely to do it twice.
