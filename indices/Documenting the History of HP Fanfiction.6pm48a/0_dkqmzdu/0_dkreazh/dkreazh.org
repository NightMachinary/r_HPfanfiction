Some very detailed notes for posterity. Thank you.

I haven't been reading HP fanfics for as long as some people have, but I do remember Yule Ball fics being quite popular when I first got into fic, so clearly, /that/ stayed trendy for a long time.

Also, going back and reading some early Harry/Luna fics, I see that there was a lot of fan speculation as to what Luna's father was like, since Xeno wasn't introduced properly until the last book. As a result, there were a lot of amusing OCs created: some authors correctly assumed he was absent-minded, while others thought he was actually /less/ odd than Luna, and that Luna's eccentricities came from her mother instead. (Which doesn't make sense - it's like they forgot Xeno edited /The Quibbler/.)

As far as Dumbledore-bashing goes... it seems to me that the rise in popularity of that trope has gone hand-in-hand with the rise of Snape-defending, ever since the last book when we finally learned both characters' backstories. In fact, it's rather surprising how popular Snape/Hermione pairings have become recently. Although clearly, judging by how far back Draco/Hermione goes, there's a long history of fic writers wanting to pair Hermione up with a "bad boy".
