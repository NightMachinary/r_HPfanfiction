I got into HP fanfic in my early teens, back during the three-year-wait between the fourth and fifth book, and I definitely remember the fandom being very different.

- Dumbledore-bashing was nearly non-existent. Dumbledore in fanfics was usually positively portrayed, even if he tended to not do a whole lot other than be in charge whenever the good guys had meetings, and play matchmaker for his students and teachers.
- Likewise, Weasley-bashing wasn't nearly as prominent. The Weasleys were generally accepted as good people, and Ron didn't get a lot of hatred (though a lot of fics did end up killing him off so that Harry could angst about it). Ginny's name was almost uniformly believed to be "Virginia" and she was portrayed as shy and unassuming. (I remember feeling vindicated when book five showed that she only acted like that around Harry -- I still remembered Ron's comment in the second book that it was weird to see her act that timid,)
- Yule Ball fics were quite prominent for a while, because a lot of fans had misunderstood and thought the Yule Ball was an annual thing at Hogwarts for fourth-years and up.
- For a long time the popular theory was that Harry was the Heir of Gryffindor, and that the last book would feature him team up with the Heirs of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff to take down Voldemort. It was widely accepted that Susan Bones was the Heir of Hufflepuff, and that was why we saw her Sorting in the first movie.
- Fics where Hermione showed up back at Hogwarts for her fifth year and had become immensely hot, after having grown tits and/or some American cousin had given her makeovers and introduced her to Hot Topic, flourished. The phrase "Hermione had changed a lot over the summer" was infinitely quoted and mocked, as was the classic "she had grown curves in all the right places."
- Fics where Hermione turned out to really be a pure-blood witch whose pure-blood parents had tragically died and she had been adopted by Muggles, were extremely common too. Her Muggle parents sometimes turned out to be abusive, but not always -- in any case, when she found out her true heritage she always embraced it wholly. Usually this was done as an exuse to pair her up with Draco Malfoy, but again, not always.
- More Hermione: Fics where she became Head Girl in her seventh year were common -- for some reason being Head Girl meant that she no longer slept in the girls' dormitories but got her own "appartment" in Hogwarts... that she shared with the Head Boy. Who was usually Draco Malfoy, and this was always a thinly-veiled excuse to have them end up together.
- Lots and lots of self-insert exchange students from America.
- And lots of female Defence teachers, usually extremely competent, smoking hot and usually hooking up with either Snape or Sirius.
