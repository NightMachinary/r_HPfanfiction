I started reading HP fic around 2000, and slash fic was already around, although I can't speak to how prevalent it was at the time because I wasn't seeking it out. I also wouldn't call slash on its own a trope, and its popularity within this fandom can't be tracked back to one fic the same way the "Draco in leather pants" trope could potentially be.

If you're at all interested in diving into the history of slash, though, start with Star Trek (specifically Spock/Kirk, which is often cited as the origin of the term), and the physical zines which were published in the 70s. IIRC, slash writers for Man from Uncle were really prolific as well.

Honestly, a lot of the fandom history and fanfic history goes hand-in-hand, and has already been documented on sites like fanlore and the now archived Fandom Wank. But if you want an Adventure, track down the Msscribe story. That's a fun read.
