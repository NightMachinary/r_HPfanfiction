While I can't see Romilda Vane, a vapid girl a year or two below Harry actually /raping/ him, I could easily see this sort of fallout as being very plausible after being enslaved with a powerful love potion like /amortentia/ (same deal with Tom Riddle Sr. from Merope doing this to him, too/)./

See, this is where rape, as repugnant and /wrong/ as it is in reality, would make a logical and disturbing plot catalyst/device in fiction, not just the "rape porn" stories people write (yes, they exist: It's mostly just a 'kink' thing to them than the actual horrors of rape, the violation of mind and body, though).
