  While I can't see Romilda Vane, a vapid girl a year or two below Harry actually /raping/ him

It's canon that she attempted to dose him with love potions though. I'm not sure the vapidity plays into the unlikelihood of it; in some ways I think that makes it more likely, since it means she's thoughtless enough to not care about the effects of her actions on Harry.

And I think it's a bit more believable when love potions are involved - that kind of thing might not even be seen as rape in the wizarding world. I mean even in our society a lot of people still don't immediately equate coerced consent with outright rape, even though the former can be just as damaging to the psyche as the latter. Naturally something like that could be magnified in the wizarding world, given that love potions actually make you want to perform the act while under the influence.
