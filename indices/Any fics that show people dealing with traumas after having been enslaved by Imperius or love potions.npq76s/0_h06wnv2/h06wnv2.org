In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617/chapters/32648763#workskin][An Hour of Wolves]] Harry gets raped by Romilda Vane via love potion and struggles with the trauma afterwards. The story's mostly about him coming to terms with what happened and his friends trying to help him through it. It's really well-written, if incomplete.
