Could you imagine how Harry would feel if a desperate character, such as a Ginny seen in a shitty Indie-Harry story or if another girl in his year, such as Daphne Greengrass or even someone like Susan Bones, did this? He'd wake up from a living nightmare to find himself having been with the girl for a year...

And she can't understand why he "hadn't fallen in love with her" by then, much like how it was implied as an explanation to why Merope stopped feeding him (Riddle Sr.) the love potion.

Harry being rehabilitated by his friends while his "wife" tries to desperately get him back via various means e.g. emotional blackmail, legally, et cetera, could be a thrilling read.

Especially if children were created. Holy shit.
