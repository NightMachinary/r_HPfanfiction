I wrote one about the problematic nature of love potions, even in established relationships. Hermione apprentices under Master Slughorn and makes her project all about a universal theory of love potions after Ron doses her with one in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28292328/chapters/69327945][Fridays I'm In Love]]. There's also a bunch of war-related trauma recovery for both Hermione and Snape. Nightmares, fight-flight-freeze responses, searching for meaning and control, relationship fallout, self-doubt, and more. Post-war SSHG romance complete at 27k words. Marked with a noncon warning due to the dubious nature of a surreptitious love potion.
