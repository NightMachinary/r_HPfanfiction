The author Slide has an entire series through the eyes of 4 Slytherins in the year above Harry. I cannot recommend it enough - it's fantastic. Excellent plot, characterization, and writing. The first is linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba). I also remember reading a series that followed Astoria Greengrass, but I don't remember the name.
