I know this is not answering your question but until now I never realized that the terms were gender-based (duh obvious). I always assumed that witchcraft, as the name suggests, would deal with the practical applications of magic and wizardry would be used for more abstract concepts since wizarding is used for gender neutral concepts (e.g. Wizarding World, wizarding money, ordinary wizarding levels, etc.)
