Witches in folklore are associated with a person of any gender that practices magic and their practice is called 'witchcraft'. Prior to Harry Potter, wizards were associated with elderly long white bearded men that wore pointy blue hats with stars on them, who served as the mentor to the hero, which indicated that they had transcended beyond simple spell casting and their magic was very abstract.

It was JK who made this distinction as based on sex. So I am not even sure whether she's an actual feminist.
