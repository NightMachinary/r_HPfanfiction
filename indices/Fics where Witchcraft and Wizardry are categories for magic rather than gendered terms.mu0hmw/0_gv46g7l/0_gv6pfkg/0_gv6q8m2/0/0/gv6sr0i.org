Well people tend to be petty when they are jealous. Ron also got petty with Harry when he got way too much attention. Draco was petty with Harry when Harry rejected his friendship. So Fleur is not such a special case tbh. Tonks had a child... if a mother won't take care of him... I think that the whole point is to vilify Lupin who left them. Lavender was hated by Hermione who was Harry's friend, who also felt that she was stealing his friend away. I have no explanation for Molly though.
