I do know of one, but... rule 8. Its a DARK fic, even if there is no explicit scenes I can recall. But it discusses a lot of what you are talking about: Wizardry and Witchcraft as magical arts. Its a rather popular series and fully finished. The Black Queen series. PM me if you are interested in a link, I wont drop one here, even if it is just FFN.
