I remember a story which was based on this premise.

Witch and wizard were gender neutral terms. Witch stood for people who could use magic but without the support of strong magic source they could not cast spell. That is why they concentrated around magic rich places or around a strong wizard. However, they were able to do things that did not require magic heavy spell casting like potion and divination.

Wizards were those who were able to use their own innate magic to change the world around themselves. Charms and spells were their main focus.

Above them went to Mages who has much more power than an average wizard and would be able to use transfiguration to a great extent without tiring out ( Think how Dumbledore used it in the Ministry battle in the 5th book).
