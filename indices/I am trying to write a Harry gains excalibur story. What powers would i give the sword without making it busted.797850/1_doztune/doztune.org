Null Magic - The sword is immune to magic that is not its own. No force shields are going to block this bad boy. Also good for beating down magically reinforced doors and intercepting projectile spells.

Self Maintenance - Excalibur is always sharp, shiny, and clean. If broken the blade will shatter into pieces that are relatively simple to place back together. Once all pieces are placed back together the sword will reform completely. When broken each piece seeks to rejoin the others and fate is manipulated in tiny but unceasing ways to see that the sword is eventually whole once again.

Aura of Authority - While wearing or wielding the sword people will unconsciously give proper respect to the wearer for any position or office he holds if said people are within the lands the position or office is held in. Only works when speaking on behalf of said office or position.

Just Cause - Anyone killed by Excalibur for a just cause will see their magics related to that cause die as well. I.E. if you curse the Queen and the King kills you for it the curse on the Queen will end. Also works for normally incurable magics such as lycanthropy.
