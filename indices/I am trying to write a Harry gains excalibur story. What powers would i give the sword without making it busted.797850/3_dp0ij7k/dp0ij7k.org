As fun as adapting myth to modern storytelling can be, I would avoid as much of the extreme powers others have listed here. Excalibur should be a powerful weapon, but don't give it absolute power over anything, or else the story becomes about the sword and not about the hero.

Awe-inducing effect? Absolutely. Able to cleave through armor, troll hide, even dragon scale - now that's something even a wizard can appreciate.

Able to force the truth from people? That's a power that destroys dramatic tension. I can believe someone would report that they felt incapable of lying with that thing held at their neck, but it wasn't a divine power of cleaving truth from lies; just the power of self-preservation overriding their sense of creativity.

Basically, make it worthy of the name without providing abilities beyond the needs of the story.
