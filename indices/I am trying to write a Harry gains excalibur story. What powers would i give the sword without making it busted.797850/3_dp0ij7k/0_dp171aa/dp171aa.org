  Able to force the truth from people? That's a power that destroys dramatic tension
#+end_quote

It can be done, if it compels truthfunless rather than the truth. The Wheel of Time does a good job of showing the difference between telling the truth and not lying.

You could easily rachet up the dramatic tension if Harry doesn't realize the difference and that the truth he heard was not necessarily the truth they said.
