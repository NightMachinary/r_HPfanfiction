I don't know if you've read The Iron Druid series by Kevin Hearne, but there are a couple of faerie swords in that series. Wounds from one of them, Moralltach, are always fatal sort of like the basilisk venom-imbued Sword of Gryffindor. The other one, Fragarach, could pierce any armor. Those are both interesting abilities for the sword of a king or warlord to have. Compelling people in its presence to tell the truth could also come in handy as would glamour-dispelling.
