Just adding onto this comment.

Fragarach can cut through absolutely anything with ease, yes, but there's more.

It gives its wielder some control over wind.

Last and most certainly not least, if the wielder holds Fragarach to the neck of someone, that person is immobilized and is compelled to speak the truth - this is completely irresistible.
