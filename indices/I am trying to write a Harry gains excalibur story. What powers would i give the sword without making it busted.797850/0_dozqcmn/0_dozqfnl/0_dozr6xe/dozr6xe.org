You might want to look at my comment again, for more information on how the various powers of Excalibur could be used (I updated). But for some more information, you might want to look into Arthurian myth, from the poetry of Lord Tennyson, to the various cycles of Arthurian literature, and perhaps almost required reading would be Geoffrey of Monmouth's the /History of the Kings of Britain/. Other than that, Arthurian romances are great for learning about the characters that made up his court and the Round-Table.
