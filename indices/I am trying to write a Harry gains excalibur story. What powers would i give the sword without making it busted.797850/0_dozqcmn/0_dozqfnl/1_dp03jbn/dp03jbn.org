On top of what the other guy said, I suggest you have a listen to the Arthurian episodes of the Myths and Legends podcast for ideas about the general setting the sword comes from, without all the pointless guff in some of the tales (like seriously there's a lot of unecessary detail in some accounts because it was intended as historical fanfiction afaik)
