Does this make him the Once and Future King? If so you should definitely try to incorporate heavy Arthurian myth. Some powers to consider:

From the name /Caledfwlch/ (the Cornish/Welsh name for Excalibur), you get the translation of hard cleft, so the blade may be indestructible. The blade is said to cut iron or steel like wood, so it may be able to cut very easily through most anything, or perhaps everything. Or perhaps it is simply never dull, always wickedly sharp. From Wikipedia, they have a short section of the Mabinogion translated:

  Then they heard Cadwr Earl of Cornwall being summoned, and saw him rise with Arthur's sword in his hand, with a design of two chimeras on the golden hilt; when the sword was unsheathed what was seen from the mouths of the two chimeras was like two flames of fire, so dreadful that it was not easy for anyone to look. At that the host settled and the commotion subsided, and the earl returned to his tent.

This might establish an aura of fear or awe.

Other powers included preventing wounds of the scabbard-bearer (not the sword) from bleeding out, the sword itself blinding the wielder's foes, and perhaps any powers you may want to borrow from great swords of legend, including the similarly named, but probably not closely related, /Caladbolg/.

All of these powers are great, and a fair amount of them allow the wielder to contend with a variety of spells. An indestructible blade can be used to deflect or block many spells, including /Avada Kedavra/. A blade that can cut through anything makes a handy mage-, dragon-, or some other magical creature slayer. It can also destroy Horcruxes and perhaps can even cut right through magic, or perhaps just enchantments. An aura of fear or awe is good for inspiring followers, especially if he is to be king. The ability to not bleed out from wounds is remarkably useful for surviving many otherwise lethal spells, including the Entrail-Expelling curse. Blinding one's foes is extremely useful for preventing an enemy from successfully hitting you with most spells. For /Caladbolg's/ abilities, it was known for slaughtering entire armies and slicing off the tops of mountains, which is rather scary, since it suggests that the blade is able to cut extended from itself for perhaps a good hundred yards or more.
