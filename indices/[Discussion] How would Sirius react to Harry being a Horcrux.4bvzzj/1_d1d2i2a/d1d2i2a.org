There would be a huge argument between he and Harry if he saw the memory at the same time. Harry would argue based on that very thing: he'd die to protect his friends just like Sirius would. Sirius would be crushed and want to go with him, but Harry would then make Sirius promise to kill the snake.

They'd both know that, with Harry dead, Sirius wasn't going live much longer. Sirius would be fully intending to die in the final battle while taking as many death eaters and hopefully Voldemort with him.
