If he was still alive at the time he would be absolutely devastated. All he ever wanted to do was protect Harry, and for him to learn it was all for nothing would be pretty heart breaking for him I imagine. He would probably try to find another way to remove it, but who wouldn't I guess.

But if he was dead, like in the book, I would probably think he would be proud? Maybe he would see that sometimes it's necessary to sacrifice yourself? I don't know honestly.

I would love to read some fics where this situation happens though.
