I had a somewhat cracky idea to have one of those "summon another Harry who already defeated Voldemort fics" where instead of getting an alternate Harry the order accidentally summons a demon. Turns out getting summoning instructions from a book in Grimmauld Place wasn't the best idea.

Anyway your idea sounds like it could make a really fun fic, I hope you write it someday. My only suggestion that other people haven't already made is when Harry becomes a demon, I hope he doesn't still go by Harry. Kind of hard to take a demon named Harry seriously, lol.
