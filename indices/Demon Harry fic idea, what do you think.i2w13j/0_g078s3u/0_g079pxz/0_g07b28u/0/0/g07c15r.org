Cool. One last thought, are you familiar with the Transcendence AU of Gravity Falls fan fiction? If not that's fine, but if so you might be able to incorporate some of the demoney things from that. Eg. Harry is a demon, an agent of chaos. He's not human anymore, but he's not necessarily /evil/. He's perfectly fine doing kinda evil demon things, but his link back to his original humanity makes him want to be a more... /human/ kind of demon.
