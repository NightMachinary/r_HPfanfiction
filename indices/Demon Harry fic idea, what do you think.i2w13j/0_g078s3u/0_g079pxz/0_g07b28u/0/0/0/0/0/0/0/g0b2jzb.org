Well, I would base it on his personality. If he's super angry/violent/powerful then some black fire or lightning (or both) sound pretty demonic. But if he's a bit more thinking, more cold, then black ice and snow would be kinda cool. ;)

General stuff like flying is definitely a good idea, maybe some form of possession and mind reading? Small scale teleportation, telekinesis, fear aura, etc. Other than that I'm not sure.

(Hope this is helpful and not annoying)
