Sorry, didn't see ur notif! Harry's physical appearance can range from what I described, to human. There won't a any out of nowhere metamorphic abilities, and changing his body won't be fun. In order to appear human he has to shift and suppress parts of his body, its uncomfortable and like having an arm in a too tight sling. It's no so much he can't use all of his abilities, but if he does he will expose himself.
