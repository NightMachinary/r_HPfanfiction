About inspiration I would recommend trying a eviler version of Crowley from Good Omens. He is a demon and does the occasional “evil” deed (which mostly boils down to inconveniences and annoyances), but he does enjoy the comforts and good things in life to the point of not being completely on-board with the whole “end the world” plan.
