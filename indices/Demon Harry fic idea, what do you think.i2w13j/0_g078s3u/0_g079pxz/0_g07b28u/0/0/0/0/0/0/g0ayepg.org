His abilities aren't all worked out, but demon magic will be different than human magic. It's much more chaotic and wild, so Harry won't have an easy time with more intricate spellwork. I'm comparing it to trying to carve something with a sledgehammer lol. Elemental magic will be big, and I'm thinking of having him use either fire, air, darkness, ice or lightning (which I'm leaning towards). He'll be a fantastic flyer, and have an easy time with darker arts. And since his magic is so uncontrollable, I'm thinking of giving him a set of bracelet foci for the more blasty magic. Maybe he /can/ learn all the Elemental magic, but he has a natural affinity for one? If you have any ideas I'd love to hear them!
