Yeah I am, definitely went through the GF phase. His humanity would be a big part of his wish to go back to Hogwarts, he doesn't want to leave his life behind even if it means glamoring the heck out of his body. He'd be struggling with his morals all throughout, caught between sadistic apathy and the loving relationships he's built. Satan didn't give him much, so until his hand is forced Harry will try to be normal. Having the remnants of the summer to sort things out will definitely help him in the control department, but you can't ignore a demon at Hogwarts for long.
