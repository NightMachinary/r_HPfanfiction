You bring up good points. At this point in his life, harry is rather irritable so I'm thinking some cool lightning. Like someone ticks him off and then a big crash of thunder? OvO that sounds fun. As for the general stuff: yes,, very good ideas. I think Harry'd hold off on the more possessing and mind stuff, because he's probably a bit uncomfortable with the idea. He'll need to loosen up his morals a bit first lol. And >:O it's not annoying! Thanks so much for helping me figure this stuff out! It's very appreciated â™¡
