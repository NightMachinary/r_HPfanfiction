There is also [[https://www.royalroad.com/][royalroad]], it is rather famous. You can also check famous fanfiction forums that allow original content like [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/][sufficientvelocity]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/][spacebattles]] and [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com][questionablequesting]].

Lastly, although I dislike it heavily.. Qidian, the famous chinese webnovel publisher does have [[https://www.webnovel.com][an English site]] and supports original English content, though it's mostly about translation of chinese fantasy webnovels. It supports adwalls and premium chapter systems to allow the authors and translators the ability of getting some money, though I'm not sure about the details.
