Fictionpress is basically fanfiction.net but for original fiction. AO3, wattpad, and livejournal are all options, though AO3 is dominated by fan works and it's hard to find anything with livejournal, and I personally never go to watt pad because I've found the overall quality of the average work posted there to be rather poor.

On another note, I really don't think this post belongs on this particular subreddit.
