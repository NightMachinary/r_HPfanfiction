I see where you come from, description has always been a weakness of mine.

For the whole thing of Harry and Hermione being mad about the mutants being slaves has glossed over my mind.

For the Hermione and Harry anger about slaves beeing treated as mutants will be definetley used when the Death Eaters attack.

As for if the muggles think Wizards are considered mutants, it's safe to say the Dursleys do.

For the whole muggle population i'd have to give that more thought as to how they found out as to how the Wizards exist or if i can find a work around as to how they've ignored the wizarding population.

You've given me alot to think about and for that I thank you.

As to how I do the accents i use this website : [[https://www.payneful.co.uk/projects/french-accent-translator/#]] since I can hardly write an accent.
