I prefer to think that Fawkes didn't /know/ where he was going, or what was needed. I also prefer to think that Dumbledore didn't know the sword was hidden in the hat. I like to think that the Hat is supposed to go help any student in need, and he usually gets a house elf, but because the Chamber is Secret, he gets Fawkes involved.
