Hmm. Well it's not out yet and a quick search doesn't reveal the published installments (I suppose she took them down and I don't feel like using the Wayback Machine). I'd get it in November when it comes out but what the hell, the Kindle version is $18. If the hardcover has nice glossy illustrations I'd understand the $21 pricetag, which is still a hefty premium over regular hardcover prices, but for the Kindle edition it's far too much. Oh well, I'll wait until my library gets it.
