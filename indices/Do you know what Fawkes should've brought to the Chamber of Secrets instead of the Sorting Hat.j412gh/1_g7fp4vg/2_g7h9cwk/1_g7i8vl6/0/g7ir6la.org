Not really? It takes what, a month? To get a new basilisk. The components, an egg and a toad, are cheap and easy to get. A sticking charm keeps the thing in alignment and ensures that all you need to do is feed the toad.

The problem is that the basilisk would be small and weak at the beginning and take a lot of time to grow up to a useful size... But a small one for testing purposes would be manageable, if highly illegal, endavour.
