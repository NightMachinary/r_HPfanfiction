Given that peril-fetishes exist, as well as apparently people having a fetish for that snake from the Jungle Book movies (among other snakes)... There's probably /someone/ out there for whom a sixty-foot danger noodle, whose looks literally /can/ kill, pushes every button they have.\\
I guess that's why one of the rules of the Internet is "whatever it is, it's someone's fetish". Don't kinkshame that person.
