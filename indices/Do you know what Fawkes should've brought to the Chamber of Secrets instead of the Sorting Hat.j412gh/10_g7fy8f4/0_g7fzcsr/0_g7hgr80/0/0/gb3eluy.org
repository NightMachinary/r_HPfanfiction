I disagree. I think she has good characters at least better then the movie characters (though I do still enjoys the movies) . Also I don't think that character are out of sync which what they would actually do in situation. Also that emotions can tell you to do things not with in you character. The only part that i though was strange was when Harry started be very angry in the 5th book. But for a teen that is normal. Truthfully having them not stay completely to character is more realistic. But I think they stay pretty close to character.
