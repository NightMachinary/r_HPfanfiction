For the basilisk, yes that would have made sense. But I don't think Harry would have been able to destroy the Diary in that case, since he most likely wouldn't have gotten close enough to the basilisk to get bitten.

I'm sure Fawkes would have been able to get the book to Harry anyways but would he be able to think of going to the Basilisks corpse and use a tooth to destroy it?

So yeah, no fight, dead Ginny and a reborn Tom - don't think that'd have been a good ending.
