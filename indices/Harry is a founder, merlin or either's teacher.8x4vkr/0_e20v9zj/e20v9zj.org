A long journey home is probably the best story that uses this trope, which has fem!harry teaching Merlin.

Basilisk born has harry as Salazar Slytherin. I didn't much enjoy it, but it's quite popular so maybe it'll do it for you.

What's past is prologue by steerpike is my personal favourite of the “harry is Salazar” fics, but the meat of the story takes place in the present day.

Their are a couple “harry is Merlin stories” kicking about, but they are generally mediocre, and are mostly reincarnation or inheritance style fics, wherein the stories don't really feature the historical aspect at all.

I'll post some more if I think of them. I can't link anything as I'm on mobile.
