I love it!

The last part reminds me of a bit of an idea I had myself where Hermione (for "research purposes" or something) goes into the past to do whatever but fucks up critical events and lands in an alternate (bad) future. She sets out to help the future because she feels bad about having caused its existence -- even if nothing stops her from just going back (because that wouldn't actually remove the future, only her from it) -- and only after having saved the alternate world, goes back and tries to return to where she came from originally.
