"Oh no, it's the Unspeakables!"

Is what any time traveller, without exception, would say once they were collected. This one was no exception.

They had, of course, detected his arrival. It happened relatively often, time travel that is, and it was mostly accidental. Sands of time were a journeyman-level alchemy transmutation after all, and any chronometric casing could theoretically leverage them into a temporal displacement field. Many people accidentally flung themselves into the past because they liked the way Sands of Time flowed upwards, enchanted an hourglass of the stuff to turn itself and then accidentally touched it after it built up enough charge.

So they had built an antenna. A massive reciever underneath the DoM, which detected and triangulated all time travel within the hemisphere centered on it. Another sat in New Zealand, covering the rest of the planet. They'd been seriously considering a Moon array, but that was deemed slightly over budget. Portals with that sort of inner length were a bit on the expensive side.

So a mosquito with a control enchant and a portkey band was dispatched to his location, landed on his back and ported him with it back to the DoM about 2 seconds after his arrival. With a small cleanup team, the Butterfly Effect would be minimized.

"So, why did you decide to visit our time, Mr. Potter?"

"I'm afraid I can't say. It might change the future."

"We're very well versed on the effects of time travel. And you just revealed to us that you are from the future."

--------------

"Accidental or deliberate?"

"Deliberate. But I had a good reason!"

"Of course you did. Noone sane would time travel to the past for the fun of it."

"What about historians?"

"Didn't I say sane?"

--------------

"What is the method you used?"

"Time Turner, with the Portkey enchantment and a sacrifice as the power source."

The unremarkable figure looked up.

"It was a bad guy."

"Understandable."

--------------

"Alright, that would be it. Are you sure you don't want to return to your native Timeline?" a wince. "Or maybe another one?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well, we here at the DoM monitor the timelines, of course. Your answers, coupled with your unique temporal signature allowed us to pin down the timeline you've originated in. It looks like in that one, Lord Voldemort is resurrected, takes over the magical world, then makes the muggles destroy each other and fails to develop anti-radiation charms in time to prevent the sterilisation of all remaining wizards. They slowly die out, and after that it gets fuzzy, because our methods anchor themselves by humanity. All we can say is that there's something in the far future that can also use magic, and that it has some piece of humanity in it."

"Well yes, that's what I'm here to change. I will defeat Voldemort before he resurrects and prevent all of that from happening!"

"That's not how any of this works. You can only change things because an infinite amount of timelines exist. You will simply stabilize yourself into one where your changes are carried over, but your original timeline keeps going, only you disappeared."

"Well shit."
