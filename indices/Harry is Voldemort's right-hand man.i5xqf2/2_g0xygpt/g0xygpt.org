Give linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9623987/1/River-Styx]]) a read if you are interested in that sort of thing. It's decently written, though it turned out not to be my cup of tea so I dropped it around Chapter 7, because certain tropes got to me. (See [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/post-20256418][this post for a summary.]]) Also, the author made an unfortunate choice of nom de guerre for Harry: it's very hard to take anything involving a "Dark Lord Filldeserp" seriously.
