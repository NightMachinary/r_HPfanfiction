Maybe I should have been more clear, my mistake. Yes, there are plenty of fics that use over the top bashing, but it's meant to be serious and not for comedic effect. Also, when talking about the severity of bashing I was talking about both how over the top it was /and/ how prevelant it was throughout the story. I find it pretty rare in the fics I've read to have that level of bashing consistently shown throughout the story, typically if there is bashing that's that over the top it will be a few moments in the entire fic, with less over the top bashing in the moments between those OTT moments, and the bashing isn't the entire focus of the story but rather a small part of it.

Although, even just talking about how over the top it is, I've /never/ seen a fic that characterizes Ron as being so utterly stupid and humiliated as he's portrayed in TCC. Some that have a few moments that compare to the less over the top parts of TCC, yes, but never the characterization as a whole.
