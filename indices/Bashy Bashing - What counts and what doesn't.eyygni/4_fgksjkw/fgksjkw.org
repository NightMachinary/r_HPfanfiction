My definition of bashing is when the characterization of a character is written in such a way that you as a reader can tell that the author just doesn't like that character. It's hard to nail down with any specific markers other than how things come across to the reader. I can read a story where Gryffindor Ron becomes an antagonist to Slytherin Harry, and as long as the negative traits that are emphasized in this version of Ron exist for a reason, it doesn't feel like bashing, it feels like the author is trying to tell a story. Conversely, if scenes with the character serve no purpose other than to attempt to make you, the reader, dislike the character, then its bashing. The author wants you to feel anger, indignation, and irritation with the character and that is all.

Bashing is most noticeable and atrocious when it comes in a sudden characterization shift from canon to the fics starting off point. Also very noticeable when there are constant repetitions of the bashed character being beaten down by the hero and beckoning more stubborn, angry, manipulative, baggy, self righteous etc every time.
