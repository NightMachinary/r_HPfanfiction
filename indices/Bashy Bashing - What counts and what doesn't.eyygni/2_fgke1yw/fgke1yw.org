Bashing is taking an established character and then emphasizing one or more negative traits into the absolute extreme. Bashing begets bashing, too, as seen the "gold-digging weasley" trope, an idea completely springing from fanon.

For example:

Ron is a treacherous coward because of the triwizard thing. He was a glutton and a pig. He was only after Harry's money. He conspired with ginny and molly to give harry a rape-potion. Etc.

Dumbledore is a diabolical chessmaster who works from the shadows, controlling everything. He knows about the scarcrux and has set Harry up to die. The Greater Good is his ideal. He's stealing harry's money to fund the war. etc.

Hermione is vain and nasty to anyone who does better than her. All her strengths are actually flaws and her confidence is actually insecurity. She's only after Harry's recognition. etc.

I could go on, but I think this makes the point quite nicely.
