No, they aren't.

1. Dumbledore doesn't control anything from the shadows. In fact, he works quite openly.

2. While he did know that Harry needed to die, he did not work towards that as a goal and actually tried to find solutions that wouldn't require his death. Many of the reasons Harry survived are actually his doing. (master of death, the blood connection to voldemort, etc)

3. He never stole Harry's money. While we don't know how much he has himself, his will doesn't name any, but he holds three very high positions. It's likely that he used the entirety of his own savings and salaries to fund the Order.

4. He doesn't believe in the greater good - in fact, he actually espouses it since it was gellert's ideal.

The only thing he would be 'guilty' of is putting Harry with his wicked relatives, and knowing they'd treat him bad. Remember though that dursely abuse is mostly fanon (the starving and locking in rooms is canon, the rest decidedly not) and that there was a legitimate reason for it: Nothing else would have worked. Harry just came out of a broken Fidelius, the second most powerful defensive spell, which can obviously be overcome. Death Eaters are still at large, and the familial connection to Malfoy, no matter how tenuous, could have resulted in them gaining custody of Harry, with the insertion of a few bribes here and there. Once Harry is in their hands, he's gone forever - either dead as soon as he could write (diary, and the dark lord is released once more), raised abused or raised a datk wizard.
