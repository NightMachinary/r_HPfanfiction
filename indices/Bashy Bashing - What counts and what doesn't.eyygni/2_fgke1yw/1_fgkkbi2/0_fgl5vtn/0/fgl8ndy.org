  Dumbledore doesn't control anything from the shadows. In fact, he works quite openly.
#+end_quote

He basically told Harry nothing about his plans and what was going on until 6th year, and even then he spent all year only giving Harry some information on Voldemort and not much else. Perhaps he shared a lot of his plans with the Order, but we don't see that, and we know he didn't tell anyone but Snape about the Horcruxes so he definitely kept at least some plans to himself and very few others.

  While he did know that Harry needed to die, he did not work towards that as a goal and actually tried to find solutions that wouldn't require his death. Many of the reasons Harry survived are actually his doing. (master of death, the blood connection to voldemort, etc)

So... is he a master manipulator or not? Does he work behind the scenes to ensure his plans come together or is he very open about the fact that Harry has to die? In any case, he certainly didn't plan on Voldemort using Harry's blood in a ritual, giving him a thread to the living world, nor did he plan on Draco disarming him and Harry disarming Draco, thus making Harry the master of the Elder Wand. That's actually one of my biggest problems with DH, that Harry only wins and survives through a series of huge coincidences and contrivances. In any case, Dumbledore certainly knew Harry had to die, and had Snape share that with him at the very last second, knowing that Harry would be vulnerable and willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. He hoped that things were set up so Harry could survive, and he was right, but he wasn't certain.

The last two I agree with you on, but that's 50% right there. Now, don't get what I'm saying twisted, I don't think canon Dumbledore is a villian or nearly as bad as fanfics make him out to be. I'm simply pointing out that some of the fanon traits are based on his canon characterization. If I reread the books and really analyzed his character (which I might do in the future) I'm sure I could point out a lot of the good and bad traits of his character and show some of the sketchier things he's done. Some of which, I'm sure, wasn't put in intentionally but rather by the way JKR started the series, then changed the style and realism of it halfway through, thus creating some unfortunate implications in the first few books. But, yeah, he's definitely not intended to be interpreted that way, JKR's just not that great of an author.

In regards to the Dursleys, while fanfic authors do tend to overexaggerate the abuse compared to canon, what they do is still abuse. Being locked in a tiny space, isolated, being forced to cook and clean, starvation, either turning a blind eye to their son beating up Harry or potentially encouraging it, and possibly physically abusing him as well (Petunia does try to hit him with a goddamn frying pan, which doesn't explicitly show physical abuse but does imply that they're willing to go there), not to mention all of the emotional abuse like name calling, calling him worthless, degrading his parents, and letting Marge's dog chase him into a tree and keep him up there for hours. I'm not going to say Dumbledore definitely knew what was going on, but let's not pretend that the Dursleys only did a fraction of what they actually did and that there was absolutely nothing Dumbledore could have done to prevent it. At best he's guilty of not checking in on Harry and assuming the best of the Dursleys, at worst he simply ignored the abuse and couldn't think of a better option. The latter seems more probable considering what he says at the end of OotP.
