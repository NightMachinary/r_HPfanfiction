To me, character bashing can be summarized as "Character A's entire characterization is being a cunt". Usually the character being bashed has no redeeming qualities, is consistently a butt monkey, and do not change when a reasonable person would, but really if every scene with them could just be explained with - Character A is being a dick again -(the exception is for outright antagonists, which won't count as bashing to me if they ever succeed in some lasting and not instantly reversed way/show intelligence/show growth/are very obviously parodies and not serious characterizations) then thats pretty much bashing. As an example would a fic that I literally just started and dropped reading today - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/10/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance][Harry Potter and the last Chance]] . Ron has no purpose other than to be a dick. He accomplishes nothing other than inadvertently screw himself over by being a dick.

Another example is a fic I dropped reading after the first paragraph set off all my alarms for bashing ; linkffn(7104654) after the first paragraph mentions he can't trust Ron after the GoF thing. Other commentators have told me my senses weren't wrong at all, and the fic bashes characters heavily.

Just my two cents.

Edit: Went a bit more in depth on what I'd say counts as exceptions to bashing.
