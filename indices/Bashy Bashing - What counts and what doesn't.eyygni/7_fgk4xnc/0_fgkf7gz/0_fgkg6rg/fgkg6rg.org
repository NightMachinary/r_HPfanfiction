Like I said, I didn't read the fic. I can't say for certain that it was or was not bashing, merely that I was later informed I was right by another comment. It set off my bashing alarms because

A) rons a fucking fan favorite for being bashed into the ground

B) It starts in Order of the Pheonix time, well after canon Harry and Ron got this shit sorted without any changed details being explicit. They patched up. It was done, and this fic bringing it up without saying why is a red alarm that Ron's suddenly going to be a worse character without any explanation either.
