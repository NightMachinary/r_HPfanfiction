It's funny how people can have a totally vision of the same events. For me, Ron was mad at Harry, not because he managed to enter into the Tournament, but because he thought he did this behind /his/ back (low self estem, fear of just being the "sidekick" . . .).

This conflict could have been easily resolved, if Harry had just said something along the lines of "Maugrey think that someone entered my name into the Tournament to kill me", rather than "You are an idiot if you think I did it" (even though, the morning of the Champion selection, so like 12h before, they had talked about it and Harry said it would be nice to "win the Tournament".) Ron is not omniscient, he knew Harry was interested, that he had a potential mean (the cloak), and that he did become Champion.\\
Even after this night, the conflict could have been resolved before the 1st Task, if Harry had not added oil to the fire when he stopped his conversation with Sirius. Yes he was angry that his appearance cut the conversation short, but Ron could not know this, and yelling at him and throwing a badge to his head is not a good way to make up.

Anyways, my point is that, in my opinion, Ron apology after the 1st Task is not a "I saw you almost die and I magically trust you that you did not cheat to enter", but rather a "I saw you almost die, and I decided that, even though you have at least 50% of the blame for this dispute, you are still my best friend and I don't want to loose you so I will be the bigger man and apologize even if it's akward".
