Canon it seemed they made up when Ron noticed he wasn't cheating by nearing getting killed. By that point, that's essentially you believe in a religion because you see it happen, not because you believe it in. So it seemed like he never believed he wasn't cheating or lying until he nearly died, which to me made me look in awe at the stupidity of that.
