On it's own you are definitely right, that isn't bashing. However, it is totally a red flag for bashing. If an author writes a scene of Harry feeling that way, in the moment, it reads more like they are approaching an emotional issue not fully developed in canon, with a resolution likely to follow. If an author writes a scene where Harry suddenly has a realization later about the motives and actions of another character, it almost always prefaces bashing.

In this example, Harry suddenly realizes in fifth year that Ron's actions of a year ago mean he is untrustworthy. Given the best benefit of the doubt, the author then has Harry approach Ron, they discuss the issue, and resolve it. The entire scene is pointless. Another option is that the author wants Ron out of the story but doesn't want to bash and has Harry cut ties because of this sudden realization. Not bashing, but a sign of poor writing. Lastly, Harry has suddenly thought back on to how he can't trust Ron because of his previous actions. The author is very likely going to follow this up with Harry thinking of other times Ron has been untrustworthy in a bashy internal monologue, and they are very likely to give Ron opportunity in their fic to prove that they are untrustworthy with future bashy reactions.

That last formula has been followed by so many bash fics that it is a pretty decent red flag.
