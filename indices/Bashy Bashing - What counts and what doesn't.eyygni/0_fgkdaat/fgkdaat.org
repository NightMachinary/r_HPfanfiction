To me, bashing means that a character is behaving worse than he/she should reasonably act with canon character development for no apparent reason.

Reading other comments here, I seem to have a slightly different view on what constitutes bashing -- however, I will say that the examples given are the worst cases of bashing, even if IMO they aren't the /only/ ones.

With my view on what bashing is, what you say is entirely possible -- a character's actions can be interpreted differently by different people, meaning that their "bash point", or what constitutes as "worse than canon behaviour for no reason" would be different.

One thing that comes to mind regarding this that I could see be interpreted differently is GoF Ron. Harry has lived through childhood emotionally abused. It would not be unreasonable to have Harry take Ron's actions in GoF as a betrayal of friendship and a major loss of trust that cannot easily be undone after the First Task. Ron would, obviously, not take such a reaction well, and would probably be rather angry, possibly fracturing their friendship completely. This is IMO a completely understandable reaction with what we know of his character at this point, and while obviously a character flaw, doesn't mean he's an evil person, just in the wrong here. However, someone else might consider such a reaction Ron-bashing.
