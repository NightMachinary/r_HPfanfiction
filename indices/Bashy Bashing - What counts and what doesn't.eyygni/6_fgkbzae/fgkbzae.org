To me it's about how it affects the plot. A lot of the Ron bashing stories you could kill him in the first chapter or remove him altogether and nothing would change with the story. Just look at Draco in the Philosopher's Stone. Draco comes off very poorly in the book but every interaction either gives Harry/the reader new information or pushes the plot forward. Another good example is linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) In that story both the Weasley twins and Krum are portrayed negatively. If you remove the Weasley twins subplot from the story nothing really changes. The rivalry with Krum however pushes the plot forward and helps push Harry and Fleur's relationship. The twins are bashed, Krum is a villian.

(Edit: I may be wrong about The Lie I've Lived, it's been awhile since I read it)
