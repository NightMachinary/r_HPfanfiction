To continue my thought: I've been reading a lot of crossovers recently. Many of those stories have Harry end up in another universe at the end of the first chapter but still take time to bash characters. Then never mention them again. linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make) is a good example. Harry goes to Westeros at the end of chapter one but the chapter still spends a paragraph or two talking about how much of a loser Ron is. It is unnecessary and makes me like an otherwise good story a little less.
