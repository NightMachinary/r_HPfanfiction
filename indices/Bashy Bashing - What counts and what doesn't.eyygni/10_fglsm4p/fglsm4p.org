This is a great question. I'm not sure myself at times.

I think it is about an unrealistic bad or evil presentation of a character. It takes away complexity from the character and focuses on their flaws (real or invented by the author or fandom) in an out of context way. It is about out of character behavior of the character and the character around them.

​

What is not bashing to me is shining light at flaws of characters or let other characters 'bash' a character if it fits their character like Harry expecting the worst of Snape or Draco... Even showing a character mostly negative isn't necessarily bashing either, as long as it is realistic. You can write a story about a teenager falling in with the death eaters and even commit horrendous crimes without bashing the character.

​

Other people seem to think that every negative or mostly negative presentation is bashing. In a story, I wrote somebody said that I bash Snape and I can't agree with that. In this story, I write from Lily Evans' point of view and how it was not just one word that broke the friendship between them, but years of going in different moral directions. I show him as unwilling to admit if he is wrong or doesn't know something and covers it with being rude at times or socially awkward and it shows how the friendship turned more and more toxic for Lily with time. I don't think it is bashing but others maybe do if they like Snape a lot and don't agree that those are realistic flaws or that he never agreed with the death eater ideology and was completely forced into joining against his will.
