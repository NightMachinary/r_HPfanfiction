It's more of how prolonged they make the bashing. If it's done to explain why the character won't be in the rest of the fic, or if they realize their mistakes and change from who they were, it's easier to tolerate and serves a point to the plot. However, in the cases that are disliked, the characters continue to make the same mistakes and are hated for it, making supposedly smart characters unable to realize they're in the wrong. In most cases this is often tedious because it feels like the same story happens over and over again, and the protagonist feels like a perfect and/or powerful character who can do no wrong.
