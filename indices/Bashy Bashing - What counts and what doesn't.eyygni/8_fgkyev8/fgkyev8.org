To me, there's using a trope as a plot point for the story. Like Potions Queen Molly. This isn't bashing.

Bashing is belittling a character with no plot advancement.

This story has the love potions, but they weren't uselessly bashed. At most, Ron acts the same as the Yule Ball/Triwizard cup tantrum he threw for similar reasons. The epilogue seems like bashing at first, but you have to consider the fact that he didn't have the final three books worth of change he had in canon, so he kept on the course of 4th year attitude.

People still call this bashing. Hell, some people call anything that doesn't conform with canon bashing.
