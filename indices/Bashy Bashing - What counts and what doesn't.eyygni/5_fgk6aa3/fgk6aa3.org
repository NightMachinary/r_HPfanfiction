I do agree it's relative, however I'm fairly certain there's some touches or themes that's the same for most if not all fics considered "Bashy".

For me personally I consider bashing when the author goes to extreme lengths to discredit a character without there being any favourable trait shown. The greatest example should be the "Dumbles" trope where he's usually portrayed as a truly evil person with no moral compass, completly focused on only doing what's in his own mind considered "for the greater good". And I feel like [[/u/slutforpotter][u/slutforpotter]] and [[/u/TheHeadlessScholar][u/TheHeadlessScholar]] both has great points.
