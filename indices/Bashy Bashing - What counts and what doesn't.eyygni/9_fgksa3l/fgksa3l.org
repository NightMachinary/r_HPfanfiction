To me, it's character bashing if the character's characterization is off and the other characters' view of that character is inconsistent with canon for no particular reason.

For example, it's pretty in-character for Ron to say something insensitive, causing a fight between him and Hermione, and Hermione leaves the fight fuming about him being an idiot. There are multiple instances of that in canon and that occurring in a fic wouldn't raise an eyebrow for me, even if the fic were from the perspective of someone who fought with Ron often, like Malfoy or Percy, and thus would showcase the worst side of him often. But if Ron suddenly went off on how Hermione was inferior because she was muggleborn and Harry mused about how he hated Ron all along because Ron only made friends with him because he was rich, that would be blatant bashing to me. Plus, it just comes off as bad writing if the only way you can justify your hate for a character is to twist them until they're not that character anymore.
