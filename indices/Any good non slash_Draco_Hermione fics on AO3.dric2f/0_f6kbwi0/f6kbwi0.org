linkao3(4913998) is the first in a fantastic Slytherin Harry series that follows the first three books, and it remains my favorite of the Slytherin Harry genre.

linkao3(13760487) is a story where Harry gets adopted by a muggle couple that has great characterizations of Harry, Sirius, and Remus in particular.

linkao3(12985506) is a sweet Pansy/Ron story where they get locked in a manner over Christmas together. Very fluff.

link ao3(12424344; 13912332; 15687453) are three story by the same author that are both excellent. Grey Space is an AU where Hogwarts doesn't start until fourteen, so Harry goes to Stonewall High. In Sleeper, Harry enters another world when he dreams-- one that seems just slightly...off. Proof is a post-war story in which Harry and company attempt to fix the Wizengamot, featuring Harry trying to bake (and, largely, failing).

linkao3(431269) is a post-war one-shot featuring Blaise Zabini learning about football, muggle culture, and what happened to muggleborns during the war.

link ao3(17475989) follows Harry Potter's life with his new guardian- Albus Dumbledore.

BONUS FIC:

linkao3(3652266) is slash, but it's not a major facet of the story-- and its shaping up to be one of the most enjoyable, and, I suspect, tragic stories I've read.
