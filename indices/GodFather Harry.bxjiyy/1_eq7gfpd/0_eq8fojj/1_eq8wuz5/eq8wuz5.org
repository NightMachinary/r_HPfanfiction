I would honestly say it's one of the best post Hogwarts story out thier, if not the best. Quite honestly it kinda acted as some catharsis for some frustrations I had from the main series. The fact that harry fought and died for a society that in the end didnt change from it's terrible ways much was kinda frustrating lol.
