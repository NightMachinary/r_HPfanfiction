I can't take this story seriously enough to even begin reading it, to be honest.

The characters would have to be so AU to make this work, and in that case, why even stick with those chosen?

I'm expected to believe that Hermione "or worse, expelled!" Granger and Ron "there's no good Slytherin" Weasley are doing gangster mob/dark lord shit with Harry "just Harry" Potter as the Boss.... All over something to do with the son of a man that was his parents' best mate, but left Harry alone for 13 years?

Nah, I don't swallow that.
