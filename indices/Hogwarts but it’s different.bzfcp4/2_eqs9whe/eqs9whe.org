  Or Hogwarts is a specialized magic school, like Battle Magic.

In linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School), Hogwarts' curriculum was changed after the first war against Riddle so that it was excessively militarized. There were specific group Battle and Strategy classes and dueling and combat were regular parts of school life. The school was so combat-focused that Harry, when seeing a novel use of transfiguration occurring, noted that most Hogwarts students wouldn't think of using transfiguration in that manner as that was outside of the combat-focused scope of Hogwarts' classes.

Edit: I like how within 10 minutes, /everybody/ suggested Hogwarts Battle School.
