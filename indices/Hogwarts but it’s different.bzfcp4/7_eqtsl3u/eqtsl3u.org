Oh, I forgot to put these down. They both have very different versions of Hogwarts.

linkffn(Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles) it's exactly what it sounds like. Notable not just for the theme, but being the only fic I can think of with more reviews than words.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality) it's a Harry Potter-Matrix crossover. In this version, Hogwarts accepts people not at 11, but whenever they first experience accidental magic. The Trio attends and are considered unusual because they were all accepted at the same age. Malfoy is the same age as the trio but is a 5th year because he had accidental magic much earlier than the trio.
