  Like it's actually the best education you can get in Europe with actual competent teachers who are respected in their fields. Students who research and do projects about magic.

I have a similar Hogwarts in my story "Patron". F.e., Hagrid is a teacher, and known as one of the best authorities on magical creatures in Europe. The students (and everyone) also use far more magic than in canon.
