How is HPMOR an Ender's Game rip-off? Yeah okay the combat/battle progression was the same, but I felt even that was written as a parody and acknowledgement of Ender's Game just as much as a showcase for Harry's abilities. As for the rest of the work, it didn't seem to follow stuff from Ender's Game at all. But it's been awhile since I read either work, so if I'm mistaken, please tell me in what other ways HPMOR ripped off Ender's Game.

You're right about that graveyard scene though. Of course, if the author is to be believed, some random reader thought that up as a way to get Harry out of there alive.
