You can just imagine an ending, let's say that they all go into the room of requirement and have a bunch of simulations of battles against the acromantulas around the world, and in each simulation they get closer and closer to the main acromantula nest where they are from originally, which they eventually blow up completely with some super magic deatomizer weapon. Then it turns out the simulations were real and all the acromantulas in the world are all dead. But then it turns out that the acromantulas only attacked wizards in the first place because of a misunderstanding and weren't planning on doing that anymore. Harry then travels to another planet, starts a religion, and the story picks up several thousand years later. Oh but there's a side story about Hermione's adventures still on earth, trying to find a cure for some generic disease she had that will kill her in her 20s or 30s, and Harry's cousin Dudley becomes the ruler of the entire world.
