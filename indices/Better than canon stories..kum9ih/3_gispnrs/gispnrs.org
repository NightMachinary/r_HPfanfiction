Think the quality of writing in "A Marauder's Plan" is excellent, maybe on par with canon? I know your post is asking for better but I just felt like it sucks you into another world the same way canon does, like I can picture so many things so clearly.

I actually abandoned it quite deep into the story/skipped ahead to the end, just because there are a lot of things that aren't *my* thing- i.e. the Lord stuff/family magic/Harmony/ Harry being good at everything....but I would highly recommend it to others.
