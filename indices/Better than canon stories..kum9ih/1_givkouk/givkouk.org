I keep coming back to this one:

linkao3(13795605) Victoria Potter.

Mainly because of the insane amount of world-building done in the background and the fact that, while it's still recognizably a Potterverse fanfic, it reads like an entirely different series as opposed to "canon events but with x added in".
