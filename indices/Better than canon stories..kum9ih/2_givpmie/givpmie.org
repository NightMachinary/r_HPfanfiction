The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/632600][Crow Rides a Pale Horse]] series has gorgeous worldbuilding, including a whole lot of details, like a more interesting Triwizard Tournament, and specifics of anti-werewolf bias. All the wholesome hugging can get tiresome, but the story overall is great.
