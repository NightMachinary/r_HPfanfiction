Dude, all stories by the author of magic of the force have terrible writing, a lot of repeating phrases and are super slow. Even tho the plot itself maybe okay, they are impossible to read. The once I recommend have far superior writing even if you don't like the plot. Anyway, nobody gives a shit if you disagree with my fics preference. I bet you are one of those people who enjoy a cringfest like 'in the mind of a scientist'.
