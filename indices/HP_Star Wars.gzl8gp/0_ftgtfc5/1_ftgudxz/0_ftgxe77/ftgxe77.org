That would be one of my other favorite ones. Both are very different in tone and plot though, so it's hard to draw any comparisons.

But for what it's worth, Darth Marrs himself keeps saying that this one is his best HP/SW crossover whenever he shows up in a thread here. And I agree, even if I enjoy "The Lord of Light" a lot too, apart from the weird ending at least.

So if you like his other fics, I would definitely give this one another try, I enjoyed it a lot.
