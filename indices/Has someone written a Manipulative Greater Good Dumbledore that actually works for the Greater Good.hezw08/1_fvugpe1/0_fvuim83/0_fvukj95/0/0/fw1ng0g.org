I am not putting emphasis on the word “Evil” for the evilness sake. Just that I really dislike the term “manipulative” for all its ambiguities it contains (as our discussion proves) and all difficult problems it actually hides. Do we agree that self-sacrificing of Harry (even without the plotcruch with his blood bringing him back) would be the only moral solution in case there was no other way how to defeat Voldemort? (of course, it would be necessary to let him know about the horcrux in his head in advance and let him make the sacrifice, instead of manipulating him into it).

Also, I really personally dislike the Jeremy Bentham's philosophy, because I grew up in the Communist Czechoslovakia and the needs of many outweighing my own needs was pushed down my throat for too long. Why should I fucking care about the needs of others? (well, sometime I do, but it is more complicated than that; also about the Greater Good is the book “[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eugenics_and_other_Evils][Eugenics and other evils]]” by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton][Gilbert K. Chesterton]]).

Also, are you aware that canonically Dumbledore used the term “Greater Good” only once when he was fifteen and he regretted it ever since? Although, certainly many of his decisions in the war had to be based on the similar ideas, because they had to be.
