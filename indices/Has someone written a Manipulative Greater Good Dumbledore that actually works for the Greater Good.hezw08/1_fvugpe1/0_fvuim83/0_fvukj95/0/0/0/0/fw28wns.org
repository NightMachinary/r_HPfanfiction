Yes, for me “manipulative” is something deeply negative, but I understand your point of view.

And I am a practising Christian and from the study of our history, it is kind of obvious to me that whenever we want to formalise ethics much more precisely than Two Commands of Love very bad things happen (and sorry our Jewish cousins, it hasn't really worked for you either).

Concerning better understanding of Dumbledore, I really like him in linkffn(12155794) ... Harry in the story is horrible super!Harry (and the Haphne Syndrom of dropping all his old friends, because they are suddenly not good enough for him), but there are many things on the fringes of the story which are really good (portrayal of the Grindelwald's War is other one, and was this the story with improved rules of Quidditch?).
