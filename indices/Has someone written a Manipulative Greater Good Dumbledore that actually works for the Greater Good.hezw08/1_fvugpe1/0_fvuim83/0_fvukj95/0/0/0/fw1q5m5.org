Fair enough - I can see your point regarding 'manipulative'. Though I will say, I personally don't attach any particular moral value to the term manipulative myself. It just means exhibiting dishonest or unfair control over a person. If you give a dishonest, but well-meaning compliment to boost a friend's self-esteem, that's technically manipulative, but I'd say that being nice to your friend is a moral action. When I say 'manipulative Dumbledore', that just means a Dumbledore that exhibits control over the people and societal systems around him - whether that's to do good things or bad things is a secondary property.

And for the record, I don't actually hold to a Utilitarian Philosophy, Benthamite or otherwise. It's kinda hard to do that, when you're in such an individually-focused field as psychology. Plus, in this role, it's really common sense to look after yourself first - in the vein of the old 'put your own air mask on first, before you help others on the aeroplane' advice - as you really can't help others break water if you're drowning yourself.

Also, I studied Philosophy at A-Level and realised quickly that most formalised moral frameworks have some seriously glaring flaws, Utilitarianism included. Haven't been able to bring myself to accept any textbook morality since. :D

But yeah. I'm just looking for it because it makes for an interesting story that deviates from the Evil, Selfish Dumbledore norm of the Manipulative!Dumbledore cliche, not because I agree with the underlying philosophy behind my request or because I believe it to be Rowling's canon (intended, original, ret-conned, or otherwise). I imagine it'd be a lot harder to read those stories if I'd lived through that darker side of that philosophy like you have though and I apologise if I've given the indication I condone actions or philosophies like that of the KSC. Privilege of the Ivory Tower, I'm afraid. :)
