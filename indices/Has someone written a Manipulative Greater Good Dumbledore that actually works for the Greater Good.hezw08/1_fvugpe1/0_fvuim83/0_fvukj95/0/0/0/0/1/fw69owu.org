Pretty much. It's fascinating how an ethical system can work perfectly well as it's originally put into practice, but falter when it's codified in textbooks for others to draw from elsewhere. Though problematic or not, I gotta admit that Theological Ethics makes for some fascinating reading - and even more fascinating conversations with my Catholic relatives (I'm of Irish-Italian descent, so that's... pretty much all of them. :D). It's really cool to see how patterns develop and how ideas were transmitted from group to group back in the days when plagiarism was regarded as just another method of citation - and an honoured one at that. :)

Heh. Yeah, that is a baffling cliche, isn't it? Like, people who literally follow you into life or death situations probably aren't too bad to keep on at least polite terms with, even if certain aspects of their personality suddenly grate on you.

Thanks for the rec. I do find it interesting when otherwise flawed fics have such interesting smaller pieces integrated into them. A glint of gold in a pile of dirt is always fun to uncover - for me, anyway. :)
