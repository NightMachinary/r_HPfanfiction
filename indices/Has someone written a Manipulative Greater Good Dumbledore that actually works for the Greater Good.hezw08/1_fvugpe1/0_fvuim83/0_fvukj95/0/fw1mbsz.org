And some other people apparently do. Each to their own, and all that. People gonna people.

I think I'm garbling something somewhere, judging by your emphasis on that Dumbledore being evil (and thank you for the link, btw).

I'm not looking for Evil Dumbledore, necessarily. Just a Manipulative Dumbledore that works for the betterment of society as a whole (ie. the Greater Good of Society), rather than to improve his own position or fare (ie. the Greater Good of Albus Dumbledore). A Dumbledore who'd sacrifice a garrison of soldiers to save more elsewhere, rather than a Dumbledore who'd sacrifice a garrison to fill his own pockets.

Too many manipulative Dumbledores make him a villain out to set himself up as the tyrant of the world, but I'm looking for a manipulative Dumbledore that's genuinely trying to save and improve British Magical Society. A Utilitarian, 'needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few' type.
