Sure, but that's not what I'm questioning - the dispute I'm asking about would be if Churchill sacrificed that Garrison so he could save his art collection from a museum nearby vs Churchill sacrificing that Garrison so the evacuation could work out. The first is the 'Greater Good of Albus Dumbledore' that so many people write, the latter is the 'Utilitarian Dumbledore' that I'm looking for. :)

Personally, I don't really mind what interpretation of a character exists, so whether Dumbledore is seen as manipulative and machiavellian or well-meaning doesn't really matter to me - I have no particular skin in the game for any of it. I just want it to make sense with the story that person is trying to tell. Verisimilitude and all that. :)
