The line between being manipulative and necessities of the war is really fine. Do you remember Churchill in the film Darkest Hour (2019), when he sacrificed the garrison of the fortress of Calais in order that the evacuation from Dunkirk may proceed? Was it badly manipulative or was it just necessary sacrifice of few soldiers to save many (and perhaps whole war)?
