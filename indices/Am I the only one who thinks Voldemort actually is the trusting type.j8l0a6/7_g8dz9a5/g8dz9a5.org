I think Voldemort trusts Bellatrix's loyalty to him more than to the woman herself. And for the Draco thing, I'm pretty sure that he didn't actually believe that Draco would accomplish his task but knew that he would do his best simply not to get /Crucio/'d and also happened to have a handy-dandy Death Eater on staff to help him. He didn't trust Wormtail but merely used the man's fear of being caught by Sirius to his advantage.
