He sent Draco that task knowing he would fail. The thing about Voldemort is that he is a psychopath, he only cares about himself and enjoys causing pain to others. He doesn't trust anyone but he knows that they are loyal to him and his cause. Being about to see into their minds can reassure him of that. He spreads the bits of his soul out as widespread as he can, because he doesn't trust anyone with them, and without them he will die. It was out of fear, not trust. Death is his greatest fear. He cares only for himself. Not his deatheaters, they are expendable.
