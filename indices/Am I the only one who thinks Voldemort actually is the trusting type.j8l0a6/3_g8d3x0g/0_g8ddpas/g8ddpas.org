I love redemption stories about Voldemort especially ones where it actually addressed that yes he was insane due to his own doing. And yet it doesnt change him completely it's more of a slow return to humanity.

Sadly this fics are few and far inbetween most fics I see are either he was never insane and it was all a facade or ploy or that his insanity was faked by Dumbledore or other enemies
