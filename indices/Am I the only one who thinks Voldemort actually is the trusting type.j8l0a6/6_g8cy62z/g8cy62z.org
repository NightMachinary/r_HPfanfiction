I disagree about Draco.

He didn't trust Draco. It was punishment to Lucius. Draco didn't knew enough to be a threat, even if he betrayed, and it would one more excuse to kill him, in front of his father. It was likely Voldemort's plan, unless Draco managed to impress him and kill Dumbledore, which Voldemort didn't believe he could do.
