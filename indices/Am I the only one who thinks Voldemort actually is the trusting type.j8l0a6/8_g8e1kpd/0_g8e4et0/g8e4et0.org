But he still gave him a task which put him in enough pressure to seriously consider changing sides, I don't believe for a second that Draco didn't consider going to Dumbledore in the hope of working something up, yeah, his parents life's would be endangered by the attempt and it may not work, however having Draco open the metaphorical and actual gates to Voldemort's hideout for the order and even some Aurors while every DE is distracted (maybe sending some to capture the ones invading Hogwarts with the cabinet while the rest attacks in mass) could lead to a major victory for Dumbledore's side, enough to buy a pardon for his family. By the end he realized that his mission was a punishment to his father, so he probably also knew or at least suspected that even if he succeeded chances were that his family would still be always a Voldemort-tantrum away from death, by turning coat the chances of his family dying would be only slightly bigger and Voldemort probably /knew it too/, that he didn't force Draco to make an unbreakable vow shows that he trusted that Draco would recognize him as the greater danger or even that Draco would show himself loyal.
