I wouldn't go so far as to say trusting, not in other people anyways, but he most certainly came even remotely close to trusting Bellatrix anyways because she was beautiful, influential, rich, fiercely loyal and (the foolish part on Voldemort's side) quite good at Occlumency. He also trusted Malfoy to a certain extent for whatever reason but my headcanon is that the intent was always for the diary to return to Hogwarts together with Draco (Lucius at least knew it was a weapon against Muggleborns). It happened but he never had the chance to give the order and the things didn't go as intended. Voldemort also trusted Snape after learning he killed Dumbledore but that still didn't stop him from killing his servant when he needed to.

I think Voldemort was mostly trusting in his own plans, thinking how brilliant and powerful he was. He thought of himself as a god and started to disregard the fact that humans around him might have feelings too. Also he remains quite secretive with his plans as neither Bellatrix, nor Lucius know what they were given, nor does he tell Wormtail the full plan other than the fact that he will be honored with a task that most his followers would give their right hand for, nor does he tell Snape what the plan with Draco is despite him being the successor if Draco fails. Also speaking of Draco... Voldemort might have not been able to feel love but could recognize it and exploit and knew that as long as he could get faster than Dumbledore to Narcissa and Lucius, Draco would do his best to complete the mission
