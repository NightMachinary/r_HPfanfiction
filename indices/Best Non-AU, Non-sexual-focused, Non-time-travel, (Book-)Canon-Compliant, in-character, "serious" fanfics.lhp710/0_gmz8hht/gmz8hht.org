[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]]: The first HP fanfic I finished reading. It's (obviously) Year 6 from Ginny's POV. I like it very much

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]: Another one from Ginny's POV, this time from Year 7. It's imho the most canon compliant fic about Hogwarts during that year

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]: Depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, from their Muggle neighbor's POV. It's my favorite postwar canon compliant fic. In fact, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][its author]] wrote a 85+ story series about the postwar world
