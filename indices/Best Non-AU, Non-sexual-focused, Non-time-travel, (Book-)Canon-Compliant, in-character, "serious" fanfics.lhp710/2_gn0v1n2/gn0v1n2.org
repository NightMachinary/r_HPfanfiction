I don't know if it's what you had in mind but here are 2 OC insert series that keep the plot the same for the most part with a few added extras

The Potter and black series linkffn(9349216) that's book 1 its a sirius black has a daughter oc insert

You were always there series linkffn(8634951) again link is for book one this time it's a muggleborn girl next door friend kind of story.

both are some of the earliest fanfics I ever read (at least for Harry Potter) and are a great way to stay in touch with the word and even introduce yourself to reading fanfics
