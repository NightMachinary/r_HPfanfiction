If you haven't already, consider posting for feedback over at the main table top gaming subs and dnd subs as well. They love giving feedback on things over there and might be able to give more focused critique on mechanics than the average HP fanfic reader can.

I'll have to give a more in depth review of the system later, but I can say that the point system presented in the post itself seems reasonable!
