I've played Vampire using the 20th Anniversary rules and some of my ideas were from there. Never playes the other games though. Interestingly enough, how you described the system of Mage is roughly parallel to the system I came up with for spells, with the exception thay attributes and skill level reduces difficulty on rolls and all rolls are simplified to a 1d20 instead of basing number of dice on attribute + skill. In our current game, I find that its always the dice rolls that bog down the game because we're constantly having to look for where the stats are and adding/subtracring because of health or disciplines and then xalcilating difficulty on top of that.
