Hey man. Have you ever played World of Darkness games? Their d10 system is non-linear and very open ended. Every attribute, skill, and power is 1-5. 1 dot in athletics would be someone who runs on a treadmill once a week, whereas 5 dots would be Usain Bolt/Brock Lesnar levels of athleticism. Untrained doesn't mean you can't run, it just means you haven't spent any time being athletic.

Mage[WoD] handles magic pretty well (which is ALWAYS where system development comes to a screeching halt for me), and is quite flexible with spell creation. For magic, there are nine Spheres [ex. Forces, Matter, Time, Life, Death, etc.] Depending upon how many dots you have in which Spheres allows you to cast a wider variety of spells, and directly influences the power behind them as well.

I'd lean toward the newer editions of Mage since it's a bit more rigid as far as spells go. (1st-3rd edition is largely limited to your own imagination, and takes a /very/ good GM to run.) But you can just rename the Spheres to your liking, and roll from there.

If you have any questions about it, I'd be glad to chit-chat.
