I am also a hobbyist RPG designer (also on [[/r/RPGdesign]]) so I will give you some input.

- What is the reason to create a whole system and not mod an existing system. In this way, you won't need to worry about dice mechanics etc. Systems like FATE work pretty well.
- I don't know what your dice mechanic is.
- Make sure everything is as useful at everything else. E.g. Art will feel a little bit useless in many campaigns. Maybe merge it with something.
- In many cases, you describe all options. Explicitly leave stuff open for other options.
- I love the idea of choosing a wand to be a special part of character creation. However, it doesn't give me any guidelines how I should choose the wand stats. Maybe giving bonuses and penalties for all materials and cores. Maybe giving it a few advantages and disadvantages that the player can choose. I don't know.
- Maybe grouping all nonhuman races as one category. This reduces the feeling that it is necessary to pick a nonhuman race.

I really hope you can make the RPG system you want. It looks very interesting but far from finished. Finally, I would go and test it out. There is no reason writing a system of 300 pages and then finding out your magic system isn't fun. Good luck.
