Well, now you're having /me/ google vinewood wardrobe lol....

Hmm, idk I think that Harry is near death too or at least knows that he will be dying soon because the cottage is finally on sale. He's kept the cottage for so long, sort of guarding it and the memories associated with it while he still could and selling it is a move he makes when he's no longer able to do so. I think that's pretty much confirmed by the last sentence:

  Slowly making his way down the path, past the overgrown lawn and the weeds and the dead plants, and past the sign beside the gate which told the end of Harry Potter's story for all to see.
#+end_quote

The end of his story/life.

Just my interpretation, I could be wrong.
