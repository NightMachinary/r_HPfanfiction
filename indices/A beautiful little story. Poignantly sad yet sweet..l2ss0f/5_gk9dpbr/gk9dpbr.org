Sorry, while I'm one who often gets attacked by feels from stories, this one didn't do it for me. I have to be immersed in the story to get the feels, and I kept getting thrown out of it.

I lost my suspension of disbelief almost immediately, with the author's claim that the people going deaf could hear the high-pitched squeal of the gate better than a knock on the door. People lose the higher pitches FIRST when losing their hearing, not last.

Then I got distracted by the vinewood end table, and a third time by the vinewood wardrobe. You see, I'd never considered before that that vine is not a specific wood. That's like saying everybody else's wands are made of tree. I even stopped in the middle of reading the story to make a post about that.

And the final thing that kept me from connecting to the story was the confusion at the end. Clearly Hermione has passed on, yet Harry is thinking of the Elder Wand being buried with himself. Is he dying? I thought the story was going to say that he was going to bury it with Hermione, although indications are that she's been gone for a while, which of course nobody would ever go looking for it there. Where is he going to keep it until his death, and how will he then make sure it's buried with him? That part made no sense.

So no, I did not get attacked by the feels.
