Hey, author here!

Your first point is valid and something I didn't think about until after I'd posted it, by which time I decided that liked the imagery more than I thought being technically correct was important.

The second point is actually something I'd debated changing but ultimately decided that if vine wands are a thing then there must be something else there besides normal vines, else Hermione's wand would be floppy! I put it away in my head that maybe there's a species of magical vine that grows like a tree rather than a crawler.

Your third point is something that I left ambiguous because I didn't think the particulars were too important to the point of the story, which was mostly reminiscence. Selling the house meant that it'd be safer elsewhere so it was time to find a new home.

Thanks for reading either way though, everybody responds to fics differently I think :)
