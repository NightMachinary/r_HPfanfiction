Thanks for the clarifications. I didn't mean to imply that I didn't enjoy the story, because I did. Just that it didn't "grab" my senses because the little niggling details kept distracting me.

Check one of the earlier resposes for a link to english vine. It shows quite thick vines melded to a thick tree trunk. That certainly would be wood-like enough to be a wand. My epiphany was that "vine" could be any number of things. When we hear about somebody's wand, we hear yew, walnut, etc. (although "pine" is also non-specific, now that I think about it). It was your references to furniture made of vine that made me realize that we didn't know what KIND of vine. I actually liked the imagery of them having furniture that matched their wands' woods.

I'm still curious how Harry intends to make sure the Elder wand is buried with him. With Hermione gone, I guess he'll have to take somebody into his confidence; presumably whomever he thinks will be the one planning his funeral (whenever that may be). Oldest child, maybe?
