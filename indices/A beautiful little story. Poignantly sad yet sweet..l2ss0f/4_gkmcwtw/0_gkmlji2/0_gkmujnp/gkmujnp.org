Perhaps someday people will cure aging; it's probably not that far off. That will be a nice thing; there's no joy or beauty in senility or arthritis or wrinkles or osteoporosis. Even if we do fix it, though, eventually you'll have an accident, or at very very unlikely best, the heat death of the universe will get you. Would five thousand years or five million be more fun? Sure, but that's not forever either. Even our planet will someday be forgotten, and if you wait long enough, all trace of our species and its works will vanish without a trace.

Every story ends. You have to find your own meaning. That's fine though. The Harry in this story gets everything he could ask for. This is what “happily ever after” actually means. It's a fine ending. Most of us are unwilling to stare it in the face, but it's better to face it without horror.
