Ao3 also imports stories from ancient fan fiction sites, and I've noticed that some of those imports come through without tags... so while there are certainly authors dropping the ball, it's also coming from however they're importing crap.

Authors not tagging fan fiction properly has been a problem for a long, long time and it's not gonna stop any time soon. Goes back to the days when people were posting on forums and blogs and using headers and they weren't even called 'tags,' haha.

I guess I could complain, but... you get what you pay for, and fan fiction is free.
