  Dumbledore would regret the decision to hand over the school letters to the house elves, even if it did save him hours in admin. Eleven year old Harry Potter was expected... Tom Riddle and Gellert Grindelwald... yeah, not so much. However that might turn out to be the least of the school's problems.

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)
