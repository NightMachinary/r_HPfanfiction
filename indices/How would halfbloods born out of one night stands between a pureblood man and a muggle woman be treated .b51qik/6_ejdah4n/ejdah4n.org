I think it depends on their father's involvement in their life pre-Hogwarts. Do they know who their father is? Do they know their father is a wizard? If they know and he's somewhat involved then they'd be treated as halfbloods. I imagine their treatment would vary depending on who. Perhaps a few cracks about their mother being a muggle from pure bloods like Draco but otherwise treated well. If they don't know, then they'd be treated as muggleborns. This is the same backstory Dean Thomas was supposed to have (grew up with mom, not knowing his father who was a wizard).
