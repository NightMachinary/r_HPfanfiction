It could be considered cultural/ racial appropriation since a turban is considered a religious and a cultural item in a lot of different religions and cultures, mostly in India so Harry could just be thinking about that (while it is true that most religions which involve a turban don't mind that other people wear a turban Harry is probably not aware of whether its okay for Quirrel to wear a ethnic clothing item especially since Quirrel is a white dude who's as pale as a vampire). Plus in the books (Both canon and POS) the turban is described as ridiculously large for his head (since you know he has a whole another head he needs to hide in there). If you're really concerned about this I would suggest asking your friend if he thinks this is a unsavoury line or simply humour.
