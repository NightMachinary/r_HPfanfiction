I don't know, man. Kind of sounds like you've only heard white people talking about it, so I'm not going to add to that. But don't worry, I love saris, and do engage with the Indian textile tradition because it's fucking awesome. I'm just not going to be like â€˜I just thought of this really cool thing. check out my wrap' and it's just like...a leather sari, or something lmao.

But anyway on the subject at hand I think that is a really weird thing to say about Snape as an argument as to why he didn't think he was the culprit.
