While Sikhs might be fine with sharing their culture with other groups of people that doesn't mean other cultures are. For example a year or two ago a white woman in America dressed as a Geisha for her school prom, this garnered a huge negative response from the Japanese community. While your opinion as a person of colour should certainly be respected this doesn't mean you're allowed to speak for other cultures and their opinion on appropriation of culture.
