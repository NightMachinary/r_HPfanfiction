valid point. You're right that Dursleys are totally the type of people to be completely and blatantly racist, and be complexity unapologetic about it. ‘Those people stealing our jobs' etc etc, right?

Some people actually say shit like ‘Harry would never have seen someone who isn't white before' which is just too extreme. He was very sheltered, but never? Your point isn't that though, so sorry for misreading it.
