The context of the line is Harry talking to Snape after Voldemort flees from the castle in first year (I could be wrong about the timeline because I haven't read the first POS book in a while) and then he says that he never believed that Snape was working with Quirrel/ Voldemort to steal the philosophers stone after Snape asks why Harry didn't believe it like his brother, he lists some legitimate points on why he didn't believe that they were working together before he sarcastically says he wouldn't have expected that the head of Slytherin house would work with a guy that wears a giant turban.

And about why people (at least me, I'm not sure what other people's view points are) are talking like only white people live in England is that Harry was raised in a primarily white neighborhood where he wasn't allowed to interact with other people for most of the time and spent most of his time in a cupboard, also the Dursley's come off as the kind of people who wouldn't talk or associate with anybody who doesn't seem normal or doesn't uphold the status quo (basically I'm saying that they seem like the kind of people who would be racist/xenophobic in that “I don't talk to anybody I consider inferior” kinda way). While I'm not saying that Harry has never seen a Indian person or a person wearing a turban I'm saying that Harry has probably not had the chance or much motivation to go research the importance and reason for wearing a turban before he came to Hogwarts.
