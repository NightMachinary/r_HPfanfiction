Cultural appropriation is definitely a thing. There are customs that are open, and customs that are not open. The sikhs are super chill and open and that's valid, but that doesn't mean that people from other cultures who find white girls wearing their sacred traditions as fashion to be incredibly inappropriate and disrespectful aren't valid

Eta: I find that line incredibly off putting though I haven't read the fic. What was the context? Why would someone say that? It's very strange.

And why do people keep acting like there are only white people in England?
