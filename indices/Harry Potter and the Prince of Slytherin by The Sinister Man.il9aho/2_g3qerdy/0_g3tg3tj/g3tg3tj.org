Even if it was racist, have you ever listened to how teenagers actually talk amongst themselves (eg in a bus)? If you transcribed that, people would think that it's poor freestyle rap based on the amount of racism, homophobia, sex and overall swear words.

Obviously they aren't all racists, sexists and such, they simply have no filter and think that bad language makes them badass.
