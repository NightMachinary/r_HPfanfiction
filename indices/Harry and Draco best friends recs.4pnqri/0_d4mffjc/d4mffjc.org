You're going to want DrizzleWizzle's series starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection). First 5 books are done, two chapters of the 6th are up (at time of comment). Kind of canon-rehashy, but I don't have the rabid dislike of that which others have.

For a post-Hogwarts, EWE fic, check out linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble).
