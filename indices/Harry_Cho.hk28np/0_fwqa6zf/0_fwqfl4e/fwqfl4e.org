Personally, I've wanted to see a harry/cho post hogwarts

they've both matured a bit, moved past/still dealing with loss, decide to give it a fresh try

maybe a quidditch rivals or something more normal

unique wise- she doesn't have any of the tropes/baggage associated with the other pairings that im so sick of i.e. daphne- pure blood lordness, susan- ministry , ginny - weasley brothers being the stereotype "dont touch our sister hur hur"
