I've never read the fic you linked, but there's a tonne to make the pairing interesting. A few ideas:

Cho is equally into quidditch as ginny, but being in a different house, there's more options for some fun, flirty interhouse rivalry.

Depending on when you start it, Cedric's death is a great unifying factor. In canon it effectively dooms their relationship (or rather Harry's handling of it does), but if things go a little different you could easily have them grieving together. It'd be really interesting to have an exploration of grief and loss through their relationship.

Cho is a little older and in a different house - that's an entire different social circle Harry can become embroiled in!

Depending on when you set it, Harry and Cho meeting again after Hogwarts and giving their relationship a second, more mature try? That's a dynamic we don't really get anywhere else (and would be really interesting if paired with an exploration of grief, trauma and recovery).
