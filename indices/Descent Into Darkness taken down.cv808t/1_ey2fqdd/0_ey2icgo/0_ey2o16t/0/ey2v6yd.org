I suggest you take the time to educate yourself on how different fanfiction authors have handled their works in the past, what rights they have to their works, what entitlement you have (none), and the loose conventions of the fandom community which generally respects the authors enough to willingly abide by their wishes. This sub in particular has rule 6.

Now, let's look a little more at why your base instict to fling insults is completely out of line.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey?a=b][author's FFN profile]] shows that she is actually one of the more openly fair minded and generous writers in this fandom. She is fine with people adapting her ideas in whatever way they want without crediting her. She even gives permission for anyone to adopt her abandoned stories as long as they list her as the original author. Most fanfiction authors are more protective of their creations and wouldn't give such broad license for others to use and abuse.

The author specifically warned her fans that the stories were going to be taken down, thus giving them a grace period to save copies for themselves if they love the story. Most other authors tend to take their stories down without any warning at all. To be honest, the readers are not entitled to anything, but Athey shows more courtesy to her fans than most other authors give in similar circumstances.

In conclusion, you would do better to learn more about a situation before sticking your foot in your mouth, and you should endeavor not to repay freely given courtesy with unjustifiable vitriol.
