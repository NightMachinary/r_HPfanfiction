Was it one of their fics with sex scenes? If so, someone may have reported it and had it brought to the admins' attention.

By FFN's t&c, fics aren't supposed to have explicit sexual content, as the ratings only go up to M, unlike the NC-17 or E ratings on other sites like Ao3. (Or LJ pre-Russian buyout.) Since there are so many fics hosted on FFN, no one moderates the content except in individual cases where it's been reported.
