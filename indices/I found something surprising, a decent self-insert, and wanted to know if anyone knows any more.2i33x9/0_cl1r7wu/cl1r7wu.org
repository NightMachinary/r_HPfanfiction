Holyshit that is actually pretty terrible.

He kills the Dusrleys in cold blood like it was nothing, this includes an innocent eleven years old.

Let that sink into you

*He kills an eleven year old kid because he bullied his cousin*

he sounds like a high functioning sociopath.

Now i admit the guy has decent writing technique but then he starts fixing harry's problems in the matters of a few hours, getting Petter and Barty C. JR. in the same days and nobody thinks that's suspicious

Ok i'm done dropped like a bass

I'm not religious at all but he believes in God but aparently has no qualms on killing an innocent boy?

FUCK THAT SHIT M8

I'm out

Edit: just to say that the idea of the story is actually pretty good and could be intersting if done well.
