The one you list is the only good one I know of in the HP fandom. A long series of "meh" ones can be found on [[http://www.siye.co.uk][SIYE]] by Spenser Hemmingway. He's a site mod who submits a new SI story for each bimonthly contest on the site. I never thought much of them, but some people must like them (though the humor falls pretty flat to me, they seem to win the contests more often than not).

If you don't mind recommendations from other fandoms, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/315314/Silver-Queen][Dreaming of Sunshine]] by Silver Queen is a Naruto SI that's quite good. Also recommended is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8774090/1/Reincarnation-Roulette][Reincarnation Roulette]] by the same author.
