Bit long, has pacing issues if I remember correctly and the SI isn't too proactive.

Same premise as the one you linked

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4499794/1/Being-Gilderoy-Lockhart][Being Gilderoy Lockheart]]

Again same premise

There is also a pretty long one called a matter of force, where the SI is harry's twin sister, but it is non serious and a bit cracky (one plot point is taking like 5 chapters / a few months, in a time travel device with 15 people to learn how to play rock guitars, blegh, no one would agree to that in real life). I didn't really like it.
