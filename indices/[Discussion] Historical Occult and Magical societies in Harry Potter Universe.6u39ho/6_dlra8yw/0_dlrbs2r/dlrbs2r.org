Historically in some cultures magic was widely respected, between shaman, witch doctors, hedge witches, etc. The ISoS was fairly recent in history, and you could assume that the desire to cover up magic stemmed from the lessening of wizard numbers and the growth of muggle population, which led to distrust of those with magic to downright hostility, often caused by jealous individuals with power.
