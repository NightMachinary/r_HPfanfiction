It would actually make sense for the most prominent magical societies of the time to have been window-dressed as religious in nature prior to the SoS becoming a thing. The druids, the first priests, the polytheistic temple attendants, all of them were essentially the go-to guys when it came to the storage, processing and dissemination of data at the time. If you wanted to learn how to read or write, you went to them (for a price, mind. Altruism is an incredibly modern concept by religious standards). You needed healing, you went to them. You wanted something recorded or copied, you went to them.

Ancient and not-so-ancient religions held a monopoly on knowledge, medical techniques and education in ancient times. That is an incredibly powerful position to be in, and qualifying for a post there would have been the ancient world's equivalent to getting a PHD in a STEM field given the sheer complexity and responsibility such a position would have commanded in societies where, despite the fact that said civilizations lived or died by the information they had, there were very, very few other knowledge bases available-and none the general public would have had easy access to at that.

In other words, it's almost perfect for a small magical community. The authority to gather information, an almost unequalled amount of freedom when compared to what the rest of the public had to put up with, a lavish lifestyle and the ability to pass off any potential accidents involving magic as either a sign of the gods or a miracle brought to Earth.

In a time before the obliviate spell became widespread, this particular subterfuge would have been vital in keeping a lid on the muggles' tendency towards discrimination/hatred/genocidal impulses when magic came into play.

And then Jesus happened and the wheels started coming off.Whether that was due to monotheism, Christianity, strife between religions, the evolution of human society as a whole or the Roman Empire (which tended to screw things up a lot anyway), something else or everything at once is up for debate.
