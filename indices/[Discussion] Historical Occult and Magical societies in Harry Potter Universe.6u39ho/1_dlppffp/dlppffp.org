Huh. I was doing something similar to this a few days ago, but a narrower scope. Have you looked into Crowley's stuff? Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, something something Orient, and the A.A.? There's the Freemasons, of course, and I was looking specifically into University-based secret societies - one that looked promising was the 7 Society. I'm going to look up Thule now and I'll get back to you if I find anything else of interest :)
