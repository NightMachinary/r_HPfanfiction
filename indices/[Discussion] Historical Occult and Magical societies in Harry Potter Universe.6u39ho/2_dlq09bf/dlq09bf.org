In the Middle Ages there was a heresy (well, there is currently debate about whether they existed or not) called the Heresy of the Free Spirit (condemned by Ad Nostrum from the Council of Lyons in 1245, I think, it's been a while). Also, there was a sub-Branch of the Franciscans called the Spiritual Franciscans who were declared heretical by the church, despite the fact they were following Francis' testament to the letter. While neither are magical or occult, heresy is always fun (well, not for heretics). The Cathars are also popular, or the beguines which got in trouble for letting women minister.
