The same can also be said for the Inquisition itself. What better way would there have been for the magical world to remove any proof that magic actually existed than to secretly run the group meant to find and destroy any practitioner and source material using it? After all, there is no guarantee that magic was purely the domain of wizards and witches if the existence and the generally accepted techniques for actually using magic were more widely known. Having muggles tap into magical-seeming powers would have been a threat to the SoS, one the magical world would have trouble eradicating without tipping off the uninformed as to their existence. The inquisition would have been a boon to them, offering them both the means to quickly identify such practices alongside the authority to eradicate it as well as those that know about it.
