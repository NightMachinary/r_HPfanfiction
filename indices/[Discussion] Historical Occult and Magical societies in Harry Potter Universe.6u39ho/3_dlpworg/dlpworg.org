I would assume Camelot was real, but Merlin existed post-Hogwarts, which historically doesn't match with the timelines unless you wanna add a couple headmasters to Hogwarts' history. I'd still make Camelot real if I was making a full AU story, but I would take Merlin out of Hogwarts, maybe one of the founders was a long lost apprentice of an apprentice?

Maybe there are also specialized Magical Cults? Like Pyromancers or specifically Dark Magicians that practice in Sorcery, etc... To increase the size of Magical Society, you must all increase the size and scope of Magic. The only reason Voldemort is considered the most powerful Dark Lord is because of how ambiguous history is for Rowling's world, but once you blow the lid open, everything gets scaled up.

I'd also assume that there is a 'Wandmakers Guild' or was at some point, just as there are 'Librarians' that probably cultivate Magical Knowledge in the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Wizards don't seem like ones for Book Burning, so you'd find just about anything in there, Old Magic, New Magic, Experimental Magic, Unfinished Spells, etc....
