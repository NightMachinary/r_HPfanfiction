The Cambridge Apostles are secretly upper-class muggleborn wizards who have ventured back into the muggle world and chosen to continue their education at Cambridge. In addition to debates and talks, the Apostles meet to practice magic away from the watchful eyes of professors and obliviators alike. Their magical origin has been an open secret since the fifties, when they came to ministry attention after five of their former members were caught sharing intelligence with the Soviet war-wizards. During the reign of Margaret Thatcher, the left-leaning tendencies of the Apostles caused great deal of political friction between the Ministry of Magic and the national government.

Several of their members have achieved fame in both worlds -- John Maynard Keynes, who through the publication of his Theory of Magical Economics founded an entirely new field, and Bertrand Russel, who is credited with several of the greatest discoveries in modern arithmancy.
