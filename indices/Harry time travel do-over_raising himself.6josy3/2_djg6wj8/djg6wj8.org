God there was one I read awhile back but can't remember the name of. One-shot, on Harry's first day of muggle school the kids are all stunned because the Harry is basically the teachers mini-me. Briefly goes through his muggle school years with the teacher also introducing him to the magical world and even setting up a house(in actuality a keep) on an island for Harry to love away from the Dursleys on before it ends. I remember it being pretty good. Anyone know what it was called?
