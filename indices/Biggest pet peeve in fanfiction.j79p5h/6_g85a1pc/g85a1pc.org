- shopping scenes. Idk if this sounds petty but I don't want to read a super long chapter where Harry gets all these new clothes, new books, something new with his hair, etc

- Harry is super knowledgeable with wizarding politics (addressing people like Malfoy as "Lord") and is super smooth with the ladies

- Harry is acting super girlish or childish
