Personally i hate grown up Harry more than childish Harry. Like I get he had a horrible childhood and would be more mature than the average child. But that doesn't mean he should be all, "we have dealt a devastating blow against the dark this day, but we must be wary as lifes equilibrium always moves to oppose the changes we have made!" when he is 11 yrs old
