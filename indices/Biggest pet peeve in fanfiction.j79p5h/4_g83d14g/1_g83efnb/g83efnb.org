I agree! The Weasleys I get, because of Mr. Weasley's muggle obsession, but everyone else... robes aren't just a cloak. Though it makes me curious about the idea of jumpers, which we know about from canon. Mrs. Weasley, who is unfamiliar with most things muggle, still knit them for her kids. So are they considered wizarding clothing or not?
