Against the Moon - linkffn(7305052)

I like this one, but the updates are quite slow. Though I prefer a background where werewolves are stronger than the average human though, and this one paints the werewolf curse as weaker... it's stlil a delightful read. The author writes Sirius and James really well, and it's one of the rare fics that doesn't leave out Peter as part of the Marauders.
