[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want To Make A Memory?]] - Starts at the beginning of their first year and goes through their years at Hogwarts and beyond. The only romantic pairing is James/Lily. Remus gets the most focus, but everyone is characterized pretty well; Peter isn't left out as part of the group, and they all have a believable friendship. It's also complete!

[[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][The Shoebox Project]] - You've probably heard of this one, and it doesn't go through all their years at Hogwarts - it's not completely finished - but what exists is enough to keep you busy for a while, and the characterizations are pretty solid. It's pretty canon compliant, and the romantic pairings are James/Lily and Sirius/Remus.
