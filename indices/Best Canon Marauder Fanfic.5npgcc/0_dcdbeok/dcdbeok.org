I haven't read it in a long time, but I have a soft spot for Casting Moonshadows - linkffn(3378356)

It's slash & incomplete, but it fleshes out the home-life/background of Remus and Sirius beautifully. Remus' the main character so there's a big focus on lycanthropy. Endearing pranks and a solid characterisation of both James and Peter too. Canon compliant if you don't mind S/R.
