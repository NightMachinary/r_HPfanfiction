Train to Nowhere hits many of those.

Harry isn't a slytherin but is in Durmstrang, everyone is pretty dark arts oriented since is an AU where Voldemort won the war.

Harry is pretty dark in a number of ways.

Voldemort is not good but he is charming and sane and an effective ruler. and the main character along with Harry.

Harry knows Draco since childhood and he meets the rest of the slytherins but they are not very close.

Harry slowly turns super political and little by little start to plan his own resistance. This is very well managed and realistic. No 11 y/o Harry taking over the world.

Lily and James are dark Lord followers.

There is Sirius-remus interaction but is a bit unusual. Remus is super supportive of Harry though.

And is an extremely slowburn Tomarry

The world building is excellent and the writing is great quality.
