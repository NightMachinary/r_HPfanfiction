Just imagining a journal left behind by Dumbledore and Fawke's last mission was to deliver it to whoever ends up controlling the Elder Wand after an short gestation period (totally reasonable to assume it would switch hands a few times after his death).

In the first couple pages of the Journal, he writes a few letters depending on his best guesses of who would end up with the wand.

If Harry, he implores him to once again take up the crown of responsibility that he never asked for, but wears so well.

If Voldemort, an appeal to his humanity that, while they may have never seen eye-to-eye, the wizarding world was still his home and it was necessary that these things be done to keep it operating smoothly.

If Dobby, question reality.

The rest of the journal would be descriptions and instructions of each of these weird and unexpected things he had learned needed to be done to keep the world functioning properly.

Every Monday, check for an Imperious on the Comptroller General.

Every Tuesday, refill the fountain of magical creatures in the atrium of the ministry.

Every Wednesday, make sure Dobby hasn't accidentally acquired the Elder Wand.
