Headcanon: wizarding Britain started falling apart bit by bit after Dumbledore died. At first no one noticed because hey it was wartime things were supposed to be a mess. Then it got more obvious as time went on. Turned out he did a bunch of maintenance behind the scenes with the elder wand and now Britain needs to figure out how to cope without him.
