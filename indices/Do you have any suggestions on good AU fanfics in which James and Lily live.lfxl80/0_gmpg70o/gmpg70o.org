There is that series on archieveofown which is basically the seven books re-written with the premise that Peter Pettigrew is overwhelmed by regret for his betrayal during his visit at the Potters and he ends up sacrificing himself for them thus initiating the protective love spell. I can't remember its name but I think it's fairly well-known so maybe someone here can help.
