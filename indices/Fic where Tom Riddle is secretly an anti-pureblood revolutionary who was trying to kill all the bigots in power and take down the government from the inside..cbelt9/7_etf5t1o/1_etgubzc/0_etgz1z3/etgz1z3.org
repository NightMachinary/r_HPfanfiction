I'm not sure where your last quote is coming from, but I certainly didn't say it. My problem with HPMoR recommendations doesn't necessarily come from a dislike of the story, but from how often its being recommended is inappropriate.

It's a large fic with many different chapters and many different tangents. It covers quite a few cliches and tropes ironically in certain chapters, never to be seen again. Quite a few requests, because of this, can technically be filled by HPMoR even though that person would sometimes have to wade through some 100+ chapters to find it mentioned a single time.

Even THIS request, to which we're responding, the whole David Monroe plot being revealed to be Tom Riddle doesn't happen until pretty much the very end. Obviously it's a reveal that retrospectively affects the entire plot, but it's not consciously a factor in your first read through.

TL;DR: I'm not gatekeeping. A popular fic doesn't necessarily translate to recommendations. HPMoR, however, can FIT a lot of requests, if only barely and not in the SPIRIT of the request.
