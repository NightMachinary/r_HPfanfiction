I feel like there's an obvious difference between "Hey this isn't exactly what you asked for, but it's a good story and you might like it" and "This story has over 100 chapters and is over half-a-million words long, but your request is kind of mentioned in one chapter for a few lines and is never brought up again, so you might want to read the whole thing to find it."
