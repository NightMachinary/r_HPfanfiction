  "looking for a 'for want of a nail' fic where Harry is raised by different people so he turns out differently"

That's actually an excellent example of a request that HPMOR /wouldn't/ fit. HPMOR is not a 'for want of a nail' fic; it has many, many underlying differences from canon, not just one change.

From what I've seen on this sub, people tend to view the fic more favorably when it actually fits the OP's request. Disregarding the minutia of the OP's requirements does no one any favors.
