  Nope. Nowhere in the OP is it stated that whole plot of the fic revolves around Tom Riddle's attempt to take down the government, that could easily just be a side bit. Plenty of people make queries where it turns out the bits they remembered were side bits.

Yeah, that's a fair point.

  hardly any of them were based on something mentioned once in passing.

Honestly, maybe it's just been too long since I've read HPMoR, but I can't remember very many plot points that are continuous enough to last beyond a few chapters.

SPOILERS:

There's, like, Bellatrix being broken out of prison which is pretty important. Time turners are a constant theme... Bullies, maybe. The redemption of Draco Malfoy and his friendship with Hermione.

I suppose there are a lot of ways to phrase those, but other than that... it feels like most of the chapters are almost self-contained logical fallacies or parts of the scientific method that the author wanted to discuss for a minute.
