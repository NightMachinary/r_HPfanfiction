It's not really like A Dramatic Reading, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8553100/1/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Harry-J-Potter][The Rise and Fall of Harry J Potter]] is also inspired by the 'Reading the Books' trope and is 'technically' more complete (it's on to Chamber of Secrets at least).

  All was well. Truly, it was. Harry Potter was so happy that not even Rita Skeeter's newest biography could spoil things. Okay, fine, so maybe he'd 'forgotten' to mention parts of his past to his loved ones. It wasn't like this disaster could end in Azkaban sentences or pygmy puff invasions, right? Right. He was worrying about nothing. --- Pre-Epilogue, canon ships.
