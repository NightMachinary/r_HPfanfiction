I actually asked about the Slytherin 'United Front' thing way back, turns out - if you take Pottermore as canon - there's a bunch of vocabulary in the Slytherin introductory speech if you get sorted there that supports the whole thing, in less poorly-explained terms, and without any BS "because the rest of the school are against us" reason.

Otherwise I'm afraid OP that I can't think of any Gryffindor re-sort time-travels off the top of my head, sorry for not actually being able to answer your request.
