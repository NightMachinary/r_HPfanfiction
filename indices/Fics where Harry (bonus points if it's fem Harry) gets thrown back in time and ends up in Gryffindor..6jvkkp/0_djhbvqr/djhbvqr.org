I agree so much! Why is this even a thing? Is it just a justification that explains why Slytherin isn't a bunch of evil people for not coming to Harry's rescue when Draco says mean stuff? Don't these authors understand that even without those rules people prefer their in-group? Most people don't care about the petty squabbles of two kids in school and don't want to emberrass themselves by speaking up anyways.
