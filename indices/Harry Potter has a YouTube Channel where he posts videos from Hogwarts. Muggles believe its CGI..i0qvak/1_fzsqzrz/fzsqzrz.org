(In your best Asmongold voice) What up, y'all. It's ya boi. It's Harry Potter. I don't even know where to start on this one. For the record, I did NOT, repeat, DID NOT, put my name in the goblet. The staff here.... it's like they don't even care any more. They aren't listening to the students. They knew something like this could happen and someone ran an exploit on the Goblet anyway. The staff at Hogwarts cares so much about image that they forgot to tighten security. Check and double check the wards. Maybe, I dunno, look for sloppy spellwork. This is so frustrating. In its current state, this Tournament is UNPLAYABLE.
