“Guys, I've made some freaky discoveries. You know how Snape killed Dumbledore last year? He did it on /Dumbledore's orders/! Isn't that crazy? On top of that, he was best friends with my mum and loved her! He was protecting me all these years! Now, here's the sad part. This will be my very last video. Ever. After I sign off, I'm going to have to give myself up to Voldemort and die to protect the Wizarding World. Thank you Hermione, my brilliant editor, and Ron, my source for ideas. You two have been my greatest friends. Draco, otherwise known as PurebloodSupreme, please come up with better username. And yes, I know it was you. Professor McGonagall, thank you for being such a supportive teacher and being there for me every step of the way. Hagrid, you're awesome! Without you, I wouldn't even be here! Ginny, I love you with all my heart, and I hope you can still be happy in the future. The guy who ends up with you will be a truly lucky guy. Lastly, to Professor Snape, I hope you and Mum manage to become friends again. She'll forgive you. You protected me, after all. She can't possibly deny that! Guys, it was fun vlogging and sharing all these cool memories with you, and I hope you've enjoyed my content up to this point. I'm signing off, now. Wish me luck on the next great adventure!”

“Okay guys, I lied. I'm not dead. Apparently my mum's sacrificial charm saved me. But I meant what I said earlier. I'm immensely grateful to all the people I mentioned in my goodbye message. You know who /is/ dead? Voldemort! All the people who laid down their lives to fight him will now be avenged thanks to his destruction. If you liked this vlog, do the big three! I'll see you in the next one! Bye!”
