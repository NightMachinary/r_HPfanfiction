Maybe Dudley edited the videos and got super invested in the history?

Would also be fun to see Harry outright and straight-faced breaking the Statute of Secrecy with not only the ministry not doing anything because they don't know enough about technology to understand what he is doing but also the muggles he is exposing the magical world to (completed with complex explanations about culture and history) not only laughing it off, but also actively teasing and finding explanations to convince those who do believe in it. In the end he will actually have helped to straighten the secret by making the muggles find alternative explanations to any magic that does slip through.
