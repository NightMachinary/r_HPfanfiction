  Izuku Midoriya was a normal quirkless boy. At least, that's what he thought. When he sees in his mirror a serial killer that's been haunting the streets of Musutafu for 3 months, claiming around six victims over that period of time, he has to deal with the fact that his body does have a quirk. It just doesn't belong to him.
