The only crossover i've read that's held my attention is linkffn(Wand and Shield) , however it's not complete and has weird irregular updates. The best part about this story is how harry still seems in character yet blends into the world of the avengers perfectly.

Now if only the author would update it already, i end up having to reread half the fic again because of his random resurrections of the it.
