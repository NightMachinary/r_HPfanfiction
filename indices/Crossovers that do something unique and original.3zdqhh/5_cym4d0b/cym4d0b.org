linkffn(7748339) is a fave for how it avoided all the normal cliches. Pyro/Brotherhood/X-Men have little contact with the wizarding world. Instead, John and Harry meet and build a relationship in the mundane Privet Drive after HBP. The first part of the story happens during that summer where their respective roles are temporarily on hold. The next part takes place after the wizarding war ends.

Again, nothing overpowered. People are in character. There's abusive!Vernon, but the violence is a new development and it's done in a way that makes sense. It doesn't bash Harry's other relationships either. It's just really well done when many crossovers of this type go completely off the rails.
