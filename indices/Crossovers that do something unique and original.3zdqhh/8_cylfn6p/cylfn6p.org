[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4044086/1/Strength-of-Brothers][Strength of Brothers]] In which Naruto and Harry Potter have shared dreams, and share what they know with eachother, Harry being a year older for some reason and taking the role of the older brother.

The excuse of this is Luna's mother, who is so often an Unspeakable, attempts some experiment to establish a link to a distant reality at the same time a giant fox demon gets sealed by a deathgod and Harry get's zapped by a curse that should kill; and that fucks shit up in the best possible way, though then the author ruins that explanation a tiny bit by revealing Luna has been linked with dozens of people in dreams including a giant tree, and reveals to Harry that his link is far stronger as they consider themselves brothers, and sooner or later, when they use too much power the link will break, snapping one of them into the other's dimension. Though it has an unexpected consequence when it does happen.

Still, a fantastic fanfiction, the only downside is it ends just before the shippuden timeskip for Naruto and at the end of the triwizard tournament for harry, it's complete, but there should be a sequel and isnt and likely won't be one.

Still well worth the read however, and I don't think I've seen any other fic where the majority of it being a cross over is shared dreams with another person in another reality. If you read naruto harry crossovers, you'll know there's a few pen pals type fics out there, and this fic takes that to it's logical extreme without plopping the elemental nations on Earth.
