As [[/u/Hobbitcraftlol]] said, you can consider Daphne Greengrass an OC so here's linkffn(10649604) a pretty good fic.

Don't be repelled by the title, it is one of the best romance I've ever read in fanfiction.

Besides that, Harry Potter and the BWL is pretty much one of the best writings around, published or not.
