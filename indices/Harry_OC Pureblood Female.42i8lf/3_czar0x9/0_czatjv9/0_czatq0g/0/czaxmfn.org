Oh, it's definitely in character, I just didn't want to read about it.

I get a bit ragey when umbridge does her thing in any story, and drugging/obliviation are huge rage inducers as well. So I had a real urge to go vigilante on a fictional character every time she appeared, and it wasn't a nice relaxing pastime at that point.
