I love this author. Big Harry/Daphne fan actually, and I think it was his stories that did it. The lion tamer trilogy is a little old and he's improved as a writer since then but I loved it when I read it. He used to go by munkeymaniac and he's gotten rid of a few of his older stories, but I'm always following what he's writing, in fact he just started a new story I haven't looked at yet.
