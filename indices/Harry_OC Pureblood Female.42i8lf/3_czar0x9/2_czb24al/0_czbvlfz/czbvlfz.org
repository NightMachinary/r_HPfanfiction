Oh, yes, thank you for reminding me that I have to finish the Lion Tamer, I was chapter 26 or so if I recall correctly!

And I'll go check his new story to file it for later, I have more than a few story waiting to be read.

P.S.: Did you know that if you mistype "lion" it can become "loin"? I will now view this story in another light.
