  Isabella Dementa Riddle was the daughter of Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. Rescued by the Order after Bellatrix's arrest, Dumbledore sent her to live in an American Orphanage away from her parent's dark past. She is forced to transfer to Hogwarts upon her father's return where she meets Harry Potter, the boy who lived. Will he hate her too, or will he see the truth in her?
