Editorial note- he's 33-34 when caught in the Shrieking Shack.

I like to think that Peter valued courage and honour and all that, but that he had 'a different kind of courage'; he would've been frustrated with being sidelined after leaving school, when his friends were in the Order with him but no one thought enough of him to send him on dangerous missions. /Wasn't I the one sneaking everywhere to make our map? Wasn't I the one sent in to deliver our pranks while my friends sat publicly elsewhere to make an alibi?/

It's this frustration that might lead him to take on his own spying mission, to finally get one of them into the enemy's camp. After all, that's what he'd done during school. How much different could it be with adults who aren't as crafty as Hogwarts Professors?

Peter hadn't accounted for the Dark Lord's powers over the mind. Caught, with no other possible avenue of survival, he played out his intended backup story; "I'm not valued by the Order!" (which was true).

Peter may even have known a bit of Occlumency, but once he had taken the Dark Mark his mind was to Voldemort an open book.

That's my take on it. Call it tragic misjudgement or hubris, but I don't see it being better to blame Dumbledore for Peter's fate. He chose it- like a Gryffindor.
