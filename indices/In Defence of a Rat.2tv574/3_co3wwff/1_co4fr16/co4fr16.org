And it's true Dumbledore was looking pretty scapegoat-y, but you see it in movies and other books all the time. The general of the war has to think about the overall outcome, not about the individual soldiers. If a brigade (Has anyone read Brigade's stories I love them so much not that that's relevant to this discussion at all) has to be sacrificed to win the war, then that's what he'll do, because countless other lives will be saved. Dumbledore tried to get them out, but he couldn't halt the plan just because they refused to go along with it (unknowingly). It's Sirius he really threw under the bus, but I guess that comes from reading so many fics where Dumbledore needed Harry with the Dursleys that it's become headcanon.
