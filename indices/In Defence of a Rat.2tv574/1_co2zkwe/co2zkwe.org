Peter betraying the order wasn't necessarily an act of cowardice. All his life he'd followed James, Sirius and Remus, doing what they wanted because he wanted friends. Stepping away from that to find a place in life where he felt truly valued would have taken courage as leaving your comfort zone is always scary. If he truly held the same beliefs as the death eaters then what he was actually doing was turning away from a life where he was secure and protected in order to follow his beliefs. You don't necessarily have to be "good" in order to be brave.

On both sides of every war are people fighting for what they believe is right. The people on the losing side are no less brave just because their views on the world are different, they're still putting their lives at risk to stand up for their beliefs.

Peter then decided to live as a rat rather than face the punishment for his actions. It's pretty hard to argue that it's not brave, but nowhere in canon does it say that Gryffindors always have to be brave. There are examples in the books of Harry running away rather than doing the brave thing. For example, when he inflates Aunt Marge he chooses to try to run from the ministry and hide rather than accept the punishment for performing magic outside of school. This is exactly what Peter did, albeit for a much lesser crime.

Peter is one of my favourite characters in the series because of the complexity of his character, despite the fact it's not really explored in canon. I also hate that he's always portrayed as a snivelling coward since I find it very unlikely that James and Sirius would've put up with him if he was like that.
