If Peter betrayed the Order because he was more sympathetic towards the cause of the Death Eaters, then good lord, more power to him. But I'm just really tired of seeing him being kicked around in fanfic. He's the disposable Death Eater, the moving target practice, the snivelling rat who valued his own skin so much he betrayed his best friends to get it. I mean, agree on Gryffindors not always being brave, but this is kinda, like, one of the defining moments of his character, and we're told at the Shrieking Shack "he would have killed me!" "Then you should have died!"

Please give me your opinions on Peter's complexity :)
