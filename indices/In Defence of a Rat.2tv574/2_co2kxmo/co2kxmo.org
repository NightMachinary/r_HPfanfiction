  This is something I never liked. Peter Pettigrew is a Gryffindor, yet his act of betrayal is said to be the result of cowardice and self-preservation -distinctly non-Gryffindor traits. So instead of showing that villains can come from any house, it shows us that Pettigrew wasn't a "true" Gryffindor and was displaying the Slytherin trait of self-preservation.

Acutally doesn't Dumbledore say something on the lines of "We sort too soon" in regards to Snape? I guess while the hat can see your potential, only you can actually make that potential become something more?
