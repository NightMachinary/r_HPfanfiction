I guess. I mean, it did pretty okay with regards to a lot of the other characters. I think of course most people will have a mix of all the house traits, and also I personally think (and have heard) that the hat takes values into account. So I could be sorted into Slytherin if I value ambition and subtlety and cunning, even if inside I'm a fluffy loyal Hufflepuff who can't stand to see people hurt.

I guess I just wanted to see other possible motivations for Pettigrew's betrayal. The "he would have killed me" explanation always seemed a little stupid to me. Why would Voldemort bother with a weak wizard like Pettigrew? Pettigrew would have flown so far under the radar he could have been in the middle of a battlefield and Voldemort wouldn't care one bit about him. By turning coat, he brought himself to the Dark Lord's attention - a stupid move if his motivations were to save his skin. So yeah, I wanted to see a headcanon where he really did love his friends.
