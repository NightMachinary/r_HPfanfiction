I do like these fics quite a lot, sadly it's been a while since I found any I considered keeping for a reread :( though ones I read turn to Harry becoming 'dark', or at least 'grey' - is that all right with you?

My absolute favorite though is Horror of Our Love ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/419407/chapters/698700]]), sadly unfinished, but does have quite a word count, and is a pleasure to read :3!

While not specifically diary!Tom, you might also enjoy Strange_Soulmates' Harry/Tom fics ([[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Strange_Soulmates/pseuds/Strange_Soulmates/works?fandom_id=136512]]) - while heavily AU, I really enjoy their character interpretation :)
