Well, there is "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/1/Harry-Potter-Squatter][Harry Potter, Squatter]]", which is more of an [Abandoned Harry finds new home] fic than anything else. Although he technically is a demigod, he doesn't get an OP buff from said heritage; it just explains his bipolar luck. He still gets by on his skills and wit, with a touch of accidental/wandless magic. linkffn(13274956)

One thing I find nice is that it's not just a [PJO rehash, but with Harry in the team] fic, but a relatively fresh plot. Also, Annabeth gets a raid team to help her tackle Arachne, rather than being forced to solo the Mark of Athena.
