I didn't mean it like that I just don't like the "one universe is Better than the other in every way" trope for example Wizards VS Half gods in my opinion a really equal fight but many authors only focus on the physical side of the fight Half Gods train more, therefore, they beat the Wizards but the fact that Wizards can Teleport, create things out of thin Air, cast living sentient fire that can't be put out unless it runs out of feeding material (Fiendfire), turn into mist, transform into Animals, ... Gets completely ignored.

That's why I like that some canon in my fics, I imagined the whole the Gods pay the wizards to keep the goods a secret thing like this:

The gods only know that some mortal organization keeps the rest of them unaware of the Gods.

The normal Wizard doesn't know that gods exist it's an Unspeakable/MACUSA President level secret. The Obliviators only get told to erase the last few hours of memories.

But I had an idea that would go full AU:

My idea is that the whole Pantheon of Olympus and all the other gods are just very strong near-immortal Wizards with, Illusions of grandeur, that act like gods and that give through blood magic some magical traits to their children and put them in camp half-blood to create an army of child super-soldiers to take over the World. The wizarding world found out about this and launches an international Auror strike against Camp half Blood and Mt Olympus at the end of Percy Jackson and the Lightning thief when everything seems to be right with the world.

Problem is that I'm too lazy and Incompetent to write a story that's longer than 700 words without losing interest and binning it.
