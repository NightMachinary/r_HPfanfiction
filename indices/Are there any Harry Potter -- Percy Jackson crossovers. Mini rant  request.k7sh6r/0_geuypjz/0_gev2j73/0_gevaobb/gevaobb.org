Oh ok, we are going full AU. Obviously all that would work then, but any story like this would require a whole big deus ex machina. Or the author rewrites a lot of the books.

I was just thinking about both universes are absolutely 100% seperate, noone cares/knows about the other until the crossover happens. Since thats how I like my crossovers. I hate the whole "Imma rewrite everything canon so my crossover can work and have Harry learn about the Gods and how they are real at Hogwarts". But yea, if you assume all that, I guess they would care, maybe? Lot of stuff that doesnt make any sense then tho. For example, I doubt Hades would allow Horcruxes to exist since they go straight against his domain.
