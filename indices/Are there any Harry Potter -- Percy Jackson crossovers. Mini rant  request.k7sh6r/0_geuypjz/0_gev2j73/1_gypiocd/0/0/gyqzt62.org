Okay but “magical” is a very broad term. The magic and creatures that we see in the wizarding world needs to originate from /somewhere/. Since the gods are...gods, it's a reasonable assumption that they played a hand in how magic works. Their creatures and monsters also need to originate from somewhere, so doesn't it make sense that they'd originate from the same place as all other monsters in this universe (Tartarus)? So, it's simply possible that the wizards haven't found a way to kill it, but Percy being a demigod is able to using his sword which is lethal to monsters.

In a shared world, that's the lore that would make sense to me. However, this is just my interpretation of how an universe with both magic and gods would work and perhaps you would do it differently
