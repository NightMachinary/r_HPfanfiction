But dementors are Magical, not Mythical creatures in Percy Jackson law, as far as I know so correct me if I'm wrong, their weapons shouldn't work at all add to that that you can't in any way shape or form harm a Dementor as far as Harry Potter lore is concerned and I would say that Dementors should be pretty safe from anything.
