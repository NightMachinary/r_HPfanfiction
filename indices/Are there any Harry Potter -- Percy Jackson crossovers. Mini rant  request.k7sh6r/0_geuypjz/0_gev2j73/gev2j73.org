Ok, but how do you tell the difference between a Magical(HP) Hydra and a Greek(PJ) Hydra plus if goods are real why not Wizards.

I imagine that in a shared universe the Gods pay the Magical community to obliviate the Godly activities.

- I doubt that the Gods wouldn't care about a magical world that has a spell that instantly kills you nothing you can do about it sends your soul straight to the afterlife. One more thing Dementors just saying soul removal is a pretty straight death so I would think that the Gods have to care if the magical world exists.

(All my assumptions are made with local rules for example I won't assume that a Percy Jackson Bronze Sword can kill a Dementor (one fic I saw led with that) nothing can kill a Dementor only the Patronus drives a dementor away. Gods/Halfgods/Demigods all have souls therefor Dementors can Kiss/kill all Percy Jackson characters without any counter.)

I'm no expert in The Percy Jackson universe so if you know something like the Dementor rule tell me
