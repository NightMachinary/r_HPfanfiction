"percy was born 1993" umm, actually his birthday is august 1992, plus the Mist is /very/ effective, considering one of the keepers of the barrier is Hecate, goddess of magic, she could probably /easily/ make it so witches/wizards are affected by it too, normally (cause clear eyed mortals exist, clear eyed witches and wizards would probably exist) but fics that have harry either be older than percy period, or just not demigod period? also, is fem!harry fics okay?
