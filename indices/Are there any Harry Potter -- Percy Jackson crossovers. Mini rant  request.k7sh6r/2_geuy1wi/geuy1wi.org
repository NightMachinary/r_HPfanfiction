linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) might not be quite what you had in mind, but it fits, and it's probably my favorite Percy Jackson fic. It does have Harry as an adult dealing with the Percy Jackson world, but it's because he's doing some MoD dimension hopping. What really sold me on it was Persephone being a main character and the actions she's getting up to.

linkffn(The Serpopard by PsychicDetective) fits, but hasn't been updated in about 1.5 years and hasn't even reached the start of the PJO books yet.
