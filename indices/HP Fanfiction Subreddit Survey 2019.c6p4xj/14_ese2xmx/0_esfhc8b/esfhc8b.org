"Wrong Boy Who Lived" and "Harem" seem to be tropes that get discussed frequently on this sub, so those might be good question topics.

Changing Harry's name seems to be a divisive subject, so it might be interesting to see what percentage of the sub feels strongly for and against.

It might also be neat to see what the most popular preferences are for alternate sortings (Harry going into Slytherin, Ravenclaw, etc.)

I've seen the "Dark Magic addiction" trope pop up frequently in Dark! or Indie!Harry fics, so that might also make a good topic.
