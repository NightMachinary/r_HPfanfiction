Any fanfic involving the Dark Lord I'll read. Then the writer has to come up with dialogues worthy of his intelligence, ruthlessness and cunning, not all are up to it. It's like reading a fanfiction about Hannibal Lecter. Specially when he pushes Harry out of his Gryffindor nonsense, it makes you wonder how different things would be with a friend or mentor that sharp and ruthless.
