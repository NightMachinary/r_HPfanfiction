I mean, it definitely helps, but I always thought it was rooted in the fact that Voldemort is not in any way realistic. It's like hating Sauron. Sure, they're both unquestionably evil and the sooner they kick the bucket the better, but it's hard to muster any real /hatred/ for them.

Umbridge (to name the clear runaway winner in that particular un-popularity contest) is /real./ Not in the sense that Dolores Jane Umbridge is walking around London (or cooling her heels in prison), but in the sense that the specific flavor of petty evil that she embodies is alive and well in the world today. We've /all/ known, met, or heard stories of an Umbridge-esque person who abuses the rules to get their way. That she hides under a saccharine-sweet veneer just makes it worse.
