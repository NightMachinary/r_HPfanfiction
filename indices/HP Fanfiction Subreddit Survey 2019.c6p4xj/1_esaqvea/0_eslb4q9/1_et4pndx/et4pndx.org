It's more the fact that Voldemort isn't much of a character, we mostly just here that he's evil and scary, see him have a few fights (the only remotely impressive one being with Dumbledore), he really doesn't have much time in the spotlight.\\
Compare that to characters like Umbrdige who spend an entire book being realistically vile.
