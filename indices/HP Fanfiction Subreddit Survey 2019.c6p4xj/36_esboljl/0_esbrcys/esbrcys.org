I think there's a difference between bashing and portraying a character in a negative light, however.

I'm not a huge fan of Hermione in fanfiction (though I like her fine in canon). But even though I'm fine reading Hermione as an antagonist, I'd much prefer to read about the protagonist being at odds with a Hermione who has her canonical talents (neither exaggerated nor diminished) and who is capable of learning and growth. Not only is such a character much more believable, she's also just a better antagonist that way. Stupid antagonists result in stories with no conflict.

I've no interest in reading about a cartoonish Hermione whose magical talent has been downgraded and who just performs the same pointless actions again and again while expecting a different result (usually with completely opaque motivations).
