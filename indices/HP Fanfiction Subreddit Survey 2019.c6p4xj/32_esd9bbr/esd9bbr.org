Thanks for this as always, Taure! I'm pretty sure I answered differently than I did last year, which is interesting to see how my own views have changed in a year. My demographic information changed too - I wonder if marriage, a full time job, etc, has any effect on what I read? (Modding this subreddit has certainly changed what and /how/ I read.)

Really appreciate all your hard work.
