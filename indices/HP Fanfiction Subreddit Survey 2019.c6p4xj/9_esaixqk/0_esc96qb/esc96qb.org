It's not too surprising that that was the most popular opinion. Dumbledore self-admittedly screwed Harry over, he could have probably left him with a wide range of people who could have kept him safe and granted him a happy childhood without really changing all that much about the overall plot of the series.

Now the Wizarding World would have been fucked if Dumbledore didn't try and stop Voldemort, imagine a fifth year where Dumbledore agrees with the ministry that Voldemort isn't back and Harry is full of shit, chances are it wouldn't be known that Voldemort is back until it was far too late.

Also I feel like the latter situation I described has amazing story potential, a world where Dumbledore assumes the prophecy was fulfilled when Harry was a Baby and that Voldemort is vanquished leaving Harry to fend for himself against Voldemort. Book 1 would probably need to go fairly differently, but the rest could stay mostly the same until the end of 4.
