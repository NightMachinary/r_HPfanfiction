We don't know if there was another way to keep Harry alive besides suicide by Avada Kedavra. The way he's portrayed, Dumbledore basically ensures that Harry's life is miserable enough to be willing to die, and it's only through astronomical coincidence that Harry survives. It's pretty clear that Dumbledore always intended for Harry to die in order to ultimately defeat Voldemort.
