Fascinating survey! Some of those questions at the end really hit home how much of the fandom (now) is American and influenced by American (actually outlier within the world at large, although probably quite commonplace within the US) attitudes e.g. twisting the world of Harry Potter that shows no signs of being so into a Puritan-esque traditionalist paradise, and the idea of the US as a much better setting than that awful UK!

Other notes based on previous years: the age of everyone is starting to seriously trend up year on year now eh! I think that's probably healthy tho. Less male dominated than some threads would suggest (!) suggesting perhaps there are just a large number of female readers who stay out of certain shall we say /heated/ discussions!

In terms of how the results are shaping up, will this be the year where Hermione overtakes Ginny as the favourite pairing for Harry?! Favourite character overall result seems a little different to previous years too although we have our usual front-runners - Harry really is pulling away this year tho eh?
