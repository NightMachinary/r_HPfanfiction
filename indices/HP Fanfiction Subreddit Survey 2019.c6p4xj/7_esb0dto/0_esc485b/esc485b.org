  Less male dominated than some threads would suggest (!)

One thing I've noticed site-wide is that men seem to be significantly more â€˜active' in general on most subreddits, making most places seem even more male-dominated than they are. I think it's probably a result of the past when Reddit was extremely male-dominated, so subreddit cultures formed based on those demographics and continue to persist even after things have balanced out a bit. This subreddit also has a sizeable presence of DLP writers who tend to be men.
