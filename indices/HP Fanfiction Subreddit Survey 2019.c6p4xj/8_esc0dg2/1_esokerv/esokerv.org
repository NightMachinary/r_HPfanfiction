I haven't read many fics with this as a main trope... but have seen it mentioned a LOT in fics that mention things like Technomancy being already achieved in Japan and America, and lots of things considered "dark" in the UK being grey at worst in America.

Mostly those stories are from before Fantastic Beasts, the new MACUSA is much more strict on things like Wand Control and Marrying or interacting with NoMag's at all. I don't like the new USA even considering how corrupt Britain's Ministry is.
