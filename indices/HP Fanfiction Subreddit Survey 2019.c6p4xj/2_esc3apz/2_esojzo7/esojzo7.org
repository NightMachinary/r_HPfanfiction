I only stopped reading Daily because I've run out of decent completed fics. I've moved on to things I wouldn't normally read because they are poorly written, include slash, or relationships I'd normally avoid... but those are much easier to put down.

My other fandoms are Naruto, and Buffy mainly...both of which I've run out of as well... moved into One Piece, Bleach and DC/Marvel stuff too... but even with Crossovers I'm running dry.

I'm much less likely to re-read a list of tropes in a fic from any fandom but HP or Naruto. There are several standout fics in other bubbles (mostly Anime...)

The only incomplete stuff I read on a regular basis is Dogbertcarrol's never ending Yet Again More series of one-shots and plot bunnies. He ranges ALL over the place but mostly Buffyverse.
