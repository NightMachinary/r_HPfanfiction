One of the difficult things for me was the “how often do you read HP fanfiction”. I kind of go through phases of fandoms. I've been on a Harry Potter phase for the past couple of weeks, where I read HP fanfics daily. Before that it was ASOIAF fanfics for a few months, and before that it was Star Wars. During these phases I'll pretty much be exclusively reading fics from that fandom daily, until I move on.
