Huh. I don't have uncompromising views on the matter, but there's no nuance to the question so I answered in the broadest stroke possible. The community organizing group I used to work for was very clear that you don't make top-down decisions for marginalized communities. You offer them resources and training, let them make the decisions, and support them as they take ownership of their next steps and direction. So I voted no because I can only imagine what a hash wizards would make of emancipation by fiat.
