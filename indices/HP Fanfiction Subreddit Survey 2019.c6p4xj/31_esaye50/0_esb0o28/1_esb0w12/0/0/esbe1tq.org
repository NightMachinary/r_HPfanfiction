How can Dobby be a free elf if being free is fatal? I find it very telling that the first elf we are exposed to by Rowling is a mistreated one that is ultimately freed. Additionally, the power dynamic between wizard and house elf is so lopsided that a house elf's opinion doesn't appear to matter much at all. Even if they think they are deciding for themselves, after living in slavery for so long they don't know of anything else.

I've heard it said that house elves were based on brownies from Scottish folklore, but in most accounts those creatures aren't slaves at all. They appear to work for an offering of some sort, and could leave if mistreated. If house elves used to be that way and somehow over time became slaves to wizards, they could work that way again after they gain freedom.
