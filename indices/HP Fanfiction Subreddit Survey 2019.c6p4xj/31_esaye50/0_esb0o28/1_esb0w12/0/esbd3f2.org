It's unclear what the house elf bond really means. It's implied in canon and often explicitly stated in fanfic that in most cases, freeing house elves is ultimately fatal to the elf in question, so universal emancipation would be tantamount to genocide.

I think the house elves' opinion on the matter is /very/ relevant.
