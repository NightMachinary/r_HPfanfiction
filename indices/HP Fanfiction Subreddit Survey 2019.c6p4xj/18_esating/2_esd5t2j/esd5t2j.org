Given how CR porn is a sub-category of smut stories in general, and how smut ideas can be turned into good stories, the same logic should also be applicable to the former category as well (even if for a very niche audience that is currently explicitly unwelcome on this website).

That devil's advocating aside, I'm sure most survey takers just didn't have such extremes in mind when responding to that particular question and from the context of the other questions deduced it to be about the general cliches and bad tropes of fanfiction.
