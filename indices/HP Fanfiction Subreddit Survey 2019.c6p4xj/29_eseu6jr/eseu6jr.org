How exactly did Dumbledore made the WW better though? The consensus is that he made it better, as of the writing of this comment. Except by beating Grindelwald, and even that is debatable, as a Grindelwald victory may have been much more beneficial to Wizardkind (RIP Muggles tho).

The Ministry of Magic is a disfunctional institution with a legislature run by ex-Death Eaters and riddled by nepotism and bribery. Hogwarts, the most strategically important point in the country, the sole education institution in Britain, is a chaotic mess which not only tolerates, but promotes Blood purism ideologies. The only media outlet in the country is a government run propaganda machine. I legit cant understand how anyone would look at Magical Britain and think /yeah, id love to live there/.
