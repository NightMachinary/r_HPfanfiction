Looking at the results I can see I was in the minority in a lot of the tropes, but honestly I have found that the longer I read fanfic, the more enjoyable tropes get. Soulbond? Marriage Contract? Sure you read the first one and its intriguing, but then the next one is the same...now I am on the hunt for the next marraige contract fit that makes me feel surprised, impressed, something that takes this trope and cliche and make it something else, something more. I guess this in itself is cheesy as are these tropes.
