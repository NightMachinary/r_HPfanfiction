I can't remember where I read it, but there is a justification for that.

Tropes are great the first one or two times you read them, because to you they are not tropes yet.

Then you see it EVERY-FREAKING-Where and it gets annoying, so you start avoiding it.

Then you either run out of things to read, or you want "comfort food". Tropes are easy to slip into, make you feel like you know what is happening in the story, and where it is going. Sometimes you just want simple reading, not something that makes you think.

As a fanfic author, I find that I can quote brand new TV episodes and movies as the characters are saying it. I recognize the trope, examine the characters and motivations, and write the lines as I'm watching. It is both fun and annoying, and surprise twists that are ACTUALLY surprises are amazing... and very far between.
