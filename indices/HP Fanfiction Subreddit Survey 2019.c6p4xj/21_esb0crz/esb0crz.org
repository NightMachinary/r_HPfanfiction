Great survey. Always interesting to see data, even if it confirms what we already know as is the case with the demographic data for this sub (active Reddit users who read HP fanfic).

I would suggest changing how you present the “choose 1 character questions” since the pie charts are hard to read. A ranked table or an ordered bar graph would both work well.

For the trope questions I would keep the bars but would also extract the mean and standard deviation for analysis purposes. From an interpretation point of view, it should also be important that people's responses may not be as much their view on a trope as they may be their view on an issue at large (especially if it parallels with today's world).
