  Bashing of all forms is disliked. But people disapprove as much of Ron-bashing as Hermione-bashing! Feels like a turnaround from the state of the fandom a few years ago.

Things seem to have changed over the last 8 or so hours. 20.3% are for bashing Ron compared to the 10.1% who approve of bashing Hermione. It seems there was just an influx of pro-Ron and/or anti-Hermione folks at the start of polling.
