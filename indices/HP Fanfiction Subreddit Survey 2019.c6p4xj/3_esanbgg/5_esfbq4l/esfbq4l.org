I was missing distinction between canon as “everything what's there is true” (which I would probably assign only to books), and “and there are some things I take without problems” (which would for me include films, Pottermore, old JKR site ... who doesn't know about [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120208051500/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=49][Mark Evans fiasco]]?). For example, I have no problem with accepting Minerva McGonagall as a daughter of the Presbyterian pastor (and yes, JKR shot herself to foot with making her twenty years younger in FB 2 movie).

Also with slash: I don't like and I immediately stop reading Harry being gay (or fem!Harry being a lesbian), but I don't care if for example Hermione decides that Luna is her dream girl.
