Great survey. A good length with some interesting questions. I think the wording of a few of the tropes revealed the author's biases (e.g. the definitions of 'small', 'medium' and 'large' wizarding populations) but overall, this could give us some really interesting data.

Some curious results so far:

- At least 40% of the people who gave a 'favourite slash pairing' don't actually read slash.

  - I wonder who they voted for. Ron's share of the vote seems way too high. So does Other, although there were a bunch of pairings missed.
  - For comparison, in most surveys of slash communities, Drarry is /the/ slash pairing, distantly followed by SS/HP and LV/HP.
  - That's SS for Severus Snape by the way, not Salazar Slytherin. His inclusion cracked me up.

- Only 12% refuse to read non-Harry-centric fics. As someone who /prefers/ these fics, that's heartening to see.

- The canonicity of the FB movies is falling off a cliff. I was also a little surprised that Pottermore ranked as highly as the side books (since the latter having been around for longer).

- The subreddit likes "pureblood culture", is mixed on "pureblood nobility" but really doesn't like Harry to inherit political power. Interesting, given the ubiquity of fics where all three are true.

- Evil!Harry was by /far/ the most polarising trope.

- Bashing of all forms is disliked. But people disapprove as much of Ron-bashing as Hermione-bashing! Feels like a turnaround from the state of the fandom a few years ago.
