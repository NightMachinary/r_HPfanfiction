There used to be a huge community on livejournal of this ship in the mid 2000s. Post-DH book and the movies, it's sort of died. Rupert Grint growing up to be the least attractive member of the main cast definitely didn't help. Adult Ron in these fics was a tall, hot hunk of ginger, often a quidditch player or something. He often had divination powers for some reason. Then the last book came out and the movies followed, and what we got was not that Ron.
