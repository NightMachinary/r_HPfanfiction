I generally prefer having the questions optional to N/A options. The problem with an "N/A" option is that it messes up the results of the people who do have opinions on the topic. If you have no opinion on a question, best to skip it unless it is compulsory. I think on all the compulsory ones, there is an "Other" option, or some kind of neutral position, such as the "3" on the Trope Alert questions.

For example, with specific reference to the slash pairing question, this is just a question for people who actually have a favourite slash pairing. If you do not read slash, then this information will have already been captured by the "Do you read stories with a gay male protagonist?" question.
