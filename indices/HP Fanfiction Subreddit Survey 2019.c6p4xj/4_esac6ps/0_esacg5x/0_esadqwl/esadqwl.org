The "favorite het pairing" and "favorite slash pairing" questions were marked as optional with the possibility of choosing "Other.

My experience: Since there wasn't an "N/A" choice I picked "Other" for favorite het pairing before noticing that the question was optional. After picking an answer there was no way to un-answer the question, so I had to stick with "Other."

I mention this because the "optional" tag isn't very prominent. Other respondents might make a similar mistake with the "optional" questions and thus "other" may end up skewing your data the same way an "N/A" choice would have.
