Honestly, I don't really buy this argument. The question is less accurate for the sake of not adding one option that people in countries to which it doesn't apply can just ignore. Especially when the majority--or at very least a plurality, depending on the breakdown of the people who responded that they live in North America--live in a country in which it does apply. According to Wikipedia the UK and a few other countries have equivalents too.
