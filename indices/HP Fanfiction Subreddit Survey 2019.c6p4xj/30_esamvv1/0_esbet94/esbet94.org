As last year - in an international survey, I'm loath to make things too US-specific. In a similar way, I didn't break up "school leaving qualifications" into "School leaving qualifications - 16" and "School leaving qualifications - 18" because as far as I'm aware, very few countries other than the UK do things that way.
