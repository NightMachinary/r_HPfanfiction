My opinion: An unabashedly evil character can be likeable, a favorite villain. Whereas someone who did a lot of bad things but is supposed to be good gets a lot more hate.

Snape helped win the war, he was a double/triple agent, and protected Harry several times without him knowing it. But he was also (apparently) an incel obsessed with Lily who seems to only regret that she died and didn't end up with him after he accidentally got her husband killed. He treated everyone not in Slytherin like complete crap, especially the main Trio. Not to mention the things he likely had to do AS a Death Eater that he was never punished for (other than his own personal internal torture).

To have a man like that be lauded as a hero turns a lot of peoples stomachs. Even if it is correct, it doesn't mean you can't hate him.

I chose Snape over Umbridge... partly because I didn't see Umbridge, but that was because I saw Snape and made a snap decision and moved on. Delores was just as awful, but she only really directly affected the main trio for one book.

The two are a toss-up to me... I'd much rather read a redeemed Snape story than a redeemed Umbridge story...so I probably voted wrong.
