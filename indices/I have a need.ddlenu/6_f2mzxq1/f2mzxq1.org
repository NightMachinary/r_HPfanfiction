  Also if anyone knows of any gamer!fics - as in character wakes up to find reality has become like a video game - in any fandom I will love you forever if you share them with me :D

The only Harry!Gamer fic I still remember ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/][the michelsuave one]]) got posted already, but here's a few Worm ones.

- *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-dovahkiin-without-dragon-souls-to-spend-worm-skyrim-gamer-complete.513694/][A Dovahkiin without Dragon Souls to Spend]]*, in which Taylor Hebert works off Skyrim mechanics in the grimdark world of Worm. 140k words, complete, has two sequels.
- *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-maid-of-brockton-bay-worm-maid-gamer-taylor.766552/][The Maid of Brockton Bay]]*, in which Taylor Hebert wakes up to a floating popup, becoming... a Guardian Maid! 24k words, last updated at the end of July.
- *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs.496126/reader][The Paragamer]]*, a quest featuring an OC with Gamer powers getting caught up in the aftermath of a Leviathan attack. 250k words, apparently still updated regularly.

The Maid of Brockton Bay is hilarious, and A Dovahkiin Without Dragon Souls To Spend is also pretty enjoyable.
