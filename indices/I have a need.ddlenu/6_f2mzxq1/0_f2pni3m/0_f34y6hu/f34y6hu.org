Just as a heads up here, "The Paragamer" is dead and is your typical "grind to nowhere" fic where no actual story happens. And "A Dovahkiin" is teeth-grindingly bad writing. If you're okay with grammar and spelling mistakes and diction that sounds like an over-enthusiastic 13 year old, then "Dovahkiin" is fine. But if you're looking for anything like good writing, give it a pass.

"Maid" is good so far and I recommend it, but it's a WIP and if it's anything like 99% of /Worm/ fics it'll die before completion.
