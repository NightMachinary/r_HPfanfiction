[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] might be up your alley. It has a continuation, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3078469/1/Changes-in-a-Time-of-War][Changes in a Time of War]]. Word of warning, they're LONG, and they might get a bit over the top sometimes with the blood magic and the vampires and demons. It has everything: blood magic, multiple animagus forms, dragon blood, time travel, you name it. I personally started reading them quite some time ago, but I haven't finished the second part yet. I only plan to do so out of commitment. But who knows, it might be what you're looking for.
