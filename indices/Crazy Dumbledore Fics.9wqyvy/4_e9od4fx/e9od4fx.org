Itachi, is that a baby. (God i feel like im speaking about this fic a lot lately) Dumbledores crazy is quite flavourful (and hilarious) in this fic.

Some choice quotes.

"In addition to the forbidden objects, the Forbidden Forest is, shockingly enough, forbidden. This, too, is not a negotiable point. Any student stupid enough to go into the Forest will not be punished, we simply won't go look for you. Considering the nature of the dwellers in the Forest, I will remind the students that they should avoid it unless they are facing their Potions final."

"I reiterate that the rooms on the east side of the third floor are forbidden and that any student who dies as a result of ignoring this warning will be buried in the usual mass grave in back of the castle reserved for those who have thankfully removed themselves from our society before their idiocy can do too much damage."

"One last announcement: those of you planning to . . . celebrate the end of exams, please make sure you are protected. If someone goes home pregnant, being expelled will be the least of the worries of the unhappy parents involved." He pointed to the bits of bird that lay on people's plates. "Good night."

"The food vanished and Dumbledore stood up to speak. "As usual, I have many things to say regarding the start of the year. The first will be to warmly welcome Gilderoy Lockhart to the teaching staff. Sit down, Gilderoy, I did not invite your comments." Lockhart had been halfway to his feet when Dumbledore cut him off. "I will tell you when you are welcome to speak. Here's a hint: not while I'm Headmaster."
