I second linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin).

Harry begins learning Occlumency in Year 1. 2 years later and he's barely competent. I don't know of many other fics that have this super slow growth.

The fic does a lot to try and make the wizarding world a lot more internally consistent. One major way is to actually make certain talents rare and hard, which you may like.
