Once you find out how she is able to do what she does it stops being a wank fest. This Hermione is quite different from Canon, her only friend has been Neville and with the schools push for rankings it just made her that much more competitive. Some of her bad qualities from Canon are magnified here as a result of the changes but I think it makes sense.

I was hooked on the story from the beginning but I would encourage you to read a few chapters to get a better feel of the story.
