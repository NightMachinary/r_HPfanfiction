Just power through the first chapter, after that one I was hooked. It's an Ender's Game crossover (basically it's just HP with EG undertones so you don't need to know anything about EG to understand the story) and I'm a big EG fan so it was easy for me to get into.

There are a few very violent scenes toward the end of third year. Be aware of a potential trigger related to suicide.
