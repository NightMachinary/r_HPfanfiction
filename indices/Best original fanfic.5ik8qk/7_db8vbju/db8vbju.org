I think what you really mean is you are done with CANON Harry at Hogwarts story. Well, most HP fanfics are AU (alternate universe) anyway. Here are some of my favorites:

/Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw/, linkffn(11574569), is quite interesting and very well written. It's also set in a very different world.

/Divided and Entwined/, linkffn(11910994), is AU after Year 4, and depicts an all out civil war in magical Britain. Hermione is the main character here.

/The Stars Alone/, linkffn(12040341), is a SG-1 crossover and sequel to /Broken Chains/, linkffn(7718942), which is a Star Wars crossover. In this story, Harry, Hermione, and Luna were building a new civilization from the scratch and taking on the Goa'ulds.

/Petrification Proliferation/, linkffn(11265467), is a humorous take on what would have been if the adults had behaved more competent after the CoS incident.

/The Sum of Their Parts/, linkffn(11858167), is a post DH dark!Trio fic. Harry and Co was again betrayed by the establishment after Voldemort's fall. They had it enough and decided to fight back again, with ANY MEANS necessary.

/Seventh Horcrux/, linkffn(10677106), is an excellent humor fic and my top favorite.
