Speaking of Inverarity (the guy who wrote Hogwarts, Houses Divided) I think the Alexandra Quick series needs a shoutout here. The series is completely independent of the original Harry Potter series, although it occurs in the same universe at some point after the conclusion of HP&TDH.

The Alexandra Quick series takes place in America and follows the eponymous protagonist as she discovers her magic and enters the magical society of America.

One of my favorite things about this series is the way that it makes American society feel different from the British society we are familiar with from Harry Potter, while also maintaining enough similarities that it still feels like the Harry Potter universe.

My other favorite thing is how well written the series is, to the point where it feels more like an original story (which it basically is) than like fanfiction.

With four 'books' done, clocking in at about 200k words each, this has to be by far my favorite series in the Harry Potter fandom, with an interesting (if flawed) hero, excellent worldbuilding, and an awesome overarching plot which (in my opinion) blows the overarching Voldemort plot from the original series out of the water.

Anyway, without further ado, here is the link to the first book, linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)
