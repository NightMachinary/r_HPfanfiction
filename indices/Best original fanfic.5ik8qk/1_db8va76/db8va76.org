First of all, I agree with Hogwarts Houses Divided. One of my favorite fics.

*One-shots (short fics)*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6167455/1/Things-Unsaid][Things Unsaid]] - what if each character that died in the series got one last line? It's short and really very touching. I cry every time I get to Lupin's or Cedric's.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] both center on Colin Creevy, and are generally touching (but sad) fics.

*Longer Fics*

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/821297/chapters/1556418][Saying Yes]] is about Andromeda Tonks (Tonks' mom) and Kingsley slowly getting together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4882577/1/A-Bit-Unhealthy][A Bit Unhealthy]] is about George and Angeline coping with Fred's death.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] is about Malfoy being sentenced to live for a few years without Magic as punishment for his crimes. It's actually one of the best stories I've seen with Draco being "redeemed" and learning how wrong his prejudices were. The only downside is that it's still in progress (but almost done if the last chapter was any indication).

*A full fledged series*

[[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/muggle_index.html][The James Potter Series]] follows Harry's son James throughout Hogwarts. I was a big fan of the first few books, but I never finished the series because I wasn't happy with some of the later ones (starting with the book where they all go to the US for a year).
