Hogwarts Houses Divides is straight up amazing as others have said. If you want one that picks up where Cursed Child ends and has phenomenal characterizations of the grown-up trio with a focus on their kids (namely Albus), I cannot recommend linkffn(put your guns away, it's tea time) nearly enough! The sequel is ongoing and equally great, with more action and mystery than the first one and the same amount of heart. :)

Editing to add that you don't have to have read Cursed Child to understand or enjoy this story! I haven't read or seen it, just heard summaries from people on here.
