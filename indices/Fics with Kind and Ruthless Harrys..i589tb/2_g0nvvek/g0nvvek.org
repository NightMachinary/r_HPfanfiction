Actually, the character that springs to mind isn't Harry; it's the Paragon protagonist from With This Ring. In his first year he mostly tries to avoid lethal force, since he's on the Young Justice team and their rules of engagement emphasise non-lethal takedowns. And he really does try hard to find diplomatic and reasonable solutions to things. But when push comes to shove, he can genocide an entire Evil Empire and not lose sleep over it.

The Renegade protagonist, who doesn't feature much until later in the story, is a great deal more ruthless. Still a good person, still generous to his friends, devoted family man, and committed to the greater good, but if, say, you invade his home and threaten him, you probably won't be bound in orange construct chains, knocked out, and handed over to the police; you'll get a giant sword through your chest.
