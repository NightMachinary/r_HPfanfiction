I honestly can picture FemHarry with a much more wider variety of hair and eye colors, the Harry.

I can see her w/ blonde, black, and red hair, and green or hazel eyes. But for Harry, he's always going to be green eyes and black hair.

Both FemHarry and Harry also have pale skin, but depending on the direction the fic takes, I can also see them becoming tan.

For their facial features, I can see Harry and FemHarry with high cheek bones, thin eye brows, and long slim nose. Also their face would be angular and sharp.
