I prefer femHarry to have the same colouring and overall look of Harry just because I don't understand why she wouldn't. I mean, gender has nothing (that I know of) to do with hair color or texture and eye shape/color. Red hair is a recessive trait so it is less likely than black hair, and Harry can't get the blond gene from Lily because as a red head she has two copies of the red hair gene. Again, I didn't get past basic biology in uni, but what we're talking about here is basic genetic inheritance. Hazel eyes are basically green eyes with brown areas, but green eyes are so harped on in canon that people cling to them.

Harry's kids have red hair because he has red hair genes to pass down and his wife is a red-head.

Harry's canon personality is not a carbon of his parents (they were both way more social than him for one thing) but canon characters draw parallels because they want to see his parents in him. I think that realistically a similar thing would happen to femHarry - people who knew the Potters would expect to see similarities and so actively look for them i.e. 'You like Quidditch? So did your dad! You're just like him!' as if 3/4 of the wizarding population wasn't obsessed with flying on a stick.
