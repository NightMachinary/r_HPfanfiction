One way to determine what Fem!Harry's physical appearance would be is to determine which traits are carried by dominant and recessive genes, presuming that magic doesn't do funky stuff to people on a genetic level. But I suspect that most people have neither the time nor the patience to sit down with a University level textbook on genetics to determine what a fictional character is supposed to look like, so they take shortcuts. The simplest being to invert which parent a specific trait came from, regardless of what biology might have to say on the matter.
