Must be observation bias, then.

When I used to read a lot of Indy!Harry fics, Harry slaughtered goblins with his dual-wielded zweihanders, mowed Death Eaters down with machine guns, and threw Unforgivables around like it was Halloween every day of the week, with zero guilt or introspection. If there was any angst in the fics I read, it was shallow, short-lived, and directed at other people who had wronged Harry, instead of the internalized survivor's guilt PTSD of canon Harry.
