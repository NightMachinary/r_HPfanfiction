In most fanfictions I've read, Harry, whether it's a girl or a boy, is nothing like canon James, Lily, or even canon Harry. Fanfiction Harry is way smarter than any canon child at age 11, he never fumbles his romances like the canon teens at age 15, and he never angsts over anything and actively seeks revenge instead of internally brooding.

On appearances, I've seen more combos of Lily's hair + James' eyes or James' hair + Lily's eyes than a straight up copy of one parent's traits. I have also noticed that Fem!Harry gets way more purple prose description than Boy!Harry, with repeated mentions of her sparkling viridian eyes and fiery vermilion hair.

However, there are rare times where Harry's appearances doesn't match either of his/her canon parents'. I've seen blonde Harry, whose hair color matches Petunia and Dudley (both blonde in the books), and brown Harry. For some reason, [[http://harry-potter-headcanon.tumblr.com/post/126179755754/can-you-explain-why-many-people-think-harry-potter][it's become popular in the Tumblr-creative community]] to make James Potter Indian, because the Dursleys are xenophobic white English folks and hate James' people, so obviously James must be brown. This makes Harry half-Indian and brown-skinned. I don't know where it originated first, but if you google "Desi Harry Potter" you will see many supporters and fanarts of this. I guess it became popular with Black Hermione being a thing after Cursed Child, but then again I don't go on Tumblr much.
