I think people reuse Harry's canon traits because their symbolism fits well with personality and plot.

Green works well for eye color because it's the color of the killing curse, symbolizing the fated connection of death between Voldemort and the child of prophecy. Also, green is just a less common eye color compared to brown, so the prophecy child gets to be a special snowflake.

As for the hair, messy hair fits with Harry's personality of being 'normal' and not fitting in with the upper crust of pretentious purebloods. It's also a connection to his/her heritage as a Potter and gives the pretentious Dursleys another reason to look down on kid Harry.

I do think that red hair would work just as well as black for a fem!Harry.
