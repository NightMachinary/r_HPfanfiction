Ooooh, it's finally finished? Maybe it's time to read it through.

I, like you, stopped around a month ago. There are plenty of things wrong with it, in my opinion, but nothing that cannot be ignored:

1. Visiting many canon stations for no reason.
2. Continuity errors, for example with Hagrid and forest detention, and with Skeeter interview at the wand weighing.
3. Lots of typos.
