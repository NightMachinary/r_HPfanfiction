Yeah. That Harry could easily end up like Henry Morgan from Forever TV series who experimented with all kinds of way of dying. In a lot of scenes, I ask the question of why the hell he is not just commiting suicide. Something went wrong? Just commit suicide.

But in the end, it's a relatively good fic. Ending is also nice.
