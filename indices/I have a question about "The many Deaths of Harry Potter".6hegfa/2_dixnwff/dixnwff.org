--*Warning*: probably spoiler and I haven't finished this fic so not a complete perspective.--

Yeah, at some point I just figured that it wasn't worth subjecting myself to the sheer depressiveness of the situations and attitudes that were apparently everything that was left. In the beginning I felt like it could be an interesting fic where the main mechanic would lead to a kind of tainted and emotionally turbulent but nevertheless hopeful attitude. But it was just a drag where everything went to shit at the point where I dropped it.

If Harry, the main perspective through which I'm experiencing the world, is emotionally dead and has no apparent emotional investment in the world anymore, then how can I?
