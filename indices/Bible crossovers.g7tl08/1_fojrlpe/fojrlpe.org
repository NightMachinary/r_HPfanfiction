I've read one where Harry received a lot of "social distance" during OotP, I think, because he accidentally invoked The Guy In The Sky. (OMG; God,damnit!; or something similar) Nothing happened, really, but suddenly he was all alone.

Why? Because deities are real, powerful and unpredictable, and wizards do not want anything to do with that mess. So, they all try to stay out of blast radius. The fic later dissolved, for the lack of better word, but the beginning was alright, and quite a novel idea too.
