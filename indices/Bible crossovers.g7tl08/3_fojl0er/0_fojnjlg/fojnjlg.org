I mean, I feel like you're missing the fairly obvious here: Jesus as a Lockhart-esque wizard whose use of magic to grow his fanbase ended in wizards collaborating with muggles to take him down, inadvertently making him a martyr and spawning a cult that lasted thousands of years.

And that's beside that very pertinent fact: he's said to have lived /two thousand years ago/. He'd /predate/ Hogwarts by /centuries/. Judging his abilities by the abilities of modern day wizards is rather like saying "Newton could do calculus? Pffft, I learnt that in secondary school."
