A Hogwarts student could perform all but two of Jesus's miracles by the time he graduated. Voldemort could do all of them (inferni for Lazarus and Horcruxes for returning from the dead). Jesus would probably not even be a footnote in history if he was a regular wizard.

I feel like the ancient religions have more crossover potential (think Percy Jackson) since there are more fantastic creatures involved there, and you have all kinds of demi gods.
