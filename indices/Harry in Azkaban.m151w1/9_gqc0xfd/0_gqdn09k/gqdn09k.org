On one hand, its a prompt to give you a creative push to write something, not something to be followed rigidly. You should pick and choose what elements inspire you and abandon the rest. On the other, I have read hundreds of "hurr durr the ministry is stupid and evil and sent innocent harry to azkaban hurr durr" fics and they're all universally terrible. You'll get more readers being more original, like Harry actually deserving to be sent to Azkaban.
