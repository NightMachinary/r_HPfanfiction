It isn't a question of quality for me, but of how unique a fic is. There are a lot of fics I remember enjoying and I see getting a lot of praise on here that I could never continue reading because despite all the praise, it was just one of the hundred fics following Harry during his Hogwarts year I read. I can't easily differentiate between them so I don't bother continuing.

But I still vividly remember an SI fic where the main charachter was a seer that I read a few years ago, or that fic where AU Potters end up in the canon world after the war, or that fic where Field Operative Unspeakable Harry accidentally went back in time. I ca easily jump back in a uncompleted unique fic, even if it isn't that good.
