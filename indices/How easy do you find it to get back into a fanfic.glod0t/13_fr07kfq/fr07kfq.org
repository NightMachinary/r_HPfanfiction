If I find it hard continuing a fic I would usully leave it and start or cobtinue with other fics in my list. Then later when I am in a mood for a different fic than the one I aam currently reading I might go back to one of my old ones. Of course usually I just start reading a new one and so now I have hundreds of fics that I have either barely started, half way through or a few chapters from finishing and I just did not have the will to finish completely (either too emotionally draining, or it was a fic that I only read because of the interesting idea).
