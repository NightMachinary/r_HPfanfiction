If it's a completed work, I'm more likely to read it for longer, and most of the time I can read it till the very end. Whether it's a book or fanfiction, if its bad I'll still finish it because I hate not knowing the ending of a story.

It takes a lot to get my to put something I'm reading down, it would have to be something morally reprehensible or a /truly/ never ending story. There was this one fic that was like 400,000 words, and I read half of it and I /despised/ the story from about 10,000 words. It lacked any plot, and was basically 400,000 words of the pairing going on dates in Hogsmeade. At one point there was a magic carpet ride and I had to stop and question whether I was reading an Aladdin crossover.

If it's an ongoing fic and hasn't grabbed my attention by the last update, I'm unlikely to return.
