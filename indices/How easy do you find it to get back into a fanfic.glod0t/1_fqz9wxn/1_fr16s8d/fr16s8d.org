5000 words? You're way more generous than I am.

I drop probably 70% of the stories I read in the first 500 words. I have a strict "three strikes" policy on spelling, grammar, and diction mistakes, as well as anything that sounds fanfic-y.

EDIT: Harry Crow is /objectively bad/. People are allowed to like bad shit, I guess, but it's still hot fucking garbage and if someone says it's a great story you know you can basically ignore their opinion on anything.
