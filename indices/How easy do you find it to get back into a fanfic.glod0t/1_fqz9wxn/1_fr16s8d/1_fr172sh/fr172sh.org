I try to forgive anything that I would miss or don't effect the story. (There, their). However i do hate it if my reading a sentence and "Harry walked down the bleach toes in the sand." If you make me stop and try to figure out what you mean I get annoyed. Everybody gets one per chapter. If it's just straight up terrible, you're out.
