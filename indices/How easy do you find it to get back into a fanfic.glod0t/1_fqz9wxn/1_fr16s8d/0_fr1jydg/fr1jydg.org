  Harry Crow is /objectively bad/
#+end_quote

If I can ask, what make you decide that a fic is good or bad?

Because, while it's been years since I tried to read "Harry Crow", from what I remember, the writing was pretty good.\\
I mean, I hated the plot, which was full of tropes I hate (from "Perfect Hermione" to "Manipulative Dumbledore" with some "Harry can decide the fate of a country at 11"), and I found the whole "Kids talk like Victorian adults" very cringy.

But while I found the substance of the fic terrible, the firm seemed of pretty good quality. Granted, English is not my first language so I may have missed mistakes, but I don't remember any major error with the Grammar, the Spelling or the Diction. In fact, outside of maybe some Purple Prose (and I'm not even sure about that), the writing, or the form seemed done skillfully. The author did a good job when pulling the reader into his world (or rather his vision of Rowling's world), I just happened to hate it.

So, while I would never recommand Harry Crow to anyone (or any RobSt story since they all seemed to have the same tropes/ cliches of "Perfect Harmony"), I'm not sure I would call them "Objectively Bad". All the parts we can /objectively/ judge, and even if I hate the plot, my tastes are subjectives and the fact that some people love this fic show that it has its public, so is it really bad?
