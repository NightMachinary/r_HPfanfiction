Sometimes I prefer unfinished fics if they finish on a high, rather than taking the risk that the story will peter out. I used to have far better memory for the storylines when waiting for updates, though - pretty much the same as you.

The issue I was posting about was more... I'm halfway through an interesting chapter, but now I have to make dinner, entertain the other half since we're staying inside for a long while yet. Etc, etc. When I come back to the fic, my brain just goes 'eh'.

I also can't get behind Harry Crow. There's definitely something out there for everyone.

I'll take onboard your advice for those fics that do keep me going, though. Especially compared to ones I get bored of while reading with no gap.
