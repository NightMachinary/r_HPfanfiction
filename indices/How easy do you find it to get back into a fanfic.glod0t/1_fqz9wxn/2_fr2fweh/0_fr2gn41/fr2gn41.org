Hm... Maybe an e-reader would work if you are reading on your phone. I find when I'm on my phone my partner Will come up to me and ask me if I'm reading what I'm reading what I'm doing. However if I'm in on an e-reader it's like I'm holding a book and he already knows and so he doesn't bother me. He respects that I'm reading and not 'just' on my phone. (not that you don't deserve alone time to just browse reddit if you want.)
