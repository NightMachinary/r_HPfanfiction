I reeeaally need to give Rationality another shot! I always make it quite a bit through - I remember loving that bit in Quirrell's classroom when he made it outer space for example - but never getting pulled in deep enough! (Or having enough hours at one time)

Ooooh, I wanted to give Rebuilding a go, but a couple reviews mentioned Draco being v OOC which made me hesitant.

Is that the Veela story where Hermione is a different kind of Veela that doesn't come with the normal amazing looks/allure? I vaguely remember something like that... She was this second type of Veela that couldn't live without her mate from memory!

Have you read Paradox by Olivieblake? I think that's my favourite Dramione that's not, like, Isolation/Bex-Chan-popular

I'm going to look up that Brilliant Magic story! I don't mind some smut, haha. I dunno if you've ever been a fan of teenage Tom Riddle stuff, but there's a hella underrated story by Cybrid called A Dangerous Game. Just a believable characterisation for me (perhaps not for some others I'm sure) and fun to read ðŸ˜‚
