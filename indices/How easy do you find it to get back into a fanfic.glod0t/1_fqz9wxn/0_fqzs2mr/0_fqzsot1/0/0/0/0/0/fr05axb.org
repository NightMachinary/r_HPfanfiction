Very true. I'm glad he isn't too OOC then! I definitely understand a Draco who's matured believably, it's just those fics where it's like a completely different person with Draco's name (and not far enough in the future for enough time to rationalise a huge shift). I might give this story a go though!

No you didn't ðŸ˜† but I also forget the name!

Yessssssss, let me know how you find Paradox! So good.

A Dangerous Game was definitely like a gateway story for me, hahaha. I was generally only mainly into reading Draco/Hermione or Harry/Hermione stuff, but I just loved the somewhat dark vibe/humour/general writing of this that I ended up liking Tom Riddle, haha. REALLY hard to find another Tom written like this though, sadly. Again, I hate when he's too soft (or too morbid) ðŸ˜‚
