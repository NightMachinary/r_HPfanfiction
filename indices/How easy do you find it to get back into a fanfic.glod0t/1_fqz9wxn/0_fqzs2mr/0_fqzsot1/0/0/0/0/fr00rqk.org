So I dont think Draco is too OOC honestly. It's hard because you have sect of people who are deeply loyal to the books but there are some big problems when writing for HP. The first is that 1. The OG books take place with children to teenagers. I am NOT the same person I was at 17. Let alone 15. 2. Wars changes people. Drastically. Noone is coming out of that the same. Which is what the story is focused on. A BIT to heavy handed in the end but eh.

Yes. It. Freaking. Is!!!!! I did not dream it up!

Oooo hoooo hoo. New thing to read once I finish up Running on air tonight.

I don't really mess with old voldy but I'm willing to give it a try sjnce a real person is recommending it.
