Hmmmm so my basic bitch favorite is def theories of rationality. It's just so good. Actual favorite right now may be rebuilding-colubrina. It's a bit on the nose for me but I recognize it had excellent character development. Even if the plot was a bit predicable.

Dark horse.... Hmmm.... I really really liked that one fic. I'm going to have to make a post about it. There's a really great one where Hermione is infected with Veela genetics somehow and ends up bonded to Draco. If she doesn't spend time around him she gets sick. I read it years ago but I'll get back to you if I find it.

Second dark horse I could actually find.

Brilliant magic- LJ summers - a fantastic Wesley twinsx Hermione fix that actually feels well written and human. It's super smutth but so good in between it feels natural.
