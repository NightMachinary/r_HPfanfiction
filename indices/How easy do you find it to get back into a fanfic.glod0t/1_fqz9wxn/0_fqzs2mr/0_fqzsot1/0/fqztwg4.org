Aw, yay!! My favourite is actually probably a tie between Prince of the Dark Kingdom and To the Waters and the Wild. Both abandoned, mind you. As for a Dark Horse - probably a couple looking through my favourites. What ships do you like, if any? And what settings? I feel like Blood Crest by Cauchy is pretty underrated (no ships) but it still has 1k reviews, so maybe not as underrated as I thought ðŸ˜†

And what would your favourites and Dark Horse be?
