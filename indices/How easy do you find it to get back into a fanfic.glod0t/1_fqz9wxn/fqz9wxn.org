I say this as a writer. I understand I'm the worst person

I only read completed works. And I only read if it's interesting within the first... 5000 words?

For me personally I don't lose it through a story. I absolutely hate it when I'm reading things chapter by chapter. I forget why I care that Harry can't fly on a broom anymore. And then when something weird happens I just assume it's poor writing because I forget it was skillfully forshadowed 4 chapters ago because it was a freaking month ago!

So if the issue is it just gets bad. Fine. It's bad. It's okay for you not to like it. Harry Crow ff:8186017 is the 4th highest favorited fic of all time in the Harry Potter universe. I hate it. It's cringey and contrived and predicitible. My friend finds it satisfying. Edgey. Wish fulfilling. It just depends.

I say identify things you will always want. No matter how niche, then learn what sucks you in about those stories and move outwards from there.
