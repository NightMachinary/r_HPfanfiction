It's pretty much depends on the quality of the fic and the amount of time it's been between update Due to the lockdown a lot of old fics that I followed are being updated but I find that they really aren't as good as I remember them or are just plain cringe worthy. Some of them are pretty easy to get back into and I end up reading the whole thing just to refresh my memory
