You think it's bad when it's just that something dried up? Imagine when you loved the story, but something in it came out of left field and freaked you out, and then you learned that the problem was only temporary and wanted to go back to it, but dreaded rereading that one part!

I freaked when I was reading HPMOR and reached spring break (if you've read it, you should be able to guess why, if you haven't, I won't spoil more than absolutely necessary) and then spent a few years randomly shuddering and agonizing until finally the last chapter was released; I then peeked to confirm that the particular plot point ultimately got reversed... and I haven't managed to get even to Azkaban in a reread since then (I've tried at least 3 times). Urgh I need to figure out how to force myself to reread it...

I'm also facing similar with the reread I started a while ago of the Young Wizards series by Diane Duane (an actual book series, not a fanfic). All I'll say is that she's a glorious bastard who Kali-ma's your heart out, plops it in a blender set to frappe, and leaves you begging for more, but then when you go to reread, the anticipation of what you know is going to happen is viscerally painful. Somehow I've reached the 4th book, where everything slows drastically (seriously that entire book comes outta left field, nothing like the first 3, and seems more like a buffer for 5 or intro of chars to be used later than anything else; still fun, but damn it she's just stretching out my dread of later books).
