It a fic loses my attention, and I /know/ that it's not merely due to general tiredness, then I'll abandon the fic in search of another.

Sometimes I'll stick with a fic based on overwhelming praise, but some fics (like Seventh Horcrux - the crack one) just don't do anything for me regardless of the heaps of praise it gets.
