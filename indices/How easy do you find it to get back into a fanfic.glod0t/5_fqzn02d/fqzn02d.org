I've discovered that it takes around 3 chapters to fully immerse me, whether I'm binging or not, but if I read 23 chapters straight, even on fics I enjoy immensely, I'll end up finding it hard to pick up again.

What I do at that point is go back a couple chapters and skim for scenes I don't fully recall, and work forward until I'm once more on the Binger Express.
