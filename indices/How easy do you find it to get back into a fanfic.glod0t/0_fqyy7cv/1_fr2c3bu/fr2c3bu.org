How long I last with a fic depends on my mood and the quality of writing. Some fics I can tell I won't like from the first few paragraphs - especially if it's clash of formatting style. I usually skip ahead a bit to see if it keeps happening.

If I'm bored enough I push through and poor plot or style that doesn't suit me, I also tend to stick with for 5-10 chapters.

Sometimes I take on the task of being more open minded, but I do have some firm favourites that I seem to get into on a cycle that I've just about exhausted. I think when I'm stressed I'm less open to new fic - it's why I'm no longer read fiction books. Bad taste, my wife says!
