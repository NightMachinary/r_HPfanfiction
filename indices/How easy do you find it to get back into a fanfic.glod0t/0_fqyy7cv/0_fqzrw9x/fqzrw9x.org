I was so like you once, haha. Then I decided to give a highly reviewed story another go after trying and failing, despite haaaating the the first chapter or two it took to properly world build (Prince of the Dark Kingdom specifically haha) and now it's my favourite all time fic 🤷‍♀️ I still prefer instant gratification tho 😂
