I can't follow things week-to-week because my memory is so bad and I go through stories so fast. Honestly, I read something last week, left a highly positive review which I hardly ever do so I must have loved it, and then I look at the new chapter today and I have no idea what was happening.

My general process is to wait a few years, check back and reread the whole thing up to the newest chapter, and repeat. But I'm also relatively new to the fandom, been reading/writing for less than five years, so I've a lot of awesome still untouched. I imagine it'll be very different for anyone who's been around the block a few times.
