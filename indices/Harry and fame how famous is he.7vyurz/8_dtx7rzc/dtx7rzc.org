I'm a bit suspicious how people instantly recognized him. Who the heck spread detailed and accurate information on what he looked like? That whole scene in the Leaky Cauldron in the first book was very strange.

  Harry becoming the head of the aurors how politically astute is he?

I can't understand why he would work for (and presumably take orders from) a Ministry that consistently treated him so badly.

If he was politically astute he'd be able to spot the difference between corrupted nepotism and democracy. And with his new fame, why didn't he try to get into a position of power in order to fix all the things that are so obviously wrong in the Wizarding world?

Harry is just like a modern-day celebrity. All fame and no brains. A magical Kardashian.
