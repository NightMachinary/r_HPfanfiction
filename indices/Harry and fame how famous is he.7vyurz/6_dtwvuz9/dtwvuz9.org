I would say Harry is rather famous in the West, he's extremely famous in The UK and other neighbors. Like everyone knows what he looks like at the Tri wizard people point and whisper like at home. Let's say Harry goes to the US, 1 in 5 wizards would know off the top of their head who he is from visuals, 1 in 3 would know from his name only and everyone would know of someone said Boy Who Lived.

In the East I see it as mildly known by those who take in foreign media and even then their would be some doubt as to if what is said to have happen actually happened
