I think that outside of Brittain the story of "The-Boy-Who-Lived" would be well known, but the level and type of fame would depend on international relations/stereotypes I would think (bear with me). If the magical communities of the US/Japan view Brittain as backwater and/or racist hicks, then I don't think they would believe it. Know the story, yes. Believe it, not so much. However if US/Japan vuew British wizards with respect (like how our real world governments and people do) then they might believe that Harry took a killing curse to the face and lived.

Your question about him becoming head of the aurors doesn't make sense. If you are asking if he got the gig because of his teaching skills, I would disagree. If you are saying that a good teacher would be good at politicing, I would again disagree. If your are asking that hid skills at politicing are as good as his skills at teaching, and THAT got him the job, then yes, I would agree with that. From what I understand, the higher you go in a given field, the more your skills at politics comes into play, and fo be head of a department one would need to be reasonably good at it.
