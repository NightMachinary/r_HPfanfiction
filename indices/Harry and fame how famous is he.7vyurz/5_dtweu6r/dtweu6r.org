Well, in canon, it seems like he's pretty well-known in Britain as he had unknown people bowing to him as a child. Like [[/u/TheAccursedOnes]] says, that fame probably stretches over most of Europe. Rita Skeeter certainly was able to use his fame to her advantage and it didn't really seem to matter whether people believed the whole "boy-who-lived" story or not.

In my own Potterverse, Harry continues being well-known in the UK into his adult life and the Auror department has few scruples of using that fame to their advantage and that's part of what drives him out to the US to a (hopefully) quieter life. The way I have it, the wizarding world in the US is certainly aware of him and children are taught about him in the course of Modern Magical History, but on the whole they just kind of shrug and move on, which suits him just fine.

As for the rest of the world, I can see where certain pockets of society would be more interested in him. Aurors and law enforcement from other countries, Dark Magic practitioners/researchers, educators ... but your regular witch or wizard not so much.
