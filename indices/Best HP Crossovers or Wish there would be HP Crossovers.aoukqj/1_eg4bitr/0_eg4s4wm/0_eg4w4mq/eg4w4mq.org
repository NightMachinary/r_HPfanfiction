No, Harry uses the trees as weapons against the Others, but that's it. And that's sort of a specific example, but what I meant more generally was Harry who uses earth based spells so that people think he is Garth Greenhand reborn, like an incarcerous spell made of vines, trees that shoot leaves like arrows, something like that which gives the impression that he has control over the plants and earth. And like Garth Greenhand he has a bunch of super powerful children by a bunch of different mothers who shape the future of Westeros.
