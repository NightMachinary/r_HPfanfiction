I want to see a Harry in Westeros fic where he is believed to be Garth Greenhand reborn and he carries on that legacy. Holds back the Others using the trees in the Haunted Forest as weapons, allows for more than enough food to be grown during the Long Night, and knocks up a few dozen highborn women.
