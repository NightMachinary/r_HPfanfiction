Oh how I wish for an ASOIAF crossover, with old/experienced Harry getting stuck there and somewhat getting mixed up in local conflicts but NOT the game of thrones or on Westeros (a completely different timeline would be even better). Westeros for me is hands down the most boring setting imaginable in the world of ASOIAF. (Sth approximately similar was A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My Fault, but that's gone off the rails after a while and it's a cross with Dresden not HP.)

Now that I think about it I basically want the Shadow of Angmar in Martin's world :)).

Or basically any crossovers along these lines, where the point of the work is *not* how Harry could make all conflict pointless by existing, or how he could be stuffed into a plot-line which was much-much better off without his inclusion.

Worlds I like are Dresden, The Dark Tower, LoTR, ASOIAF, Star Wars even, SG on occasion, nBSG... but in my experience there are very few of these kinds of crossovers which are even slightly above trash. (And most of those have already been listed in this thread, or other similar ones.)

Some which I liked, not necessarily in line with my above-outlined-wishes, and weren't listed in this thread are:
