Yes, and no. I am sure that Harry would oppose real slavery as well if he ever visited Meereen or Yunkai. He fights for what is right, and the Hogwarts House Elves are not mistreated. Unlike the slaves in Westeros. Hermione would be the driving force, but Harry would follow out of conviction and not because he doesn't want to hurt a friend.

And Hermione, at least in the scenario I have in mind, would be hardened by the war. She would be more akin to "We need to build a Navy to stop the Ironborn and later free the slaves. So we need guns, steel, coal, scientists and engineers, factories..." and less "let's make some token hats which don't actually free the House Elves".

Less idealism, more Realpolitik so to speak.
