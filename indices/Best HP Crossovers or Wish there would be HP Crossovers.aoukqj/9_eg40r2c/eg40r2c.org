A A Song of Ice and Fire Crossover where Harry and Hermione end up in Westeros shortly after the Rebellion. And AFTER Hermione has read the first book (which came out in 1996), so she knows about the Lannister duplicity, Littlefinger, Dany and Jon's parentage as well as the White Walkers (although not as much as they should know).

Given that neither feels like shitting into buckets and watching everyone die by age 40, a quick industrialisation and enlightenment would be in order (magic makes that ridiculously easy), as well as a deliverance of Slavers' Bay (most likely through gunboat diplomacy) and the utter destruction of the Unsullied and their masters.

Given that they are both British, I don't see a democratic crusade happening, but definitely the introduction of parliamentarism and a constitution as well as the abolition of serfdom.

Starfox might argue that mind-control would be the best way, but that makes for a boring story and would still take years to set up because they could not use apparation and portkeys without having visited the places first.
