So many crossovers I wish for...

A Star Wars/Harry Potter fusion where Harry is a Jedi who is on the run after the Jedi Purge starts and ends up being taken in and hidden by the Weasley famiy. The Weasley kids are all force sensitive, but Molly and Arthur refused to give them up to the Jedi at such a young age.

A Skins crossover with Harry/Effy. Lots of drugs in the form of potions and lots of firewhiskey. (I'd also take Ginny/Cook or Emily/Hermione.)

A Hannibal (NBC) crossover with teenage Harry ending up in the position of Abigail in the Will/Hannibal relationship - while staying as in-character as possible.)

A Buffy crossover where Dawn gets sent to Harry for protection instead. He suddenly has this 14-year-old daughter he supposedly conceived right after the war and he finds out it's all fake memories when Glory comes after her.

A Stargate crossover where Bill becomes host to a Goa'uld while working in Egypt. Or Bill finds alien tech in Egypt. Or a Goa'uld is what 'attaches' itself to Ron in the DoM.

A Song of Ice and Fire crossover with slow-burn Harry/Robb. Harry is not OP, but he's useful enough to make a difference in the war, and Robb takes the Iron Throne.

A Krypton (Syfy) crossover/AU where the Justice League tracks Voldemort from Romania to Britain and Superman rescues Harry in the graveyard. Years later, Trelawney prophecizes that an enemy is going back in time to destroy Superman. Harry, who never really found a purpose after Voldemort's capture, steals a device from the DoM that takes him to Krypton 200 years before it exploded. Oh, and Dumbledore tells Superman/Batman that Harry is horcrux and that Voldemort can't die with him alive. As a result, Voldemort gets thrown into the Phantom Zone.
