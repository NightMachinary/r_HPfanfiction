I'd like to see a fic post Hogwarts where Harry decides to protect the non magicals from monsters etc. like the Hunters from supernatural.

He would still use wizard world resources etc as hes smart, but doesnt agree with the way the Wizard world ignores and doesnt help the non magicals. Could even leave that universe and just do that in the Supernatural universe.
