Some random ideas from my wish list.

Unspeakable Harry is thrown back in time, to prevent a paradox he travels to country he's never learned about to avoid paradox (can't change what you don't know). There he hears rumors of a strangely dressed priestess... Inuyasha crossover.

A HP/Monster Musume crossover that deals semi-seriously with the fall of the Statue of Secrecy, and still has some monster girl shenanigans.

A D&D/Elder Scrolls/etc. crossover where the actual lore is explored rather regaling the reader with munchkinry. Bonus points for actually having to learn rather than receiving some blessing or luck to 'move the plot along'.

Competitive empire building like how I like to imagine [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12523587/1/Goblet-of-Vegas][Goblet of Vegas]] turning out.

A semi-serious Highschool DxD crossover where a devil wants to experiment with resurrection is collecting parts of Voldemort and people possessed by his horcruxes into their peerage. (Quirrell, Ginny, Harry, Nagi, and others).

The Ministry Six find themselves scattered throughout the Old World of Warhammer Fantasy. Fate might bring them back together, but they would all be changed by their experiences.
