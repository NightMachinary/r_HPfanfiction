Some of my favorites : linkffn(8501689) linkffn(11115934) linkffn(4388682)

linkffn(4183715) (listed as pure HP, but it's actually hp/dresden files. I think it started before that was a crossover option on ff.net).

Unfortunately, none of them are being actively updated right now, but I think only one is straight up abandoned.
