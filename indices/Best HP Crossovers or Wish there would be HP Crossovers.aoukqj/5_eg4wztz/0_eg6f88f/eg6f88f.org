Yeah, I hear you. I'd love to see a proper fusion crossover, with muggleborns knowing about capes, the purebloods freaking out about the sos and the Simurgh popping around every so often to mess things up.

Maybe a story that follows Harry until he triggers? God knows he's been through some trigger-worthy shit.
