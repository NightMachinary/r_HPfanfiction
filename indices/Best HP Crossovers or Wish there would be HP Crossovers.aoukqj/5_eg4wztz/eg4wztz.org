I wish there was a solid, longer Worm crossover where Harry has superpowers. Preferably Worm-typical ironic-hell type powers, preferably as an unwilling/accidental supervillain, preferably /not/ overpowered...but at this point I can't afford to be too picky.

I'm probably gonna have to write it myself.
