I saw one that can best be summarized as "Mary Poppins /does not approve/ of leaving babies on doorsteps!" Which I could stand to read a dozen more variations of. Seriously, that's a great premise that isn't too limiting, and saying Mary Poppins is actually a HP-style witch doesn't conflict with either canon (that carpetbag is just like Hermione's beaded bag).
