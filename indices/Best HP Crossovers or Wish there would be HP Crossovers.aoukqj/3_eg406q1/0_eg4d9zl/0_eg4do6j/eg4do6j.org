Garrus and Liara are the most popular character of the fandom, and at some point, they are simply overused. I call it the "Neville Effect". And Grunt would cause some hilarity, but he would not blend into the shadows. Tali could hack her way around any security and provide technical know-how, Grunt can headbutt stuff and kick arse.

I feel that he would be better suited if you dropped the squad into the Battle of Hogwarts, slugging it out with Acromantulas and Giants than in a story about technological advancement.
