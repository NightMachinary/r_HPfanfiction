A Mass Effect Crossover where Jane Shepard and Tali are thrown through time and crash into the garden of Privet drive just after Dumbledore dropped Harry off. Jane finds Harry (suffering from slight hypothermia) and takes him along because of the letter Dumbledore included (which does not fit their understanding of the world at all).

Jane and Tali use future knowledge to revolutionise technology (with Jane being the figurehead like Elon Musk) and completely shit over the timeline because they know that their future just brings doom and destruction. Possibly even initiate an early first contact with the Quarians. They also unsuccessfully try to figure out what magic is after witnessing some accidental one which cannot be explained with Mass Effect lore.

Meanwhile, once he gets to Hogwarts, Harry tells everyone that his adoptive mother is an alien who has to live in an environmental suit and everyone is like "sounds like something Harry Potter would do". Not sure about the exact details, but I think it would end in the Death Eaters being introduced to mass-accelerated Sniper rounds and Voldemort suffering the same fate should the graveyard repeat itself in a similar fashion. And because Jane grew to love Harry, that would even satisfy the Prophecy.
