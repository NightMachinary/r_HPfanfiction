legit, you should try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643565/1/Blue-Magic][Blue Magic]] by Tellur !linkffn(8643565) the plot is somewhat similar to what you have described except swap Shepard for Liara, and Tali for Tali's great grandmother

it also happens to be competently written, with great dialogue and is pretty witty at times. Unfortunately it is unfinished, and I have doubts the author will continue. :( still, they are pretty active with their PM's, so they might respond if you ask them about it
