Pretty much, just have to decide what actually isn't worth the time to read. I remember when I first started reading fanfiction, I had the same problem. I'd read it for 16 hours a day. The well didn't really dry up, I just started getting sick of reading the same repackaged ideas over and over again.

Nowadays I feel lucky to find more than one interesting HP fic to read per month.
