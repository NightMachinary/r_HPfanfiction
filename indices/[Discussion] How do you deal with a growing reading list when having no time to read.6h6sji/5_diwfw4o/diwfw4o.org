50 stories? Amateur. My To Read list is over 400 fics long. I've been working on it for about 5 years.

That's probably not very encouraging for you, actually.

As for actually dealing with it, I've basically hit a point where I just put them all on my tablet so that they're on hand to read whenever I want. Once you actually start a fic, you're more likely to continue, so even if you start reading for just ten minutes before bed, or waiting for the bus, or on the toilet, then you'll start finding more time to read afterwards because you want to finish it.

On the other hand, if life gets really too busy, you may just have to resign yourself to never getting to read some stories. (This may not necessarily stop you saving them, however; that's how you end up with 5yr old reading lists that are 400 stories long.)
