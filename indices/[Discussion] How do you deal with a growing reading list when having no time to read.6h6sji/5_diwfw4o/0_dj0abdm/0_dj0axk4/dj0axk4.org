If they're complete, I download and stick 'em all in a folder labelled "To Read"; I follow incomplete ones and then download when the last chapter is posted. I always read on my tablet these days so I don't have to sit at the computer (excepting occasional one-shots shorter than 10k), plus I don't have to worry about the fic being deleted before I get around to actually reading it. Other than that, I have no organisation; I just label each file with author and title. By the time I get around to reading them, I usually don't even know what fandom it's from until I open it up (unless the title has some obvious indicator), let alone what it's about.
