I wish I had this problem! I have the opposite problem of not having anything to read. You'll probably be disappointed and only really want to read 80% of them, not to be a downer! Take it easy though, they're not going anywhere. Nothing wrong with having a list of things you want to read, that's always better than having nothing!
