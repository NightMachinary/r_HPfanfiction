I have sooo many things to read as well; I've got a spreadsheet of them. Plus I always want to reread older stuff and that often takes precedence. I should do the Kindle thing too, actually. I guess I'm pickier about dropping them once I start if there's something I don't like, but I'm sure I'm still weeding out good ones that way.
