You mean at the end of Order of The Phoenix? My reasoning is that most of them spent 10+ years in Azkaban, they are bound to lose some combative edge. The kids were losing, employing stall tactics in what amounts to a maze until the Order showed up. They had also spent time getting practical defensive magical lessons, which may have been the only thing to keep them alive that long. If Snape hadn't been a member they would have been properly fucked.
