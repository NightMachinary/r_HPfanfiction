Several plausible reasons come to mind:

- OotP adults might have taken risks to protect the young ones.
- Those under 17 were sent into hiding or evacuated, so there might not have been many of them in the first place, relative to the number of unnamed adults.
- DEs would be more focused on taking out those they perceived the most dangerous: the more experienced witches and wizards.
- There is some circumstantial evidence that DEs had standing orders to spare pureblooded children if practical:

  - Voldemort outright tried to recruit Neville after.
  - At the Department of Mysteries at the end of OotP, the only one targeted with lethal magic was Hermione.
