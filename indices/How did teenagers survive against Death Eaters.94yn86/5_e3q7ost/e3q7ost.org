Death Eaters aren't exactly a trained army. They're basically just people who decided to go around terrorizing others. More like gang members or thugs. So except for a few particularly talented ones (Bellatrix, etc.) the average Death Eater probably isn't much better at combat magic than the average teenager who's been training for a year or more to fight them.

Just as much as people get mad at Harry for not training much, I doubt the Death Eaters in general train much either.

As for the first war--those few particularly talented ones can mean a lot in terms of actually pulling off murders. Especially since Voldemort himself probably killed lots of Order members.
