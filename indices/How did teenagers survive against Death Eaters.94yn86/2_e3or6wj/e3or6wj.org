It is abit unrealistic. Though Voldmort was prone to underestimating those he considered unworthy. I'm sure he didnt think an army of mostly half blood and muggle borns or even creatures could defeat him.

He seemed to underestimate Harry too.

I think the only person he was wary of underestimating was Dumbledore.
