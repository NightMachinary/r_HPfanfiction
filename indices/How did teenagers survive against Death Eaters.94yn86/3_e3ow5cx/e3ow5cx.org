No. I think you'd be fine with killing some of them, although it would depend on who you were thinking of killing and it is probably a good idea to develop them a bit.

As for why, other than plot reasons, I think it's possible and indeed very likely that most weren't facing Death Eaters (those saved for Order members) but the likes of Stanley Shunpikes (imperiused victims) in the battle .
