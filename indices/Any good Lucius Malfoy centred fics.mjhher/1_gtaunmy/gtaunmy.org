  Why is Lucius so often portrayed as a complece psychopath towards everyone around him
#+end_quote

Because he's a blood purist and a death eater who blindly followed a mad man ? Gave an 11 years old girl a cursed dark object and nearly killed Harry in his second year ? He probably was behind the death eater attack in the world cup and tortured defenseless muggles ? He let a madman into his own home ? Raised his son into an arrogant blood purist and led to him getting marked (probably unwillingly ?) And having to commit murder in order to protect himself and his mother? Because he tortured house elves ? Because an 18 years old girl got tortured in his house and he barely reacted ?

Im sorry but how do you want us to portray him ?
