That happens to me all the time. And it makes me sad for multiple reasons. I'm sad that I forgot the fanfiction, although it had been great and I'm sad that I spent time reading something I already read because I could have been reading some other great fanfiction. I don't know how many fanfictions I read totally captivated just to notice in the last chapter that I had read it already...
