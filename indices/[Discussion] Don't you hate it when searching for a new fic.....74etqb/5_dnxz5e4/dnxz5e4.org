That happens to my mother with books, movies and TV shows ALL THE TIME. To the point where she no longer bothers to manage her own Kindle library - she gets me to put on things she hasn't read before, and remove the things she has, so that she doesn't accidentally reread and get annoyed with herself.

It's only happened to me a few times. Once, notably, with a fic that was taken down and re-uploaded with a new name, and a few times when things were posted on AO3 and FFN both. I think they were all decent fics though, so I just went ahead and reread them, since it put off the search for something decent to read for a few hours.
