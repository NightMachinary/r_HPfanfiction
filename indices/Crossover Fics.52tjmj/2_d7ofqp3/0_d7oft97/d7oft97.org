  Based on The Galactic War challenge by Belgrath on DZ2's forums. During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter is sent to the Star Wars universe. Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return. Not sure which genres to call this one.

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)
