This makes me wonder if there's any good and badass fanfics about a more gangster version of Harry. I mean american gangster, not the UK version. Alternatively, if there's any buddy cop or dynamic duo sort of fic starring Harry and Ron.

It'd be ideal if, besides these changes, that they were otherwise canon compliant.
