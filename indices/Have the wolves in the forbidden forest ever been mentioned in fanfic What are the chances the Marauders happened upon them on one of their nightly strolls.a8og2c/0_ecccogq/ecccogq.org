There was one fanfic where Bellatrix was a wolf animagus and ran from the law. She went to Hogwarts to steal a wand and restore Voldemort but failed amd went to live with the wolves while slowly losing her human nature. Sirius finds her completely feral and realises that she might be useful after Voldemort's return.

I don't remember the name, only that I dropped it because it completely ignored the Malfoys' faults.
