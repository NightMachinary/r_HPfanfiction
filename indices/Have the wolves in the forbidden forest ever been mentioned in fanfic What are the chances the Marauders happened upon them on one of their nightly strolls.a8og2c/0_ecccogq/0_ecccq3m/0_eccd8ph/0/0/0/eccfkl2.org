It's what Rowling said though, and personally I consider her to be canon... Dolohov killed Remus and Bella killed Tonks.

The problem with her is that she did not exactly go to prison because she repented and confessed, but rather without her cousin's abilities as an animagus she managed to survive on get maniacal loyalty to Voldemort alone. Heck she went to prison because even after he'd disappeared she couldn't accept it and tortured two ppl until the turned insane trying to find out information about how she could get Voldemort back. I'm sorry but I've never seen any redeeming qualities in her, she was just crazy. At least the Malfoys knew to keep their heads down and Snape suffered and died for the right cause (for the wrong reasons but still). Bella and Sirius are really alike, must be the genes. I bet she'd be a dog too if she was an animagus.
