I don't disagree, all I'm saying is that there's not "no way" that the Malfoys could have gotten away relatively unpunished.

"Rich Nazi-Supporter profits of Hitler's reign and gets largely away" was sadly not as uncommon as you'd want it, and even people involved directly in the holocaust got away easy-ish.

Again, I'm not saying that the Malfoys get away, and/or that they should not be punished, or are redeemed. I was simply trying to point out that just because of warcrimes, people can still get away and live a life in normal society. I wasn't making any case that they ought to be viewed as redeemed or redeemable - but rather that some monsters, sadly, were in fact viewed as redeemed, despite their crimes and little punishment.

So I'm not really disagreeing with you, I'm just saying that sadly in reality, there would be a chance for some semi-"redemption".
