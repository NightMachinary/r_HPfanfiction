  Coercion and being 16 are not valid defences for attempted murder, treason and terrorism.

That depends on the jurisdiction - however, it's likely that any jurisdiction would have had a harsh sentence for him.

But if we look at post-WW2 Germany we can see that the sentence might have been much lower than you expect. To cherry-pick one person: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Broad][Perry Broad]] was a guard as Ausschwitz, and was found guilty for "Gemeinschaftliche Beihilfe zum gemeinschaftlichen Mord (in 22 FÃ¤llen an mindestens 2.000 Menschen)" (assistance to joint murder (in 22 cases and at least 2,000 humans).

He got four years in a harsher-than-usual prison.

A few of the guards got not much more than a slap on the wrist. For example [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakiv_Palij][Jakiv Palij]] didn't get any punishment, as far as I can tell.

These were not even singular cases, a lot of the Nazis got off relatively easy. And while I don't think it's likely, I can't say that I consider it entirely impossible that the Malfoys got off largely scot-free.

Now, this doesn't have to do much with redeem-ability, but I wanted to bring it up, since you brought up the crimes.
