Sorry about that then, I cannot find what I've read and am not sure anymore now that it was all Rowling, because it was a text. It basically said what you quoted, that Snape was not just good or evil, that he made great sacrifices for the greater good, but also that his one true goal was to avenge Lily and honor her memory but did not really care for the lives of the others involved. It might have been a reader's interpretation I guess.
