You misunderstood my point. In canon, neither are redeemable. Malfoys violations of Article 23 of the Hague convention, subsections a, b and f (especially F) would have been his death warrant, even at the hands of the Allies. Coercion and being 16 are not valid defences for attempted murder, treason and terrorism. And Bellatrix crimes are undisputed.

But if you were to write a story where they are to be redeemed, Bellatrix is the far better candidate because she was severely punished for her crimes while the Malfoys, and Snape to a lesser extent) lived a life of luxury. And a believable redemption would require non-canon-compliant changes to their characters either way. Bellatrix, being almost broken by 13 years in Azkaban, would be more believable to have a change of heart. And she atoned with her time served, while the Malfoys drank champagne and ate caviar (so to speak).
