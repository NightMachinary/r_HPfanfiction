That's not canon. In canon we only see her body.

Hell, I find Bellatrix a lot more redeemable than either Malfoy or Snape because she actually faced justice for her crimes while the others lived a life of luxury. And even as a supporter of punitive justice rather than corrective, a decade in Azkaban as it was in canon should be enough for pretty much anyone short of Voldemort, Umbridge and Fudge.
