To answer your question, there are a none you must have read.

I would suggest you take note of what type of story you want to read and then systematically work your way down the top reviewed stories on [[https://FF.net][F]]anfiction.net. The recommendations here on the Subreddit are quite often repetitive, pointing out always the same stories, over and over again.

Alot of those stories are attempts to get away from the poor and sullen boy that Harry in their opinion is, in canon.Though, I have yet to find a story that does not depict Harry as someone of questionable moral integrity, - I mean those stories that think they point him in a "grey" area, when in truth they are anything but subtle in their attempt to establish a dominion of power that he holds reign supreme in whereas others are at his whims.

To cut the chase: I cannot make you any recommendations without knowing what you enjoy. Do you like powerplays? Do you enjoy a retelling of canon with a slight different touch? Maybe a different angle? Or do you enjoy Crossovers?
