No.

Taste is too subjective to have universally accepted must reads. I couldn't get through most of the popular fics around here. I couldn't stand Methods of Rationality for ten chapters. At the same time many stories I consider top-tier are niche picks. Quite a few of those are only good if you have read a lot of other stories and want a breath of fresh air, like Call Me, which is the antithesis to the average "Summer after 5th year" story.
