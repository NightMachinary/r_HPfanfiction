I hate those â€˜summer after 5th/6th year stories'. They pretend to be edgy and give Harry thousands of powers but all they manage to do is fall face first into a pool of cliches and spit out an overpowered, out of character, mean and bigoted Harry. They are eventually abandoned because there isn't much you can do with a Deus Ex Machina character.
