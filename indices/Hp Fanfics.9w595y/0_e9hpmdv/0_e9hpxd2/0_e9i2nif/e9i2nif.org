Then read Call Me by Wrexscar. It's a nice summer romance, if a little fast paced and it does not start terribly romantic (they are horny teenagers and have sex early on, before really establishing a relationship) . At the same time it is very refreshing after that edgy shit. There's no powerwank, no bashing, no politics and no inheritances, just a sweet, character focused story. Teenagers act like teenagers, they are quick to have sex, drink, try weed, stuff like that.

The biggest flaws are two chapters where everyone acts a little too rational (Roofies and Church) and Hermione is more in line with her 11year old characterisation than her canon 16 year one, but she is only in two scenes either way.
