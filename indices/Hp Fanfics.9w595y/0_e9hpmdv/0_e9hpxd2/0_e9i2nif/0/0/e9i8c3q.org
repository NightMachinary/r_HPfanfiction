  What's up with your obsession with teenagers and sex
#+end_quote

I am merely annoyed how most stories are either pure smut or completely ignore that it happens. Especially at Hogwarts (no supervision, countless private places, nothing else to do in the evenings/at night). Most teenagers are horny bastards, and yet most authors depict them as angles with little to none "inappropriate" thoughts. Kinda makes the whole romance arc feel incomplete.

  I feel like every time I see you in a thread you are mentioning it somewhere.

Considering that my last few posts here dealt mostly with Death Eater war crimes and the criminal process, you are getting the wrong picture.

  Do you mostly read romance
#+end_quote

Nope, if anything I am sick of pure romances. Pretty much any trope like the big emphasis on the girl's virginity, declarations of love way too early, jealous admirer/protective father as the antagonist, people dicking around and plot driven by misunderstandings.

I prefer romantic sideplots which are not resolved at the end but rather focus on the "us vs the world" aspect.
