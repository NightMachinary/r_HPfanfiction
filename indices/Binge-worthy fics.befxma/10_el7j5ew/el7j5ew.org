linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) does this to me every time. It's definitely not for everyone, but I can't put it down. Every time.

I recently started reading linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby?) and next thing I knew it was 5am and I hadn't slept at all. It's absolutely ridiculous insane craziness and I couldn't look away. I'm still only a third of the way through it and severely sleep-deprived.
