linkao3(Turn by Sarasgirl) Is my absolute favourite, it centres around a middle aged Harry going through a midlife crisis. It's a wonderful story. (Harry/Draco)

linkao3(No Glory by Obsidianpen) thematises what would happen if Harry wasn't killed in the forrest, instead Voldemort takes him prisoner. It's amazing but absolutely heart wrenching.
