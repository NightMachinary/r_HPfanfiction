Absolutely there are recaps, and a full list of all the podcasts are there. The first podcast they ever do is Melindaleo's Seventh Horcrux, if memory serves. I listened along to it as I read through it ages ago. Later, that author and many others are guests in the podcasts. Melindaleo, Lupine Moon, Bobmin, Lady Chi, Robst (iirc) and others.

I haven't had time to listen to even a fraction of them, so I picked out ones that talked about fics I've read or was reading. They also cover a lot of other fanfiction genres. Guide here:

A number of them also do at least one other podcast called "Potterfic Weekly."
