It's a podcast for Fanfiction and in particular Harry Potter fanfiction. It's been around for the better part of 10 years and it has a forum with some friendly and quirky folk in it. That's why I am surprised it hasn't shown up in the couple of years I've been in [[/r/HPFanfiction]]

There's a /LOT/ of podcast content there for those that like that sort of thing. And by a lot, I mean several hundred hours.
