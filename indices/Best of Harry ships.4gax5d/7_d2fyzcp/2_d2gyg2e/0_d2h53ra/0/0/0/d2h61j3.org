[[https://twitter.com/annerbhp/status/390184437800898560][There might even be a sequel's sequel!]] And the sequel is at 90k words already! That's almost as long as The Changeling is now. And that was almost a year ago.

I almost wish the author would start posting whatever she's written and finish the current story in her own time. But that might not be as satisfactory as getting the story in its proper order, and i desire perfection.
