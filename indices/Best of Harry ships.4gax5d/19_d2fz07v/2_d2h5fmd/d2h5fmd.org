Twist of Fate by Oakstone730 linkao3(473335)- Maybe it is just because I am a sucker for angst, but this is the best Harry/Draco other than TURN. In this fic, Harry and Draco have a beautiful, albeit young love, relationship 4th and 5th year at Hogwarts that they have to keep secret. Then for Harry's protection in the war, Draco has to erase all of Harry's memories of them being together. The story pics up after the war at the trials when Harry finds out. It is so heartbreaking and beautiful. This fic is the perfect example of a story that could only work in the HP universe - it is so woven into the fabric of canon. Canon knowledge just enriches this - it almost feels like it could be head cannon (EWE). Part of me wants to imagine that this IS canon, but what happened to Harry and Draco is just so tragic that it makes me sad to imagine it.
