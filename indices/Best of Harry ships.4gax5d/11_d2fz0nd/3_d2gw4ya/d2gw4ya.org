linkffn(11185533) While not much in the way of romance it is a HP/DG with the rare treat of adult Harry and Dudley

linkffn(5864749) One of my favorites. I stumble upon it once every couple of years and every reread has been enjoyable so far.

linkffn(5835213) and linkffn(4334542) are what made me get in to Harry/Daphne and that has been the longest sailing ship for me for some time

There are some others that I enjoy but these are my havorites that have not been mentioned
