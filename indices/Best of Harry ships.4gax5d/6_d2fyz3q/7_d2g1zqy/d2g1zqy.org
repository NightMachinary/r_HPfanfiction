Probably the most intimidating Voldemort around. Lots of intriguer, spell crafting, tactics, etc.. Awesome, awesome action, some of the best I've ever read, period. The Dark Arts are /really/ dark, lots of horrible spells and sacrificial rituals.

I think the only downside is that its pretty sexual- magical Britain has sex turned up to 11. No sex scenes, but lots of "alluring, "scantly clad," etc.. Its obviously ymmv, but I considered it a distraction from what I consider the main attraction.
