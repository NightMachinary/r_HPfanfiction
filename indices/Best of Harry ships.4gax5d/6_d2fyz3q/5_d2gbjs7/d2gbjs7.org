Definitely Resistance for a single fic, but all of lorien829's HHR is awesome. I'd name Forever Knight too(probably my solution to the favorite how-to-deal-with-Ron problem, if not Resistance) but its already been mentioned. HermioneCrookshanks has some really, really good ones too, but my favorite of hers is The List.
