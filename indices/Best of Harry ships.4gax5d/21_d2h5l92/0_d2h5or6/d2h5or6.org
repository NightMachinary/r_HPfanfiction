I have only read one of these but it was really really good.

linkao3(979182) Cartographers Craft - a great DH - AU where 16 yr old sirius comes back somehow out of the marauders map. There is a lot to like about this fic - really great writing, interesting characters who are well-developed, a slow building and believable love story etc. Not too creepy Sirius/Harry because there wasn't an age-gap between them. Also the search for the horcruxes was believable and interesting. This is a really nice fic and I highly recommend it.
