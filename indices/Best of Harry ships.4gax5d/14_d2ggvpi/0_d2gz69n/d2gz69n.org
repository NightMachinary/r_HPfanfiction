The only one I know of is linkffn(Other Waters by Mad Maudlin). Ignore the summary, the author was probably drunk when he wrote it. The actual writing is quite good. Ron had been kidnapped and tortured by Death eaters for three years (I think?) and this story is about his recovery and rebuilding his life.
