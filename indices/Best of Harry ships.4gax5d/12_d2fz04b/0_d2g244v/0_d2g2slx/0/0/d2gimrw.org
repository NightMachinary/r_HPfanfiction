Some of the minor characters are pretty well characterized actually. Lily, James, Sirius, Snape and many of the Black Family members. Bellatrix is certainly bleh; the author does little more than present her than a bratty child.

The main problem with the fic is the complete lack of meaningful conflict in the second half of the story. Harry is always two steps ahead and is more interested in fun and games than anything else. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort are nerfed and it becomes a curb stomp fic.

The author is also a mediocre writer at best. His fight scenes and his attempts at witty dialogue are particularly bad. The story was still decent enough to be readable in the first half which had actual conflict, but after that it became complete, utter never-ending dreck.
