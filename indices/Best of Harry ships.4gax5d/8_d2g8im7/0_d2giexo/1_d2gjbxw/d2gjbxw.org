I really wish the author had left the multiple marriages thing out of Heart and Soul. The fic is a little slow and maybe a bit overwritten but overall i really liked it, except i just can't stand the Polygamy thing that seems to run rampant in HP fanfic. It always seems like wish fulfillment for horny teenagers to me. In fact the only thing i hate more in HP fanfiction than the multiple wive trope is the Harry/Hermoine pairing.

I just don't understand the appeal. It always feels forced to me. I could live with it if people just marked their fics as Harry/Hermoine so i can ignore them but for some reason she always has to be a second wive or a secret girlfriend or part of some ridicioulus Harem.

Sorry for the rant, i just had to get that of my chest :D I hate it when a decent Harry/Fleur story gets ruined.
