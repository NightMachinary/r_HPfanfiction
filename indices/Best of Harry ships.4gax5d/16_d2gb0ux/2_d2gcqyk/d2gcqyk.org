linkffn(9911469) My favorite because of how off-beat this is. It's still in gen territory, though HP/TR is endgame (way, way in the future.)

linkffn(6953303) The classic must-read of this pairing. This is the fic that had me falling in love with this pairing. It's awesome because no one is bashed and Harry doesn't turn evil. [[/spoiler][And Voldemort is redeemed by love yet still visibly himself.]]

linkffn(2171770) An old HP/TR fic that isn't drowning in the awful tropes that populate this pairing.

linkao3(1155472) Harry is raised by all of Voldemort's horcuxes. It's /awesome/.
