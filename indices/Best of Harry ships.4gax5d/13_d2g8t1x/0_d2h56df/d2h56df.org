Cambiare Podentes linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361)-]] This is a Harry/Snape fic where there is a prophecy that in order to kill voldermort, harry must bind to snape in an ancient spell as his permanent slave. I was really really expecting not to like this fic - not least because I think it is creepy in most stories, totally OOC and also not at all well explained. This story is totally different. First of all, it is a 600K-ish word series and so the characters and their motivations are fully explained. Second, snape and harry are both in character - especially snape.

I loved this fic and would highly recommend it to anyone who is okay with slash (even if not usually Harry/Snape) and likes really well written long fics. You will definitely like this.
