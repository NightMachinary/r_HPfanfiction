Thanks for this. Personally, I enjoy HPMOR as a story, so reviews that critique it on literary grounds are of 0 interest to me. Plus, most reviews don't bother with any critique at all, instead just ranting about the reviewer's dislike without any substance. These posts don't seem to have either of those failings. Quality criticism of fanfic happens so infrequently that it's /always/ worth reading, if I agree with it or not.
