Thanks for posting this! I've read through a lot of his chapter reviews and thoroughly enjoyed it. He is is able to critique the science of HPMOR which I enjoyed. Harriezer throws around a lot of references to various scientific theories and it's nice to get a scientists take on it. He does a good job of giving Harriezer credit when he gets something right, and tears him apart when he's wrong. He gives a good description of how Bayesian theory fits in to the wider field, and the reasons why it's not accepted by many rationalist philosophers. Plus, he does a good job of critiquing on a literary level. It is just fracking hilarious to read him tear it apart chapter by chapter.
