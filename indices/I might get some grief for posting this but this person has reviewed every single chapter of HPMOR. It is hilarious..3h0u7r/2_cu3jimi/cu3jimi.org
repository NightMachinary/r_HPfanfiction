Ok, I liked HPMOR as a fanfiction. However, I totally agree with the reviewer in that a lot of the stuff Harry says isn't very... correct.

I feel that if Less Wrong had written this as just fanfiction, instead of trying to be extremely sciency and rational, the story would have been much better. It's hard for me to take the idea of a rational 11 year old seriously, even if you accept the story's explanation for why. Those who have finished the fanfiction know what I'm talking about.

There are obviously rationalists and skeptics in the world, people who basically are influenced by rational thinking in a lot of things they do. They needed years and years to get to the point where they could think like that. Young Harry, I feel, would be way too young and immature to behave like he does, even with his special little problem/ability that is explained toward the end of the story.

You should totally post this in [[/r/HPMOR]] OP. I don't think you'll get lynched as much as you think you will.
