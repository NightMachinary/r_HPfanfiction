I searched [[/r/HPMOR]] and found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/search?q=su3su2u1&restrict_sr=on][two threads]] about these wonderful reviews by Su3Su2u1. Those two posts have a combined 332 comments (!). Those were 5 months ago, so I think they are pretty aware of it. There were actually plenty of commenters who agreed with Su3Su2u1. So *The_Entire_Eurozone* is right: your chances of being lynched are not 100%.
