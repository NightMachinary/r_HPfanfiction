  - I don't think I'm beating up on Yudkowsky at all. I am instead discussing a story he wrote with a critical eye. In particular, HPMOR is explicitly supposed to be pedagogical, its supposed to teach the reader things. Therefore, we should keep on eye on what it is teaching.\\
  - I will probably occasionally also criticize the sequences for similar reasons. Nothing is more frustrating than getting a student in an introductory quantum mechanics class who thinks they've learned it all in the LessWrong sequences (this has happened to me twice). I fear one of the (erroneous) lessons the sequences implicitly teach is that you can know as much (or MORE) as physicists about the proper way to do quantum mechanics simply by reading a few dozen pages.

I think this should help sum up why this person's put so much effort into this critique. This isn't just random ranting (for the most part, anyway), it's talking about the failures of the so-called science in the story.
