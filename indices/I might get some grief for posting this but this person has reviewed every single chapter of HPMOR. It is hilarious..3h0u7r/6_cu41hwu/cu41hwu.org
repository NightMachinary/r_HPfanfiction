Thanks for posting this; I find it interesting. I was peripherally aware of some of it, but I somehow missed that he has an 11-year-old Draco threatening to rape a 10-year-old Luna in the first few chapters. I'm surprised this isn't something that's brought up when criticizing this fic. I find it extra disturbing because, as far as I can tell, this version of Draco is actually supposed to be more sympathetic than the canon version.

IMO, the only way an 11-year-old would be going around spouting rape threats is if this is something they are hearing at home, so I suppose we are meant to assume that Lucius frequently threatens to rape people he doesn't like in the earshot of his son. Say what you will about the Malfoys, but that does not seem in character. If anything, Draco seems to be one of the more sheltered children in the books, at least at age 11.
