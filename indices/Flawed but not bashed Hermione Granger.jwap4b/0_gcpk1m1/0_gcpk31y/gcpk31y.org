  Hermione Granger knows who she is. She is a Gryffindor. She is a Muggleborn. She is Afro-Arab. She is English. She is a Muslimah. She is a good friend. She is smart. She is an activist. She is things that she will never say out loud.Hermione Granger knows who she is. The problem: No one else does.1. Not her friends.2. Not her parents.3. Not even her. Not yet.  (this is the unlearning. the miseducation. minute by minute)

  He glances at the boxy too-uniform numbers flashing on the face of Richard's radio. It's nearly noon, and he should be getting ready to leave; but there is still a harsh tension in his shoulders and neck that he wants to work out before Hermione finds him. It is, after all, Tuesday; and while his Tuesdays were designated ‘tea with Helen' days previously, they are now ‘lunch with Granger' days, ever since the chance meet-up with the Weasel's wife and the insufferable swot herself.

#+begin_quote
  When Hermione agrees to go to Bulgaria with Sirius to help him in his hunt for Peter Pettigrew the summer after third year, she never imagined she would discover herself, make new friends, and fall in love with Viktor Krum. However, the golden warmth of summer has its shadows, and Hermione finds herself on the edge of something much bigger and more sinister than she ever could have imagined.

  Viktor had thought he might have loved her when he saw her by the Black Lake the first time, standing under a tree and trying, desperately, to make it look as if she wasn't waiting for him. But now? Now as she glanced up at him dwarfed by one of his old coats, snowflakes catching on her eyelashes... Now, he knew.

  Bobby and Hermione finally meet. Secrets will be revealed. Relationships will be built.And a trip to Australia is definitely in order.This work is meant to follow a series of letters between (primarily) Richard Granger and Bobby Singer. It may help to read at least the last few from 1997 and 1998 to get an idea of where this is starting.
