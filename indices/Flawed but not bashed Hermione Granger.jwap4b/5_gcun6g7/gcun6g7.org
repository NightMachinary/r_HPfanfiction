I remember the Sugarquill having a great collection of flawed but believable Hermione stories. It was a Ron/Hermione-based site, but they prided themselves on being "canon-friendly" so keep that in mind. However, some of the best HP fics I've read were hosted on that site and I felt safe because I prefer canon-friendly fics (at the time). Also, keep in mind many of the fics were written pre-Deathly Hallows. Some were even written pre-Half Blood Prince, and many were pre-OotP because there was that long period in-between the publication of GOF and OotP where the number of fics sky-rocketed.
