I have a go-to rec list specfically for this request. I selected the critical fics from the bashing ones.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

-This fic has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time. She gets better though. Ron/Daphne pairing. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]])

-linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. It's more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5269970/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Third-Key-Reloaded]]) OP!Harry, Hermione's a bit controlling in this, Ron's a good friend.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]) SELF-PROMO! where Ron choses not to date Hermione in 6th year. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]) It doesn't focus on bashing, but it portrays Hermione as not perfect and definitely outlines her flaws.

This community on FFN has some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]] but I can't say all of them are bash-free.
