You have a good list here! I bookmarked a few that look up my alley. Idk if we are allowed to post our own work here, but I'm writing a dramione story right now and my Hermione is nosy, quick to speak her opinion without thinking about the impact of her words, and has a bit of a temper. She is also still dealing with the consequences of the war, but that is not a main focus. I've got 7 chapters up so far, 8th one will be up tonight, and I update every few days.
