Crossover, dark, not cliched, hm... Okay, darkness and writing quality vary a bit and I'm not sure what exactly qualifies as cliche but:

linkffn(8933408) - One of the many Kathryn518 coauthored crossovers with an OP Harry fixing another setting (Warcraft in this case) and acquiring a harem. He has no qualms about killing and bloodshed, but I couldn't really describe him as dark either. Long and in progress.

linkffn(8832598) - Harry's new familiar is OP, but Harry himself still feels very young and unsure... but his familiar will influence him in disturbing ways. There's some significant writing problems (English is not his first language). Dead fic.\\
I haven't read them but I know there's a number of Dresden Files crossovers with good reputations, that are supposed to involve dark or at the very least semi-dark Harrys:

linkffn(11188292) - Harry raised by 'Lash, updates on a reliable schedule.

linkffn(3473224) - Harry with a Blackened Denarius. Complete with sequels.\\
oh wait I did read this one, it's awesome:

linkffn(7779108) - HP dies and as MoD his next great adventure is interrupted by being summoned in to Dresdenverse as... well, spoilers, but read it. Dead fic.
