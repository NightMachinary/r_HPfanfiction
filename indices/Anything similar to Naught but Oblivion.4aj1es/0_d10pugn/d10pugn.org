  Lord Voldemort sneered at the thought of a mere child being the cause of his downfall once again. No wizard could defeat him, for he was immortal; he was a god! Unfortunately for him, Harry Potter was not a wizard. He was an alien, a son of Krypton, and if one of them was a god, it was him. Voldemort was right about one thing though: a mortal stood no chance against a god. ONESHOT.
