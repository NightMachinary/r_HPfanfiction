Badass secret agent Ron centric. Here's one of my favorite scenes:

  Ron leaned out of the open door and peered down and ahead. "We're about..." He mentally calculated the distance relative to his current size. "...one yard out and two yards up."

  "Alright!" Luna whispered, though her voice was far too loud for Ron's peace of mind.

  The helicopter started to slowly move ahead.

  "Half a yard... one foot. Stop!" Ron called out. "Start descending."

  "Alright!"

  He saw the roof grow closer as the helicopter lost altitude. At around one foot, he called out "Stop!"

  "Copy!" Luna replied, and the helicopter stopped its movement, hovering in the air. Ron kicked the string they had spooled up out of the door, then attached his harness to it. "Ready?" he asked, glancing over his shoulder at Harry on the other side.

  "Yes," his friend replied.

  "Going down!" Ron announced, then climbed out and rappelled down, Harry doing the same on his side.

  They hit the roof almost simultaneously, then went to its edge and fastened more string to the roof rail there. By the time they were set for the next step, the helicopter had already left and headed back to Luna. And, after checking for spiders or other dangerous creatures hiding beneath the rail, they started climbing down. Towards the infrared-sensor.
