"Before I Knew" and "This Is Where" are slice-of-life companion stories which both look at Harry's school years as seen from the POV of his Gryffindor year-mates. "Before I Knew" centers on Dean and Seamus, while "This is Where" centers on Lavender and Parvati.

Keep in mind, both stories eventually end up as slash (femmeslash in the case of the Lavender/Parvati one), but it's not graphic and characterisations are excellent, and I'd say the stories are worth reading because they have some of the best, mosth three-dimensional and sympathetic presentations of these four characters I've ever seen in a fanfic.

The writer really captures the feel of growing up and struggling with the idea that you might be attracted to people your own sex.
