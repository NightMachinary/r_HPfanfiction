"To Know You Is To Love You" is about Ron and Hermione going through a somewhat unorthodox couple's counselling, in which they both get to intimately examine each other's lives, from their early childhoods and through their Hogwarts years, the war with Voldemort and beyond. Features excellent characterisation and development for both Ron and Hermione, but keep in mind there are some sexy parts here...

"Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind" sees Harry, Ron and Hermione as amnesiacs; after the last battle with Voldemort they've all forgotten anything and everything tied to their magical lives, including each other. Fic sort of focuses on all three of them, but Ron ends up as the main character in the later parts of the story. Technical writing isn't the best, but Ron is GREAT in this story.
