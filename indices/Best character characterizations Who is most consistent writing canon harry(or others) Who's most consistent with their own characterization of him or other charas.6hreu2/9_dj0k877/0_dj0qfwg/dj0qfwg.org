linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love) Luna and Snape friendship fic. Canon compliant with very good characterizations of both Snape and Luna.

Prince of the dark kingdom also has great AU characterization of Luna. She is not really canon other than her personality, but she is this awesome werewolf shaman girl with very distinct and unique characterization.
