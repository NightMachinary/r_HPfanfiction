/I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love/, linkffn(11923164) This one doubles as a good Luna fic too. Strictly a friendship fic, very much in line with canon. Somehow manages to have fairly in-character Snape, Luna, and Harry, which is an accomplishment. Read it thanks to seeing a recommend in this sub.

/A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles/, linkffn(7937889), is a Snape-centered fic that details his life. I'm currently reading this one and haven't finished it yet, but the characterization is pretty decent. It's generally from his POV, so he doesn't exactly see Harry & co. kindly -- not bashing, just his own warped lens with which he sees the world. There is some downplaying of a few traits/motivations, but it never really seems to go into full-on whitewashing. There was also one thing that rang very, very false for me, [[/spoiler][namely Snape being physically abusive towards Lily, wtf]], but other than that, it's been one of the better characterizations of Snape that I've read.

That second fic was also from a recommend in this sub.
