This is an interesting fem!Snape piece.

linkao3(Train Song by masterofesoterica)

One of the very few mentor Snapes that I could stomach.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within by Theowyn of HPG)

I like the sequel better, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chained Souls by Theowyn of HPG)

Warning. This is slash but you can skip the last part to still get a great character study of Snape.
