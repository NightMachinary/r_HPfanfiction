This one gets recommended here occasionally, but the characterization is too good to leave it out. /Applied Cultural Anthropology/ features an academically-inclined Slytherin!Hermione who isn't an all-knowing super genius. She actually works for her success. Also no romance -- Snape's listed as a main character because he's something of a mentor. linkffn(9238861)
