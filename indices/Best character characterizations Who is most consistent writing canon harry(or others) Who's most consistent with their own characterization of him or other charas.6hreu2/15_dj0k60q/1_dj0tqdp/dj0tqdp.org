"Reign of the Serpent" is extremely AU, to the point where the wizarding world is a totally different place, but it has a BRILLIANT Hermione. Thanks to being in a much worse situation, in a harsher and more warlike society, she's got a few different priorities, is a little more paranoid, a little less idealistic, and has a much harder ttime trusting or befriending anyone... but she's still the same overachieving, hard-working, bossy know-it-all that we know and love.

Fic's got good roles for Harry, Ron and Neville as well... and even Dean Thomas and Justin Finch-Fletchley.
