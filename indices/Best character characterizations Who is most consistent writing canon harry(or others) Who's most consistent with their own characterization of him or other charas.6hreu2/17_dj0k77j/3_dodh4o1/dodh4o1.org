I personally was a bit disappointed with how Voldemort seemed so black-and-white in the later books. From what we know he was a brillant student, but as Voldemort he made so many stupid mistakes... A lot of it can be explained as him going mad because of the horcruxes and all, but since I love him as a character I enjoy reading about a more "sane" Voldemort - still a psychopath, murderous saddest, but an intelligent one. So some stories by Lady Miya (AO3) are really interesting to me. It's not everybody's cup of tea, but I love seeing him portrayed as a genius, manipulative, evil guy who can still feel emotions - just uses them. Especially in Hermione pairings, when she grows as an equaly intelligent and manipulative person, they can complement each other really well. Shared Flame by Lady Miya is my absolute favorite for this reason.
