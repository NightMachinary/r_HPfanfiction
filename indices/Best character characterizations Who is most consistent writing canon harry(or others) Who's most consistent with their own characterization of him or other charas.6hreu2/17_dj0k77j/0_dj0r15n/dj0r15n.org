One of my favorite Riddle fics, /insurgere/, is an AU one-shot, but it exemplifies the danger of Tom Riddle as a genius, rather than Tom Riddle as Lord Voldemort, if that makes any sense. And best of all, it doesn't fall prey to the /blatantly noticeable psychopath/ Riddle stuff that infests fics depicting his Hogwarts years. linkffn(5846518)

The best Riddle fic, hands down, has to be [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/5761261/1][/Little Differences/]], which seems to have been deleted from FFN, unfortunately.
