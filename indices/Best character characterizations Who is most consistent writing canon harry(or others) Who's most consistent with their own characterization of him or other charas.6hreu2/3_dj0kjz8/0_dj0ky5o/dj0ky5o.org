A) I am incredibly impressed by the work you put into this post.

B) The best characterization of two utterly minor and nearly non-existent characters from canon are Sturgis Podmore and Mulciber in linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress). They have their own goals they are working towards, interesting dynamics with other characters and they feel like an ogre (which, as you should know from Shrek, ogres have layers).
