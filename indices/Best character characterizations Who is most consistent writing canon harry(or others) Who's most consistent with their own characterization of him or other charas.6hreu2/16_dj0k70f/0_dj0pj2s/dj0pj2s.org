After Voldemort's fall, Draco is forced to live without magic, for five years. As he runs, both from Wizarding society and his past, Draco must survive in the Muggle world. I particularly like Draco's characterization in this fic because it's very slow and gradual. He doesn't suddenly stop becoming prejudiced overnight, it's a process that takes lots of time (with more than a few steps backwards).
