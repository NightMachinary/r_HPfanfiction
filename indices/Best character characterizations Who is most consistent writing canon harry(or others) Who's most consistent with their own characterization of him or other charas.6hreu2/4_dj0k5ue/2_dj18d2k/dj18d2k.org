Nonjon writes a very consistent Harry (in each fiction), who is definitly almost always "chaotic good".

In most cases he's witty, powerful (and knows how to use his power and his limits), not afraid, and faces problems head on - with not really being angsty or whiny.

He really crafted his own Harry and writes him really well.

While his Harry does come closer to canon Harry than most I think nonjon deliberately changes his Harry a bit - but he does so consistently.
