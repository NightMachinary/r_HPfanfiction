Yes, his humor is certainly different, and often he is a jerk, I agree. I enjoy the stories even with that, but I can totally see why it could put someone off.

However, in nonjon's stories he still (mostly) does the right thing because it is the right thing, and just pretends he does so because fun (which gets mostly more obvious towards the end when he has difficult decisions to make).

And that part to me is the core of canon!Harry: He tries to be as good as possible.

Also, while Harry is often a jerk, he very obviously tries to avoid harming people who didn't earn it, and even then he isn't particularly cruel.\\
This is a better characterization than in any Lord Potter or indy!Harry story, where he is hurtful and cruel, which doesn't fit Harry at all imo.

All of this makes him kind of similar to canon which is wby I wrote it - and certainly within the story nonjon's Harry is consistent.
