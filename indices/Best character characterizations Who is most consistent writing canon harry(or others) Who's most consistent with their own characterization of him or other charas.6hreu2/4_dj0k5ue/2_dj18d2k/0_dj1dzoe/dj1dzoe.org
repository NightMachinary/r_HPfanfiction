I have tried to read a few nonjon stories since so many people seem to love them, but I could never get into them and I really dislike Harry's character. I may just not be remembering correctly since I only read a few chapters of some, but Harry in his fics doesn't seem close to canon Harry at all. From what I remember, he has this kind of assholeish behavior sometimes, a lot of the humour is so vulgar and sex based and his character seems completely different.
