I feel like this one is hard since there are so many different characterizations of him that I get seriously confused as to what is actually canon and what is not. My suggestions are not exactly canon, but generally very consistent with in their own AU's.

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) I really like Harry's character in this one. He is such a good mix of sassy, sarcastic, rebellious, not overpowered, just a teenager with a heart of gold trying to get by and do what he feels is right. I like how kind he is and how he still has a thing for saving people.

linkffn(The never-ending road) Fem!Harry fic that I feel really stays true to Harry's character if Harry was born a girl. Harry has that sassy humour thing going to deal with problems, often talks back to authority figures and often goes off to do things on her own, but also wants to trust adults around her such as Dumbledore and Sirius. Has a sweet friendship going with Hermione.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) Very AU Harry character, but very consistent with the slow influence of Tom Riddle Horcrux in his head.
