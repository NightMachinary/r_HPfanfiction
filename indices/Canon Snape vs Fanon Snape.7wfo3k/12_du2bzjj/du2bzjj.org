One thing in my head cannon that I always thought of was this. In cannon his hair is greasy, which to me wasn't because of fumes of options but some sort of protective conditioner in his hair. Both to keep his hair from falling into and ruining a potion, and because his work matters more than his appearance. Like a doctor smelling heavily of disinfectant all the time. It's not great but it is important. I always figured Slughorn had hair like that too, but shorter and slicked back. Maybe it doesn't smell bad but it doesn't smell good.

Fannon Shape is hilarious to me when I'm in the mood to read it. The the "silky hair" always threw me off of it ever came up though. The only other thing that threw me off was his thing for Lily not being creepy. Because it is. Like really creepy man. I don't care how you dress it up, having a woman's husband and child killed in exchange for her life. Is terrible no matter what your past relationship. What I do like about Fannon Snape is fan Snape can be aware of how creepy it is and be self loathing about it and try to do some good.

Which is where Movie Snape is worse, than Book or Fan Snape. "...Always."

Fuck That Noise. Sorry for swearing
