  ETA: People, please stop mass-commenting and faving this old doodle. I have far more complex works in my gallery sitting nigh-on ignored, while this gets plastered with the same umpteen-times-repeated questions and whatsits all over again. I'm not even following this fandom any more. If you'd like to extend the courtesy of giving actual feedback, then please consider writing something constructive, say, beneath one of those drawings that has eaten up 30h or much more.

  Thank you.
