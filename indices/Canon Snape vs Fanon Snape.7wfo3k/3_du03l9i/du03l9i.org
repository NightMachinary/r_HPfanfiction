That's the reason I don't understand any ship with Snape. The guy was ugly and had bad hygiene. He spends most of his time surrounded by, let's be honest here, absolutely disgusting stuff like animal guts, ground beetles and Flobberworm slime. Unless he goes through a Sci-Fi level decon for hostile environments twice a day, his /odour/ will make 95% of all people puke before the clothes, which will reek at a similar level, are even off. And that is not even taking his absolutely toxic personality and disturbing obsession for Lily Evans into account.
