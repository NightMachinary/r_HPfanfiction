I actually have fun with him for this reason, in my never-to-be-published terribad fics. He's just so awful, you end up playing the game 'what would have to happen to cause...' Well, you probably don't, but I do.

Generally though, he's greasy, narcissistic and misanthropic and even his few likeable qualities are covered in a layer of Snape being, well, Snape.

There's always time travel, a mentor and lots of therapy though.

BTW you brought up some excellent description there that I am going to let influence me the next time he appears in a fic. It's not plagiarism, it's 'homage'.
