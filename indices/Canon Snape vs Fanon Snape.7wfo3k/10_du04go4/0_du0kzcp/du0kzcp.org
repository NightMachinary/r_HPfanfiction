This is true. I don't know why you got downvoted. Snape absolutely does not have a goatee. This comic has also been posted before where the consensus was that the actual canon Snape was somewhere in between these two comical extremes. I personally see him looking like [[https://vizen.deviantart.com/art/Harry-Christmas-Snape-106746993][this]] or [[https://vizen.deviantart.com/art/The-Light-in-the-Darkness-493683043][this]].
