Maybe I've read the books too many times, but I would say this is too easy:

Amphibians/reptiles: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

Harry Potter characters: 3, 5, 7, 9,

I read the answers after and see that #10, Trimeresurus Salazar, is listed as "both" because the Salazar part was from HP, but honestly, most of the animal names here include the name of the scientist that first studied them, and Salazar is a common enough name in Europe and Latin America. It's rather cheeky to say, "this reptile partially named for a Harry Potter character counts as a Harry Potter character".
