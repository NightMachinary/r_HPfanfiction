linkffn(13391615) has Harry as a dinosaur animagus. Though if I recall correctly, that's not a particularly major plot point.

I also know I read a story where Luna steals a dinosaur bone from a museum to use in the animagus process to get a dinosaur form. But I don't remember what story it was, and I'm pretty sure it ended, was abandoned, or I stopped reading before she ever did anything with that form.
