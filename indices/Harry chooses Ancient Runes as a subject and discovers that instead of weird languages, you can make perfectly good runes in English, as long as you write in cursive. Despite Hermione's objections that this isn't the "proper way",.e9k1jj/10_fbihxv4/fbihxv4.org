Hey! Done with my story, it only wound up being about 30,000 words it all. Hasn't been beta'd but still overall alright. Currently releasing a chapter a day, each is around 3k words. Your prompt was the one that inspired me to get to writing. I admit it is not my best work but it is alright. Enjoy!
