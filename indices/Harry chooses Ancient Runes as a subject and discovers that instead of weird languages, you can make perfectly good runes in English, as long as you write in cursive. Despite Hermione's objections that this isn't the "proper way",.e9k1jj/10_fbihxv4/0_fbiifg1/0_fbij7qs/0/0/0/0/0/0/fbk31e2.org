Haha, I was wondering if anyone would catch that. Totally had an old AD&D loot table up for it. Drew inspiration from there and Eragon, the whole Names thing they had in the book.

Yep the items are a bit min-maxed as they are Runes. Which is the most op broken thing ever. Even the most neutered rune fic I have read allows for OP-ness fairly easily. Fan made magic rune are essentially a physical way to tinker with the base code of the universe.

They are the actual coding of existence in physical form. We may be using the equivalent of Bubba Ray's School of Learning Computers Good coding it's still there!

That's why my fan au has no runes, I just cannot see a way to not break the universe with them.

Glad you enjoyed the story so far! It gets interesting to say the least.
