  My thought is the magic unravels as time goes on. So a quick note might last a few hours, while a signature at the end of a thesis submitted for a Mastery may last months. Blood quills use the medium of blood to hold the magic in place, thus the signature doesn't fade.

This works very well! Especially blood quills using blood itself to preserve the magic.

I'm hoping to enjoy not only how Harry totally exploits this power but also the banter between an ecstatic/smug Harry and an irritated Hermione because of her desire to "do things the 'right way' according to rules in the book".

Going to read Chapter 2!
