I didn't get that actually, the story grew past the point where he could have that discussion with her sadly. The next similar length one I am working on right now is filled with that though.

It's based on Harry figuring out that Arresto Momentum is the single most broken spell he can think of. His entire third year made easier as he twists the spell beyond recognition and she gets upset as that's not possible according to the books.

Turns into a space adventure eventually, expanding on the short story I wrote about it.
