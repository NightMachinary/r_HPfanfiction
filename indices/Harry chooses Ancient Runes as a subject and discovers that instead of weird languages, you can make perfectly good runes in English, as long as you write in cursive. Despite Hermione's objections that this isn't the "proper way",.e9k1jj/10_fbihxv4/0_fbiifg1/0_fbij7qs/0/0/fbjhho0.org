Thanks for the comments. Giving it more detail would be good you're correct. I also need to get a beta some time, hope it's not that bad.

I'll be honest the story is rough around the edges. The injecting parts of their magic is something I have been wondering about. There are lots of things in this story that I touch on that are part of another world.

I have a fairly large FanAU file and took inspiration from parts of it. My thought is the magic unravels as time goes on. So a quick note might last a few hours, while a signature at the end of a thesis submitted for a Mastery may last months. Blood quills use the medium of blood to hold the magic in place, thus the signature doesn't fade.

I appreciate your reply and will try to punch up the scenes a bit today before posting the next chapter.

All Crouch Jr did was assign them a parchment due a day prior. He may not know the mechanics fully but Voldemort could likely know a bit more this giving the instructions.
