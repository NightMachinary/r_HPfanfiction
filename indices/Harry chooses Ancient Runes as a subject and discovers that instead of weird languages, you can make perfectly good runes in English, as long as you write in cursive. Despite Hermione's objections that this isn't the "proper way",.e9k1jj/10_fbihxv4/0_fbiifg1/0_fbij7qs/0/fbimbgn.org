Your story EXCITES me!

There are a couple of typos (which will be picked up by a beta). And some of the dialog would sound a little more "active" with some action in between the spoken sentences.

e.g.

--------------

"Madam Pince? I have a question for you if you would not mind." *He waited as she closed the thick tome in her hands and turned her gaze to him.* "How do the book holding alcoves work when you sign your name? I am trying to figure out how my name worked from the Goblet, I swear I didn't enter it but I still have to compete. I want to know how it works." *Realizing that he was rambling, he paused for a breath and continued.* "The register will give me a good idea on how it works. Please!" *he pleaded.*

--------------

And another one:

--------------

"These books are not to be taken from the restricted section. You are not to share them with anyone, and you are to keep any secrets of the library secret." *She leaned forward and her already steely voice became downright deadly.* "Champion or not I will bring my full wrath down on you should the library be compromised. You will return this note to my desk or I will ban you from the library for the rest of your time here."

--------------

I think Hermione's dialog is fine without breaks because her tendency to ramble and speak quickly is being implied anyway.

The idea that wizards unconsciously inject a tiny bit of their magic whenever they write anything could open a lot of potential plot holes but I think your idea of metal tipped quills takes care of most of them. A witch could use those to write anonymous letters that wouldn't be traced back to her.

The build up of Harry's internal thoughts near the end of the chapter is fantastic, especially the reveal with the mirror. It's a thrilling end to a chapter, without being an obvious cliffhanger, and makes me really excited to read the next one!
