People downvote like all the gay pairing though? It's just a trend I've observed. Personally I have the opposite of a problem for that sort of thing :P

Regardless, there's a context for every ship so it really depends on how the author spins thing. Ron is a self deserving bastard who only cares about himself or he's a loyal friend who suffers from self doubt. He's an abuser or he's abused. That's one of the best things about this fandom, you know, the fact that every story is a familiar setting with a new take on the somewhat flat cannon characters.
