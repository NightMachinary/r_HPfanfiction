Its because most of the gay pairings are like that. With het pairings, you get relatively normal couples - close in age, vaguely similar mental structure, common intrests, etc.

With the most popular gay pairings, you get "Harry and fucking voldemort" or "Harry and goddamn snape" or "Harry and the literal bastard Draco" The last one is somewhat good if its done correctly, I admit. But two of the popular gay pairings are straight up pedophilic and its not alright. There's tons of interesting male characters you could pair harry with that would give a supremely interesting story! Seamus, for instance. Neville. Ron. Blaise, as the "DG blank slate" character. Just not Snake Satan, some dude as old as your dad, or someone who calls random people the wizard N-word out in the open!
