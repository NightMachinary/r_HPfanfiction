I know most people abandon it, but most of the time it's for a weird mix of script and cursive (at least for most people I know so second year uni) so cursive is by no means an illegible mystery to them. And most importantly, at 10 they still use it and then they go to a school where they're forced to use quills, with which it's almost impossible to write in script. So Hogwarts students would definitely write in cursive.
