  Plus in the UK most children learn to write in cursive first
#+end_quote

This isn't the case in my experience. I learned to print first and didn't learn cursive until I was about 7yo. That was in NW England in the 70s though. My sister's kids also learned to print first though, and they're from Scotland in the 0's.
