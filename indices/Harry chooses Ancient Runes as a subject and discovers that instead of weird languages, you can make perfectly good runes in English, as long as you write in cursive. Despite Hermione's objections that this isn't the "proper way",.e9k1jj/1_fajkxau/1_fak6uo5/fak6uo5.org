In Germany, where I went to school as a wee lad, we all learned cursive script (not sure if it was the "Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift" ("simplified basic [cursive] script") or the "Schulausgangsschrift" ("basic [cursive] school script"), though) where I went to grade school and we even had to use these fucking fountain pens (ballpoint pens were /verboten/ until, IIRC, fifth grade). I still use that script most of the time when I use a pen, but my handwriting is atrocious, tbh (as if a pigeon had diarrhea and shat on the page ðŸ˜…).
