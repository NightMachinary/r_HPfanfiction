I don't know about other countries in the past or today. I know that in the modern-day USA, in most states and school districts cursive writing has been de-emphasized significantly, and students are not being taught to competence.

However, it is important to know that the USA has no centralized educational system, really, and this is all /very/ individual based on where your school is.

At any rate, my comment was simply to let you know that you might call "cursive writing" by some other name.
