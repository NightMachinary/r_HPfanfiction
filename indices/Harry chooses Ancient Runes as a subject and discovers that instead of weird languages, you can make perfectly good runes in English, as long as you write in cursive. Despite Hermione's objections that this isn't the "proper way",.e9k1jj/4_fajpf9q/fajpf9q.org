This has already been written. It was a fic called the Runemaster - one of my favourite FanFictions ever. Unfortunately the author deleted it. There are some reposts online that you can find though. Harry didn't necessarily write in cursive but had this weird affinity to runes. He ended up outshining everyone with knowledge alone :)
