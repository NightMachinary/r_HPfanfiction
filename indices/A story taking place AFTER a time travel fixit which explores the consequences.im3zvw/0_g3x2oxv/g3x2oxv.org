  How is Hermione going to fix this world's problems when everyone she knows is different?

Time travel again and again until she gets things right...^{^{/s}}

In all seriousness, this Hermione is in her 30s, a war veteran and, well, she's Hermione (so tons of random knowledge and research). Screw future knowledge, short of Dumbledore she should be able to match anyone and therefore she'd be a prime target for Slughorn to collect (since she dealt with the Death Eaters, Snape is dead at best or a random potioneer at worst). Slughorn gives her the connections she'd need (and as an adult she'd understand this) to reach high places and the ideology you chose (Muggle dominance) should be quite easy to stop with a campaign or two about becoming what they fought against in the 40s since that was Grindelwald's cause. And she should be able to get this moving under an alias even before she graduates, worst case like Harry in Poison Pen.
