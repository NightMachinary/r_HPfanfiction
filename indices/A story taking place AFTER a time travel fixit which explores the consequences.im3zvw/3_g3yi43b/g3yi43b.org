Always wondered about a followup to Wind Shear. Imagine Cygnus Black dealing with his son-in-laws. A blood traitor, a mudblood and a halfblood. He likes the mudblood the best, he's the only one that shows the proper respect.

Meanwhile Nymphadora Black has the elder Blacks wrapped her fingers. Harry's kids go to Hogwarts with his half-siblings and become friends with Ron and Hermione et al. And he's a paranoid wreck, "Don't go to the restroom alone, there's trolls!" "Sure, dad. Whatever."
