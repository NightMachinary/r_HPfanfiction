We shouldn't police stuff, regardless of our own opinions on whether it's fucked up or not - literature as a medium is one of the only ones that isn't heavily censored, and as a result has both the good and the bad that that entails, i.e. disturbing or otherwise morally questionable content.

If the choice is between none of that but actually vetting things like fanfiction, and just letting it be a free-for-all and letting the chips fall wherever, I'm inclined to support the latter.

I just tend to turn off of stories that include sexual content I find objectionable - Twincest is a resolute no for me, as I'm a twin myself and it offends me more deeply than other stuff. Honestly, most depictions of twins (mental-twin-speak and shit like that) in fanfiction make me /very/ angry.

That said, you're entitled to your own opinions, but likewise so is everyone else - if you want to avoid content like you've described, the far easier and in my opinion more generally right thing to do is just pay attention to what you read yourself, and turn away from things you might find offensive, rather than make a concerted effort as a community to purge certain points-of-view.
