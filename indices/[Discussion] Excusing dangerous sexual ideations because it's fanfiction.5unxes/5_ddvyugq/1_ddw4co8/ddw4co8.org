But then I look at actual pedophile cases and so many of the perpetrators start small; increasingly with roots in fandom as was seen in a recent furry sex abuse case, as with multiple abusive fandom members being given power because of the content they write like in the final fantasy house etc.\\
My entire being is adamant that this is not harmless and that it can be incredibly insidious, fueling fantasies and material for the fantasies of future abusers.\\
There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. I wouldn't for example condemn the book Flowers in the Attic for it's depiction of rape, incest, and underage sex. It had it's place, it meant something. I understand the cathartic release it can give victims of these acts and that it's important to express these realities in all forms of media, so of course I don't think you can blindly say that because it has that content that it's evil or detrimental. I think everything, in every aspect of life, should be taken on a case by case basis.
