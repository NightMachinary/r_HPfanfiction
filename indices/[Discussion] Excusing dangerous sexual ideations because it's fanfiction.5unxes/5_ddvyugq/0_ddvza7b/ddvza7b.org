Disclaimer: I work in the games industry.

Correlation is not causation. There is a known (and arguably higher) correlation between violence and other social factors--mental health status, income level, family involvement. And as I replied to another commenter above, many violent video games (or at least, the largest ones--MOBAs, shooters, MMOs alike) attempt to incentivise using them as an outlet for violent behaviour rather than RL, through competitive play, encouraging teamwork, obvious victory conditions, and rewards both tangible and emotional. Their intent is obviously not to prevent RL violence, but to encourage players to keep playing, but it does have some of the same results.
