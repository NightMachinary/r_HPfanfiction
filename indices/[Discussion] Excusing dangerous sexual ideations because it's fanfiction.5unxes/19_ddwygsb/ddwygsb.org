I'm quite ok with all manners of stuff existing, but I think stories with morally/ethically questionable content could be handled better.

First, while many stories already have proper tags, I think that all stories should be tagged properly. For example, I don't want to read about the Dursleys sexually abusing Harry. If it's necessary for someone's story, fine, but I'd rather not be surprised by that.

Second, I think stories/chapters that are intentionally depicting unhealthy/abusive/whatever relationships should come with a note, stating that while it's perfectly fine to read/fantasize about that pairing or act, it's not a portrayal of a healthy relationship between two consenting adults. Many readers won't need that reminder, but others do.
