  On the other hand, however, I can't get away from the fact that there's quite a lot of rape in published fiction (off the top of my head: "Girl Who Played With Fire, *The Windup Girl, Pillars of the Earth, pretty much every Neal Stephenson I've read, Deerskin, "Beloved, *Go Ask Alice, some 80s romance novels, etc.) and in terms of sexual exploitation of children you can definitely add Brave New World to the obvious Lolita (for general teenage sex shenanigans there're whole "young adult"/"new adult" genres).

If a book is read in an educational setting, talking about problematic stuff should be part of the discussion. Quite a few of the books you mentioned have been extensively discussed and talked about, so both tagging and warnings about their content exist in some form.

  To your second point, I think things start getting a bit fuzzier with the "captured by deatheaters"/"soulbonded" tropes and worse in situations like the Twilight series (where people seem to be split along a stalking/"true love" divide). I appreciate it when people warn when a relationship/character is awful but I believe people can have very different ideas about what a healthy relationship looks like so enforcing a warning would be difficult.

This is why I said "intentionally depicting". There's some authors that set out to write about an awful relationship (e.g. Nabokov with Lolita) and there's authors that write just what they think is romantic (e.g. Meyer with Twilight - this is just an assumption, but I'm sure there is a book where this is true). I still think that Twilight's love story is problematic, but it probably wasn't written with the intention of exploring flawed characters and a broken relationship. Instead, it was written as a teen romance, suggesting that the behaviour is romantic, not abusive. Technically both would need a warning, but it's absurd to ask for one if the author doesn't view their own work as showing an abusive relationship.

By the way, if you want to ping [[/u/narwahlnel]], you need a space after the username.
