I definitely agree with tagging (or making a note that the author isn't going to tag b/c spoilers but bad things do happen, PM for details etc.).

On the other hand, however, I can't get away from the fact that there's quite a lot of rape in published fiction (off the top of my head: "Girl Who Played With Fire/, *The Windup Girl/, /Pillars of the Earth/, pretty much every Neal Stephenson I've read, /Deerskin/, "Beloved/, *Go Ask Alice/, some 80s romance novels, etc.) and in terms of sexual exploitation of children you can definitely add /Brave New World/ to the obvious /Lolita/ (for general teenage sex shenanigans there're whole "young adult"/"new adult" genres).

To your second point, I think things start getting a bit fuzzier with the "captured by deatheaters"/"soulbonded" tropes and worse in situations like the /Twilight/ series (where people seem to be split along a stalking/"true love" divide). I appreciate it when people warn when a relationship/character is awful but I believe people can have very different ideas about what a healthy relationship looks like so enforcing a warning would be difficult.

Question for you [[/u/narwhalnel--how][u/narwhalnel--how]] do you feel about fic where Snape is having sex with young Hermione and then surprise! Hermione wakes up from one of Fred and George's patented day dream charms? Or Fred and George are having sex, but it's really Lee and George is delusional/roleplaying? If all the stories you find objectional ended with "And then <character> woke up and went down to the Great Hall for kippers with the sense that they just had a really strange dream" would that make things better?

I'm glad that ao3 hosts everything and I say this as someone who never wants to glimpse another A/B/O fic again ever. A "scientific " study of a question on which you have a firm moral opinion leads to fun things like the Eugenics movement and the whole question feels a little like newspeak. Website hosts can decide what they want to allow, but the idea that we should police a community (that we have no authority over and no evidence of wrong doing) for nebulous immoralities seems odd(?) to me.
