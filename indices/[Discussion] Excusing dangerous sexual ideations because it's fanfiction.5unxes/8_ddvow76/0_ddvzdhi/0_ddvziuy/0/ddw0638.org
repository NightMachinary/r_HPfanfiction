If it was on AO3, it's against archive policy to remove the works. They were founded with 'a policy of maximum inclusiveness,' and they deliberately state in their FAQ 'We will not remove content from the Archive because it contains explicit material, as long as it doesn't violate any other part of the content policy (e.g., the harassment policy).' They have a Warning tag for Underage, but there is an option for 'Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings' and so works may not be labelled; that's author choice.
