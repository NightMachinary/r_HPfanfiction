You can request it of the author. If it's an Archive Warning-level tag, and the author has used other Archive Warning-level tags (for example, they've Warned for Major Character Death but not Rape/Noncon and both are present in the fic) then you can report it, which goes to the Abuse Team, and the fic will probably be stripped of /all/ of its Archive Warnings and be labelled Author Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings.

But you can't force a tag onto a fic that the author doesn't choose to use.
