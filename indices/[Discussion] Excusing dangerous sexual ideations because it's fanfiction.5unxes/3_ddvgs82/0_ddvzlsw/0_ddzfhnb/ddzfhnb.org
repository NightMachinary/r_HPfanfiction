Right. This has sparked some great discussion, but too often people are rushing to declare that censorship is bad. Which it is.

I'm with you that the solution is harsher labels or more sites commenting on and recommending stories. Just because its hard to envision how this sort of self-policing/self-reflection should be set-up doesn't mean its not worth discussing.
