People also have to understand the time period all of this is in, Harry Potter is set in a time where no one was really homosexual, no one really practiced adultery, and in the rare cases where it did happen it was almost immediately stamped out. The involvement of these 'kinks' in the magical world is definitely disturbing.

Edit: Le downvotes for having an opinion. Tolerant Leftist Potteheads are tolerant. lmao.
