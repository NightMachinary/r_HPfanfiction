No one was /really/ homosexual. As in, coming out was a lot less frequent and a lot less common. In a country as big as America and as accepting as America, we only have 4% of the total population identifying LGBT, I would assume in a less accepting time and environment like 1990's Britain, the number would be significantly lower.
