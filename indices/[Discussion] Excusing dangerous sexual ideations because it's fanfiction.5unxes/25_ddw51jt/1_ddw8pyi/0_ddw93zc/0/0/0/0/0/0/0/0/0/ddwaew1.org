That's what makes Fan Fiction so wonderful. In the books Harry never became Lord Potter/Slytherin/etc but in fan fiction he can. In the books Harry never got with Hermione, Daphne Greengrass, Tonks, Luna, etc but in fan fiction he can. Harry never saved his parents or anyone else that died by going back in time but in fan fiction he can. Do you get it? *ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN FAN FICTION!*

Also Dumbledore was gay.
