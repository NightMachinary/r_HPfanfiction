Like I said, in a time where it's more accepted like 2016 a total of 4% of the populace has come out at LGBT. It's highly unlikely that the UK would have a high enough contingency for the main character of a novel to be gay. I'm not saying that no one at Hogwarts can be gay, I'm saying that Harry is not gay and it's highly unlikely for him to just turn around and say that he is.
