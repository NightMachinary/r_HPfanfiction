Dumbledore was said to be gay by JK Rowling who was trying to further her liberal agenda at the time. There was no evidence to it other than the author's psudeo-character development in interviews.

The way we make Harry get with Hermione, Daphne Greengrass, Tonks, Luna, etc... is by changing circumstance, is by changing the character Harry is. It's highly likely that Harry would just turn around and say "I don't have time for relationships as I'm more likely to die in this war than not." But naturally, JKR has to further her agenda, and he has to pay more attention to Ginny than he does to training for his upcoming fight with the big-bad. Anything can happen in fanfiction, but if it happens without reason and with no explanation, then it's very badly written. Simply as that.
