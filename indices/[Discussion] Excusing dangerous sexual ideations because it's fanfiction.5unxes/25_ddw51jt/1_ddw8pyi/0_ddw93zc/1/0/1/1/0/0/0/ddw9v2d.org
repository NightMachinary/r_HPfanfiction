For one, the word you meant is "bait", not "bate". Spell check is your friend.

You said, and I quote "Elton John is Elton John, he is famous and he has a platform. I doubt any fans of his really cared of his sexual preference. *I mean Adultery as in a younger female student having a relationship with an older male teacher.*"

I then informed you that you were incorrect as Adultery is between someone married and someone not married. Nowhere in that quote did you mention Arthur Weasley or Hermione Granger so how was I supposed to know that was what you meant? I don't read minds.
