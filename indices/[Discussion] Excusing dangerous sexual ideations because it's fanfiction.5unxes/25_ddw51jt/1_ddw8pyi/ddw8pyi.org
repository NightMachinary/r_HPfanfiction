Refuting your points in order, just sticking to well-known British people of the era:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John#Sexuality_and_family][No one was really homosexual: Elton John came out as gay in 1988, and started dating his now-husband in 1993.]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall#Relationship_with_the_Prince_of_Wales][No one really practised adultery: Prince Charles and Camilla, now Duchess of Cornwall, were known to lovers in 1980, and likely all through Charles' marriage to Princess Diana.]]

That didn't make these things not scandalous, but in order for something to be a scandal, it has to exist.
