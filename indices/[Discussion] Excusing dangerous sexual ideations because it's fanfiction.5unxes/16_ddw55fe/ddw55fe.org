I feel that if you don't like something don't read it. I don't like reality TV shows. Does that mean I want them all cancelled? No, because I'm not an asshole who wants everyone to believe what I believe.

I don't care much for slash fics. Have I read and enjoyed a couple? Yes I have, but it seems the vast majority of fics that I've skimmed are poorly done attempts at explaining/having a gay character.

If you think this is the "worst" the internet has to offer...you're seriously mistaken. At abolutely worst, it's a wank story about fictional characters doing sexual things to other fictional characters. They don't exist in real life. They're not real, just as the people you kill in video games don't exist either. Now if it was a wank fic about Emma getting tag teamed by Rupert and Daniel, complete with 'shopped pics of them getting it on, yeah the creep factor would be /much/ higher, but that's not the point. As it is, most wank fics are poorly written examples of how /not/ to have sex, just like regular porn movies.
