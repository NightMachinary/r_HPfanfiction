I think doing what you want is far, far more dangerous. Do you really think encouraging mob rule will stop at what you think is disgusting and illegal?

Take incest. In the majority of the western world and half of the USA, first cousins having sex with each other is not seen as incest and perfectly legal. Yet people regularly complain about incest if a story here features that. Which rule should be followed?

Take underage sex (for non-explicit stories, not smut). Which is the age of consent? 14? 15? 16? 17? 18? The majority of Europe has an age of consent of 14 to 16, for example. The United Kingdom's age of consent is 16, for example. And in Wizarding Britain, you're an adult with 17, so that's the bare minimum for age of consent - it may be lower.

What about people who find witchcraft evil and disturbing?
