When I lived in indiana I knew a girl (she's 10ish years younger than me but still a legal adult) who's step father is her mother's first cousin. They had to get married in Tennessee I believe. They're not having any kids and it was surprising when I found out about it but honestly it didn't bother me at all. What two consenting adults do in their own home is none of my damn business.
