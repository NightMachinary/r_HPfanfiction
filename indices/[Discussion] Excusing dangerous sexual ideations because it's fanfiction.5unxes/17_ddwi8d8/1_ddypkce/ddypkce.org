My ao3 experience drastically improved when I realized that you can type "-m/m" (or "-f/f" if that's what you're avoiding) in the search within results box to eliminate most multi fics that contain slash. I personally don't mind slash, but I often have your problem where a pairing I want to read is tagged even though it's a very minor part of the story.
