Yeah, but that also removes the stories where its minor or not the main pairing. Which I don't mind. Believe me, I've tried it with the MCU and suddenly there are no stories that involve Tony and basically anyone.Â¨ But adding "-Tony Stark/Steve Rogers" at least removes one of the biggest slashpairings.
