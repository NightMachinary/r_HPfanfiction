So I won't bother writing an essay about this but just take it as bullet points. A good few of those that have already answered have hit on a lot of my views already.

Sexual content: If characters are at the age of consent in their country/world. Though subtracting two years depending on how low/high it is can be reasonable.(My middle school science teacher pointed out that the early debutants could be as early as that)

Incest: If consensual, sure. As stated, there are places where first cousin incest is legal, even in the west.

Underage: As in a 14-year-old Hermione X Snape, no. Two consenting underage characters? Yes.

But as stated by [[/u/padfootprohibited][u/padfootprohibited]] when one posts on AO3, tag things correctly! It's a bummer to try and eliminate what you don't want to read, but you still end up with what you don't want to read because as an example:

I don't read slashfiction, sorry, not sorry. That's not my cuppa tea. So I just search for F/M, multi and Gen fics. But as one background pairing is F/M it still shows M/M fics :/

Aggressive tagging can be good, but please show some restraint yeah?
