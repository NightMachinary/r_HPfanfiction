No, we don't have any obligation to self police or rail against "abuses". Cultures, thoughts, and opinions on how things should be vary wildly from person to person, and group to group.

I think that you should censor yourself, rather than try to censor everyone else. If you don't want to read stories containing incest, or other acts which may be offensive to you, then don't. Censoring such content encroaches upon dangerous territory, if the media out there is any indication. Encouraging mob mentality will lead to further problems down the road. Once the "mob" eliminates these kinds of stories from fanfiction, what will they do next? Will they settle down, as their mission would be concluded, or will they mob after another aspect of FF they do not like?

Don't like? Don't read. It is the easiest and most peaceful solution, which will avoid needless confrontation.
