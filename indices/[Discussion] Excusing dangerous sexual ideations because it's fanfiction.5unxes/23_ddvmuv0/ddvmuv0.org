I never read fics that have explicit sex scenes before the age of 18. That's my personal opinion and way to go.

When it comes to the question of when it is appropriate to write sex scenes, we have to remind ourselves of two things:

- Amorality can be part of a story.

- Age of consent is different in different cultures.

I'm honestly not sure where to draw the line between "stuff I find in bad taste, but not bad enough to report" and fics that I report for content that steps over a line. For example, "The Real Us" is one of the stories I reported for overstepping the bounds for being just blatant child pornography.
