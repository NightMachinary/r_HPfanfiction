So, this is a little late, but as the age of consent in the UK, where the books are set, is 16, fics with characters of that age get a pass from me.

I myself live in the UK. Due to this being my normal, I find it pretty interesting when US writers treat 16-year-olds like kids or as immature people, or use characters of that age to write fics with a slightly exploitative edge to them.

Presumably US writers see 16 year olds as children that are starting to have some sexual feelings etc. and so are ripe to be characters in exploitative or 'naughty' stories that push the boundary of acceptable. Whereas, UK residents and writers see 16-year-olds as just about adults because by law that is the case.

It's similar to how in the US you aren't able to drink until 21, and your college is just like an extension of school rather than a completely different thing altogether.
