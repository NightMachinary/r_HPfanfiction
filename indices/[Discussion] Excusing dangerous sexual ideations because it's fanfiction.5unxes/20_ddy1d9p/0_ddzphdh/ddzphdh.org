Yeah 16+ or around there I really don't care so much about what they get up to. They're adults with really bad impulse control in my mind. I've never personally read anything that contains underage sex that would be considered exploitative in published literature though. I mean, I said in another comment, Flowers in the Attic was still published and I don't have a problem with it (other than the scars it left on my 13-y/o psyche). I think context and intent are important, and that you can tell intent through the writing.
