I'm much more tolerant of these things in fanfiction mainly because adults tend not to write underage sex scenes and glorify them. Even if they do, there are still degrees of objectionableness due to differing cultures and laws. To me, two 14-year-olds having sex is not really bad in fanfiction, because that's something teenagers do in real life, and it's something a 14-year-old author might want to write about. In any case, I'm just not interested in reading it.

What adult readers don't always take into account is the age of the author. Underage authors have sexual fantasies of their own, and may not be aware of how adult readers would receive their stories. For them, I think fanfiction is a healthy outlet for sexual expression with privacy. It's a hell of a lot better to write about weird sex than try it IRL without taking proper precautions. It would be wrong to deny them this outlet.

Dangerous territory would involve real people as characters and a predatory nature to the writing. If the author uses their writing as a platform for inciting violence, that is dangerous and should be reported. Likewise, writing that targets a specific person the author knows for bullying. I've never seen anything remotely dangerous in fanfiction, however.
