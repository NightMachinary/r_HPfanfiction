I'm a little late to the party, took my time reading all of the responses first. But I really wanted to put in my own two cents. The problem for me is the amount of grey area here. Things that I consider inappropriate may be (and probably are) vastly different from what you consider inappropriate, and probably changes from person to person. For example, at what age is it appropriate to have two fiction characters form an sexually explicit relationship in a story? To use a common pairing, how about Ron and Hermione in 3rd year? 4th? 5th? Not until they've graduated? I personally don't like anything below 15 years old, but that is actually 4th year for Hermione, and 5th year for Ron. So what about Hermione and one of the older Weasley's, George? George is less than two years older than Hermione, at what age would it be appropriate for them to have a relationship? At what age would it be appropriate for the author to write explicit scenes about this relationship?

Going with a different pairing, you mentioned Harry/Sirius. You didn't state what you found inappropriate about this relationship. Are you implying that Harry is underage? If so, at what age would a relationship between Harry and Sirius be no longer problematic? Are you implying that it's inappropriate because Sirius is Harry's Godfather? I didn't grow up in a religious family, so I really don't understand the significance of a Godparent, and thus don't see why the title would preclude a relationship. I doubt this is the case, but is it because it is a slash pairing? If so, what about Hermione/Sirius? Or is it because of the age gap? Is there a point when the age gap becomes less relevant? We know that wizards have longer life spans, so what about a 25yo Harry and a 45yo Sirius? What about Harry/Bill (10 year age gap)?

And then you have the issue of magic... You've got time travel. If Hermione travels back in time and gets with Sirius when they're the same age, I would assume that isn't a problem. But what is she gets thrown back into the present? Now you have two characters with a 19year age difference in an established relationship. Is that wrong? And you've got Do-Over fics. One of my favourite fics has Hermione thrown out of her time where she lives out 10+ years of her life. Then she's snapped back into her past, a 35yo in a 15yo's body. In that case, what would be more appropriate? A 35yo in a 15yo's body dating other people her physical age, or her mental age? Any way you look at it, there's going to be an age gap, either physically or mentally. Another one of my favourite fics has a Harry that can't die. Every time he died he wakes up as a baby. In the story, he starts an explicit relationship with another character when he's 14yo. But he uses aging potions to appear ~25yo. And mentally he's like 300+... Like I said, massive grey area, lol.

I'd love to hear how you feel about some of these more specific examples...
