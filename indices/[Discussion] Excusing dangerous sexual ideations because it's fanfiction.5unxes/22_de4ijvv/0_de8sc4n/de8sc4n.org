For sure! I'm almost always down to discuss this more, simply because of the massive amount of gray area. The Harry/Sirius bit is with the assumption that this is during their schooling and there are no changes to their age. Godparents...I don't have an issue with other than it being evidence of the age gap. I never have an issue with Harry/Bill, I think because Bill isn't a parental figure or parental alternative. Also, I've never read a harry/bill where harry is still a teen. Half your age plus seven is the rule of thumb for minimum age differences.\\
Time travel is a nonissue in my eyes; you need to ignore the trope and take what they're giving you at face value. Is 35 y/o Hermione in a 15 y/o body going to go around fucking around the castle? Not only would that be OOC, but imho would be borderline inappropriate, especially depending on how the sexual content is handled.\\
BRO I LOVE THAT FIC UR TALKIN BOUT (but i never finished it). I don't find that one problematic until the later chapters, but the author does a good job of addressing discomfort with Harry's young form and using aging potions (which I don't find a problem because of his mental age).\\
I think about 99% of examples will be gray area, but there is a 1% of vile fic out there that excuses disgustingness with it 'not being real' and 'no one getting hurt'. Literature is plenty real and has plenty of impact on the real world. I am anti-banning but I think that shoving it all into it's own dark corner is best (and, in the rarest of occurrences, reporting the fanfic but tbh ive only come across one in the hp fandom like that. spn is the worst offending fandom when it comes to kiddy porn stuff)
