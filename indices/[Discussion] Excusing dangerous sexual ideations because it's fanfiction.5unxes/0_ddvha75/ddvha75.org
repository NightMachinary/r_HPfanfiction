  Do we have a responsibility as fans to self police and rail against these fictional abuses?

No, at the very least because you have no idea what mindframe the author is writing from. I've written some of these stories, I ship Harry/Sirius (these days, mostly in a time-travel context, I'll admit). There's a HUGE difference between content that glamourises and glorifies these things, and that which treats them as the horror they are. I am a survivor of CSA, and my writing was massively therapeutic for me.

In addition, attempts to censor this sort of content have gone poorly in fandom. This is how LiveJournal's DeleteGate started, and the beginning of the end of LJ's place as the main hub of fandom activity. Unfortunately, it was far too broad a stroke, and the private journals of actual survivors got caught up in the banwave. This is a massive part of why AO3 exists today--the argument that ALL fanworks have a right to exist, regardless of whether they contain what some may consider objectionable content.

There is a much-derided (at least on this subreddit) phrase that comes to mind, as to what you should do when you find one of these fics: Don't like, don't read. Don't support authors and artists who make content you object to. Don't send them reviews, don't leave Kudos, don't read their work. Support the creators who make stuff you DO enjoy. Most will be discouraged by the lack of response, and some may stop creating or otherwise move on.

Whether that's a good thing for the fandom is of course a matter of personal opinion.
