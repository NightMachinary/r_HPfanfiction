I really really appreciate your nuanced response.

I think as recommenders or reviewers we have a responsibility to mention when an author or story doesn't seem to be handling things appropriately. We can't know where they're coming from, which is why I'm not a fan of call-out culture, but if the nuance isn't coming across, it might not matter to a casual reader that the author was victimized.

Yes, if most people see twincest, they can just choose not to avoid it, but you can necessarily tell ahead of time how the author will handle rape as a plot device.

Our culture rails against censorship, but I think we're overdue for a discussion and some serious scholarly research about how media consumption affects us. People are terrible at separating themselves from the narrator and maybe authors should voluntarily modulate their work in light of that. Some pedophiles sympathesize with Nabokov's Humbert Humbert at one extreme, but a lot more people are unable to totally reject Humbert's perspective and think Lolita was manipulative or acted sexually precious or whatever.
