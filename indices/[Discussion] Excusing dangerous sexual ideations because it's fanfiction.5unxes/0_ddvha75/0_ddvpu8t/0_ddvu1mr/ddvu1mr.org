This is probably going to get long, and I'm not terribly sorry about that. So for ease of reading, I'm going to address your points individually. Also, my perspective is not without bias: I work in the gaming industry, and obviously that will colour my views. In addition, I've been in HP fandom for close to 20 years, so some of my thinking may well be dated. Caveat lector.

  I think as recommenders or reviewers we have a responsibility to mention when an author or story doesn't seem to be handling things appropriately.

Should all stories always make an attempt to handle things appropriately, then? Who determines what appropriate is? A male survivor, a female survivor, someone with a heavy social justice background, a Supreme Court judge, a congressman--all of these will have a different view on what is appropriate. The US attempts to legislate obscenity, but it remains a movable benchmark. Are stories that are intended to be solely pornographic exempt from this 'appropriate handling' issue?

Taking your example of rape: A man writes a fanfic from the aggressor's point of view, let's say Draco and Hermione, just to put some names on things. It's clearly purely sexual fantasy on his part. A woman writes a fanfic from the victim's point of view, let's say Dolohov and Hermione this time. Once again, it's very clearly pure sexual fantasy. Is one of these things more appropriate than the other? Is it more appropriate, or less, if Hermione is the aggressor and Draco the victim? Does it change if it's Bellatrix and Hermione, or Voldemort and Draco? Is it different if these are all original characters, and the site of publication is, let's say, Letters to Penthouse?

Porn isn't less valid literature, and people need a place to play with sexual fantasies that are otherwise inappropriate or taboo. Which leads us into the second point.

  Our culture rails against censorship, but I think we're overdue for a discussion and some serious scholarly research about how media consumption affects us.

The main misstep here is to take all media as a whole. The underlying point is good, but each category of things will have to be studied separately; there's a world of difference between reading a drabble on the internet and spending 10 hours a day playing Call of Duty. However, it also needs to be considered that consuming certain forms of media which depict inappropriate behaviours may actually make it LESS likely that people will engage in those behaviours afterwards. It's far more socially acceptable to vent my frustrations about my Very Noisy Neighbours by shooting up the opposing team in Overwatch than by shooting up my neighbour, and a game of Overwatch (like most competitive shooters) has tangible and emotional rewards that positively reinforce using it in that manner--not to mention which the Most Dangerous Game definitely applies, as it's far more satisfying to win against people who fight back.

In terms of how this relates to fanfic, pedophilia, and online communities, Dusk Peterson has addressed this in some of their writings far better than I ever could. The [[http://www.duskpeterson.com/master/index.htm#unmasked][Unmasked stories]] are based in RL events. [[http://www.duskpeterson.com/obligations.htm][Their essay on the ethical obligations of fiction authors]] is also relevant.

Regarding Humbert Humbert and the Lolita Problem, I'd argue that that's not so much a difficulty of separating themselves from the narrator specifically as a problem of modern culture generally. After all, people seem to have little trouble realising that the narrator of The Great Gatsby is unreliable. The attitude that 'she was asking for it,' even when the girl in question is underage, remains prevalent. Men who cheat continue to have been 'tempted' by faithless women. We are not Humbert Humbert, but we made him, and we continue to validate his existence.
