Continuing this in a part 2.

The reader of Lolita is supposed to, on some level, identify with Humbert Humbert; this is the purpose of making him the narrator. It's a social commentary, and one is intended to recognise these problems in our culture and ourselves. The problem with this is that we only see the world through Humbert's eyes, we only see Lolita through Humbert's eyes. To him, she is manipulative. This is the perspective the publishing industry grants us. Published literary fiction massively skews towards the perspective of the straight white male protagonist.

Fanfiction is by its very nature subversive literature. Fandom is dominated by amateurs, unpublished writers, many of whom are women, queer, not white. There is already a form of censorship at work, even if it's merely passive, in the low representation of these voices in published literature. Fanfiction gives Lolita her voice. What happened to her is wrong, but that doesn't give us the right to tell her it didn't happen, and that talking about it is ALSO wrong. This is how more people end up hesitant to report rape. It stops becoming a thing that can happen to anyone, and by extension, it becomes somehow the fault of the victim.

Discussions of rape fantasy are already taboo. Discussions of consensual sexual violence (BDSM) were taboo, until Fifty Shades of Grey brought that set of kinks into very public eye. Where did Fifty Shades of Grey start, you ask? Twilight fanfic. Fanfic has turned into the way we talk about things we're not supposed to talk about.

In this era of political conservatism and increasing government control of media, we need more of that, not less.
