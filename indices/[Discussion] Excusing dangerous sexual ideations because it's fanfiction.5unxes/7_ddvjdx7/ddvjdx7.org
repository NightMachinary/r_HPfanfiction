I'm not a proponent of incest, but I have difficulty finding a moral objection towards it as long as pregnancies are avoided.

Underage sex can be problematic if it is pornographic (for the sexual gratification of the audience or authors), but stories who treat anyone below 18 as asexual are equally as disturbing. IMHO teenage sexuality (in this context I mean ages 13-18) can be done in a tasteful way and can be important for the story and characters, but depending on your cultural context it may always be disturbing no matter how it is executed (from a biological standpoint this seems more abnormal than acknowledging it, but whatever).

Also stories should be able to address ethically objectionable relationships (like abuse of a Teacher/Student relationship, etc...). I'm personally not interested in reading stories that glorify this and there seems to be a consensus (at least in this subreddit) concerning this viewpoint.

A part of your comment seems to touch on the topic of something I like to refer to as "Democratic Censorship" which isn't much better than censorship by the state. Public opinion is not a reliable measure for what should be protected as art.
