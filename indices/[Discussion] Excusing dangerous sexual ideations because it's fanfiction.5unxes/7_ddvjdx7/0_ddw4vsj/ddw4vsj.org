I certainly am aware that cultures differ, and that cousins are no more likely to produce a genetically deformed child than the next same-race couple. I specifically am speaking of /glorified/ teacher/student with graphic sex, to build off your example. It happens in a lot of fandoms I've dipped my toes in, and often the writers are vilified by lynch mobs and their waves of defenders that cry "don't like, don't read".\\
If you consider fanfiction as being able to be porn, then wouldn't you have to consider these graphic fics as such? Then, building on this, how do you proceed? Would you not take it down? Would you use a separate agreement page like that of AO3's adult content warning? I don't know. But I think that public opinion has some measure of power, and some measure of right.
