I think it's important to note that the author is creating the whole story of the characters. from the author's perspective, the kid is giving consent and is not being taken advantage of. Maybe the kid is written to have adult level maturity in a childish body. In a fantasy world, if the author says the consent is the absolute god-given truth, then it should be. The author is God of that world. Obviously this is not true in real life, but stories are not real life. Obviously real kids cannot give consent because they are kids with kid level logic and maturity.

I also think these stories tend to be written from the perspective of the young kid authors who think old people are hot and not from old pedos who think kids are hot... A lot of teenage boys write about motherxson where mothers teach their kids how to have sex by practical experience. It's weird but the trope is everywhere and I doubt moms are actually having sex with their kids to teach them?? People just have weird fantasies and to think about something is wayyy different from acting on anything.

For example, i think bestiality in a fic could be OK if the author explicitly shows that the beast has a normal IQ, finds the sexual experience enjoyable, and wants to continue. but in real life, this sureness is impossible, so it's always always rape.

Overall, no matter what, there's no crime because nothing's real... just accept that people have weird fantasies, I think. As long as no real humans are harmed IRL then it's OK. if a teacher jerks off to a student, that's not illegal. It's only horrendous when the harmful fantasies are actually acted upon. But brains cook up weird ideas for many people... Better to just keep those ideas contained to the darker side of the internet.
