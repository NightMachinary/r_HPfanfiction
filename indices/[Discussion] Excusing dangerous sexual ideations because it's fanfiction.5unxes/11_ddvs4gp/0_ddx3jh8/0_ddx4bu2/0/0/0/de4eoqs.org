I agree with you, if I'm understanding what you're saying. The problem that I /may/ have with these types of "thought crimes", as you call them, actually stems from a question that I've never been able to find the answer to. Quite simply, can written work help to stop physical altercations, or does it act as a gateway for escalation. Let me explain. First, I was a victim of childhood sexual abuse. My step-father went to jail for eight years, and I have absolutely no contact with him now. But I always wonder if it was just me. No other victims came forward when he was arrested, he claims that I was his only victim, and I hope that that is the truth. But what it he doing now? He's free, walking the streets. Even if I was his only victim in the past, does he still have those desires? And assuming he does, what is he doing about them? Personally, I would *MUCH* rather he read some kiddie porn abuse fics on ao3 than go out and find another young girl to abuse. But as someone who doesn't have those desires, I honestly don't know if reading about them would be satisfying or frustrating. I don't know if it would decrease the urge to find a victim, or increase the desire to play out the story in real life. I just don't know. If it's the former, then I am /all for it/. Read to your heart's content. Write to your heart's content. Anything that will keep another potential victim safe. If it's the latter... Well... The problem that I see is that it's probably a mix of both. There are probably some people who can read about it and choose not to actually do anything, while there are probably others who use the fics as foreplay. I don't think there is a good answer.
