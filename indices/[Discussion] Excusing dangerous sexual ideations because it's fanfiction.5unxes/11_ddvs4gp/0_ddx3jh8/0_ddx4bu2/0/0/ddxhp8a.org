I'm sorry that you seem to be offended by my questions, I thought you were open to discussion? All I'm trying to do is get at the heart of the moral question here. Do you think things are wrong because someone told you so, or because you have empathy for your fellow humans? Is it the desire that's wrong, or the act which brings harm to another person? Should I be condemned for a desire to murder, even if I never act upon it? What about media which glorifies violence and murder, something very common in today's society? To me, this is the line between thoughtcrime and actual crime. There is no harm that comes from thoughts in your head, it is the actions that hurt people, cause physical and emotional damage in real life, which are disturbing and reprehensible.
