My advice:

- Don't slavishly rehash canon in AU fics
- Don't bash
- Don't rename Harry unless he needs to hide his identity; and never call him Hadrian because this name has become the synonym for powerwanking asshole edgelord Harry
- Don't manufacture drama and angst
- Don't dumb down any character to force through a plot
- Don't write Daphne Greengrass as 'Ice Queen' unless she's great at cold based spells
- Don't write Hermione as an authority worshipper because she's not
- Don't let Harry outduel Voldemort in a straight fight after only a couple years (or even months) or training; even better, don't let a teenager Harry defeat Voldemort in a fair fight
- Don't let your heroes submit to that crap called marriage law, because in real world, even Nazis and Stalinists didn't dare to push through that kind of atrocity. Only the ultimate scumbag of the 20th century, the Khmer Rouge, did something similar!
