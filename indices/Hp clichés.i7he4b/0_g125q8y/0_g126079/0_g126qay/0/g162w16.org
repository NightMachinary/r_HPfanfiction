To be fair though it does have a great potential to re-start the war by forcing the characters to face that the Ministry is not going to get better on it's own even after they won the war. Maybe it is because I tend to ignore romance focused fanfics and pretty much all the ships this trope is usually used to force, but I myself saw it mostly done to get either a civil war started or to get Harry to leave Britain (generally to one or more countries that are so much better than the British magical society that it's like seeing someone go from the cave age to some futuristic utopia which, admittedly, gets old faster than you would expect)
