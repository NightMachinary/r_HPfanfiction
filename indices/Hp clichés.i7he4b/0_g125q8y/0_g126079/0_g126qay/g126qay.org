It's a trope quite prevalent in this fandom, and it generally works like that:

- After the war, in order to grow the population, Wizengamot passes this law FORCING couples together
- The couples are assigned by the Wizengamot or the Ministry
- The couples must fuck in order to fulfill the law's requirement
- People who don't comply get send to Azkaban

Now imagine in real world, some corrupt government body forces you to fuck or be fucked by someone you don't even know or like. Or, some decrepit and disgusting shitheads with money and power will get to pick their favorites, and threaten torture and prison if their victims don't comply.

This trope was developed by shippers who couldn't otherwise put their outrageous pairings together
