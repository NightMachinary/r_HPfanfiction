"Super clever" Harry who has a sudden awakening and total change of character for no good reason, and goes "listen here, Dumble-fuck, I do whatever I want, and you can't stop me 'cause I'm the Boy-Who-Lived", and apparently that is enough to make Dumbledore give in.

Also, Dumbledore or the Weasleys stealing money from Harry or the latter being friendly to him only because Dumbledore pays them to be. Forthe sake of "the greater good".
