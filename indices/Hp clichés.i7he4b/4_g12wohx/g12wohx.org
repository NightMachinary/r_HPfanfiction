Find a good plot. Plot is everything. There is nothing else.

Yes, you will get in this thread long lists of most horrible clichés happening in the HP fanfiction stories, but remember: the cliché is not the root of the problem, it just a symptom of bad writing and especially bad or missing plot. Authors don's bash Ron Weasley because that would be the thing, no, they bash him because they are not able or they are too lazy to write a good realistic romantic subplot. They don't write Ginny-doses-Harry-with-love-potions because they think it is a good idea, but because of the teenage moral inversion and because they think by writing something so outrageously stupid they will attract attention (they don't, because there are ten zillion stories like this hoping to attract attention by the shock value). Bashing Dumbledore is not the thing because it would be a good idea, but because they are not willing to subject Harry to the real suffering (like in the canon) and suddenly they found themselves without any dramatic conflict, so they hurriedly make Dumbledore into the main antagonist without any reason (and again the moral inversion).
