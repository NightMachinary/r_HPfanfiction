That's the thing about Harry/Fleur, it's soooo close to being ok. 14/17 is kinda creepy. Cho/Cedric is 15/17, is that so much better? Has Cho ever fought a dragon and saved Cedric's little sister? But give it 3 years and nobody cares.

The main thing is, 14-year old Harry still suffers from teaspoon syndrome.
