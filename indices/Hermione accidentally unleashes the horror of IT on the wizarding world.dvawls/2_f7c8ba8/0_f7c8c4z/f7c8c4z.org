[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9035489/1/][*/How Hermione Granger and AOL got Umbridge Sacked/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2569626/apAidan][/apAidan/]]

  This is an AU look at what might have happened the day after the Twins left the school during OOTP if Umbridge had had a reason to question Hermione as she did Harry. Since wizards don't understand anything about the internet, or computers or gamergirls, it's a classic example of what you don't know can hurt you. Rated T for ... well just because. AU Harmony. H/Hr
