I feel like there is too much unnecessary description. There are lots of names, dates and random facts with very little action or anything really going on making it really hard to read and understand. I would go through and cut down on the background information that is not directly relevant to what you are describing. For example, the first few paragraphs on the Riddle home/family, death eater names and descriptions could easily be cut out and not change the story at all at this point. You could always add the background later in the story as needed.
