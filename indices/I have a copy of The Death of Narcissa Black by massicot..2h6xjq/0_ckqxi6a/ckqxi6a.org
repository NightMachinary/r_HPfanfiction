I thought this was an interesting story! I liked the art style also.

But I don't really understand it. It seems to me that being Minister of Magic would take priority in her family's eyes. The position seems to be held for a very long time/indefinitely so the chances she could have a shot at it again are slim. And any child she bears won't actually be a Black, but take the name of the father. Also, why couldn't she have children in office? I assume nannies/house elves often take care of the children in affluent families.

I know they explain it as there needs to be someone to carry the name, but I think it is a very wishy washy explanation. I think a family of Slytherins could figure out a way to do both. Voluntarily giving up all that power?
