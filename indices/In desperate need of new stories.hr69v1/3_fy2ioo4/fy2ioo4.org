All I have are slashfics but this first one is one of my favs. I highly recommend it even if u are not into slash. There is a lot of focus on the plot and I just beg you to give it a shot since it's so well planned out and the relationships between the ppl are so well written. (Of wizards and heroes)

Some of the fics might be sad at times but I swear all of them have a happy end.

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

Also this time travel fic. Bit sad at one point but Happy ending! (Ships Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

A funny drarry fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14010333]])

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers
