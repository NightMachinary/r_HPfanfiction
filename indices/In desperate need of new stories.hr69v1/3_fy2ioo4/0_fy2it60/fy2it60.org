  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  The Magical's were separating form the Mundane world. No longer able to ensure their secrecy with the advancing technology of the Muggles, they were leaving entirely.Harry wasn't going with them. Or, the one where Harry met Tony and the events of the first Iron Man movie mostly happen anyway.

  Harry worked for W.A.N.D., the Wizarding Association of National Defence. He liked his job, and he liked being a lonely, miserable, old bugger. But when he's assigned to protect Tony Stark he's unprepared for what he'll have to face: a nosy, interfering superhero intent on getting Harry a life, or perhaps just getting himself one.

  “So, I was thinking---” Neville cut off, causing Harry to peer up curiously. Neville's eyes were narrowed on the flower, small frown marring his features. “Oh, how rude.” “What's rude? It's just a flower. Strange, since Malfoy sent it to me. Do you think he was cursed? I mean, it's not like him to be nice.” Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."- Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.
