Prophesy is real though. We know its real even if it isn't a fool proof thing. There is no reason Voldemort wouldn't seek to kill any sons of his enemies that were born at the end of July. To someone without morals it is the logical thing to do.

I think after that night Voldemort was just hellbent on getting Harry, the prophesy never mattered too much anymore except to know how Harry survived. If Voldemort heard the prophesy and it wasn't what he thought and killing Harry wasn't necessary, Voldemort would still seek to do so because of the trouble that Harry caused him.
