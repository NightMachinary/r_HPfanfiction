I thought that the whole prophecy thing depended on belief. Take oedipus for instance. His father hears that his son is going to kill him form a prophet name Tiresias. He then takes this infant and has a servant take him out to kill him by exposing him to the elements. The servant takes pity on the boy and many years later, Oedipus, raised by other people, is traveling close to the city and (spoiler alert) unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother. So the whole thing could have been avoided if the king had simply treated his son well (as we find out, Oedipus is a good man which is why his story is tragic).

Thus, the prophecy was kicked off by the king hearing it. And by trying to "[eliminate] a lose end"/ kill a potential rival, the king sets himself up for death by the his son's hands. Does this scenario sound familiar? It does? Hmm... I wonder why...
