The issue I have with this is that I just can't see how Tom Riddle (known to be charming and devious and manipulative and so very smart) who, according to Dumbledore himself, was one of the most talented students to ever pass through Hogwarts, could have believed in prophecy. The issue here for me is that you have this guy who's smart and can say people. He had to have been a good orator to inspire such fanaticism in his death eaters, and he was apparently very powerful magically. So he had to have been a well read guy I think.

So why does this guy believe in prophecy? I mean, come on, he's on the verge of taking over wizarding Britain and then suddenly he starts chasing after a baby???

Hence my theory: Tom Riddle was dangerous (slightly insane since he did try to take over the world of course) but not as insane as we see him in canon. But once he heard the prophecy, perhaps due to the influence it had on him (assuming that prophecies can exert external influences of their own) he was (for some inexplicable reason) affected by it and tried to defeat his "nemesis." his body was destroyed and he spent a decade as a bodiless wraith surviving by possessing animals (which he mentions during his resurrection in Book 4). This is when he went mad and lost whatever sanity he had left, exacerbated by him slitting his soul into 7 pieces (and then 8 after he made nagini).

This of course brings in to question the power of prophecy in Harry Potter. The very act of conquering Britain shows that Tom Riddle had no interest in fate or anything like that. He says (I think) that "there is no good or evil, only power." So why would he believe in prophecy? Why couldn't he have ignored it? This means that the splitting of his soul was beginning to affect him or the prophecy had it's own influence, where, if it is heard by one of the people involved, it will affect them.

This of course brings in the question of whether the splitting of a should affects the mental capabilities of the person, something that JKR doesn't address, I don't think. Or it could be that no one thought to give the man a copy of Oedipus Rex. Seriously, can you imagine this:

Voldemort going, "time to kill my nemesis and defeat this prophecy"\\
"My lord, have you ever heard of a play called Oedipus Rex?" Interrupts Death Eater no. 6, concerned for his master.\\
"Of course I have! What're you talking about? of course I've read that book!" Voldemort raises his wand threateningly.\\
"No..nothing never mind..it's ok," says Death Eater no. 6. "...filthy half-blood," he mutters, "he's clearly never heard about a "self fulfilling prophecy""\\
"Did you just call me filthy?" whispers Voldemort "DIE! Avada Kedavra!"\\
And that's how the Dark Lord Voldemort sealed his fate.
