I think Voldemort was insane long before he even heard of Horcruxes. The Heir of Slytherin business in his sixth(fifth?) year shows that clearly - there was absolutely no point to that.

That said, I don't think he treated his followers half as bad during the first war (and his school years) as he did after his resurrection. He basically felt they betrayed him and were indebted to him, so Crucioing and humiliating them became a nice pastime of his.
