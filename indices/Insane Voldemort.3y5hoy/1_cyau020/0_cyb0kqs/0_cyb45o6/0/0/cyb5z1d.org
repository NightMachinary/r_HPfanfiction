  The entire heir of Slytherin business reads like Riddle has great-great-granddaddy issues.

He definitely does. Really just try to imagine what young Tom Riddle went through. Don't imagine a young psychopath just a kid who grew up in a shitty orphanage then gets pulled into a wonderful fantasy land to start over. Basically the same story as Harry Potter. Except Tom then goes into Slytherin where he would not be accepted because of his heritage(or lack thereof). The wonderful new world he finds himself in isn't the happy place he imagines, he'd be called a mudblood, and I don't think its a stretch to say he became fixated on his ancestry.

I'm big on nurture over nature. Tom Riddle was made into Voldemort, not born that way. It started in an orphanage, and continued in the magical world. Think about his first contact with wizards. Dumbledore comes into his room and sets all his things on fire. This is an orphan, he doesn't have much and Dumbledore just waves a wand and its burning. Life at the orphanage is all about power, Tom has power over others with his abilities, then Dumbledore shows up and demonstrates how powerless Tom really is.
