That plan is heavily flawed though. Dumbledore knows he's a Parselmouth so he immediately suspects him. If Riddle wanted to show his housemates that he's the true heir of Slytherin, then that can easily backfire if someone were to investigate the Slytherins and one of them broke and told the truth.

The entire heir of Slytherin business reads like Riddle has great-great-granddaddy issues. He doesn't like his real family, so he leans on his ancestor and the legends associated with him, and continues his "noble work" in order to make his great-great-granddaddy proud. It's a huge risk for very little, if any, gain.
