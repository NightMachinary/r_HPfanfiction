The heir of Slytherin can be justified I think. If you consider young Tom Riddle, mudblood in Slytherin, needing to put on a display of power. If we assume that house is as bigoted and hostile as canon portrays than Tom can't have been a happy student. He finds out he isn't actually a muggleborn, but people won't just believe it because he says it so he does something big and petrifies some students. Then Myrtle gets killed accidentally and Hogwarts almost closes.
