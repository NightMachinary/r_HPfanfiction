... welp. thats one way of putting it. I would also like to state that Voldemort was only crazy when Harry was involved in canon. It has been stated that Voldemort was winning the First War. He wasnt insane then. I think that its more likely that he became fixated on killing Harry, more than anything else. so... he just had a murderous form of fanboy syndrome if you wanna think of it like that.
