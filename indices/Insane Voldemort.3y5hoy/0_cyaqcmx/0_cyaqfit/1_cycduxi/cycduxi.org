Another one that not many people mention even though it makes complete sense and doesn't even need a real fab theory.

Voldemort spent thirteen years as something less than a gosh. Thirteen years alone, unable to interact with anything besides for snakes and two crazy followers. For like ten years of that time, only snakes.

That's long enough to turn anyone insane.
