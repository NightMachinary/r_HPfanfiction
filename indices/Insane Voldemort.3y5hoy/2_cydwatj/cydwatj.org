No. In fanfiction it goes way over the board, the mad cackling, torturing and killing - at least in my opinion. On the other hand, yes, he was still insane in the books. But as Servalpur mentioned, he was living ( or rather un-living) as a ghost for thirteen years. Very few individuals have such a resilience to go on and on, to survive in such conditions and even fewer can achieve it while remaining sane. One has to admit, he had an admirable willpower. People often forget few other things: for Voldemort, already immortal at that time, powerful beyond imagination (for god's sake he could fly without support!), the idea of a child destroying him, the sheer audacity of it was laughable even unbearable. So what does he do? He gets angry and plans to kill the child, just for the sake of it. Unfortunately for him, it all goes horribly wrong and so for the next decade he lives like ghost and the principal thing sustaining him is hate. He hates the child, hates his followers for leaving him alone, for believing this kid killed him, shortly, he hates everybody. Then, when finally, he is resurrected (that feat alone is unheard of) and anxiously meets his conqueror, lo! our dear Harry awaits him with his dirty clothes, unruly hair, broken spectacles and mediocre power (mind you, mediocre in comparison to his). I would be livid. So was he. And we all know what happens next... it comes as no surprise Voldy is obsessed with killing Harry.
