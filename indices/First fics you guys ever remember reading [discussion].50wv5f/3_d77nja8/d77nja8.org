I'm not really sure, to be honest! I think summer of 2000, neighbor kids printed out a fanfiction and shared it with me. Titled Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix of course. Turns out Dumbledore was evil too. Everyone had Animagus forms-I'm thinking phoenix and black griffon might have been two of them. Dumbledore and Voldemort had a huge fight and everyone's eyes were red. I never got to read the end.

It was really weird and I'm not sure why it didn't put me off fanfiction forever. Evil!Dumbledore was traumatizing
