First fic I ever read was some Remus/Tonks story over on HPFF. I remember that it won one of their awards in 2008. It MIGHT be this - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116956]] but I honestly don't remember anything about it. I do know in that first week of discovery I read the R trilogy by Greengecko, when the third part was only a few chapters in, and I also read the Ring of Gold trilogy and a few other Harry/Ginny fics.
