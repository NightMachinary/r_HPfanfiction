Mine was a fic on Mugglenet's fanfiction. I forgot the author, but the story was never finished. It was called "Another Time, Another Place". Premise: Harry runs away after the defeat of Voldemort because he believes Ginny died. He lives on a ranch in the US, has a daughter, and must return to Britain because said daughter is a witch.
