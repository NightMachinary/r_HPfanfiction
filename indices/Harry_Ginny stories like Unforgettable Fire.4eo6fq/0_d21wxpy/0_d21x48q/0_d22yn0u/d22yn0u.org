linkffn(Rebirth by Irina) and its sequel have some of the elements you seek. The fic is hella old though, and the writing at the start is really ordinary. I genuinely like the sequel though.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ginnysdarkside/SDIWIWIS.html][Somedays I Wish I Were in Slytherin]] has some of the spy stuff and a not-fully-committed relationship with Draco, but I don't remember her being particularly damaged in it.
