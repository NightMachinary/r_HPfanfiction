I would quite like to see a crackfic where this happens and Voldemort has to turn up to compete. The tournament would provide a form of protection, so that no-one could arrest him during the events. However, the organising committee would just be ramping up the challenges to absurd levels to try and take him down. It would be an amusing opportunity for him to crack out some really big magic.

Even better if Dumbledore is also trapped into it by Voldemort so that they have to compete against one another.
