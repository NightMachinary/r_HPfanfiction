I think I've seen that before: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3142958/1/Tom-Riddle-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire]]\\

Although, now that you bring it up...what if it backfired? What if someone put Voldemort/Tom Riddle's name into the Goblet of Fire, intending that he fails to show up and therefore loses his magic, but in order to enable him to fairly compete, the Goblet summons Voldemort to Hogwarts and restores him to a physical body?
