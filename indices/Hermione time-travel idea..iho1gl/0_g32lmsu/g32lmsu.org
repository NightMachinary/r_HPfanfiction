Sounds pretty good.

But I like another twist: she didn't actually time travel, but jumped to a different universe/dimension that was behind hers by ~30 years. And things are somewhat different here, so her future knowledge could even be counterproductive.

To be honest with you, if the time traveler doesn't bother with that "keeping the timeline" bullshit, and exploit their future knowledge to the fullest extent, there will be actually little challenge. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), can serve as some kind of blue print. This Hermione of yours is however many times more powerful.

Therefore, I proposed the twist of *dimensional time travel* instead of a simple time travel.
