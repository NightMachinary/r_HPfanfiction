Actually, future knowledge doesn't go as far as you'd think. Because the more you change, the more the butterfly effect will render your knowledge of the original timeline obsolete. Stuff that happened in the past that's secret would remain valuable information, like the prophecy or the horcruxes that had already been made, but knowing that, say, Lucius gave Ginny the diary in 2nd. Year, or that Moody is actually Crouch Jr., wouldn't necessarily be worth anything, because the changes caused by the time traveler's presence might mean those events never happened. This is one of the nuances of time travel that is overlooked by authors (even professional ones) with frustrating frequency.

Future Hermione might even overlook this fact sometimes, because she's so fixated on preventing the timeline she remembers, that she doesn't always anticipate the changes in the timeline she's in.

Alt dimension could work too, though.
