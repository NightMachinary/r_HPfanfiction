I'm sorry, but this is not how you use future knowledge. You don't *need to recreate* that freaking 'timeline'. No, you use what you know about the future to strike at your enemies's greatest vulnerabilities!

If this Hermione decides for 1991, then she knows:

- Voldemort's mean of immortality, what his Horcruxes are and where they are hidden
- The identity and location of *every* inner circle Death Eater
- Scabber is Wormtail, Sirius is innocent
- Barty Jr is hiding at his own home
- Quirrell is carrying Voldemort
- Rita Skeeter is a beetle Animagus
- Umbridge is a big threat

So, what can she do with these important knowledge? Someone as smart as Hermione is not going to sit passively there and let things repeat! No, she's going to actively using the information to her greatest advantage! If she's willing to work with Dumbledore, things are going to be even easier:

- Tell Dumbledore about the apocalypse if Voldemort is not defeated, scare him to the point where he agrees that *anything* is a go against Voldemort and his Death Eaters
- Get the Diadem Horcrux from the Room of Requirement
- Out Wormtail and exonerate Sirius, and have Wormtail kissed by dementors;
- Out Barty Jr, have him kissed too and his dad sent to Azkaban for life
- Stun Quirrell and hopefully Voldemort. If Voldemort's wraith escapes, she knows it's most likely in Albania
- Raid Malfoy Manor with Dumbledore and Moody in lead, they know where his secret stash is, they will have enough evidence this time to send Lucius to Azkaban for a very very long time. Most importantly, the Diary is now in their hands
- Assassinate Dolores Umbridge and frame the Death Eaters
- Blackmail Rita Skeeter (Hermione knows again) to raise public awareness against Death Eaters
- Rile up Augusta Longbottom, make a big push in Wizengamot to confiscate Crouch, Lestrange, and Malfoy assets. Get the Cup
- Let Sirius and Kreacher have a talk about Regulus, bring the Locket. Put all these Horcruxes in front of the Gaunt Shack, and burn everything down with Fiendfyre. She or Dumbledore should be able to control it
- Back at Hogwarts, kill the Basilisk with roosters, harvest its venom, sell its parts for gold
- Continue with media campaign against Death Eaters, Dumbledore, now fully in control of the Ministry, proposes reinvestigate all incarcerated Death Eaters at Azkaban, only this time with Veritaserum and Legilimency.
- Follow up on their leads and arrest all known Death Eaters, those guilty of even one murder will be pushed over the Veil. Confiscate their assets further to compensate their victims
- Meanwhile, ask Snape to seek out the wraith of Voldemort in Albania. Snape's Occlumency should make Voldemort think that he's on the run from Ministry's purge and he's the last one of his faithful. Once Voldemort is in that weak Homunculus body, a stunner in his back will finally see Voldemort captured
- Now in their custody, force Voldemort to tell all his secrets, then obliviate him fully and completely to his infancy, with the Elderwand. Even if his wraith should escape in some very unlikely fashion, he would only wander the mortal plane as a confused spirit forever! But for now, Voldemort would be petrified and locked behind a ward more powerful than Nurmengard
- Their last major task should be to remove Voldemort's soul fragment from Harry. It may work, or it may not. But since Harry is never a properly made Horcrux, it should be possible to get it out without killing him. If it works, execute Voldemort

You see, there's no need to repeat any of the canon stations. There's no need to let any of these scums carrying out their canon schemes. You go actively after them, mercilessly and ruthlessly.

Even if some should escape, this Hermione would hunt them down until the end of the Earth, while letting her counterpart and other children have the childhood they deserve!
