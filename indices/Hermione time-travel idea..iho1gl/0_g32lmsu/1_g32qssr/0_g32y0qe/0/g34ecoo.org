You have essentially repeated my point, in a much more long-winded fashion, while acting as though it is yours.

Of course the original timeline won't repeat (not in a well-written story, anyway). You don't need to even brutally murder every bad guy to make that happen. The moment you start changing things, even if its just by being in the past, that will start causing other changes, and those changes will cause more changes, and very soon you'll have a very different timeline with very different problems. Which means that your future knowledge will become less and less useful as time goes on.

That doesn't mean, though, that the changes won't create new problems- ones your foreknowledge doesn't prepare you to deal with.
