Where do you think most sapient magical creatures come from? A wizard or witch buggered up a power-up ritual, of course.\\
Swiftness of a horse? Oops, now everyone's a centaur. Keen senses of a wolf? Hello, lycanthropy. The grace of swans? Veela (though some would say that went perfectly).\\
Even when people wised up and stopped trying to use animal affinities in their rituals, stuff still went wrong. Wizards trying to get stronger became giants, witches aiming for cunning became goblins, and someone aiming for supreme control over magic ended up making supremely-controllable house-elves.
