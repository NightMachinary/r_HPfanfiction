(I'm gonna take Harry destroying the goblet for power as a senario for this to happen, destroying the goblet causes a backlash of magic in the Great Hall, cause the goblet bind his magic to the contract, Why not take the magic outta the goblet)

Harry - "Well, that was a party pooper"

Ron - "Mate, Hermione's going nuts, she's muttering all the theory she has read till now and is rocking back and forth curled up."

/Looks at Hermione's with an bewildered expression while she babbles uses of Aconite/

Harry - "Well that's wierd but not unusual."

Ron - "That's True, I'm gonna get some food. Care to join me?"

Harry - "Nah, I'm good, You go ahead."

Ron - "Whatever mate.‚Äù

/Ron runs like flash out of the Common Room/

Harry - "/sigh/ At least now the ministry has something else to talk about rather than slam me for being a delusional idiot."
