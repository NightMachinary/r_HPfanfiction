Depends how old you want him, linkffn(Again and Again) he's a bit over 600 but stuck in a Groundhog Day style loop of his life

linkffn(Viper) is a HPxLOTR crossover where he's so old he lived through the ends and beginnings of many worlds

Edit:I was wrong the second one is linkffn(And In The Darkness Bind Them)
