1. You're missing a generation - Linfred's son married Ignotus's granddaughter.
2. Linfred is credited with setting the groundwork for many potions including skelegrow and pepper-up. He made the family rich.
3. Ignotus was smart enough to not showoff the cloak the way Antioch showed off his wand and the legend of the cloak would have spread after his death. It's why the story claims he had a son - if he was so well known people would know he only had daughters.
4. They're wizards - their class system would have been different. There would not have been that big of a difference between living standards of witches and wizards no matter their wealth status. By that point, there was no magical royalty or nobility unless a muggle noble family threw a muggleborn. Linfred's son was magical, healthy, wealthy, and presumably intelligent. The two would have met at Hogwarts, fallen in love, and both families congratulated each other for the continuation of their family line.
