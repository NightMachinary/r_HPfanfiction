Here's what makes it unbelievable to me. It says that Hardwin, son of Linfred, married Iolanthe, daughter of Ignotus and the Cloak of Invisibility passed on to the Potter family.

Only thing is, Linfred was pretty much a nobody, while the Peverell family owned an artifact which is on equal tier with items like the Philosopher's Stone or the Elder Wand.

In an age where people married strictly within their class, this marriage is positively outlandish.
