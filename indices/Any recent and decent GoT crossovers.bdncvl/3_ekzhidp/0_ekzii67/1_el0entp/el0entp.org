So did I, but I'm actually sort of into this story. I got really bored a few weeks ago and actually read it. I skipped a few chapters to avoid the setup, and I'm still required to read over some of the shit, but it's mostly an engaging story. It's probably just that I'm a sucker for empire/city builder type stories.
