Then you're out of luck. The only ones I've ever found to be actually complete for this crossover are usually terrible. Spelling mistakes that make first graders look good, godlike!Harry that sneezes every single problem away; stuff like that.

The good ones try to be more GoT instead of HP, and that means they usually just make Harry born in that universe, and are abandoned before anything actually happens because they quickly learn people reading FF don't want 10 year old Harry to watch mercenaries that his grandfather hired rape his 9 year old friends. (I read a story like this. Abandoned, of coure.)
