The Blue Winter Rose (linkffn(11941470)) is the best one I know of that's somewhat recent. It's not really anything to write home about imo, but it's better than the usual insert-Harry-into-Westeros fics. The Black Prince also updated recently despite previously being abandoned but it's old and you probably knew about it already.
