[Swords and Roses] follows Harry after being born to the Tyrells as he travels Essos, conquers his own patch of land and consolidates his power on both continents as he shatters the board upon which the Game of Thrones is played.

[Hadrian Lannister Lion of the rock] is a completed story about Harry being the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, who has to deal with backstabbing whoremongers, evil sisters and psychotic nephews.

Both are by Sage1998 on FF.net and are phenomenal.
