So I looked at these... are they actually Harry Potter crossovers, or are they just ASOIAF stories with an OC main character who we are told is Harry but has no real connection to Harry Potter?

From the brief look I took, it didn't look like Harry was going to be a wizard or have any memory of his life as Harry Potter or anything like that.
