Maybe not, but it's always the mothers who get put on pedestals and frankly I am fucking sick of that shit (I mean I loved my mother despite her having basically given up on custody (I admit that now I am glad she did!), but look where that got me, she was/is a bad mother (she never attended important milestones in my life like say graduation from school!), a liar and thief! Surely I am not the only one who got duped (or otherwise treated badly) by their mom, but there's the cliche of the dead-beat-dad, but not the cliche of the bitch-mom...I really wounder why?) Sure moms are important, but so are dads (single parent households aren't ideal - there's enough studies that show that children of single parents turn to crime more often, that they don't fit in etc. etc.)
