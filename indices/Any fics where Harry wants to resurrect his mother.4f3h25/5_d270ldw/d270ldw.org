I have but one question: Why is it always his mother? - I've read several fanfictions where Lily gets to live again, some where both elder Potters come back (either from the dead or from hiding!) but I can't remember one fanfiction where it's James that comes back (I've read a few where he survives because Voldemort didn't kill him because he either wasn't home (out with Sirius for example) or just knocked out because Voldemort wanted to end the fight as fast as possible) from the dead :(

ps: It might just be me, but firstly I've grown up with my dad (because my mum didn't really fight for custody (I am glad she didn't, my father is the better role model etc.) - she after all had her new boyfriend (later new husband)) and I've been betrayed by my mother (she stole from me - a significant sum of money), so I am not part of the "a child needs its mother" faction (instead I think that a child needs a good parent, whoever that may be in the end: mother, father, grandparents etc.)
