I can see where you're coming from on that but I don't agree. Terry is just one of those people can't comprehend why someone wouldn't want friends.

And yes, Regulus is creepy, no doubts there. But in more of a "I'm bored out of my skull and slightly demented so you're going to be my next project" kind of way than anything sexual.

I think you're seeing undertones where they're not. Nothing I've seen in that fic is sexual.
