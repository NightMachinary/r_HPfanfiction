I am planning on writing a oneshot based almost exactly on this idea. I talked to someone else about it on this subreddit like a week or two ago. Also not exactly what your looking for but if you want Lily resurrected you can check out my current story (WIP) Linkffn(11707435) . I think people are enjoying it, and I think I'm better than some of the crap I've come across on ff.net but I'm not a top tier writer by any means.
