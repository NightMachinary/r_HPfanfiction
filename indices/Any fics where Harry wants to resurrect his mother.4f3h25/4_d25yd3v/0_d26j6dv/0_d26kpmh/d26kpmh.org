Just a warning. Lily's resurrection is not the main focus of the story and it doesn't happen until pretty much the current update. I'm working on the next chapter now. I'm hoping now that my university term is ending I'll be able to pump out chapters fairly quickly. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11707435/1/Things-Are-Not-Always-As-They-Seem][here]]
