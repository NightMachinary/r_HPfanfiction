  Never let it be said that a Slytherin doesn't know to take hold of an opportunity when it's presented to him on a silver platter.

  [A Fourth Year AU in which Draco makes the most of Potter and Weasley's fight and takes a second shot at befriending Harry. For the Greater Evil, obviously.]

Abandoned, but it's worth a read. Draco does call Ron 'poor' and things, but that's to be expected- there's no Ron bashing, and this is coming from an avid Ron fan. Trust me.

It's been a while since I've read it, but briefly skimming trough the first chapter made me remember that I liked this quite a bit.
