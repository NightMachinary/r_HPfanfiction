Draco has turned out rather differently, perhaps due to the absence of any non-purebloods at Hogwarts to set him off, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). Also, his over-the-top self-importance is treated as a private joke that his friends can see through.

That said, he's basically a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledSympatheticBigot][Troubled Sympathetic Bigot]]. He's been raised with bigoted views, which make Harry internally wince when they come up - but they usually don't, in an all-pureblood (or so Draco thinks) environment, and amongst those whom he considers his peers, he's friendly and even generous. On those occasions when he's confronted with people outside his comfort zone in a way that he can't just ignore, he struggles, but does show signs of being redeemable, eg he does genuinely reflect on how he could easily become a werewolf if he were unlucky enough to be bitten. Although he prefers not to think about it. When he meets Harry as herself, he's very uncomfortable at first to be around a half-blood, but he does later make at least some small steps in the right direction, perhaps mostly for Rigel's sake, but it's a positive sign. As of the end of book four, though, there's no Drarry; he did express interest in "Rigel", but she turned him down.

Also, there's definitely no Weasley bashing. Harry doesn't take on the Weasleys as a surrogate family, but gets along well with every one of them.
