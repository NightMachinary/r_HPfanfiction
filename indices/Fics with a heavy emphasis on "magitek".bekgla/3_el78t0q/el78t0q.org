Only two come to mind:

HPMOR, but not to a very large extent (it's mostly some magical applications of certain science-knowledge), it's not really the main point of the fic, and people either love or really hate the fic.

The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig has a decent amount, and the concept is amazing, but the entire fic is basically a dirge where brief triumphs are rendered moot by ever-greater tragedy. I can only recommend it if you feel like dying inside a little.

Also, it was abandoned at a point that can make sense as an ending, but only a VERY downer one.
