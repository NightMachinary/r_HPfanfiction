My long time favorite is linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by Nonjon). Firefly crossover, but there's plenty of tech and magic, with some zany hijinks.

Also, if you're a fan of Darth Mars, he has a new Battlestar Galactica crossover in progress with plenty of techno-magery. He's about 70k and 17 chapters in, started about 4 months ago. Releasing weekly so far. linkffn(Invincible by Darth Mars)
