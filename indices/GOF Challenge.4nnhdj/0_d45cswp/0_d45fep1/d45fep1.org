That's insane but I love it, although I'd like to see both. Although what is your justification for that? Also who's to stop an outsider from killing Voldemort, a team of powerful wizards, Voldemort can't kill any students nor can he tell anyone to. So these Wizards (who are hired by someone on the outside, Dumbledore can subtly hint at killing Voldemort) attack Voldemort and he's too arrogant to expect that and bam he's dead and because he doesn't compete, he loses his magic and he's no longer a credible threat.
