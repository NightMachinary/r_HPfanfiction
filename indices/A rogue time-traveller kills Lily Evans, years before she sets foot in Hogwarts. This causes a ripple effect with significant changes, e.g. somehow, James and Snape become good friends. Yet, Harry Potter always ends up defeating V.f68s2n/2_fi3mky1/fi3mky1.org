It BECAME an experiment but did not start off as one. It started off as malicious.

His name was Ragetti Crook, a lowlife known internationally (to those with an ear out for such things) as a rather... unique assassin.

*The assassin that stepped through time.*

The Department of Mysteries was already wary of him in principle, as his killings caused changes in time. Ripples that could drastically alter their entire way of life. But, they had no reason to move against him.

Until the Paradox Room, an instrumental part of the Department's scheme for monitoring their timeline, were alerted to a monumental change linked back to a killing Crook had performed.

/The date, July 2nd 1966. The victim: six year old Lily Evans./

The residents of the Paradox Room panicked. Harry Potter's parents on the list of those who had to be protected at all costs. The Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, without James or Lily he wouldn't be born. THUS the Dark Lord would not be defeated. Everything was put on hold to put this right.

However things got... strange when the resident Unspeakable went to the Head of their Department to requisition Hit-Wizards to catch Crook and revert the timeline.

Harry Potter did exist, and he defeated Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts. Exactly when and how he was supposed to...

He'd actually recently been seen with his dear friend Colin Creevey at Fortescue's, enjoying a banana splir. The Boy Wh Lived finally free of the shadows of war.

From what they knew of him, he was the same as he'd always been. Gifted at Defense, the wielder of the Elder wand and looking exactly like his father James.

With his mothers blonde hair, greyish/blue eyes and being two years younger than he was supposed to be.

With those exceptions, with further studies, more came to light. His parentage had obviously changed, but the Dark Lord had failed to target the Potter's in 1981 as there was no destined child there with James and Narcissa. He instead slaughtered the family at Spinner's End in December of 1983, where the family of three was meeting with suspected Death Eater Severus Snape, the spell reflecting off of the newly orphaned child and his fathers friend sent to Azkaban for "leading them into a trap".

They of course thoroughly gathered information on all further changes from that point onwards, as was expected of them, and compiled them for later study. Crook was captured in a sting and Lily rescued. The timeline reverted and the Paradox Room looked out on all things normal.

She died a second time, this time at age eight on the 1st of February. However the time traveller in question did so under orders from his government (not a former Death Eater) and made sure to assassinate Lily at a later date so as to avoid crossover with the previous attempt.

Under strict orders, intelligence was gathered. Harry James Potter was born a year prior in this timeline, the eldest of five when his father James accidentally impregnated an upper-classman Alice Trent (better known as Longbottom in the prime timeline). Whereas the family was attacked, the Potter's were able to escape when tipped off by Snape that the Dark Lord was coming. The Dark Lord annihilated in a trap and no child bearing the moniker of "Boy Who Lived" in this timeline at all.

Yet, in May of 1998, Voldemort stormed Hogwarts castle and fell at the wand of Harry James Potter. Just as he had in the Prime timeline. Just as he had in the timeline where Harry was born the son of Narcissa Black.

This continued, every action leading to the same outcome. 2nd of May 1998, Harry Potter defeated Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Due to bureaucracy, they were limited with the changes they could make, but found the most interesting results when James Potter was targeted.

In the first timeline they attempted James's murder, the Hit-Wizard squad was violently rebuffed by a mixture of the timelines Aurors and some unknown force.

They were successful on the third attempt.

On their return to the modern day, they found the world was blitzed by an unknown calamity that the Paradox Room residents were the only survivors of. Forced to return on time themselves to put a halt to the murder.

They instead tried more subtle approaches...

*/▪︎ An infertility potion given to Potter was somehow ignored when Lily and James conceived exactly when they should have./*

*/▪︎Castration lead to the couple urged to study alchemy and blood magic to create offspring. Seeing results five years after Harry was due to be born./*

*/▪︎ An enchantment to alter James Potter's sexual preference initially failed in the face of Lily Evans, but eventually succeeded (in another timeline) where he entered a relationship with Remus Lupin. He was then assaulted by a lovestruck Delores Umbridge who conceived a child she would call Harry James./*

*/▪︎ A series of transfiguration's on Euphemia Potter's developing offspring lead to Jamie Potter's birth. The young woman mothering Harry James after a fling with Sirius Black./*

They were convinced long before this point, but it only, truly hit home at this point.

Harry Potter's birth was a requirement. Almost an inevitability (had the few successes where they prevented it not said otherwise) where the times he did not exist were subject to a tragedy on a far greater scale than Voldemort.

A cosmic force. Some feat of magic. Something (or even someone) decreed that James Potter [in whatever form he was in] would give birth to a child named Harry James Potter, who would kill the Dark Lord Voldemort on the 2nd of May 1998.

Yes, something was going on here. And whatever it was had just made it clear it wanted them to stop...
