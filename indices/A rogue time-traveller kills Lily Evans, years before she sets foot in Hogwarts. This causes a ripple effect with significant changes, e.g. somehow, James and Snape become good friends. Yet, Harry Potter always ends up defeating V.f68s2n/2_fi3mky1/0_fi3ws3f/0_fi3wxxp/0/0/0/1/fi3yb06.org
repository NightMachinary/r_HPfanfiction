The way I see it, in my version of the prompt, no matter what happens in the timeline something conspires to ensure the following: Harry Potter is born, the Battle of Hogwarts occurs on the 2nd of May 1998 AND he kills Voldemort during that battle.

It'd be interesting to see the Unspeakables try and fiddle with getting rid of Hogwarts and/or forcing the Battle to occur somewhere else and failing just as they did when meddling with James.
