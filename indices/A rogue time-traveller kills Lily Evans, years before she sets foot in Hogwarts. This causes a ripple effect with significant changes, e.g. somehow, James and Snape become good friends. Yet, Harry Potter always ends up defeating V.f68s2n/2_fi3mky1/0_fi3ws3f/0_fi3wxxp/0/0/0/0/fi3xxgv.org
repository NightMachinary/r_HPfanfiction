I said they were limited in what they could change (by their higher ups) for a reason. So they don't viciously alter the timeline.

Thus, in their limited scope of experiments they got their results. If they tried to alter it further (e.g. kill Voldemort as a child/stop Hogwarts from being founded etc.) I dunno. Maybe the 'mysterious force' would lash out at them, maybe their superiors would have a go at them for fundamentally altering Wizarding history.

I can see, for the purpose of the experiment, them wanting to try that. Maybe an alternate route would be that, if Voldemort wasn't born then Harry wouldn't be either. I can see them being allowed to get away with that.

But there are too many pieces to manipulate to completely stop the Battle of Hogwarts that I don't think they could do it even if they were allowed. There is no one or two things they can do to stop it that doesn't cross a big line (e.g. if they nuked Hogwarts they probably couldn't battle there, but maybe Tom would still want to kill Harry in the smouldering crater of his home).
