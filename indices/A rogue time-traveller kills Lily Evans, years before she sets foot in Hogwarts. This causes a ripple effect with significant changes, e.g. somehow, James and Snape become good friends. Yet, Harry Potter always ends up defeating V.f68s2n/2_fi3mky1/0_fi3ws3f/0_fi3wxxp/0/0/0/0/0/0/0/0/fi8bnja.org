Just as " Something (or even someone) decreed that James Potter(in whatever form he was in) would give birth to a child named Harry James Potter, who would kill the Dark Lord Voldemort on the 2nd of May, 1998." it would probably also be decreed that a child named Tom Marvolo Riddle would be born in the 31st of December, 1926, destined to try to take the wizarding world within his grasp, committing genocide in the process. No matter the circumstances. Decrees like this don't just happen, and they require a lot of careful planning and highly precise execution. there's a reason why all roads lead to god damn Rome.
