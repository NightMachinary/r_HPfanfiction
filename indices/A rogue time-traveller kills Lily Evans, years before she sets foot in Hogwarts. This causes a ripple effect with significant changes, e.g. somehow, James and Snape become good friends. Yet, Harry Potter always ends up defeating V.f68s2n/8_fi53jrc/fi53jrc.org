In one of the many universes across the infinity of space and time, Harry Potter -son of James and Lily Potter- was destined to bring down the fearsome Dark Lord known as Lord Voldemort. His amazing feat would spawn multiple universes with the same formula, only slightly altered by small details, for it was a milestone in the history of humanity.

But not in this universe.

The early demise of one Lily Evans destroyed all hopes for the brave young hero to be born, sealing away the opportunity of his story to told once again.

But...

Destiny would always find her way around.

After all, the title of "Dark Lord vanquisher" was not given to the infant after the amazing deed, but instead, long before his birth. It was a wish, or rather, the cumulation of many wishes from the wizarding people that gave birth to a hero. It was their yearnings for the war to end, for their deceased ones to be avenged, for a man strong enough to stand against him, that bestowed such a heavy burden on the existence known as "Lord Voldemort's slayer". His background was irrelevant as long as the timing was correct, for destiny would take care of everything that followed.

And this was the case, in a world where James Potter would never meet a fiery red-headed girl. His life would go on as usual, not knowing his wife of many timelines was taken from him by a rogue time-traveller. He met his life-long friends, pulled pranks and eventually fell in love a with a sharp blonde girl in his last days of school. His wife, intelligent as she was, would find a way to evade the clutches of the Dark Lord and secure their lives long enough for Harry to grow up knowing his parents. But alas, destiny would call and claim their lives as per it was written in the stars, and the young Harry Potter would rise from the depths of hell and vanquish the Dark Lord as usual, for it was his purpose as an existence after all. No matter his lineage, age or gender, Harry Potter was fated to kill the Dark Lord.
