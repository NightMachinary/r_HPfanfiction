Seeing him struggle, and despite his friends remarks against it, James plucks up third year Severus Snape and refuses to leave his side.

After three years with Sirius he has a very vague idea as to why Snape flinches at contact and why he's so reluctant to talk about his father.

Summer comes, James invites himself over to Spinners End, accompanied by his mother when she is uncomfortable with just leaving her baby in an unknown Muggle neighbourhood. As luck would have it, Mr Snape is there and has no qualms in trying to intimidate and assault the older woman that is Euphemia Potter.

A costly mistake.

Thus, when Sirius runs away from home in 6th year, he goes to the Potter's where a divorced Miss Prince and her son Severus have been living with them for nearly two years at that point.

Snape and Sirius are a bit snippy with one another, always at each others throats, but you would be a liar if you said that Severus and Sirius weren't best friends, just as all the Marauders should be.
