Attempt No. 7669

Everything should have been accounted for. Both James and Lily are dead, as are their parents and grandparents. Voldemort has been subjected to so many procedures his power approaches that of a god. Hogwarts has been destroyed via alchemical warhead.

Yet, Harry Potter was born. The child of a forgotten squib in the Potter line, we found and captured him. Killing him is not advised (see attempts 30-176), so we bound his soul and destroyed his magic, then set Voldemort on his trail.

During their "battle", Voldemort had a sudden onset of mental flux (common in those so powerful) ,and while concentrating to clear it, the boy took his wand. A surge of accidental magic (apparently, Hades Extract doesn't work on mudbloods, how /convenient/) channeled through a wand connected by destiny, and Voldemort's momentarily disabled defenses, meant my lord was no more.

I give up, let someone else try their hand at this.
