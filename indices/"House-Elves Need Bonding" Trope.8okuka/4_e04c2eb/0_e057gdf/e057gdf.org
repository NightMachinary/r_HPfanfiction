  There doesn't seem to be any close mythological matches to house-elves that could explain what their psychology is based on, either. The closest might be the brownie which work secretly and refuse clothes, but those are notably free and leave when offended, something that enslaved house-elves can't do.

That's what I kept thinking, too. It might just be that elves have to have a home - we see one tending a bar, and I suppose that means 'public house' is house enough - but they don't have to be slaves.

They've just taken to acting that way so they don't get given clothes, as whatever it is that lets them make a house their home is broken by that particular act, an act that causes distress to elves that are not abused and not ridden with the house-elf equivalent of Stockholm Syndrome (hence the difference between Dobby and Kreacher). It's not universal, either, as the bar-elf at the Blind Pig doesn't display any kind of obsequiousness.

What we /do/ see is that elves that are given clothes find themselves a new home as quick as they can, whether or not they're happy about being kicked out of their former homes - Dobby is, Winky isn't. In both cases we see, it's Hogwarts. Even Kreacher ends up there when Harry stops treating Grimmauld Place as his home.

I'm of the view that wizards are massively missing a trick with House Elves, holding the power to kick them out over the poor wee blighters to reduce them to slavery. Kreacher becomes a /lot/ more useful with a bit of decent treatment, after all, and he was the most brutalised elf we see.
