Well, the reason house-elves are indentured unpaid domestic servants in canon is never really explained. The closest we get is Hermione's SPEW being poo-pooed by a handful of characters, so I guess a bunch of fanfic writers extrapolate from that to get 'enslaving elves is okay' whilst conveniently forgetting about how Dobby, Winky, and Kreacher are all physically/emotionally abused.

I guess giving Harry Dobby as a slave lets him break various canon magic rules (apparating in Hogwarts, doing whatchamacallit) without having a character who outshines him; Dobby's just a slave, after all, he doesn't need characterization beyond 'I want to serve Master Harry!'.

There doesn't seem to be any close mythological matches to house-elves that could explain what their psychology is based on, either. The closest might be the brownie which work secretly and refuse clothes, but those are notably free and leave when offended, something that enslaved house-elves can't do.

It did occur to me a few minutes ago that maybe elves/house-elves just have different ethics than humans do, considering themselves as belonging to a specific area of land/a building and being responsible for protecting everyone and everything within that place, but that doesn't explain why they would be slaves to humans and vulnerable to being abused, rather than benevolent household spirits.
