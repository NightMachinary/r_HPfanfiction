  I dunno, it's just weird that it's supposed to be such a simple thing but Hermione didn't find it in any book.

This post is a perfect example of how it could happen, actually.

It completely goes against all your assumptions about the way life works, therefore you're likely to just ignore the possibility completely. Is it really so unbelievable that Hermoine, fueled by outrage, would ignore anything that doesn't already fit her worldview? It's not outside of the realm of possibility for /magical creatures/ to be bred to require bondage. It's not impossible for elves that have already been bonded for most of their lives to be unable to live independently. Both could be true regardless of their treatment outside that.

It exists because it gives the author room to work in. "The world would be perfect if somebody with my exact mindset fixed everything" is boring as fuck in fiction if used without any serious examination. Moreover, "slavery is bad" isn't a particularly complex moral issue, so it just devolves into moral crusader wank material within minutes. It's much more interesting for characters to have to deal with a system which is inherently unfair and imperfect. Besides, if it wasn't the case that house elves needed to be bonded, you just open up the doors for whining about how the characters aren't dropping what they're doing to stop some travesty against a handful of plot devices and derailing the story completely.

The only time elves should not have such a trait is in a story exploring the weight of independence, and I'm not sure an HP fanfic is a particularly good place to do that in.
