  It completely goes against all your assumptions about the way life works, therefore you're likely to just ignore the possibility completely. Is it really so unbelievable that Hermoine, fueled by outrage, would ignore anything that doesn't already fit her worldview? It's not outside of the realm of possibility for magical creatures to be bred to require bondage

This is exactly the opposite. The position of elves are that way because wizards assume that's how things have to be, that was Hermione's point which Ron aptly proved. Elves aren't bred (nor suggested to have been) and they aren't magical creatures. They're categorized (legally) as "beings", just like wizards. In canon, Dobby had no ill effects to being freed. Winky even makes clear that all that would happen is Dobby would have ended up in front of the Elf Liason (because elves going around asking for payment is deemed bad by society). Yes, I'm aware you aren't saying it's canon, but they end up rewriting parts of canon to make this work so it seems like they just like the idea. Anyway, the bit of me you quoted was more about the fact that it's not even mentioned. If it were that simple, she wouldn't (as I so often see) be completely unaware that purebloods believed bonding was necessary for them to live.

This is where the stupidity of this trope is evident. You complain that it would otherwise be moral crusader-y wank, but there's no middle ground here. The whole point of this trope is to make it OK to have a slave, but all they really does is end up in this weird moral relativism that most people want to avoid, but to try and avoid it they make their story universes transparently shoddy. Like it's literally "We have to keep the slaves or the slaves will die!" That's far stupider than "owning slaves is bad."

This simple solution is to just ditch the bonding crap and just offer them a job. But half of these end up flipping Dobby away from wanting wages so it goes to the slavery thing again. It's just a consequence of inconsistent desires for a story. The MC must be morally top tier and high class, thus need a house-elf. But having nearly total control of another sentient being's actions is extremely creepy, so the conflict is deep.
