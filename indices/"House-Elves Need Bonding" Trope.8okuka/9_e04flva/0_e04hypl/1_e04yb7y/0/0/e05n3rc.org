  I'm sure you think it makes sense to go around calling those you see as equal "creatures". /s
#+end_quote

I wasn't saying to call them magical creatures congratulations on the strawmen argument. I was saying they are magical creatures which you explicitly said "they aren't magical creatures."

#+begin_quote
  Yea, slaves get a home and you get free labor. Mutual benefits! I know I'm being snarky, but come on this is silly
#+end_quote

Sure that's an opinion to have, but the trope works because a majority don't find it silly.

#+begin_quote
  trope is so contrived to make owning elves morally OK so the morality of the MC isn't questionable
#+end_quote

If the way you're saying the reasoning is given to the reader is contrived, than every explanation is contrived. The fact is, not all information is written down in a book. Some of it just occurs because that is how society progressed. That could have been how it happened and that is why someone needs to tell Hermione, in the fic you're referencing.

#+begin_quote
  You misunderstand. I didn't say rewrite everything so all the elves are workers. I said if you want your MC to have an elf on hand and still be good, just make them have an elf as a worker. This is literally canon, e.g. Dobby at Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Fair enough, but then it becomes where would you get the house elves? Do they have a community that you can go to so that you could hire one? If you're saying just use a throwaway "oh I hired the elf" that doesn't do anything for the story except make it so the morality of the MC isn't questionable, which is what the trope does the exact same of, with more open ended questions. If its a subplot within the story, yea sure go wild, but if it isn't a major part, that doesn't need to be explored, why waste time on it.

  Hermione wants to free the elf. X (often Harry, maybe Draco) says "Actually elves need to be bonded or they die". Therefore, owning them is not actually a bad thing to do.
#+end_quote

I'm not arguing that owning slaves isn't a bad thing. If that is how it reads in your specific recommendation sure, but that isn't how it is always used. If you're arguing about your specific fic that you're reading, I agree with you. I'm just talking about the trope as a whole. Sometime it is used to get Hermione to stop trying to free the elf because it will kill them. It would be to prevent her from committing genocide. How is that silly?

#+begin_quote
  Elves almost cannot disobey.
#+end_quote

You misunderstood because that is my point. I am saying that not having the ability to disobey is what makes it slavery, not the fact that people can order them around a specific way.
