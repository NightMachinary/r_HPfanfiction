  Wrong. They are magical creatures. "Loyal magical creatures bound to their owners as servants for life." Every magical being is a magical creature, but not every magical creature is a magical being. Yes that includes wizards and witches.

I'm sure you think it makes sense to go around calling those you see as equal "creatures". /s

  The needing bond trope generally shows it as mutualistic relationship. That and Winky gets fired for not doing her job properly. I don't think slave owners release their slaves for not completing the job. Not sure how it is stupider than owning slaves is bad. Maybe I'm off, but wouldn't a majority of people want to save the lives of another if they could with nearly no cost to them? "We have to do X or X will die" is a pretty familiar concept in everything, so not sure how that is stupider than "owning slaves is bad" its a rationale explanation.

Yea, slaves get a home and you get free labor. Mutual benefits! I know I'm being snarky, but come on this is silly. The point is the trope is so contrived to make owning elves morally OK so the morality of the MC isn't questionable. We know elves don't need to be owned in canon, so making up explanations for why they do in fanon is silly

  This is not a simpler solution than the bond trope. If it becomes a house-elf job thing, then there becomes a shit ton of inconsistencies that have to be accounted for. Nearly the entirety of the second/fifth-seventh book would play out differently. The bond trope allows you to stick more closely to canon.
#+end_quote

You misunderstand. I didn't say rewrite everything so all the elves are workers. I said if you want your MC to have an elf on hand and still be good, just make them have an elf as a worker. This is literally canon, e.g. Dobby at Hogwarts.

  I don't read the trope as explaining that slavery is good, it's just used as a way of explaining why house elves don't want to be free.
#+end_quote

Except the general structure is: Hermione wants to free the elf. X (often Harry, maybe Draco) says "Actually elves need to be bonded or they die". Therefore, owning them is not actually a bad thing to do. That's the whole point of it, that's why it gets brought up in stories to begin with.

#+begin_quote
  More of a personal thing, but this isn't true. The part that makes them a slave is them not being able to leave, not that they can be ordered around like that. People get ordered around all the time even now, the reason they aren't slaves, is because they can leave in theory.
#+end_quote

You know this is BS. Elves almost cannot disobey. Magic forces them to physically comply unless they find a loophole in the order, and if they fail they're forced to hurt themselves (or have been so thoroughly brainwashed that they do so). That's not even comparable to what you mentioned.
