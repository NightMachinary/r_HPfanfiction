Not saying owning slaves is a good thing.

#+begin_quote
  Elves aren't bred (nor suggested to have been) and they aren't magical creatures
#+end_quote

Wrong. They are magical creatures. "Loyal magical creatures bound to their owners as servants for life." Every magical being is a magical creature, but not every magical creature is a magical being. Yes that includes wizards and witches.

#+begin_quote
  Like it's literally "We have to keep the slaves or the slaves will die!" That's far stupider than "owning slaves is bad."
#+end_quote

The needing bond trope generally shows it as mutualistic relationship. That and Winky gets fired for not doing her job properly. I don't think slave owners release their slaves for not completing the job. Not sure how it is stupider than owning slaves is bad. Maybe I'm off, but wouldn't a majority of people want to save the lives of another if they could with nearly no cost to them? "We have to do X or X will die" is a pretty familiar concept in everything, so not sure how that is stupider than "owning slaves is bad" its a rationale explanation.

#+begin_quote
  This simple solution is to just ditch the bonding crap and just offer them a job.
#+end_quote

This is not a simpler solution than the bond trope. If it becomes a house-elf job thing, then there becomes a shit ton of inconsistencies that have to be accounted for. Nearly the entirety of the second/fifth-seventh book would play out differently. The bond trope allows you to stick more closely to canon.

#+begin_quote
  The MC must be morally top tier and high class, thus need a house-elf
#+end_quote

Morally top tier MC's are for the lighter fanfics. The trope is evident even in grey/darker MC fics. I don't read the trope as explaining that slavery is good, it's just used as a way of explaining why house elves don't want to be free. Sure it could be brainwashing, but if it isn't a major focus of the story, it's a decent trope to use as a throwaway explanation.

For the high class part, it's been stated that house elves usually are part of old manors, castles, etc that type of stuff. It makes sense that house elves are for the high class.

ETA:

#+begin_quote
  Maybe the method of freeing them need to start subtly, but anyone you can order around like that is, in no uncertain terms, a slave
#+end_quote

More of a personal thing, but this isn't true. The part that makes them a slave is them not being able to leave, not that they can be ordered around like that. People get ordered around all the time even now, the reason they aren't slaves, is because they can leave in theory.
