  but they end up rewriting parts of canon to make this work so it seems like they just like the idea.

Like I said,

  Besides, if it wasn't the case that house elves needed to be bonded, you just open up the doors for whining about how the characters aren't dropping what they're doing to stop some travesty against a handful of plot devices and derailing the story completely.

It comes down one of two options:

- Elves are not biologically inclined to be servants or slaves. Now good characters are morally obligated to fight that slavery, therefore the story must be sidelined to deal with the slavery, or they're not morally consistent characters.

- Elves are biologically inclined to be servants or slaves. Now the reader is upset because it's just "an excuse to allow slavery."

Like how it's completely believable for Hermoine to ignore any evidence contrary to her position, your purpose here seems to be to find excuses to validate yours and ignore any argument in which literature can offend your sensibilities without being morally repugnant or "inconsistent." It's a fictional world with fictional rules that exists /only/ for the purpose of telling an interesting story. If that means elves have to be bonded for the sake of telling that story, there's nothing wrong with that. Because elves don't come to life by being written and literature doesn't exist to serve your sensibilities.
