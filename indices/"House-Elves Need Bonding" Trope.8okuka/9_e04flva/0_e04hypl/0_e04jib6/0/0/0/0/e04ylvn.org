  Hermione, despite reading and knowing damn near everything, does not know this. She gets informed that they need the bond, and thus accepts it. It's a story logic gap. If it were obvious in one's story, there's no need to have this weird misunderstanding on her part. It's not presented as her ignoring contrary information, the idea is usually she just didn't know it

It is possible that it some things are passed down as norm through the culture and not is not written down. I'm pretty sure even in our everyday lives we do things because that is how society dictates it and it isn't written down somewhere.

  But it's much ado about nothing if there's a simple alternative

Is the simple alternative it is a job? That leaves a few questions to be answered, such as why don't the house elves just leave, or why they are scared to leave. You're referencing a specific story so I don't know where it starts, but if it starts after Winky, it would need some sort of reason why Winky went full crazy for being fired, and why it would be so hard for Dobby to find job for pay.

The bond trope is definitely a easier explanation than any alternatives out there atm. Part of it has to do with it being so well established.
