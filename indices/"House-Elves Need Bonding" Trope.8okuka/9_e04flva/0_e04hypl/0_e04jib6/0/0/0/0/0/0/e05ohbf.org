  And yet no one says it until the MC conveniently mentions it?
#+end_quote

That's how it works? Who else would you want to mention it? Sure it could be someone else, but the MC is the MC for a reason. Do you want it to happen off scene?

#+begin_quote
  And basically any book summarizing information about house elves would mention it.
#+end_quote

Possible, or at the same time it just doesn't.

To play it out, let's say the book does summarize about it, the MC hires an elf and Hermione goes ahead and tries to free them all. Now you need a back story to how they hired the elf and some sort of society for elves. If it happens off screen, that is lazy because it plays against the norm. If it happens on screen, you have to make sure you're filling up every plot hole you just opened up. That's a lot of extra work if it isn't a major or minor issue of the story.

If the book doesn't summarize it and you want to make it a hire and not slavery, same problem as above.

If the book doesn't summarize about it because it just is something everyone knows but doesn't write down and it is a lighter MC with the story not focused about house elves, now you need a way to make the MC owning a house elf morally justified without it being a hire.

  To pretend they wouldn't is like saying books about goblins written by wizards won't mention treasure or rebellions
#+end_quote

We don't know if it mentions their treasure, just rebellions. For all we know, the books don't mention what goblins consider treasure.

#+begin_quote
  Just have the MC offer an elf a job.
#+end_quote

Honestly, this isn't the simpler alternatives because it creates issues. I'm not saying you shouldn't use it as the alternative, just that it isn't simpler. By hiring an elf, you need to create a backstory, that's just how it works. I haven't read a fic where it was as simple as 'MC hires elves no questions how' because why else would there be house-elf slaves.

#+begin_quote
  Dobby was obviously surviving without a "bond".
#+end_quote

Can we at least agree that Dobby is definitely an outlier of an house elf. Sure he was surviving, but how do we know that without the bond, a house elf won't go crazy? Winky could be used as a demonstration for either way to be honest. Without the bond, her being ashamed could have been magnified and she went off tilt for all we know. A majority of the elves we see in canon tend to be a little crazed. The fact is a majority of the elves that we know of (Hogwart's elves) do not want to be freed and there has to be some reason for that. I think there is a very good chance they were brainwashed into being enslaved, but that doesn't mean the trope isn't a different possible reason.

Yes the bond is established fanon, but not it is not unnecessary or contrived for what it's intended to do. It is intended to be a extremely simple way to morally justify an MC having a house elf without creating a backstory or plot holes.

ETA:

Meant to ask, where are you going with the spell enslavement reason. If that is why house elves are slaves and you want your MC to hire an elf, still need a backstory of how you're getting elves that can be hired in the first place which can create issues.
