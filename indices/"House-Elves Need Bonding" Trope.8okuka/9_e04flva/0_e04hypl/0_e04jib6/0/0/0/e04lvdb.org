  No, it's the readers who demand it. For the sake of "consistency" and "internal logic," which cannot be resolved unless the slavery issue is addressed in the precise way the reader believes their real-world morality should be reflected in a fictional world.

I don't see that. I certainly don't think "Ah, there's a problem of Harry has to solve it." I mean, goblins aren't allow wands but that doesn't mean it needs to be focused on. That's just part of the world and may get changed. We know he has something rather more important in the books.

  You admitting the argument being made is correct, you're just mixing it up because you're making the exact same potentially incorrect assumption as she would. The argument being made is that Hermoine would automatically assume that "elves must be bonded for their own sake" was an excuse. If it actually was true, it wouldn't matter, because she would still read it as an excuse.

You really are misunderstanding. The stories I'm referencing essentially say this. Elves have to be bonded. This is an obvious fact in-story. Hermione, despite reading and knowing damn near everything, does not know this. She gets informed that they need the bond, and thus accepts it. It's a story logic gap. If it were obvious in one's story, there's no need to have this weird misunderstanding on her part. It's not presented as her ignoring contrary information, the idea is usually she just didn't know it

It'd be like "Actually Dumbledore, Horcruxes can be destroyed by shitting on them when the planets aline and you have a bucket of selkie intestines balanced on your head. Did you /really/ not read /The Guide to Destroying Horcruxes/ by Jesus Christ???"

The authors obviously accept that elves are in a rough spot and intentionally tell us why it's ok. But it's much ado about nothing if there's a simple alternative that doesn't leave the MC with "I need the slaves and they need me".
