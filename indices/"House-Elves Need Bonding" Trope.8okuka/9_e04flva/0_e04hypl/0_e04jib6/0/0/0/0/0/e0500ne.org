  It is possible that it some things are passed down as norm through the culture and not is not written down. I'm pretty sure even in our everyday lives we do things because that is how society dictates it and it isn't written down somewhere.

And yet no one says it until the MC conveniently mentions it? And basically any book summarizing information about house elves would mention it. To pretend they wouldn't is like saying books about goblins written by wizards won't mention treasure or rebellions.

  Is the simple alternative it is a job? That leaves a few questions to be answered, such as why don't the house elves just leave, or why they are scared to leave ...but if it starts after Winky, it would need some sort of reason why Winky went full crazy for being fired, and why it would be so hard for Dobby to find job for pay.

What? My point wasn't that all elves should be rewritten to be workers. It's that if you want you're MC to be believably good yet have an elf around, the bond thing is the most contrived way of doing so. Just have the MC offer an elf a job. The problem with dobby was that other wizards did not think elves should be paid. That's exactly the problem, elves don't need a bond, wizards demonstrably just view them as inferior so don't like it. Dobby was obviously surviving without a "bond". Winky didn't go down hill because she lacked a bond, but because she was ashamed of having been freed, especially so publilcally. This is in GoF, Dobby says it outright. The bond is established fanon, but it's contrived and unnecessary for what it's intended to do.
