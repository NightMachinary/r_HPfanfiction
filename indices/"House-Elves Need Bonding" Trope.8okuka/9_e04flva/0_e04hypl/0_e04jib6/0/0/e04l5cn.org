  I don't see this at all. No series suggests the characters have to solve every problem. Even in canon where it's clear elves are brainwashed slaves, their plight is not suggested to require Harry to end, and he even agrees with the goal!

No, it's the /readers/ who demand it. For the sake of "consistency" and "internal logic," which cannot be resolved unless the slavery issue is addressed in the precise way the reader believes their real-world morality should be reflected in a fictional world.

  But it's not. That behavior is OOC. If anything, Hermione would voice that "I can't believe wizard would perpetrated the idea that elves have to be bonded". Mockery of a norm she despises is much more in character. But really, you keep mistating my point. I took issue in my OP with people trying to pass off the idea that Hermione hadn't even read that elves had to be bonded. If the issue were so simple she would know.

You admitting the argument being made is correct, you're just mixing it up because you're making the exact same potentially incorrect assumption as she would. The argument being made is that Hermoine would automatically assume that "elves must be bonded for their own sake" was an excuse. If it /actually was true,/ it wouldn't matter, because she would still read it as an excuse.
