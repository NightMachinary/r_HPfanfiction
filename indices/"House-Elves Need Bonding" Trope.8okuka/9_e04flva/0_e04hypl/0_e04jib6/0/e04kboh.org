  Elves are not biologically inclined to be servants or slaves. Now good characters are morally obligated to fight that slavery, therefore the story must be sidelined to deal with the slavery, or they're not morally consistent characters.

  Elves are biologically inclined to be servants or slaves. Now the reader is upset because it's just "an excuse to allow slavery."

I don't see this at all. No series suggests the characters have to solve every problem. Even in canon where it's clear elves are brainwashed slaves, their plight is not suggested to require Harry efforts to end it, and he even agrees with the goal!

  Like how it's completely believable for Hermoine to ignore any evidence contrary to her position, your purpose here seems to be to find excuses to validate yours and ignore any argument in which literature can offend your sensibilities without being morally repugnant or "inconsistent."

But it's not. That behavior is OOC. If anything, Hermione would voice that "I can't believe wizards have perpetrated the idea that elves have to be bonded to live". Mockery of a norm she despises is much more in character. She didn't ignore the existence of the /Tales of Beedle and the Bard/ to dismiss the existence of the Hallows, she tried to discredit the idea and evidence that suggested they didn't exist ("Wouldn't Dumbledore have told you?" Etc.)

But really, you keep mistating my point. I took issue in my OP with people trying to pass off the idea that Hermione hadn't even read that elves had to be bonded. If the issue were so simple she would know because purebloods would have mentioned it in passing.

  Because elves don't come to life by being written and literature doesn't exist to serve your sensibilities.

You are confusing me taking issue with story logic with moral condemnation. People can write these, but they end up in such tortured logic that it seems too silly to bother with. Need a good, rich MC with an elf? The elf works for him. Bam, solved; they have a magic Butler instead of magic serf. Most of them don't need the bonding for anything more than that, it's just a status thing in-universe.
