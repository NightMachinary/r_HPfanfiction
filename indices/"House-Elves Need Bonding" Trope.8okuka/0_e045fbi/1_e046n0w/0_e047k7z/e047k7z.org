True, but what I mean is that the magical contract of obedience that you can free an Elf from with clothes is /all/ there is --- these individual bonds, which only force obedience in deeds, not actual enthusiastic mindset (as evidenced by Dobby and, precisely, Kreacher). What I'm arguing is that non-Dobby freed House-Elves' depression is just a cultural thing, not the result of psychological bonds.
