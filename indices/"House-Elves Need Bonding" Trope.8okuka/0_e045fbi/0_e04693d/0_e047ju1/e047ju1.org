You don't quite get what I'm saying. Of /course/ there's a magical slavery in place that forces the Elves to serve whoever is officially their Master until they're given clothes. But I'm arguing that these individual bonds, which only force obedience, not actual enthusiastic mindset (as evidenced by Dobby and, precisely, Kreacher), are /all/ there is. What I'm arguing is that non-Dobby freed House-Elves' depression is just a cultural thing, not the result of psychological bonds.
