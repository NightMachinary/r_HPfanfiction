Lots of people seek or sought escape in the magical world of Harry Potter. If you pop their bubbles, they will be very angry.

I think JKR has conflicting attitude towards the world she created. On one hand, she seems to relish its fantastic aspects, especially in the first two books. But beginning with PoA, she appears to take a fundamentally different approach, as she began depicting a magical government that was a SHITHOLE of bigotry, corruption, cruelty, incompetence, injustice, malice, and stupidity. The mainstream media of that world would make Daily Mail, Bild, or National Enquirer reputable in comparison. Only the Soviet Pravda could be possibly worse.
