Well, some people simply don't want to acknowledge that canon Wizarding Britain is a fucked up slaver society - and, worse, that only Hermione realises that and wants to do something about it. Can't have the mudblood actually be right and everyone else, especially the noble purebloods, be wrong, so they make up shit to explain why slavery is a-ok if it's elves and not humans - knowingly or unknowingly echoing all the drivel slavery apologists spewed in the 19h century.
