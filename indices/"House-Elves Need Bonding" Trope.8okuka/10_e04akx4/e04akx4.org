I don't find it strange at all. Evil, nasty wizardses oppressing poor hobbitses, I mean, house-elves, is such a fucking overdone idea that even reading canon at 10 years old I found it mind-numbingly boring.

I want the magical world to be different. And, sure, some themes of prejudice and what is right and wrong should remain, but, in my opinion, house-elves can take one for the team and become a masochistic, labor-loving race in need of torture and oppression in order to fulfill their little perverted desires.
