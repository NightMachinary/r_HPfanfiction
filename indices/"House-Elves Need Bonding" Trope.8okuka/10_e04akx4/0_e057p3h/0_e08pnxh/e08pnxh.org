...Erm, yes? This is an odd complaint. That aside, it's not even pertinent to my post. These stories simply use such a contrived method to make owning someone OK (so the elf can be nearby) when there are simpler solutions that also exist in canon (i.e. hiring an elf). It's just silly and is used in a way that creates numerous gaps in the logic of the story.

The being addressed by surname thing is.a stupid complaint on the part of those who make it. I mean, teachers do it all the time, even in HP, so it doesn't even sense for them to make some kind of appeal to equality...
