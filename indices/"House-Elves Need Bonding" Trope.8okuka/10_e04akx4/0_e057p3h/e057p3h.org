I think it's mostly Americans who have such an enormous stigma about slavery that they think any moral character should strive to free the house-elves no matter what.

Another thing I suspect is an Americanism is Harry insisting on being called "just Harry" by random goblins and house-elves and whatever else, because /of course/ every being must be equal and live in happy diverse harmony.

(For the record, I don't disagree with the sentiment, but addressing Harry as "Mr. Potter" is merely a sign of respect and politeness rather than him oppressing those poor goblins).
