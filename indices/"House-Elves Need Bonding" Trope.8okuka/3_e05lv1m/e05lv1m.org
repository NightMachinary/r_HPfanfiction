This might be slightly off topic here, but I've been rereading the series and a few things stood out to me about House Elves, particularly their self comparisons to Goblins (this happens between Winky and Dobby in book 4 she says something about being like a common goblin) and the way they're described with certain physical similarities (small stature, large-bat-like ears, long fingers) it occurred to me that it was potential that the common House Elf could have been literally domesticated from Goblins over the course of several centuries, perhaps with magical assistance. (this makes sense because house elves are even smaller, have larger eyes, less intimidating teeth, and floppier ears: mirroring real world differences between dogs and wolves)

On that note, a maledictus could be easily be present. I think it's clear the house elves are heavily indoctrinated, and that that is somehow magically enforced. I don't think Dobby was compelled to continue beating himself for disobeying the Malfoys after being freed (also book 4 I believe in the same scene down in the kitchen) when he told Harry they were ‘bad dark wizards' and then had to smash his face against a table until a human (Harry) stopped him.

It seemed like some sort of compulsion brought on by magic. As if Dobby had been living impiriused his whole life and had pulled a few decades worth of Barty Crouch JR stunts to be able to work through it. Now I wouldn't say it's as simple as that because you can't put the imperius curse on an entire population, so I think maledictus would be a more likely thing but that seems like an unusual thing for a maledictus to do. Have we ever heard of anything like that in canon?

Because it's clear there's some sort of magical binding contract passed down generation by generation that comes with the propaganda built in on such a base level that it should never be possible to question it. Giving magical folk an entire race of happy little servants. Which is horrific lbr.

And once I found myself asking if House Elves would even exist were it not for Wizards, I realized it was very unlikely they're even capable of breeding without orders (they seem to not be able to do anything without orders) so the best course of action would probably just be to stop breeding House Elves. But again I can't imagine how a House Elf would feel about that, and the situation leaves me feeling that there's no real correct answer because their current existence is a horrible reality that should never have come to pass.

Regardless of all this shit tho, we can clearly look at canon and say that House Elves do not ‘need' bonding and it's clearly not ‘for their own good'. Dobby and Winky both were able to live their lives after being freed with no negative physical consequences. No health declination other than mental stress on Winky's part. And it's pretty easy to tell anyone who says enslavement is for any creature's good is absolutely espousing propaganda.

(I also don't feel the House Elf situations is truly comparable to real world slavery and that making comparisons between them can range from tone deaf to racist because of the liberal -/cough/racist/cough/- abstractions in the source text but that's a different conversation.)
