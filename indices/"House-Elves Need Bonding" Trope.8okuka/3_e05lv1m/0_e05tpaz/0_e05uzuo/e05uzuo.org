I was saying more along the lines of forcibly subjugated and domesticated than along the line of goblins willingly doing anything (because they don't) but it's fair to say that while they don't go too far into the history of it in canon we do hear about quite a lot of goblin/wizard strife and it's safe to say there are a lot of reasons for it. Not that something like that would likely be taught at Hogwarts.

Further more with the way Goblins preside over objects and property themselves, I feel that only supports my theory.

TLDR: I am describing magical atrocity at a level that isn't really applicable to any real world scenario not willing relationships with Goblins formed out of mutual dependence for food/protection. This isn't a wolf to dog kind of domestication process.
