1) Your username is great. :)

2) I don't think the common goblin line implies that. Rather, we have to remember that house-elves come with huge, old, expensive properties. Goblins never do put up with such an arrangement, and would take it as an insult to their species to suggest it (they are bankers, fighters and spellcasters first an foremost). I'd even suggest that since elves come with such properties, there aren't very many elves. But goblins aren't bound to anything magically and so there are a lot more of them, so they're more common.
