Authors attempt to rationalize certain aspects of the wizarding world.

As far as I can tell, this usually comes up as a way to write off the idea that the house-elves are functionally slaves, true or not, and or a way to get Hermione to stop banging on about the cause very quickly.

If a house elf requires master-servant bonding (never mentioned), then of course they would need to serve wizards/witches. If a house-elf does not require that, you arrive at the conclusion that the wealthy/elite of magical society are more-or-less able to force non-humans to do whatever they want, and be happy to do it. There are OTHER ways around this, but it rarely seems to come up.

TLDR: Bonding is a short cut to rationalize house elf servitude and not have to deal with the uncomfortable implications of its existence in the magical world.
