  Is there any particular reason for this trope?

Its so the main characters can own house-elves without having to deal with the issue of slavery being immoral regardless of the happiness of individual slaves.

  I dunno, it's just weird that it's supposed to be such a simple thing but Hermione didn't find it in any book.

One explanation I have seen is that she read about it, but didn't believe it. Which honestly would make sense, considering that slaves needing to be enslaved was a argument for real slavery and it obviously wasn't true.

  One idea I had that I'll be using in my own story is the thought that elves in the past were ensnared by a powerful Maledictus cast by pure-bloods that embedded a desire to serve whatever family that took them in. A way to create a long lasting magical contract that passes down through blood, basically.

just as a suggestion. house-elves in canon are bound to property not families. The owner of a house commands the house-elves regardless of which family they belong to(obviously a house-elve can still prefer a certain family over a random owner). Thats why Kreacher was forced to serve Harry instead of Bellatrix even though Kreacher wanted to serve the Black family and not Harry who was the owner of Grimmauld place 12. They seem more like serfs in that regard.

So you could simply have them use a magically enforced Oath of Fealty which was basically a inheritable feudal contract to bind someone(and that persons descendants) to a piece of land. And the owner of that lands commands the people bound to it.

Not that this would be morally better than plain slavery.
