I think its safe to say that Voldemort and Dumbledore have both proven that numbers can mean little when it comes to magic. You're also ignoring the general incompetence of the population. Never forget that the Weasleys sold hats with shield charms on them since so many ministry employees couldn't cast the charm. The vast majority of wizards likely never encounter anything more dangerous than a doxy in their lives. Defence against the Dark arts doesn't give you an army, it gives you a bunch of people who can recognise dark magic and deal with household pests. NEWT level might go higher than that but I doubt NEWT defence is a popular option unless you plan on doing something about a Dark Lord. Its just not relevant to most jobs. With that in mind the numbers likely matter very little, not to mention the books never give an idea of how many goblins there actually are.

Wands were banned from magical creatures in 1631. There was a Goblin rebellion in 1612 involving Hogsmeade if I remember correctly. Goblins had rebelled even when they could use wands and even then they lost. Perhaps they're really not as good as you think they are. Griphook's bitter words speak of the possibilities not what they could actually do. Also bear in mind he was a bitter individual who hated wizards and both sides regularly accuse the other of being liars and cheats. With that setting you have to consider the possibility that he wasn't being entirely honest. He's never going to admit that his species can't compete.

Malfoy isn't going to murder Dobby in front of Harry in the middle of Hogwarts but if house-elves were so powerful and could beat wizards so easily then the Battle of Hogwarts would have been over in seconds after the house-elves joined the fight. Not to mention wizards would use house-elves for body-guards or assassinations. Malfoy lunges at Harry and Dobby blindsides him. It just says Malfoy had no choice but to leave. It doesn't say anything about Malfoy quaking in fear, likely he felt like he'd been made a fool and stormed off to sulk.
