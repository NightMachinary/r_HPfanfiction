  I think its safe to say that Voldemort and Dumbledore have both proven that numbers can mean little when it comes to magic.
#+end_quote

...Provided you are about the most powerful wizard in the world. Otherwise, numbers obviously matter, that's the reason Voldemort was on the verge of winning both wars. He controlled and blackmailed a bunch of Wizards (many within the MoM) and had an army of Dark creatures. Saying numbers.don't matter is just silly.

  Wands were banned from magical creatures in 1631. There was a Goblin rebellion in 1612 involving Hogsmeade if I remember correctly. Goblins had rebelled even when they could use wands and even then they lost.

Wand ownership was not allowed before the MoM was founded. You're forgetting that there was a magical government in the UK prior, the wizard's council.

  Griphook's bitter words speak of the possibilities not what they could actually do.
#+end_quote

Except this has been confirmed. See the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Chipping_Clodbury_riot][Chipping Clodbury riot]]:

#+begin_quote
  B.O.G. (Brotherhood of Goblins) supporters ran riot during a meeting with representatives from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. The goblins used illegal wands for transfiguration of a postbox and litter bins and blew up some shrubs and a shed. They called for the release of goblin activist Hodrod the Horny-Handed. Arrests ensued. Goblin-wizard relations are reported to be at an all time low (DP3)

Once they nabbed wands they apparently had no issues doing magic, nothing whatsoever indicates it to be inferior.

  Malfoy isn't going to murder Dobby in front of Harry in the middle of Hogwarts but if house-elves were so powerful and could beat wizards so easily then the Battle of Hogwarts would have been over in seconds after the house-elves joined the fight.
#+end_quote

Lucius was trying to kill Harry. If Dobby was inconsequential because of his magic, he would have killed him first, but we are told he had to leave despite getting out his wand:

#+begin_quote
  “Got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby --- Dobby is free.” Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at Harry.

  “You've lost me my servant, boy!”

  But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”

  There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.

  “You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”

  Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.

Harry would have been a non issue, but the text makes it clear even with his wand out he didn't think he could win (or at least not quickly enough to get away with killing Harry). And it was because of the elves that the Battle wasn't so easy. I didn't say elves could just trump wizards (they were vastly outnumbered), but there's absolutely nothing to suggest the magic of Wizards are above that of elves and goblins unless wand ownership is taken into account. That elves especially seem adept at wandless magic unlike wizards (every elf seems to be capable of it), they might be even stronger with wands (this is just supposition).
