There is no indication of that. Wizards have numbers on their side, not superior magic. They could blend in with Muggles (before the SoS went into place), and muggles would be terrified of goblins so they could walk broad daylight without fear unlike goblins.

And yet Lucius made no attempt to get back at Dobby afterwards. If it was so easy, he would have done it. There is nothing in support of this idea that wizards have the best magic. They simply have the wands, Griphook and the goblin rebellion that took place after the end of the series basically makes this undeniable as far as I can tell. Elves, goblins (etc) can use wands, we know once the goblins stole some their magic was not stated to be any different than a wizard's. If anything they might be stronger since it is common for goblins and elves to be able to use magic without wands, whereas most wizards seem powerless without a wand.
