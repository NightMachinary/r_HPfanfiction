I don't think there's any indication that wizards are magically superior. I mean, Dobby had no trouble stopping Lucius, who objectively is a strong wizard.

Canonically, Griphook basically answers this for us. Wizards enforced their "superiority" by legally denying all other magical beings the use of wands, which make magic more potent and efficient. Based on events that occurred after the end of the series, we know they are basically equal when wands are taken into account. In a modern goblin rebellion, some of them stole wands and immediately began using them just fine, transfiguring and charming stuff.
