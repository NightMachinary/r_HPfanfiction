Ahh, thank you! Lol, I'm so glad you liked it. Especially, the Marvel crossover haha, that one was a weird AU that I know not many people care for, but it was so much fun to write!

Awakening....I have a lot of plans for that one. ^^

I'm just a bit surprised you read all my fics in the few hours I posted this asdsdfghjk.
