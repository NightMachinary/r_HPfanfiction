Oh my god this was amazing. I then had to read your other hp fics too, of course. It's not every day you find such a gold mine after all. The Iron Man!Harry and Cap!Hermione story was unique in the best of ways, and not gonna lie, I almost cried just reading that Luna in that AU was Bucky, poor baby. Awakening, on the other hand, was just perfect. I'm so happy to find a genuinely great on-going fic that incorporates many things I love about hp fanfiction. You have a new fan!
