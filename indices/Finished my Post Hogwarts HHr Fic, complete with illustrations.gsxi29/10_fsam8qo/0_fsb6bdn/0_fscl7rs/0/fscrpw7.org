Ginny knows about recovering from deep trauma? This is never touched upon in the books, JKR never mentions Ginny having any lasting effects from the Horcrux to indicate she had to recover from anything.

In that sequence at Sirius's Harry even forgets it was Ginny that was possessed, so he never noted Ginny ever being affected after 2nd year.
