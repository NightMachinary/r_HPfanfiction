To be clear, I have no problem with Harry and Hermione bonding over their shared trauma. Totally plausible, probably nearly happened in book 7, and it's quite a good premise.

I'm just bothered by the contrast of "Ginny expected everything to go back to normal/Only Hermione understood." Um, no. Ginny would totally understand. Dismissing her just like that feels like a cop-out. With a more comprehensive reason for them not to get back together, I would have enjoyed the story a lot more. Maybe she was struggling with her own demons, and/or Fred's death, and wasn't ready for a relationship for a while; meanwhile, Harry and Hermione were there for each other. The rest of the story proceeds as before. Or maybe Ginny threw herself into something else as a coping mechanism, like professional Quidditch, and was away a lot. I like well-done Harmony, just no cheap shots.
