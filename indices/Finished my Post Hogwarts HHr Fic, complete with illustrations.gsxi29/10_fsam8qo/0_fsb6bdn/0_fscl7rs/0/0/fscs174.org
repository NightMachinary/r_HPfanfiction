You're quite right that nothing is shown, which is a real shame, but there is no possible way that she was entirely unaffected by months - nearly a year - of mind-rape. Harry just wasn't watching her closely for years afterwards.

Edit: Yes, Harry did forget about what Ginny went through. But in the same conversation, she makes it clear that she hasn't and /can't/ forget. It's just Harry being quite unaware of her feelings, which is normal for teenage boys and certainly normal for him. The fact remains that she does understand trauma and recovery, particularly trauma related to Tom, fighting Death Eaters, and having an evil presence in your head.
