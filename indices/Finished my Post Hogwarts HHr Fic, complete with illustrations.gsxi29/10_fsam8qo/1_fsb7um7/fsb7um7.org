Hmm. I totally get why you like Ginny and I agree that she does pull Harry out of a funk a time or two in the series. But so does Sirius...and Hagrid...and Ron. This isn't a shipping thing.

/Historically/, Hermione is the clear MVP of dealing with and pulling Harry out of funks. She spends the entire series doing it and there isn't anyone else close. The big Ginny moments stand out simply because they are so out of the norm in my opinion.
