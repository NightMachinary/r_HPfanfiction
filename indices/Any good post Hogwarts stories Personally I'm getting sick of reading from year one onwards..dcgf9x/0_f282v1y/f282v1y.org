I like postwar stories. Here is a collection of completed, non crossover postwar fics:

[[https://wwwfanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052$: Harry falls through the Veil and joins Sirius in a new dimension. Voldemort is still around, but gets messed up by “that fucker”.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/][A Little More Time]], linkffn(3688609): Unspeakable Teddy Lupin tries to save his parents with Time Turner.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Harry falls through the Veil and joins Sirius in a new dimension. They meet a good Tom Riddle and new villains.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): 4 years after the Battle, a Hermione from another dimension asks for help. The Trio and Ginny once more enter the breach.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Head Auror Harry Potter uses Daphne Greengrass to advance his career and agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/][Democracy]], linkffn(13072492): Neville disagrees with his friends's aggressive reform agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/][Exile]], linkffn(6432055): Draco Malfoy finds redemption in the Muggle world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/][Grave Days]], linkffn(5486257): Fully canon compliant fic depicting the days immediately following the Battle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913): The Hallows are driving Harry and Hermione insane.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Ultimate takedown of the atrocious marriage law trope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13096373/1/][In Case of Emergency]], linkffn(13096373): Almost canon compliant Harry/Ginny smut fic, with a plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628): My own one shot for the Battle's 20 year anniversary. Harry talks about the past, present, and the future.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11994595/1/][Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much]], linkffn(11994595): Dudley has a witch daughter and asks Harry for help.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/][Shadow Walks]], linkffn(6092362): 5 years after the War, Harry embarks on a big dimensional journey to find Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): My favorite canon compliant postwar fic, and together with “Grave Days”, are part of a massive 85+ story series. This one depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009.

The three sequels to the popular Slytherin Ginny fic “The Changeling”, linkffn(13143812;12713008;12569750).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511): Beautiful Harry/Hermione one shot 19 years later, set in Alaska.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): My favorite postwar fic overall. Here, Harry and his friends declare war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They begin with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who have escaped justice again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): Still the only non crossover “Wizards in space” story. Lots of problems, but still worth reading imho.
