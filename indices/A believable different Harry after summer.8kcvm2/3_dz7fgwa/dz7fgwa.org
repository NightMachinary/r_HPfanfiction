I like the changes from this Harry because of both his curse-breaking stunt and Daphne. Its really good, even if it has somewhat bad grammar. The story is good enough to make up for it, imo. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Magic of Life)

There's another, but its kinda debatlable if its believable... linkffn(Adversity breeds excellence by beetee)

The last 2 that I can think of are linkffn(The Legacy by storytellespw; Son of Potter, Daughter of Black)

One Sirius takes to himself to be more proactive in Harry's live, and the other, Harry finds an Occlumency book left by Sirius after his death that leads to a shitload of other things, but stays somewhat true to canon. Just know that the writting, despite extremelly good, can get a bit redundant at times.
