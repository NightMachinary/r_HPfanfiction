I'm the writer for the second fic, just to confirm it is not at all believable and its pairing is blatant wish fulfillment. That being said, you might want to check it out anyways as all improvements Harry makes are by his own merit, and I'm trying to make it at least a little different than similar fics which hopefully makes it interesting to read regardless of its obvious flaws. :]
