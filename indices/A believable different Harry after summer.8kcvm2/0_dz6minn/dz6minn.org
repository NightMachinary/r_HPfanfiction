Um, are you searching for a specific fic or making a general request or prompting for ideas?

...If you're looking for ideas, there was one I never properly developed where Harry starts to develop a fear of being helpless without his wand; given Tom Riddle's shade stole it in the Chamber of Secrets, Lupin disarmed him in the Shrieking Shack, then Barty Crouch Jr. stole his wand at the Quidditch World Cup and then it was taken /again/ by Peter Pettigrew at the graveyard (and he would have been dead then if not for Voldemort's insistence on a proper duel).

Given that his 5th year starts with him being attacked by Dementors and then threatened with having his wand snapped by the Ministry, it's understandable that Harry decides to try and learn how to use his magic without a wand in case he's ever disarmed again. He ends up turning to Dobby (who uses wandless magic all the time) for training.
