Harry/Lisa Turpin that has Harry grow up and become his own man without inheritance shit, bashing or politics. Believable teenagers and romance, despite an eventual engagement (without the intension to marry immediately). A good depiction of youth life and Harry being accepted in a family without Weasley level of overbearance (one scene takes that a little to far however). There's also s sequel.
