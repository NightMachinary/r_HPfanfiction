I know parents like that (not mine though). The way Susan (Lisa's mum) is written is almost a carbon copy of my best friend's mother.

  Is your girlfriend coming over? Make sure to air the room afterwards. Also, is she staying for breakfast?

  Also, remember to not overdo the drinking on Saturday. A bottle of Vodka for the three of you is enough.
