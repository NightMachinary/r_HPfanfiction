  un coup de foudre; french idiom, literally a strike of lightning.meaning: love at first sight.Pansy doesn't believe in love. Well, not like that. She's sceptical, and perhaps she has a right to be. Her family is built on distrust and malice. She definitely doesn't believe in true love, but something's about to change that.

  It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front.

  He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944.
