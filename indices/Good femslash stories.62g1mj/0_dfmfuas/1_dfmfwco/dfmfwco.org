  Years ago, when they were first starting out both in their relationship and their careers, when they were babies and hardly understood their car insurance let alone the multi-billion dollar, all-consuming, world-encompassing, life-altering business of news reporting---back then, Derek would practice his expressions in the mirror, and Stiles would think, I'm so glad he'll never have to use that face with me. And then Stiles screwed up, and he's seen nothing but that face for the past two years. Aesthetically, it's still an awesome face, and it probably always will be, but Derek is so much more than another hot dude. And he always will be.
