Okay, I'm going to rec some of my faves for you. I don't think any of them are over 50k, but they're all excellent and well worth it despite the lengths. You just haven't gotten much recc'd here so I figured I'd just go for it even though they may not be what you're looking for.

(also, maybe check out [[/r/HPSlashFic]] ?? you might have some more luck over there!)

linkao3(now they say I've got to hide it by fmslash; patience by fleetofshippyships; secretstudying by originalpuck; ashes ashes by provocative_envy; the scandalous tale of the diagon nursery calendar by woldy; set your hope on fire by theviolinist).

I also have saved to read but haven't yet read: linkao3(light of the moon by lunas_secret_lover; 7897300).
