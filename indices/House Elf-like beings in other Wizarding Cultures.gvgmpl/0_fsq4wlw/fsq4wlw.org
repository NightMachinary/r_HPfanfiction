In Thailand (or most of SE Asia I think), there are these mythical human-children-like creatures that will help your household if you are nice to them and give them food. They are dressed in traditional Thai clothing, have golden bracelets and anklets, and they like watered-down syrup or fizzy drinks. The girl creatures are called ‘hongprai' (โหงพราย girl spirit) and the boy creatures are called ‘kumantong' (กุมารทอง golden child). Most witch doctors keep a pair at their house to guard against intruders or bad fortune and maybe go on magical errands, but I think it's disrespectful to ask them to do the dishes. You can summon the creatures by going through magical rituals and eventually creating a statue of the creature, then you would put snacks/drinks in front of them.

Then there's the house spirit (เจ้าที่เจ้าทาง) who will not do the laundry for you but would help keep the house safe, clean, and free from tragedy. House spirits are worshipped with flowers and incense. They maintain the wards and bless the people in the household.

There are also crossroad spirits and other type of building spirits too.
