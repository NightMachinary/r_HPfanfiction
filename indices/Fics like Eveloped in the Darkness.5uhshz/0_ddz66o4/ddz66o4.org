Depends on what you liked inside, but I can try a few. All of these have a Darkish! Most have HP/LV (Except, The Nightmare Man Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux and Circular Reasoning if memory serves me right) Most end up , with BAMF! or OP! Harry, some have twisted/Sadic!Harry, other features Time Travel, Vampirism, Necromancy, etc. I'll update if I remember others

They all have >60k words, some in the massive 200k / 300k, are either completed or have been updated in the last months
