This is the second thread I'm recommending this fic in today, haha. In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][They Shook Hands]] series, Harry resents muggles and in one of the later books, even works toward helping the ministry snatch muggleborn babies and place them in magical foster homes so they don't have to grow up mistreated like he did. This opinion is most likely due to Harry being in Slytherin and hanging out with his muggle-hating housemates. You know, I like the story as a whole... but Harry is a little hard to like at times.
