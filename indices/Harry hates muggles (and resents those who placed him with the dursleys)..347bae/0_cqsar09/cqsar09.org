Harry dislikes Muggles in /On the Way to Greatness/, and he isn't exactly chummy with Dumbledore, albeit for different reasons.

  "Well, you actually like the Muggle world, don't you?" he said aloud, landing upon that very reason, and immediately wished he hadn't.

  There was an awful look in Hermione's eyes.

  "You have been friends with Purebloods for too long," she said. "Or else Slytherin has that effect on people. You've no right---you of all people---you have no right to condemn the Muggle world! You know what it's like!"

  "And that's why I can condemn it!" Harry said, stung. "I've actually lived there, and maybe it was good for you, but it wasn't any good for me!"

  Hermione looked like he'd just slapped her, and he felt a little shocked at the anger he found rolling within himself. He'd thought his miserable years in the Muggle world all forgotten; he cringed to remember himself in those days, and tried not to. None of it mattered anymore. Long gone was the wide-eyed child who'd expected a benevolent adult to turn up one day and deliver him from suffering; Harry had sorted himself out, and he was doing just fine.

  Here, in the wizarding world.

  Harry closed his eyes and told himself that he didn't actually hate all Muggles. He knew better than that; he knew that, while he hadn't seen any kindness in the Muggle world, perhaps there was some to be found. The entire world could not be as bad as what he had seen. The entire world could not be condemned out of hand like Harry condemned it from his personal experience. The thing was, he couldn't help the way he felt about it.
