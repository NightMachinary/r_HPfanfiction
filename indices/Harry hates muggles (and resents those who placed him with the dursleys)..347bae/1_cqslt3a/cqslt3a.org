[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3464303/1/Dark-Lord-Potter-Part-1][Dark Lord Potter]] has Harry hating muggles but with a younger tonks along for the ride...

There's another HP/NT (ish?) fic the name of which eludes me at the moment where he's in his fourth year when he flat out murders the Dursleys the instant he realizes the Dumbledore intends to keep him there every summer. IIRC: Harry only gets out of azkaban because... I think his name comes out of the GoF?

And then in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]] Harry reacts violently to the discovery that Dumbledore was responsible for his placement with the Dursleys.
