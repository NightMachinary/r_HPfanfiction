The Red knight. Ron is very much a strategist in the way he thinks while he duels, and the plans he concocts.

Possibly the best Ron ever, though a bit (a lot) OOC. Would have helped if we'd seen him grow up into this really complex figure, but given the premise, I can roll with it. The story is fun as fuck.
