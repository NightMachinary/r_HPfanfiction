I was all set to recommend "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the jungle]]" by jbern, but when I checked, it's actually second person.

The curious part is that since it's spoken as if /to you/ you actually feel like it's /about you/ and therefor very personal. The exact kind of personal that you might expect first-person perspective writing to offer but actually doesn't quite.

I'll leave it out there. His story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The lie I've lived]] actually /is/ first person, come to think. It's also definitely in the category of "good" in my opinion. linkffn(3384712)
