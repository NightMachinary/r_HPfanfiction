The author, [[/u/KwanLi][u/KwanLi]], was very upfront about it being based off of Ender's Game in the promotional post here a few years back. Although to be fair, they didn't mention "Ender's Game" specifically but many will recognize the reference to "THE Battle School" in said post (below). I don't remember Ender's Game being mentioned in the fic itself, but in the author's notes in chapter 5, they mention that they had "read the book that is the prime inspiration for this." I infer that it wasn't Prisoner of Azkaban.

edit: apparently in comments section of the post above, the author /did/ specify explicitly that Hogwarts Battle School was based on Ender's Game
