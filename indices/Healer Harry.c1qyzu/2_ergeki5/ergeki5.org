There is one I recall being about Harry being sent back in time When he was attacked by the Dementor before 5th year.

Harry is then stuck in the past (unable to age until he reaches the present) Goes through times of merlin, king arthur, Founders. He learns from all of them and becomes the best healer ever.

Can't recall the title however <.<
