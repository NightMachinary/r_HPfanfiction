Like... a /lot/? Virtually every common indy!Harry+manipulative!Dumbledore (especially post-OOTP) fics have a rebellious Harry.

You'll need to be specific, because your request probably covers thousands, if not tens of thousands of fics.

Personally - I think that if you're trying to find a Harry that is assertive and mature, just head over to the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][DLP Library]].

Otherwise, if you're trying to find a "rebellious" Harry, you can simply head over to ffnet.

(Do keep in mind that the whole "meek and submissive" Harry is usually (but not always) a stereotype from terribly-written fanfiction; canon Harry actually did stand up for himself. Fics with a meek and submissive Harry are either not trying to portray canon Harry, and if they are trying to, they're doing a pretty bad job. Most fics that emulate canon Harry well will usually have some degree of rebelliousness to his character.)

--------------

*That said*, by /far/ one of the best rebellious Harry out there can be found in the Denarian Trilogy.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is the first of three books.

Have fun!
