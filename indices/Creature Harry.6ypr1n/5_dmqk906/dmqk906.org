linkffn(We, Harry Potter) is perfect if you want something in a light-hearted, comedic style. A more serious take that a lot of people like is linkffn(Outcast's Alley), which is indeed pretty good but a heavy AU. /We, Harry Potter/ is ongoing while /Outcast's Alley/ is completed with a "on-permanent-hiatus-and-to-be-honest-probably-abandoned" sequel.

EDIT: UGH! Fffnbot messed up. It's obviously not that /We, Harry Potter/.
