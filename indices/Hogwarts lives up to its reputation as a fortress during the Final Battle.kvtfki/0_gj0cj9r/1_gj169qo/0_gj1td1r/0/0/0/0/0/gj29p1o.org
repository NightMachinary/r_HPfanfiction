Things like the Battle of Blackwater were amazing episodes, but most people will tell you GoT peaked when the majority of episodes consisted of people sitting in the small council offices talking about things. One of the few things people agree was good about S8 was when Brienne was knighted.

Sure a climatic assault on the castle will look good, but style of substance is what killed the show.
