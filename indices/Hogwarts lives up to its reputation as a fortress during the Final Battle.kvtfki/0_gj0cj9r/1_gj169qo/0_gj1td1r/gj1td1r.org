To be fair, the Dothraki wouldn't have been particularly effective inside the walls. If they'd fought like the light cavalry they were rather than trying to pretend they were heavy cavalry, they could have done some serious damage to the wights. There's some argument to be made that the version of Winterfell portrayed in the show was too small to hold the defenders' forces, but even just keeping them in the baileys as reserves to reinforce the walls rather than outside would have been smarter.
