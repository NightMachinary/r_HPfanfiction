The ones that come to mind for me are:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24792544][my head is bloody, but unbowed]]: Post-War Harry gets sent back to the First Wizarding War and lays low for a while until a Death Eater attack happens and his 'saving people thing' kicks in. Moody basically adopts him afterwards and the Longbottoms and Flamels are rather prominent characters. It very good

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966][Second String]]: Harry gets sent back in time during the summer before Fifth Year, and, not wanting to disrupt the timeline, pretends to be a squid and eventually gets taken in by Aberforth Dumbledore. Lots of minor canon characters are a lot more prominent like Alice Longbottom, Filch, and the Prewett Twins. It has a very well-conceived plot and world. This one is Slash, but romance is a very minor focus.
