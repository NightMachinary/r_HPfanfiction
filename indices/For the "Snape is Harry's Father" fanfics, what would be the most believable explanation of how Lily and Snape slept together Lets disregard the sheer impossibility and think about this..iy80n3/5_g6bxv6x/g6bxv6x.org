Replied a comment about rape by mentioning that he never slipped her a love potion in canon so he wouldn't rape her either.

In the story, he might've. Slipped her a potion, that is.

Maybe fanfic could also go with a route of Lily forgiving Severus and him turning spy because of that. (He had connections and someone should do it for the safety of Lily and others like her.) He'd have grown up but in secrecy. Then he'd be decent enough person for other possibilities (adultery or assistance to infertile James, for example) to happen.
