Polyjuice, or rape (though I guess impersonating someone lover does count as rape). If we go by their canon characters, there is just no way Lily would either forgive Snape, let alone sleep with him.

Back in 5th Year (Snape's worst memory), Lily disliked both of them : James because he was an arrogant arse, and Snape because he was a wanabe terrorist who treated every Muggleborn like trash except her.\\
3 years later (during her marriage), James had grew up and got his head out of his arse, while Snape merely went from a wanabe terrorist to a full fledged one. She would probably refuse to be in the same room as him, so any scenario involving her consent or even alcohol is doubtfull.

As far as I'm concerned, Snape can only be the father of Harry if he is the product of a rape (ignoring once again the sheer impossibility of Snape accepting to take James appearance), or if the author makes a lot of preparation and change the characters canon personalities (makes James an abusive asshole, Lily a manipulative cheater, and Snape someone less despicable).
