There are two options, and it depends on how you want to present Lily and James marriage. Either you are fully canon and both of them were almost-saints walking the Earth with us mere-mortals, or they are not.

If they are not, then the most obvious solution is probably the best. Adultery. You get much better story, but the cost may not be worthy for some.

If they are, the things are a bit more complicated. The most simple seems to me that James (being a pureblood) could be inbred and infertile. Then some magical variant of artificial insemination with her best friend would be possible. There are obvious problems: why not Lupin or Peter? (Sirius perhaps is as inbred as James) There is need to build a persuasive redemption arc for Snape and reconciliation with Potters (I don't think James would allow him hundred meters near Lily, if they haven't some mean of reconciliation).
