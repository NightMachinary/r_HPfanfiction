The RSeries by Regulus, starting with linkffn(The Philosopher's Stone Retransmuted)

He's rewritten every year, starting with minor canon divergences that gradually increase until it's a completely different story. There's plenty of angst starting around book 4, to the point where I had to quit reading it at book 5.

Well, that isn't quite right. In general, it's fairly well-written up until book 5. It's not just angst, it's that the angst is caused by some absolute retardation of some of the choices the main cast makes. With no spoilers, if you read the series up until that point, there are some things that take place where the main cast is acting completely out of character from how they were throughout the rest of the series, and they're dumbed down to the point of being stupid whereas before they were relatively intelligent individuals, and all of this is to force unecessary drama that will obviously be resolved within the next book or two. It made me angry enough to rage quit the series, and I've managed to enjoy some poorly written fics.

So, well written? For most of what I've read, yes. Angst? Definitely yes. Well written angst? Fuck no.
