What did you think of Cadmean Victory? I've restarted it a few times by I can never seem to get past the Yule Ball or a few chapter after. It always seemed kinda flat to me. Does it get better? I've heard great things and I'm tryna figure out if I should just power through, so that eventually it gets good.
