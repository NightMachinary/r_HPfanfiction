I'm of the opinion that it's still the best story to try and get someone into fanfiction with. Sure, it's not perfect and there are some parts that could be trimmed down on (Ginny's ghost for example), but it's a really good example of what can be done in the HP universe when a bit of creativity and humor are applied.
