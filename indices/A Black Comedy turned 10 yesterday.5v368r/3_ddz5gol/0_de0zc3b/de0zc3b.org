Is there anything specific that makes this fic be praised as amazing or funny? I tried getting into it a few times and into a few other nonjon fics, but have always stopped a few chapters in since nothing about it seems funny at all and the plot and writing style is very clipped and unnatural and seems boring to me. The fact that everyone praises this fic is very confusing. Although I don't really care for sex jokes or for crude humour which it seems to use quite a bit so maybe that's it?
