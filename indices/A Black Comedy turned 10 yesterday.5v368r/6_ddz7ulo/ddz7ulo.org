I didn't like it the first time I read it. Ghost Ginny irritated me and the nightly "oh no, we brought home two women who knew each other, how shocking!" made me roll my eyes. I eventually came back to it and saw the funny bits, I still skim over Ghost Ginny during rereads, but I love their Job. I like that they do their own thing instead of letting Dumbledore make choices for them. It pokes fun at wizarding logic without going overboard.
