I don't think it depends on how much fanfiction you read. I tried reading it but I was just really bored and the humour, the plot and the writing itself in it did nothing for me. Although I did not make it past a few chapters, so maybe I'm missing something. But then again, if I remember correctly, it seems to use a lot of sex jokes and crude humour and that just turns me off. Seventh horcrux on the other hand I find extremely funny.
