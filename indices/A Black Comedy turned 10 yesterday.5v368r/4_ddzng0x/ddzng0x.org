I actually reread it like last week. I was a bit confused, because I remember LOVING it (this was probably my fourth read-through), but this time, most of the jokes fell pretty flat on me. It might just have been that I had already seen them a few times, but it's more likely, I think, that I'm bothered a lot by the blatant sexism and latent homophobia now, and I was a lot younger when I read it first. There were still a few moments when I burst out laughing, but those tended to be more innocent... the sexual hijinks were no longer something I found worth while.

This probably reflects a broader change in thge types of stories I'm interested in from ABC/HPMOR and their ilk to stuff more like Etc. Etc. & life goes on, but I don't know!

AT the end of the day, I think A Black Comedy is still; clever and witty (just look at its name), and one of premier fics of the fandom. It's just not my type of fic any more.
