I've never been able to get into it. Been thinking of giving it another go though.

From what I remember, there's a lot of Slytherin bashing and Sirius Black, neither of which I tend to like outside of canon. As for the writing, there's a lot of ribaldry and not a lot of actual jokes--maybe it's just not the fic for me.
