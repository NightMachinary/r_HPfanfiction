  It was dark and *deathly* cold as the *tall*, *lanky* figure clad in *dark*, *wool* robes moved at an *even*, *unyielding* pace up the steps and onto the first floor landing of the *tall*, *nondescript* office building.

Holy extraneous adjectives, Batman. Still, I'll give it a shot. But really, woah. Hope the ever-so-critical first sentences gets another look by the author in a future revision.

It starts really, really slow, even after this inauspicious +intro+ "prologue". Look, fanfic authors everywhere, that's not an excuse to be boring just for background filling reasons. The Lord of the Rings' Prologue, famous for being long and boring, starts:

#+begin_quote
  This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a reader may discover much of their character and a little of their history.
#+end_quote

It goes on to say:

#+begin_quote
  Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset, while some may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and the first adventure is briefly recalled.
#+end_quote

If one doesn't care about that, one can skip it. If one does care (and having read the Hobbit first, and knowing little of them therefrom, I'd assume one would), then one can read it immediately or at a later date. That's not how people treat fanfic "prologues". They often use the word like an umbrella to cover a slow or weak start that comes before the "Real" story.

Without a sort-of recommendation, I wouldn't be reading this fanfic in another window while typing this. I don't care about what Snape's brewing. I don't have a Snape-brewing fetish or something.

Gotta start with a bang or a cry of pain. A murder or a wedding. Something new or something clearly explained. But everyone wants to do the Spinners End scene from the movies, and do it first. Things being dark and +stormy+ cold just doesn't do it for me. Comma use is also a little off, but who among us can say they never have that issue. Oh well, I'll survive it. Reading the second chapter now.

In the mean time, everyone should try mine (SHAMELESS PLUG):

Similar AU crossover, but humor-focused and much shorter. Also, it skillfully and artfully uses far fewer adjectives. Mostly.
