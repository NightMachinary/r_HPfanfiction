Well that was...needlessly cruel. But I suspect you knew that already. I imagine writing rude things makes you feel quite good about yourself. Superior, even. Apparently this is the point that you wished to convey, because I can't hear a thing over the blaring cacophonous sound of your ego.

I guess I must not have been looking when I posted and instead accidentally submitted a thread in [[/r/TactlessRudePeople]] on accident.
