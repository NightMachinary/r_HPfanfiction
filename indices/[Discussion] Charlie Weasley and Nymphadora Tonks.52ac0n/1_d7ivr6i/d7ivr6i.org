IIRC in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day by Little0Bird]] one of the plot lines was Charlie's grief at losing his good friend Tonks. He and Tonks had been in a relationship during hogwarts or right after and had lost their virginities to eachother I think. He also had a bunch of sketches of her, and it was implied that she was the one that got away for him. My headcanon is that charlie is gay, but I love the idea that him and Tonks we eachother's first loves and Charlie left for Romania after their breakup or something.
