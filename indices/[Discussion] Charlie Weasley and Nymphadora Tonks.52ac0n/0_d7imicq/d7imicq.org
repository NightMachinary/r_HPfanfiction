I think what's implied in the books is that they didn't rally knew eachother. They knew /of/ eachother, Charlie being the best Quidditch player of the school (we're told) and Tonks being a metamorphmagus.

But that's boring as hell. It's so much more fun to imagine that they were actually best buds or whatever
