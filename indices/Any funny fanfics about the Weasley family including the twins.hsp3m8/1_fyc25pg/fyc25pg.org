I really like “Weasley Family Picnic” cycle by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/581954/Antosha][Antosha]] starting with linkffn(2009858). Unfortunately, given the crappinnes of FFn interface, you have to pick individual pieces manually from the author's profile. Wildly mature (no, there is not much open smut), it all circles around it, but it is really beautiful.
