I love this story because, as cracky as it is, it's actually got a ton of “heart” and has some of the sweetest interactions between characters I've ever seen including my #1 favorite Harry/Percy (sibling) relationship. And allll the Bonus points for the muggleborns' reaction to “Baron VonDoomhouse”
