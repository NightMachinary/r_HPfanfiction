There were fewer inquisitors at Salem than during the English trials, because there weren't /any/ inquisitors or witch-hunters around. Trials were brought forward by individual civilians to the town magistrates, who would then launch a public examination of the witches.

While the inquisition existed during this time, it wasn't actually present in Salem due to the fact that the inquisition was a Catholic institution. The Salem Witch trials were instigated by Puritan extremism. The Catholic church's influence in the New World was very small. Additionally, any outside English influence would have been Anglican, since the country had left the Catholic Church in 1534. The Salem trials were 158 years later. By 1689 Protestantism was overwhelmingly the popular religion in England, with the English Bill of rights only applying to Protestants. So it would be very hard to get an English Inquisitor in the 1690s.

If you'd like for Dursley to have a similar role in a witch trial, he would have to be Witch-Hunter*, unless he was a member of the Catholic Inquisition, in which case he would be an inquisitor. Of course, this leaves the same issue, as there were no witch-hunters in Salem. There were witch-hunters present at the trial of the Pendle Witches in 1612, so this could work.

*Possibly also witchfinder, in the vein of Matthew Hopkins, the self-proclaimed Witchfinder General.
