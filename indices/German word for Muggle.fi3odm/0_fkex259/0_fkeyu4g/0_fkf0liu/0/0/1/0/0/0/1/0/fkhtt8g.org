Definitely, but it would be more a location for Austria or Switzerland. See "Rüdiger Zweigl and the School in the Mountain" on ff.net , where the Austrian school is located near the Grossglockner.

If the Alps serve as a location for a German school, it would make most sense for the Alemannic language continuum (Southwest Germany, Baden and Württemberg) along with German-speaking parts of Switzerland.
