No. German has a much lower tendency to shorten words than English. Instead of shortening words, you shorten sentences.

The English expression "Just a moment" can get shortened to "Just a mo'." A German would not do that. Instead of "Nur einen Moment" (just a moment) they would say "Moment", meaning "just a moment".

If words really deserve shortening, Germans are more likely to use acronyms and use them as one word.

So Nicht-Magische would become NMs (an-ams) or NiMags (neemahgs) before it becomes Nicht-Mag.
