I´m just going to throw in some words I just made and/or looked up:

​

#+begin_quote
  */Unnerbericher -/* Harzer Mundart (local dialect) for "Unterberger" ("those below the mountain") as a reference to the Brocken (or the Blocksberg), a very windy mountain in the Harz region with a mythological connection to magic, witches and the Walpurgisnight.

  */Schtrichs or Klumbs -/* again Harzer Mundart, this time for "/Macken/" (the defects, the quirks), a bit more degratory

  */Zauberlose -/* high German for "the magicless"

  */Fadleut/* - Swabian for "/fade/langweilige Leute/" ("boring/unspecial people"), this time as a reference to the Black Forrest, which is also often seen as a place of magic and folklore.

  */Grimms -/* a reference to the Brothers Grimm, who, in my headcanon have had extensive contact with the local magical communities. The stories that those communities told them were the seed for the fairytales they are known for today.
