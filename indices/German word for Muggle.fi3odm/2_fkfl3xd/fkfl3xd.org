Geistlose. The literal translation is someone without ghost/spirit(which kinda fits because Muggles dont leave ghosts)

But what fits most is the meaning of the word itself, which is refers to people who are mundane, boring, stupid, without any substance, lacking any creativity or thoughts on their own.
