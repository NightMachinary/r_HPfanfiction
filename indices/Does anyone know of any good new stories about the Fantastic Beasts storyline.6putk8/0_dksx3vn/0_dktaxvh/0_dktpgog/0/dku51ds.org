i wasn't being serious, I actually hate dumbledore bashing. But if someone were to assume that Dumbledore planned for harry to be abused (and not that it was a consequence of something that dumbledore had no alternative for) that would be actually the only valid reason I could think of. And about the killing innocent people thing. At least Grindelwald thought that its possible for a obscurial to learn controlling his powers and Dumbledore could have found a way in the past decades
