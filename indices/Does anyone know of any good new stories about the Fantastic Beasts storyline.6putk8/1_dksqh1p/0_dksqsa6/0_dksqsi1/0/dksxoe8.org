Note that while this fic has really good characterizations of Newt and Harry and does a good job portraying their relationship, there's a bit of subtle racism woven in. Africa is treated as one country early in the fic (although it improves slightly later on), all Chinese people eat dogs and magical creatures, eugenics with the Brits being naturally superior to all other countries when it comes to combat (with Harry being able to take on hundreds of magical and muggle soldiers at once), pretty much all non-white people portrayed as inept and/or magically weak cardboard villains (until the latest villain who has some backstory). At the same time, the author does briefly mention how badly colonialism screwed over the African continent. And supposedly the people of each country has something it excels at better than other countries (athough the skills so far seem to be innate and not because each country has a rich teaching tradition). It doesn't bash you over the head with the racism, but it's there throughout nonetheless.
