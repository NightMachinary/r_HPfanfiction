Okey, it's time to share my wisdom. There are SO MANY fics that I could reread 100 times. Some of them I did rearead 10 times or more. It's a shame that it's onlh hp but here we go. Warning: they are dramiones or tomionnes *[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11248015/1/Pygmalion][Pygmalion]] by Colubrina. I absolutely love this one. I think I almost know it by heart from all the times I have read it. It is a Tomione one. But, 3ven if you don't like that couple, give it a chance for Neville. Neville has never been an interesting character for me, until i came across this fic. OMG, how could her create such a masterpiece? Here, Neville is dark, easygoing and intelligent. I could talk about him for hours, but i don't want to spoil anything. I also love Luna. She is eerie and powerful a revengeful and has so many interesting ideas. If I could only read one fanfic would be this one. * [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11335983/1/Housemates][Housemates]] by Colubrina. This is one of the first ones I read. It is short and extremely interesting. I love ALL the characters and thanks to this story I discovered one of my fav poems. It really gave me another perspective. It is in a modern AU and magic doesn't exist. HOWEVER it is extremely accurate with each personality. It is polyamorous and great. 10/10

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11258545/1/The-History-Project][The history project]]. A drammione. It started with a draffle but she has been kind enough to make a hole story. Such a queen. It is absolutely original. All the story is conversation like in texts. It is wonderful to see how they both grow fond of each other with the things they wrote. I would like to say that this ones are my favourites, but in reality all her work is amazing. ALL OF HER STORIES NO EXCEPTIONS.

- How to win friends and influence people [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12531992/24/How-to-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People][here]]. How can this Book, novel, work of the Gods be free. Oh my, OH MY. It is incredible. I am deeply in love with AT LEAST 3 characters. This story has everything: romance, conspiracy, drama, homour ... and it is finished. Here the rols are marvellously reverse. Here hermione is the muscle and Draco the brains and i am in love.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8611642/4/][Love in a zombie apocalypse]] zombies and the greatest Draco I have had the pleasure to read. And believe me, I've read A LOT. Even today i think about it and the reasons that this crazy yet extremelly useful man could have. It is really an slow one but it is perfect. No finished, tho.

I have more, but I should look for them.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6467810/1/Rojo-Negro][Rojo y negro]] by MonicaAlejandra55. Este es un fanfic en español. No puedo, realmente no puedo, indicar el impacto que esta historia tuvo sobre mi. Es de las pocas historias de la 3 generación que he leído. Los personajes originales son una locura. DIOS MIO. Y la trama es otro nivel. Sólo que no está acabado. Pero por Dios y por la Virgen leer este fanfic. Por favor.
