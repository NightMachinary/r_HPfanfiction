TheDivineComedian is super talented. I've reread The Age of Lies linkao3(The Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian) many times. The author's characterization of Peter is absolutely chilling, and the Remus+Sirius+James dynamic is phenomenal. It makes me ache for more well written First War fics with lots of action.
