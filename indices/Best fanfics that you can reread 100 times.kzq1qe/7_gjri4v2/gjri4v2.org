The fics I mentioned are fics I have read at least more than 3 times, and which I loved so much that you can question me about them in two or three years and I will speak about these gems lovingly.

All of these are found on fanfiction.net or ao3. And I am probably forgetting a whole lot of different fics which are incredibly awesome as well.
