linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist]]) is a ride. I also enjoy jbern's works like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]), even if the dialogue is a bit exagerated at times. [[/u/te7]] slice of life stories like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/The-Quidditch-World-Cup]]) are great.
