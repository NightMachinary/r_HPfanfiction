I have read linkao3(sunshine in my eyes by monroeslittle) more times than I can count. Anything by monroeslittle (on ao3 or ffn, different fics on both sites for some reason) is so so good with great reread potential.

Recently I read linkao3(the imposter complex by notus_oren) and I've immediately started a reread once getting to the end of what's currently written. I think I'm on read #3 now? So that one definitely has reread potential haha. You notice more things each time and the adventure and advanced magics don't stop being awesome.
