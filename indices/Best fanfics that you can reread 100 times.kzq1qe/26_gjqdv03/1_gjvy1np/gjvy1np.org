Everything by monroeslittle is fantastic. Their fics are not crossposted between ffn and ao3 so check out both profiles!

My favorite (and one I've reread a bunch) is linkffn(And the Wolves All Cry by monroeslittle). I tried it a couple of years ago and it was too dark for me, but I read it last year and now adore it. monroeslittle's works always end with hope and concrete possibilities for the characters. I always finish their fics with a warm, content feeling. :)

linkffn(Just Stay Here Tonight by monroeslittle) is their other HP fic and is also great. Muggle!Lily and another twist.
