linkao3(survival is a talent) just has this feeling of pure Found Family beauty to it that I seldom get to enjoy in fiction, fanmade or no. And I absolutely adore it. Considering how much Harry sees Hogwarts as his home in canon, this is exactly what I wanted his experiences there to be like. Like, it's actually believable that hundreds fought to their deaths to defend this one castle, if this is what they were fighting for. It's great. It exemplifies why I read fanfiction in the first place.
