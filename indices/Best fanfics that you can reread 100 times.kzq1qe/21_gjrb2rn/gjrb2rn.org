[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11494764/1/Storm-of-Yesterday][Storm of Yesterday]] It's a bit silly sometimes and the writing isn't always 10/10 but I still come back to it. I find it's portrait of grief and how the characters try and move on with their lives are so well done I forget sometimes it is only a fanfic.
