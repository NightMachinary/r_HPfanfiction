No, the premise is that Harry, being a white male, is sidelined because of it, that the minorities(Muggleborn, not-white, and so on) are in progressive action groups that are so full of themselves, they think they're better than Harry because of their minority status and his 'privileged' status of being a white male that's a pureblood(in their mind, any pureblood makes one a full pureblood, see/google One-drop Rule) makes him obviously wrong about everything because he can't judge anything due to his inherent pureblood bias. Cho, Hermione, Angelina, Dean, or make up some other minority characters in the series then decide to go off thinking their Social Justice ways will win the day only to either win the day(which wouldn't be any good) or get themselves all slaughtered, leaving Harry horrified his friends are dead because of their own political agendas.

This does not mean I agree with Men's Rights Activists or the average conservative asshole. What it means is that I had an idea and it amused me momentarily because I can see every side of an issue even if I have my own viewpoints that are wildly different.

So it's more psychopath vs indoctrinated.
