Yes and no. Portraits are artificial beings who possess an imperfect copy of the original's personality, but know they are not the original, and they purposefully try to act as close to the original as possible. Sometimes wizards transfer them some of their most precious memories via Pensieve, other times they just tell the portrait about their life the normal way.

The point is, it's imaginable, although it would be very complex magic, that a Portrait could be given a physical body; but that would in no way amount to resurrecting the original person, it would just give the Portrait-Person a body.
