If I were following canon attitudes, I'd say that portraits are mere simulacra of people, shades without the essence. They have no souls, and that somehow means they're not people, and in turn it means you can't bring them back to life.

I've got a much more functional view of personhood. Portraits seem to be as capable as people. It should be straightforward to make a sort of magitech mecha for one. However, that person is not necessarily the same as the basis of the portrait. They might have the personality that the painter thought they had. They might only know what the painter knew the original person knew. They might be something of a caricature of the original self. Their memories might degrade with time. Their personality may be immutable.

If you want to write a story in which portraits are people and don't have massive downsides, you can make them super common, or you can invent a reason why they're not popular. Maybe they're incredibly expensive to produce, or they require letting the painter know all your secrets, or there are only a few people with the required skills. Maybe the tech is new. Maybe it requires super expensive reagents. Maybe people tend to go a bit funny in the head after a few years of being two-dimensional.

Or let's say it's not that expensive, and plenty of portraiturists are available. Then everyone's going to commission a portrait, and the dead will quickly outnumber the living. Perhaps Hephaestus Gore is enjoying his fifty-seventh term as Minister for Magic.

Another way to go: the portrait contains enough of the person's essence that you can use it to track back to the original person, through time and space. Combining the portrait, divination, and soul magic would let you return them to life by snatching their soul at the moment of their death and bringing that into a body you create today.
