A through-the-years fic of Dumbledore updating his portrait could be very interesting. It's maybe the only thing he can truly unburden himself to (how could he trust anyone besides himself with his secrets?) Seeing Dumbledore change through the eyes of the portrait from the First Wizarding War to the period of peace and through Voldemort's 2nd rise, with Dumbledore knowing almost exactly when he'll die, could be fascinating and make him a more empathetic character.

In the same vein, Snape's relationship with his portrait would be interesting. I've always assumed he went into 7th year fully expecting to be dead before the year ended; how would that affect his interaction with it?
