That's not quite right. The portraits aren't the original, but they /are/ sentient, by all appearances; they're simply different people, magical "mind-clones" whose personality is only broadly based on the originals. Thus, if you could transfer a portrait's consciousness to a body, you /would/ get a functional, feeling, thinking person --- it's just that that person would /not/ be the original brought back to life.
