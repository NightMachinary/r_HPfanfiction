Since I'm confused it wasn't yet mentioned: I don't think so, simply because in the HP universe souls are a definite thing. Remember, when a dementor takes somebody's soul, they take the personality and memories with them, even while the body stays functional, meaning they are completely anchored to the soul.

So I'd imagine your suggestion would be only marginally better than a empty shell. Maybe you can sorta 'program' the body to behave in a very basic and limited way, but nothing like the actual person.
