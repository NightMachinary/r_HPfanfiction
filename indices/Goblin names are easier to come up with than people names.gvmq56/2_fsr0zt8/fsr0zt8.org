I've never seen more than like 7 unique goblin names across all of fanfiction. It's always the same three dudes: Griphook, Ragnok and a series of interchangable combinations of "blood, bone, flesh, skull, fist, breaker, crusher, gnasher".

Honestly, I don't even know why their names have to be so gruesome all the time. They may have guards on their bank, but the name we see isn't violent at all - it's Griphook. What about Sidestep, or Rockchip, or Glasseye, or Steelfinger?
