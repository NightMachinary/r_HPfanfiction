  Crazy idea. What if Harry was Tony's dad?Not in a million years would Harry thought that by letting Anthony be held for a moment by a woman whom just lost her baby, would let the press go wild. In under an hour, the whole city knew about his baby. And under a couple of hours so did the whole United States of America. And soon the whole world would know. The worst thing was that they thought Anthony was the Stark heir.This work is a slow burn. So basically it will cover Tony as a baby, kid, teen, young man 'till adult. And mostly i used Howard, Harry, and Tony's POVPs. This work is 70% marvel and 30% Harpot world. And neither marvel or harpot charactrs are mine, but most of the story ideas are mine. So hope u enjoy reading itCOMPLETED
