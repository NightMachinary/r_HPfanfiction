That's an insane statement.

Hatred and Love are two polar opposites. Two emotions couldn't be further apart. One is the unnatural epidome of anger and wrath borne from our own mental complexity and tendency for feedback loops, the other is the unnatural epidome of strange attachement between two people.

If you hate someone, you wish to harm them. Injure, mentally and physically. You curse their name, you wish the worst for them.

If you love someone, you wish to protect them. Prevent harm and soothe worry. You become sick if they're in danger, and you are incapable of wishing bad upon them.

I don't know if you meant some strange poetic delusion, but is is an extremely untrue statement. Hate and Love are two incompatible emotions, one cannot exist if even an echo of the other remains.
