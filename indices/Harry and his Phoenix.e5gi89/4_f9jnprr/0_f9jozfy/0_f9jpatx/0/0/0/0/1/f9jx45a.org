It's just disturbing.

Here's why:

- Snape is much older.
- Literally treats Harry like crap.
- Compares him to his 'swine' of a father every single time despite him being open-minded and shy.
- He's partly responsible for the murder of his parents.
- He suppported the death eater ideals meaning he sees his mother and best friend as lesser human beings.
- Is the most unfair and second most bigoted teacher ever. Always supports his own house before others whether or not they're right or wrong.
- Let's Malfoy get away with sabotaging Harry's potions which could be life threatening.
- ...

I could go on and on but I think it boils down to this: people like Alan Rickman. He's a fairly good looking guy in an edgy way. They also somehow think Snape is 'good' because he did his part in opposing Voldemort. No. Life's not black and white.

The only possible reason he could have for wanting a romantic relationship with him would be to get one back at James Potter. And that would just be disgusting, to normal people.

Oh and exactly the same thing for Draco. And Voldemort/Tom Riddle is even worse.

Love and hate are completely opposite things. Any one who quotes something like that never loved or is in an unhealthy & toxic relationship.

Oh and Harry is straight in canon. So to be fair changing an entire character's moral beliefs/ideas/situation and sexual orientation would no longer make it the same character. Irregardless of then having the same name.
