If you are interested in hermione/snape fics, you should definitely read roman holiday and its sequels, jewel of the Nile and last tango in Paris. I'd consider them classics of the ship. Here's the author's page- [[http://www.witchfics.org/anna/]]

One of the problems with universally popular classics- that I've found to be true, at least- is that they are universally popular. When you get into different niche areas of fandom, that's where the hidden gems are. Not saying that I don't enjoy the fics listed- it's just that often some of the most poignant, well written or enjoyable fics I've found are in ships or genres I wouldn't normally read. Unfortunately I am terribly unorganized, so I don't really have that many I can list off the top of my head.

If you're looking for some of the big compiled lists, I'd also go look at tv tropes page of hp recs, painless j's list of hp recs (mostly slash, some het), and also see if you can dig up any good old livejournal fic competition pages if there's a specific ship you're looking for. Knowitalls can also be good, but after awhile I've found its kind of hit or miss.
