Surprised no one mentioned classics like [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] and [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This means war]] by jeconais.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] by MissAnnThropic is a classic too.

Most fics on phoenixsong are good, especially if you're into H/G (like melindaleo's [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/3517/][The Seventh Horcrux]]).

These are some of the old fics that got me involved in the scene on the top of my head
