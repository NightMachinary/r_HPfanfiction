The majority of "classics" are terrible compared to the stuff that's followed regularly these days. It's kind of funny, as people grew up and HP got older, obviously the FF writers grew up and became better writers as well. You can see the overall quality of what people normally care to call the "best" HP fanfics rise dramatically over just 15 years or so.

The "classics" from the early 2000s are almost universally bad compared to stuff today. Look at Barb's "Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent". For the time, it was legendary, and I'd definitely call it a classic. It's not bad, not really. Is it really /good/ though? Not really.
