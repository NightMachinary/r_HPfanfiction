There are two 'classic' series that haven't been mentioned here:

The Sacrifices series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]] - I'm not actually a fan of this series, I find it to be far too long and far far too angsty, but it is one of the most popular series in all of HP fanfiction and I think it merits mention for completions sake.

The Alexandra Quick series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]- I'm mostly mentioning this because I consider it to be the best written story in all of fanfiction. It features original characters, Magical America and a plot that is more complex and darker than the original series. There are no characters from the books in this series, and Harry himself is never even mentioned, but Inverarity's writing is more similar to Rowling's than anything that I have ever encountered.
