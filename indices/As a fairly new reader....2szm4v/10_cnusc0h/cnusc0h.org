I've created [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L42j8DtQjwikqv0ggbwA-W25Ccl77V1E2nO96fThTyI/edit?usp=sharing][a list here]], with my own in-depth reviews.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP C2]] and [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP website]] also has great fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5409855/][My favorites]] have the best fics I've seen after a year of reading ~380 novel-length fanfictions - still missing a few I have yet to add, though.
