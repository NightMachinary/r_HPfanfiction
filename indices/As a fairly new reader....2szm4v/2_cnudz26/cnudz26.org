I'm a fan of Nonjon's Brown coat, green eyes. A HP/ firefly crossover that's well written entertaining and complete. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen]] Poison pen by Genkaifan is another excellent story.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]] If you like long stories check out Miranda flairgolds Second chance at life. Extremely detailed story and there are two sequel's although the entire arc isn't completed yet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth]] Bobmin356 has many excellent stories especially the Queen who fell to earth which is completed with sequel's.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/]] When a lioness fight's by kayley silverstorm is one of my all time favorites its Hermione centered and can be extremely dark in places, the epilogue is brilliant.

Hope these help there are so many awesome stories out there it's hard to keep track of them all. I just added the links, still figuring out how to add them via my phone.
