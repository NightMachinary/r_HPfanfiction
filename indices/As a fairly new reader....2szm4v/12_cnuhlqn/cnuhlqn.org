I haven't seen anyone mention [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]. Everything she's written is part of the "same" story, and I wait for the all-too-seldom updates, but many of the stories are marked as complete.

I don't know if other people think it's a classic, but I also like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]].
