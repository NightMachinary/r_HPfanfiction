You can always sort by number of reviews or favorites on fanfiction.net--that gives a good overview of the most popular stories. Sorting by reviews favors longer stories, since readers can leave one review per chapter, while sorting by favorites provides a more even distribution of length, since readers can leave only one favorite per story.
