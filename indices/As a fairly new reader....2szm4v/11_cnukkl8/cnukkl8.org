Don't feel pressure to read the classics. First of all, some of them were good for their time, but aren't really going to seem that amazing now. The Shoebox Project is an example of this, in my opinion. Sort by favorites on FF.net, and read the ones that look vaguely intriguing. I find favorites a better way to sort through than reviews, because it won't be as biased in favor of longer stories.This isn't English class, you don't have to read fics just because they're classics.

In my opinion, little0bird, A Black Comedy, Stages of Hope, and Oh God Not Again! are all classics that have stood the test of time. There are others that have done reasonably well (Delenda Est comes to mind) and others like Poison Pen that were great at the time but haven't aged well.

And keep in mind that there are some great fics being written at this very moment. Against the Moon comes to mind. Don't worry too much about the classics.
