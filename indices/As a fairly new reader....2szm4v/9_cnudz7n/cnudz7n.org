[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] are great classics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived]] is a great look at non BWL Harry. The fanfiction link isn't the whole story. For the rest, find the Dark Lord Potter Work by Author thread with the same title.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] is one of the most popular crossovers I've seen. It's a Avengers and Harry Potter crossover if you're wondering. Pretty good, in my opinion.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] is one I've always loved. It isn't as well known, but it's very highly acclaimed by pretty much everyone I've seen talk about it.
