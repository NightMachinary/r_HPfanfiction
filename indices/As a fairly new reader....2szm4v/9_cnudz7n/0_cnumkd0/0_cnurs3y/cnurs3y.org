There pretty much as close to classics as you can come for not being completely ancient. I mean they're pushing seven or eightish years at this point for OTWTG and POTDK, and as far as crossovers go Wand and Shield is probably one the longest good ones in recent history.

They may not be classics in the sense of being "old fics" but we will certainly look back on them as such when they're all finished and done.
