[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/][Barb's trilogy Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent, Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions, and Harry Potter and the Triangle Prophecy]] is one of the really old ones, but it still has the most hits on good old FictionAlley, and I can say it's still the best fanfiction I have ever read. It picks up after the fourth book, so no Rowling's prophecy, no horcruxes, none of that. They are really, really good, and I still struggle to find fics better than this more than a decade old story.
