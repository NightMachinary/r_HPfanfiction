Can i just thank you for knowing and spreading what bemuse means? almost no-one i know, knows what it means and i live in the UK! The amount of times i wanted to bash my head in whilst reading fanfiction because of this is astounding. Also i've noticed a lot of people don't know when to properly use whom, they just assume that it is always whom because of tv and use the word to make their character seem smarter even when it makes no sense.
