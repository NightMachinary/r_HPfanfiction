About Discreet and Discrete. Its funny because in my native, discreet is "discreto" which looks a lot more like Discrete than Discreet, yet there isn't a word for Discrete in my native, afaik. (At this point, I have a larger vocabulary in english than portuguese, after reading and hearing it for so long).
