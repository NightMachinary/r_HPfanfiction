I agree. I've also noticed that some authors when talking about Dumbledore mention the “twinkle in his eye”. This may simply be a form of descriptive writing, but when they use it for every interaction with Dumbledore it gets really annoying.

Also i can't stand when authors put portraits in front of each of the common rooms and give them passwords. I've noticed that people tend to forget that every house entrance is different and simply push Gryffindor's entrance upon all the other houses.

In terms of grammar and word confusion, I would also like to add there, their, and they're. The book is over there. (Place) The book is theirs. (Possessive) They're in possession on a book. (Contraction)
