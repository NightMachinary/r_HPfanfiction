Vanished and banished. If I vanish something, I make it disappear. If I banish something, it moves away from me. This is especially common in sexy scenes in Harry Potter fanfics. E.g “I banished MC's clothes and they disappeared from their body” If you banished someone's clothes like that, the person would either end up on the other side of the room, the clothes would just flutter weirdly, or the clothes would rip and fly off.
