Droll vs Dull does it for me. They're basically opposites, but since TV shows high society saying "How droll..." without smiling or laughing, it's shown to mean "How boring", when really it's someone sarcastically saying "Cool story, bro".

Now, writers are injecting it into their stories to say situations are boring, but they're clearly not being sarcastic.
