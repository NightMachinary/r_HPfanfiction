I have a really fun time with using either the surname or the first name for certain characters because they SHOULDN'T be on first name terms, and don't want anyone to think they are, but they spend a lot of time together in private (platonically and not-so-platonically) and have become close enough for first names, so I try to keep the private and public lives separate. So when they're in public, it's surnames, whether in the third-person narrative or dialogue, I keep it lined up because that makes it easier to show that in â€˜this scene' their relationship is formal, then for private, more intimate scenes, I will use first names for both dialogue and narrative. It's hard, but I think it makes the story and setting of scenes easier for the reader to follow.
