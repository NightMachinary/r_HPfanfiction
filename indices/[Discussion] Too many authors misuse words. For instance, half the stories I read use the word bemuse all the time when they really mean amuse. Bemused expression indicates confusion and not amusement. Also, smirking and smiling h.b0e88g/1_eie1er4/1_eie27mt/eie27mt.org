  Harry calling Malfoy "Draco" even though there's a ton of animosity between them, Harry calling Hermione "Granger" even though they are friends and there's been no falling out,

Is this a British only thing? Because I have literally only ever read this sort of thing in Harry Potter. All the US books I read and in my US life people are always first name, even people who don't like each other. Like in school I hated a girl who bullied me all the time and I still called her Jessica, not her last name. She called ME my first name too.

So yes is that just a British thing, last names to indicate formality or unfamiliarity?
