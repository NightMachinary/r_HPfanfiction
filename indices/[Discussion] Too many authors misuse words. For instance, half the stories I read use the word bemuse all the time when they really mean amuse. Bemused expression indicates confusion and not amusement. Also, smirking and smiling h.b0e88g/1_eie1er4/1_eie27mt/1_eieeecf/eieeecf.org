  So yes is that just a British thing, last names to indicate formality or unfamiliarity?

Both, I think. They call each other by last names as a form of detachment. Like, "we may be classmates, but we're not really friends. We may be co-workers, but we're not friends." Harry, Ron, and Hermione call each other by their first names because they're good friends. The others in Gryffindor are similarly familiar--they all live together. People they barely know and those to whom they are unfriendly are still addressed by their last name.

Unfortunately, a lot of fics turn that around into, "pureblood custom and manners say you're not allowed to call me by my first name until I give you permission." Oh my, what a faux pas.
