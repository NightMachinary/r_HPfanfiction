Yes, but it's a historic British thing.

A couple of centuries ago, in polite society, you'd only address close friends and family by first name.

Boarding schools tend to be highly traditional, so some have adults address students by surname (with or without title dependent on the level of respect they feel students deserve).

Harry using "Malfoy" is probably intended to evoke this aesthetic. (Draco calls him "Potter" first.)

High society is also highly conservative socially, so Slytherins using this system of address might be commentary on their aspirations or Draco's influence over them or just an attempt to make them seem less friendly.
