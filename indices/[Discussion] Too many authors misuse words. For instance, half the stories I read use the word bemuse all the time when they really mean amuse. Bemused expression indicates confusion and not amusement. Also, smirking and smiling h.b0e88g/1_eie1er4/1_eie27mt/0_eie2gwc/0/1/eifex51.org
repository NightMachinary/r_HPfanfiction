It is a thing - more among guys than girls - but a lot of my friends (we're c. 10 years younger than the potter crew would be) still refer to one another by surnames. I think the origin is often in sports teams when your surname would be printed on your kit, so that's what your teammates would call you by.

It's also definitely more prevalent in public (fee-paying) schools. Although I know that's never really addressed, Hogwarts fits the general public school mould so this would make sense.
