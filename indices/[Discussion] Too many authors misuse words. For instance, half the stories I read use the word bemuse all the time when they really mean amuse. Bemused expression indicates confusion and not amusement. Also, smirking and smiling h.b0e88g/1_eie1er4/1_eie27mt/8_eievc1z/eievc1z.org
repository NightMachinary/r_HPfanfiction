  All the US books I read and in my US life people are always first name,

What part of the US are you from, cause as a fellow american i've had the exact opposite experience. I'd say about 40-50% of people I knew growing up were referred to exclusively by last name, my self included. It also had nothing to do with level of friendship or animosity, like me and some of my best friends who i've known since i was 5 years old and am set to be a groomsman at his wedding next fall still mostly refer to each other by last name.

It took until graduate school where I was with an entirely new set of people and didn't feel like I could introduce my self by my last name that people started calling by my first name. Tbh it's still kinda weird to me.
