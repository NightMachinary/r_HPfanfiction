70 years ago, everyone in British schools would have called each other by their surnames. And in adult life too, to a considerable extent. It slowly died out over time, but continued on longer in more traditional schools (actually, they probably still do it). Hogwarts is of course based on that sort of traditional school.

So no, it's not really meant to convey animosity. Using first names indicates a bit more familiarity, but using surnames isn't particularly unfriendly.
