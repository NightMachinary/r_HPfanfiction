Smirk is the absolute worst. If some authors are to be believed the entirety of England is walking around with a smirk on their face.

Not so much misused words, but I'm particular about name usage. Some authors aren't consistent or use names that aren't fitting to the story. I.e. Harry calling Malfoy "Draco" even though there's a ton of animosity between them, Harry calling Hermione "Granger" even though they are friends and there's been no falling out, etc. I have more pet peeves with names, but these types of things are closest to your topic.
