So actually I didn't realize how much controversy apparently existed over this word! I guess it depends on whether you're being more linguistically liberal or not?

As the dictionaries that provide the second definition explain, it really has one original meaning (derived from Latin and coming about around the late 16th century). But eventually in the 20th century people were mislead enough by the “non” prefix that they incorrectly assumed it meant the opposite and the mistake became so common in the english lexicon that they just also sorta included it (which i actually also find to be a really interesting decision). But i wouldn't quite agree that the word has two equally well accepted and opposing definitions? Otherwise, they wouldn't need to specify “informal, North American”.

Though maybe if even Obama has used the word incorrectly in his public comments I can't be /that/ picky? Especially if its an ESL writer, as someone pointed out.
