My personal BIGGEST peeve is people who use 'of' for contractions. "He should of done this", "It could of been amazing" IT MAKES ME SO MAD. Does anyone know why this is a thing? I understand that in speech it can be put down as a relaxed pronounciation when you say "should've" "could've" etc. but do people not get taught in school the difference?
