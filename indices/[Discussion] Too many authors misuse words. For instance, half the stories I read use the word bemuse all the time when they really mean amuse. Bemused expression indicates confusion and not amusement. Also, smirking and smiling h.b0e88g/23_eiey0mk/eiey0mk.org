For overused I notice a lot of stories have people exclaiming, yelling and crying out all the time. It reads funny to me, because it's always way too much emotion for what is seemingly quite a simple situation. It's even worse when one minute they are yelling and the next they are laughing, having such strong emotional changes all over the story is confusing.

It should be said or equivalent instead.
