A lot of authors seem to think all Malfoys' default facial expressions are sneers.

A sneer is not something you have as a resting face, it's a deliberate action you need to take to make that expression and it's also tiring to keep it for more than a few moments.

I think people need to Google image search a sneer, they seem to have it confused with a frown.
