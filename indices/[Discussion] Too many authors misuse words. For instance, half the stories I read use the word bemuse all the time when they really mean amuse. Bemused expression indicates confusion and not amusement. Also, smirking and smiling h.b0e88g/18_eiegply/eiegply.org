I tend to use ‘bemused' when the person isn't just fricking confused, but also for some reason finds themselves sort of amused by what's going on, despite not understanding it. I do this because I know so many people think ‘bemused' means ‘amused' and I don't want to use it in a serious situation where there is no amusement whatsoever, yet it doesn't really change the scene if the reader happens to know the actual meaning because I usually accompany it with some other expression of amusement.
