I tend to use it that way because so many people think ‘bemused' actually means ‘amused' that I can't use it in serious scenarios. I feel like I can only use it in light-hearted situations where people aren't going to wonder why the hell a character is finding this shitfight funny. If I were here to teach everyone about the real meaning of words, I would use ‘bemused' in situations of genuine, perhaps not serious, but maybe not always comical, confusion. I, however am not your English teacher, so I will use the word in such a way that it works whether you understand the true meaning of it or not.
