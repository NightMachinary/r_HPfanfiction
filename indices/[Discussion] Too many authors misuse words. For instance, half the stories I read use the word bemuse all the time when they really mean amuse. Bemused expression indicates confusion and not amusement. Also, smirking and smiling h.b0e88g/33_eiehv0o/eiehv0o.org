Overuse of the word “fine” “We're going to be fine. Everything is going to be fine. No matter what happens we'll be fine.”

Who on earth only wants to be fine when they're upset?! Ugh, it drives me batty, learn some other adjectives/descriptors. And it's ridiculous the number of fics I've found the overuse of “fine” in situations of upset.
