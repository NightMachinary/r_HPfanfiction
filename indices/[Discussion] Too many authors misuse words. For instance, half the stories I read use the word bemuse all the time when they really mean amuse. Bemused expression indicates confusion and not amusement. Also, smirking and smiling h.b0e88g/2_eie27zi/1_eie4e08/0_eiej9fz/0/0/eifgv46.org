I've had it since birth, so its my normal. I don't have complete aphantasia, so I can still see some things in my mind's eye, but I can't imagine:

- Color
- Faces
- Sounds
- Light
- Texture
- Surroundings
- Symbols/words

What I can imagine is basically limited to:

- Object geometry (like what you get out of a bad 3D printer)
- Mass
- Motion

It doesn't have an affect on my daily life, but my dreams, when they even have a visual component, are in black-and-white and are filled with faceless, featurless mannequin people. Its normal for me, but people tend to find that odd when I describe it.

As for how I found out --- I found a YouTube video of someone describing aphantasia and it matched my experiences.
