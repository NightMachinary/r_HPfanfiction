I suspect this is a bit of bleed-through from more expressive forms of media (like animation/manga/comics) where people necessarily have larger, more exaggerated reactions. If you remove the random hand gestures people normally make, most normal, emotionally neutral conversations people have are very boring in terms of physical action, and subtle actions don't convey well to non-visual media. I think it's a necessary evil of creating physicality within something so abstract as writing.

Of course, I might be biased. I have aphantasia, so I /literally/ cannot imagine the words on the page as real scenes. Shuddering, extreme blushing, blanching - those terms convey to me only an emotional intensity; they don't actually make me see someone have an unrealistic full-body reaction like some people might imagine. It therefore doesn't bother me as much.
