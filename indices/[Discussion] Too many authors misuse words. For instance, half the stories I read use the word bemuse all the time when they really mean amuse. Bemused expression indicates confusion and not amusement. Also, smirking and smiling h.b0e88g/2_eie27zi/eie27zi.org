Motherfucking "shudder"

Shitty fanfic authors would have you believe every goddamn person shudders at the mere mention of the bad guy's name or any passing off-color joke. For fuck's sake, people /rarely/ shudder at /anything/ and they sure as hell don't do it just because someone makes reference to Molly Weasley's temper.
