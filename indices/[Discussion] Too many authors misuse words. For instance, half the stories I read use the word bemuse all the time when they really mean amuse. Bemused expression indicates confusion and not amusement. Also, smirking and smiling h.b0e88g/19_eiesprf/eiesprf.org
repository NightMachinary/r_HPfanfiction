General grammatical mistakes thrive everywhere, we'll just assume they're listed. These are oddly specific to fanfics:

*Confused Words:*

*Starring vs Staring

*Drafts vs Draughts vs Droughts

*Retched vs Wretched

*Scarred vs Scared

*Bowel vs Bowl

*Lightning vs Lightening

The Anti-Smirk, The Sneer

Pudding is Dessert. The Wizarding World's children are not constantly being fed that horrid stuff with lumps in it that was still warm on the tray in Middle School in the US. They have a delightful array of various sweets to choose from.

Waggling their eyebrows. Unless it's a special Wizarding skill, most people can't, or at least don't frequently, waggle both of their eyebrows.

Expelliarmus isn't a knock-back spell. It is the disarming spell that at times can cause a knock-back effect, but too many people have it tossing people around right and left while nary a wand goes missing.

Oddly specific: One fic I read had the term wanking being used as a descriptor for something being glaringly obvious or hard not to notice. "When she turned her head, the book was wanking at her from atop the table." type of thing. Maybe it's simply a variation of the term I'm not familiar with, but I've adopted it into my vocabulary.
