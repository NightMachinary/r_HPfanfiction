The waggling thing was something my SO pointed out to me. I think raising an eyebrow or raising both eyebrows shows more the expression you describe. Waggling is more of a raising the alternate brows back and forth. I might just be getting caught up in my SO's pedanticism though. That or I'm frustrated at not being able to waggle my eyebrows smoothly in that fashion.

Depulso!!! I send something away!!

Occlumency saves the world bc your brain becomes super OP and organized and you memorize languages, speak telepathically, and wait... No. No it is not.

For lime/lemon fics while staying PG I must add that I'm tired of hearing about gazing into someone's <insert jewel color> orbs. Also, not every item of clothing pools around someone's feet or on the floor. Jeans for example, they get shrugged off and lay there in a clunky pile of themselves.
