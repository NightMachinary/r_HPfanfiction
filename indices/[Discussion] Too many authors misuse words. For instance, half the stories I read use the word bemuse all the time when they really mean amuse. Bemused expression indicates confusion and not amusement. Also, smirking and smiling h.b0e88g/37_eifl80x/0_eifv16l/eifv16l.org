Um... this is not correct. All languages, including French, are constantly evolving. This is why we do not speak the way people spoke in the 19th century, or even in the 1950's, or even a decade ago. That is applicable to all languages. Also, there is no governing body that regulates languages. In every country new words are being added to the dictionaries --- if they are used enough times in print --- every year. English is in fact a linguistic anarchy compared to French, but not because of this. English has no rigid rules when applied to word creation and usage. You can make a noun into a verb, you can add a Latin prefix and a German suffix to the same word at the same time, etc etc. English is just much more flexible grammatically. But it does not mean, people can arbitrarily choose alternative meanings and spellings for established words because they feel like it.
