You make some good points.

But I'd disagree with the last one. People arbitrarily redefine and respell words all the time, it just takes a bunch of people agreeing with them in order to make it stick. The great thing about the English language is that so long as enough people agree, it's correct for that dialect. (ex: the word "toboggan". For nearly all English speakers, it's a sled. But a small part of the US uses it to refer to what the rest of the world would call a beanie.) Or the fact that alternate spellings of things are everywhere
