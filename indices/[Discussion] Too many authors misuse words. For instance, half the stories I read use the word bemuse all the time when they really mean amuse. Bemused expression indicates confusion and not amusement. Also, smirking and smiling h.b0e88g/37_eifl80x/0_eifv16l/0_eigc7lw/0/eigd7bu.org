Oh yeah. That is absolutely true. As far as I remember, a new word needs to be used 5000 times --- in print! --- before it is added to the dictionary in the UK. So exactly as you say, if enough people agree, then the word may acquire a new meaning or spelling.

My point it is, however, within the topic of this thread. Meaning: because English is an evolving language, fanfic writers still cannot choose what the words shall mean on a whim. Especially if it's counter to what the dictionary says.
