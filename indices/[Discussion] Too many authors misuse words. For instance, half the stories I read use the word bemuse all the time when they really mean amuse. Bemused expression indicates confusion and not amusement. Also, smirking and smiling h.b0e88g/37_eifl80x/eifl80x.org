The thing is, English is not a set language. There are no hard and fast rules with English like there are with other languages. There is no singular overseeing body who determines how words get used and how they should get used unlike French. It's a language that is constantly mutating and evolving. There are some general guidelines that make it way more readable, but the thing with English is that its linguistic anarchy. The only reason there are accepted conventions and definitions of words is because enough people have decided that that's the way a word is going to be used that that's what it means. Take "literally" for example. It's meaning has mutated over the years. Same with "ironic" (none of the examples in the song are actually irony, but now it's an accepted definition that unfortunate coincidences are irony). Bemused has been used as a synonym for "amused" since well before the internet was a thing.
