Still hate it, but how about encouraging Wizards to have harems of Muggle women? That will really jack up the Wizard population growth!

Of course, Witches won't be happy, so they will need to be compensated.

I personally favor magical-technological solutions such as inventing an artificial womb. Then someone (eg Hermione) could identify best genetic pairings and *mass produce* magical children!!!!
