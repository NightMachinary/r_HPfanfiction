You could have the process for obtaining a marriage license involve a check for love potions and other mind magics.

Any story where a small number of people have a disproportionate amount of power can easily turn to dystopia. And unfortunately, the Harry Potter world is basically built on that concept. So any fic, especially the ones that don't just ignore the muggle world, could easy turn or be seen as potentially dystopic. But fortunately, most fics are happy to ignore or erase issues like that when they get in the way of a good story, and that's what I'm hoping to see here.
