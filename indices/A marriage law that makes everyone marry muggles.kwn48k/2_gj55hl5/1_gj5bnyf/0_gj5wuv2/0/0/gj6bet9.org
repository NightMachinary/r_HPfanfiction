The problem I have here is that you're expecting pureblood supremacists to just set aside their prejudices to marry a muggle immediately following a war fought because of those prejudices. This is not unlike telling southern white men that they have to marry black women during Reconstruction. Some may learn better. More will find a way to take it, or get around the law in some way, and then you've given a group of abusers a set of perfect targets.

Prejudice and hate cannot be legislated away. It took 100 years for the most basic civil rights to be granted to Black men and women after the American Civil War, and we're still nowhere near true equality 50 years later. I recognize what you're trying to do, but the concept is horrifying to me.
