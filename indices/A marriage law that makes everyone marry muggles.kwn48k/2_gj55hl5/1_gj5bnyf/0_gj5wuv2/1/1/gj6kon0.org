Are you telling me that you would not choose to marry a magical person if you could? There are substantial benefits to living in the magical world with someone who can do magic, even if you can't do it yourself. Plus, if you're a person who wants kids, wouldn't you like your kids to have a good shot at being magical, since it would give them much better lives?

And you don't need to force muggles to opt in. You go out and date them and fall in love like everybody else. Then their motivation is "I love you, so of course I want to marry you." You know, just like for everybody else.
