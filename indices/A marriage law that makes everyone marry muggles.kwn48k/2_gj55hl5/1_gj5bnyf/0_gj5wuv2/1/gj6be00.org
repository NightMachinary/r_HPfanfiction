There's a fic that's no longer up that talked about this and it doesn't even have to be awful people to become an awful circumstance. Most wizarding homes don't seem to have basic functionality usable by someone without magic (lights, appliances running on electricity, locks on doors). So, that really easily becomes them being prisoners in their homes. Additionally, if they are likely to result in wizarding children who often manifest ability as toddlers/young children, you have less power, especially if children see one parent using magic and the other one not. Also, what incentive do non-magical folk have to enter into these marriages? The normal method is that if you don't comply you get kicked out of the wizarding world, so like...what kind of force are you using to get muggles to opt in to this?
