Artificial womb? Kinda a long shot and might be redundant anyway, After all, basing on the general wizarding public's relationship with press it could probably be solvd be a few articles in Daily Prophet, lol.

Sure, there would be stragglers and some families would not go for it (and there would be some like that no matter the solution), but getting a good chunk of middle class to be more hedonistic and hit the clubs would already result in a surge of 'muggleborns'... :D
