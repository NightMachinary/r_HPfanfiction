Draco felt a feeling of immense dread desceding upon him. He might have been a proper wizard, a former deatheater, a man who once upon have looked the Dark Lord in the eye and helped his evil plans.

Yet the task before him seemed even more insurmountable than figuring out how to make the backdoor to Hogwarts work for the Deatheaters. Claustrophoby threatened to encompass him at any second, his ears long deafned by the overwhelming noise, the stench of shapeless mass of bodies swirling behind cloying his nostrils. He briefly considered admitting to posession of dark artifacts, if only to escape to Azkaban, the place now seeming a favourable, quiet choice.

Yet he could not, for the fate of his family, a burden of countless past generations, was resting on his shoulders.

He looked at a glass before him, dark liquid swirling in indescernible patterns. His resolve steeled, he downed in in one go, unflinchingly.

"/Alright, might as well get to it"/ he thought, turning to the girl that stood beside him.

His resolve steeled, he asked the dreaded question: "Would... would you care for a dance, miss?"
