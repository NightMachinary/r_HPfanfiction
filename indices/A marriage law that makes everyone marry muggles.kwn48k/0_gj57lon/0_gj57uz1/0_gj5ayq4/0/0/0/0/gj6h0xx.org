"Hey, Potter, do you remember when Hagrid hatched that dragon back in our first year?"

"Yeah. What about it?"

"Did it ever occur to you and your friends to, let's say, adopt the dragon, leave it with Fluffy to raise when you were in classes, and then spend the summer living with both of them in the Forbidden Forest?"

"What? No! Why would we have done that? Why would you even think to ask that?"

"Oh, no reason really. On a completely unrelated note, thank you for being such a reasonable person when we were at school."
