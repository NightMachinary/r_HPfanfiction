Well I'm the original prompter, and I don't care that you've veered off in a completely different direction. This story is fun, and I want to see what Draco continues to get up to (and I usually don't even like Draco). Will his campaign steal ideas from Harry's adventures and magical history? Will he tell Victoria that magic exists by telling her that everything from the campaign was real? Will he gloat to Harry that his girlfriend is a better hero because she defeated Voldemort by campaign/year five?
