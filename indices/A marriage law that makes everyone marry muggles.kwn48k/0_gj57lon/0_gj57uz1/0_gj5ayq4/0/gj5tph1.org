During writing the first part i've thought of naming the girl Kasey as homage to one of my favourite fics "What's her name in Hufflepuff", but it didn't fit the flow of dialogue so i've scrapped it. I'd say we can get some more mileage out Srebryakov... that is, Victoria Silver for localisation purposes.

At first, Draco was apprehensive of meeting his girlfriend's frieds. He was sure that finding one likeable muggle didn't show the full picture - after all, he reasoned, could you imagine somoene's idea about purebloods be shaped by likes of Goyle?

After a round of introductions, gifting everyone a beer from a crate he brought (Malfoy's own brewery - he refused to drink the piss most of muggle bars sold as 'beer') he gained some insight as to the purpose of this meeting.

"So, Draco", Victoria asked, "Have you ever heard of RPGs? You know, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, that sort of stuff?"

"Not really, no", he answered. He might have lived in dungeons for the most of his schoolyears, and was, after a fashion, named after dragons, but he was pretty sure that wasn't a thing to bring up at the moment. "What're those about?"

"Oh, you're going to love it", Victoria smiled, "We were going to have our monthly session today, i've figured i should introduce you to it sooner rather than later, especially since you seemed to like talking about fantasy stuff"

Draco nodded. He recalled having some rather interesting discussions about the things his girlfriend referred to as 'fantasy'. He found that muggle fascination with all thigs magic a tad humorous and abusrd at first, but he'd soon realised that it made sense. Magic was, after all, great, so it shouldn't be surprising that those without magical ability were longing for it.

"Alright", he agreed.

"Awesome! Well, i guess you can look through the rulebooks and see a bit of us playing, and then, if you like it, you could maybe join us?" Victoria asked, passing him some slightly worn out booklet.

"Sure", Draco acquiesced, accepting the papers. He glanced through the pages, trying to parse some of the rules while the others started setting up for the game. Some of the things seemed a tad absurd ("/Wizards limited to cast only a few spells a day?!", "Elves?!!!"),/ but he figured it made sense to make the game enjoyable for those that didn't choose a magical character.

Soon, he was drawn to observe and listen as a tale of an epic adventure unfolded beofre his eyes. The group of friends, acting as their choosen adventurers, adventuring through forests and caves, battling mystical monsters. It was hypnotysing, and slightly surreal, to see people he once thought to be no better than animals behaving just like any group of friends, cheerful and chatty and happy, imagining themselves to be something fantastical.

He sat, engrossed in the session, eventually joining alongside current gamemaster to lead the adventure along, throwing in a few ideas from the wizarding world here and there ("Plants that scream so loud they kill anyone when pulled out of the ground? Wicked!"). Eventually, the meeting wound down and he left alongisde Victoria to see her to her Tube line.

"So, Draco", Victoria asked as they approached the station, "Did you like meeting my friends?"

"Actually, yes. It was quite... interesting. And fun. And maybe enlightening?" He anwsered.

Victoria lauhged; "Ah, i know we're somewhat nerdy, but i'm glad you've enjoyed it. Would you like to join us on our future sessions?"

"Certainly", Draco said, "It seemed fun. Altough, i kind of liked helping the gamemaster, do you think your friends would agree to play a campaing if i came up with one?", he asked with a small amount of wariness.

"Oh, no dobut, as long as the story is good. Maybe show it to me beforehand so we can see if everything works well?", she asked.

"Fine by me. So, i guess i see you tomorrow?"

"Oh, yes. Same place as the last time, at 5?"

"Of course. See you!"

"See you too!", Victoria replied, and planted a kiss on his lips before entering the Tube station.

Draco lifted his hand to his lips, a tingle of something new emotion running through his body.

"/Screw the dark lord, and all those pureblood morons",/ he thought. "/That, that right there? That was some real magic"./

And there, by this point i've veered a bit too far from original prompt and into some different area. Oh well, it was fun. If you ever have some prompts/ideas, do send them my way as well. Creativity ain't my strong suite, but i figure i can work out a passable piece of writing given some idea and direction. It's been nice working with ya! :D
