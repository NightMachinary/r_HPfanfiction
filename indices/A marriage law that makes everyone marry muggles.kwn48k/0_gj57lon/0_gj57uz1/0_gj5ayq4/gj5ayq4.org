// Reporting for duty! XD //

Say what you will about Draco Malfoy, but he was certainly not bad looking. Silky hair, aristocratic features, body lean from playing Quiddich - it was quite enough to get him a dance.

One dance turned into ten, and before he knew it he was already set to meet the girl for a date.

Dates, too, multiplied as if by magic, and before long they were meeting regularly, and Draco was no longer forcing himself to play a role, no longer suffering through a duty. he was actually enjoying himself for once.

It was certainly a change from the post-Voldemort society. Even after his family being declared innocent (mostly) people still looked at them with suspicion. It was one of the reasons he was even going through with this, to begin with. While he had more than enough funds to pay a bounty and thus a right to make his own matchmaking choices, a Malfoy doing so would be subject to more scurtiny. Too much.

There was nothing like that amongst muggles. There, he was a good looking man with an exotic name and an endearing lack of knowledge of technology. He knew a bit, but not enough to have to feign interest when a conversation partner descended into a more deeply muggle topic. Good looking, great dancer, excellent listener... It was actually a wonder it took him a while to start enjoying his trips to muggle pubs and dance clubs.

That led him to the current situation, meeting his girlfriend's friends at her house. Not quite as stressful as meeting the parents would be, he reasoned, but he was still quite out of his depth.

He steeled himself, took a deep breath and knocked on the door.

I'm thinking a DnD nut playing a Wizard, meeting friends=meeting the group. Any ideas for the name? :D
