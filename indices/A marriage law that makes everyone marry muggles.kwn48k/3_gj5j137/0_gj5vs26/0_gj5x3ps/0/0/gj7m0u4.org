Umbridge was a half blood, and had a squib brother so there's another data point.

We're probably seeing fewer squibs than what actually happens too, as they are not in visible positions for the POV character throughout the seven books. Wizarding families also tend to go out of their way to sweep squib family members under the rug. Even Ron mentioned that his mom has an accountant cousin or something that they don't talk to.
