You're not acting like you know how Punnet squares work.

A prompt is one thing. A calculation is another. Your calculation is based on some false premises.

I don't know where you got this perfect pureblood gene pool idea. I just said, and the Punnet squares say, that genes for magic (if there are any) will stay at a constant level in the population whether there's a marriage law or not, unless there's some selection pressure on them.

Edited to add: Would an example help? Let's make a simplified model of how magical inheritance might work: It's controlled by just one gene, the M gene. M is dominant, and gives magical ability. m is recessive, and gives no magical ability.

One pureblood MM wizard moves to a town of just muggles, and marries a muggle, mm. They have two kids, both Mm, both magical. So, in one generation, the magical population doubled. Happy?

Next generation, those Mm kids marry mm muggles. Each couple has two kids: one magical Mm, one squib mm. This generation still just has two magical people in it.

Next generation, those magical kids both marry muggles and have two kids, again one magical Mm, one squib mm. There are still just two magical people in this generation.

The magical population might increase or decrease a bit due to genetic drift, but it will tend to stay about the same unless there's some selection pressure on it.
