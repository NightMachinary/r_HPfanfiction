If you're going to assume that magic is genetically inherited like other traits, you need to understand how other traits are genetically inherited. Please read about Mendelian genetics. Make sure you understand [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square][Punnet squares]].

This Mendelian model is too simple to adequately explain the inheritance of many real traits, and also can't account for both muggleborns and squibs. But at least it demonstrates how in every generation, if there isn't any selection pressure, there are the same genes in the same ratios. You don't have one trait taking over a population just because it's cool.

Natural selection still works, there are just different selection pressures. Now, being too stupid to know how birth control works gives an evolutionary advantage. I assume having access to magical birth control would be an evolutionary disadvantage, no matter how much of a personal advantage it is.
