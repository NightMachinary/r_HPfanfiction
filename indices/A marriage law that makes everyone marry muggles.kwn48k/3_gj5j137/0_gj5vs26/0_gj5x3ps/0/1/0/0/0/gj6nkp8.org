Yes, I know how Punnett squares work, and also that they are an oversimplification.

I also now completely understand why some people complain about people attacking prompts for no reason. Your "insights" have added nothing except "this wouldn't work because I don't want it to." But anyone who wanted to write a story based on it easily could say that it works without violating canon.

If you want to argue that the Death Eaters were right and muggles and mudbloods need to be kept away from the perfect pureblood genepool, please go do it somewhere else.
