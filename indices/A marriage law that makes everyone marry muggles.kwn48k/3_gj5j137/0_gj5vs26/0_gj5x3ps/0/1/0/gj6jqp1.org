My point with the Creeveys is that magic at least follows similar patterns to genetics. Something about the Creevey parents made them very likely to have magical kids. Just like something about every magical couple makes them very likely to have magical kids.

I'm pretty sure that natural selection and the like start to disappear once you have intelligent beings mucking about with things. Magic is definitely an evolutionary advantage. Even if you never cast a spell, it seems to provide increased resilience and lifespan. The problems came from societal pressures, wars, and isolation from the rest of the world.
