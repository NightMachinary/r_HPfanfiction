The Creevey brothers are muggleborns, and so don't tell us anything about the children of mixed marriages.

If there is a genetic component involved in magical inheritance (and we can't assume that, since it's not like magic follows scientific laws in general) I would assume magic acts like other genetically inherited traits like eye color. A couple with brown eyes can have two kids with blue eyes. That doesn't mean that the blue-eyed trait is taking over the population. Without selection pressure, ratios of various traits will stay about the same, or sometimes drift randomly.

If you're saying there's selection pressure for magical ability, that's another argument entirely. If a trait has an evolutionary advantage, it will spread in the population, no marriage law necessary. In canon, magical ability seems to confer a evolutionary disadvantage, considering how few children magical families tend to have, and how many characters die without reproducing at all.
