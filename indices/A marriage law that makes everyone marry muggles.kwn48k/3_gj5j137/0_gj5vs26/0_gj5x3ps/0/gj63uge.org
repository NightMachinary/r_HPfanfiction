I am inclined to ignore Pottermore whenever possible.

Snape, Seamus, possibly Dean, and of course Voldemort are also examples. Obviously there's some confirmation bias involved, since squibs would be unlikely to show up at Hogwarts.

But I think the best piece of evidence is the Creevey brothers. Muggleborns are rare enough that the chances of two of them being in the same family are nearly impossible, unless there's some strong genetic component involved. Or Mrs. Creevey was having an affair with a wizard, but that's still a point in my favor.

The selection pressure is that magic is awesome, and everyone who knows about magic will want their kids to have magic. I imagine that squibs would probably be treated as muggles for the purposes of this law. And those squibs would probably be seen as ideal spouses for many witches and wizards, because they already know about magic, and (if you are right about mixed marriages), their kids are probably more likely to be born with magic. And the squibs would probably be doing their best to hook up with witches and wizards to keep magic in their lives.

So the magical population and the percentage of the total population that is part of the magical world will grow slower than I predicted, but it will still grow. And more importantly, almost no one is going to want to leave. Squibs will stay in the magical world, marry magicals, and have magical kids. Same with siblings of muggleborns and even the families of muggles who marry magicals. Pretty soon they start hanging out in Diagon Alley in their obviously muggle clothes to try to catch someone's eye. Then they get a job there or move into Hogsmeade to spend more time in the magical world. Then some stores start opening up to cater to the muggles and squibs because there are enough of them there to support it. And then oops, we've accidentally created an integrated society.

So maybe my math is wrong, and maybe some of my assumptions are flawed, but I think that the end goal I see is still possible, even if my timeline is off. Besides, it's all up to the author anyway.
