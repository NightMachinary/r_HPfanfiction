Squibs are uncommon when both parents are magical. You're talking about mixed marriages here, which we can expect to produce different results. We don't have that many examples of mixed marriages. [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/gilderoy-lockhart][Lockhart]] was the only magical child in his family. He had two squib sisters. There's also Lupin, an only child, which doesn't tell us much.

We don't know that magic is inherited in some straightforward Mendelian way, but there are no real examples of a trait just spreading through a population (unless some selection pressure is spurring evolution) in the way you describe.
