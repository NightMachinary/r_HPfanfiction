Maybe you could start with him coming back and tell the reasons why he came back as a sort of b-roll behind the story of him becoming Tom? Maybe even make it so the b-roll swaps with the main story partway through, so you have how he becomes Tom as the main plot of the first half, then once you're sure everyone and their grandma is aware Tom Riddle becomes the barkeep Tom, the part of the story that leads up to him coming back in time with the secretly good part of his soul growing stronger with time. And then the climaxes are Voldemort coming back while Tom gives his life to see that the world doesn't end up being rules by Voldemort, or a similar ending.
