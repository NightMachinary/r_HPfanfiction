It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  What happens when a person loses one of the very last persons he can depend on and the others betray him. A fic where Harry explores the very depths of magic and attempts to find the cure to his mother's coma and become the most powerful wizard. Some chaps have paras from orig but it's being massively edited for that. Kickass, Independant Harry/ Dimension travel/ No slash

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
