There's a list of my favorites, I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is incredible and a good place to start if you haven't read it already. The Prince of Slytherin is a more recent fic that updates very regularly. There are two stories here by Newcomb, both are incredible. The Lesser Sadness is pretty slow updating but definitely worth the wait. If you have any questions just let me know.
