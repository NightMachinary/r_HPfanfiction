+Sure, I just saw this, I'm on my phone, in about an hour I'll edit this comment with a light summary of the first story (easier from pc). I was wary at first too, so I don't blame you.+

Trying to figure out spoiler tag for this sub, one sec.

I'm gonna put a basic summary in a spoiler just in case. [[/s][spoiler]]

That's basically the first story. I'd have to actually reread the whole thing to give a better rundown, I just clicked around to get the basic timeline in order. The development and awareness of the powers and other planes/dimensions, the hopping I think actually happens in one of the sequels, but it all builds. Character development, including OCs which are rather important, it builds the politics and culture of the UK Wizarding world, and gives people a chance to relearn what it's like to live without the looming fear of a 'dark lord' but also showcases many of the prejudices people hold regardless.
