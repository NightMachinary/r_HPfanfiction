I am surprised that no one has recommended "A Stranger in an Unholy Land". In my (admittedly biased) opinion, it's the best dimension hopping fic in HP fandom.The character building is not of the highest quality but the plot development is first rate . Well worth the read.

The sequel "A Stranger in the Promised Land" is also pretty good but suffers from the minor hurdle that it hasn't been updated past the fourth chapter in over seven years. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3592984/1/A-Stranger-in-the-Promised-Land]]).

Don't worry though. Unholy Land stands on its own and you can enjoy it. (PS: There's a link for "A Stranger in the Promised Land" which contains seven completed chapters(450 odd pages). If anyone's interested and wants to get frustrated at the end of chapter 7, I'll post the link).
