Hermione disappeared after the final battle, it's been years since, and almost everyone believes her to be dead. Now this is a pretty massive spoiler. [[/spoiler][Harry doesn't, and he eventually figures out she was sent to another dimension. So he finds the dimension transfer thingy that the Unspeakables created and starts dimension-hopping in order to find her. In one of the dimensions he encounters an alternate!Hermione who hast lost everything.]]

lorien829 has great - perhaps even some of the best - H/Hr stories with solid characterization, good writing, etc. They feel very true to canon in terms of tone and character personalities. (Somehow, they're also not very /exciting/, but maybe that's just me).
