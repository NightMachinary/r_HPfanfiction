Bellatrix's age is highly suspect: JKR put her birth year in 1951 and her father's in 1938, so you people can see the problem. The author of "Delenda Est" increased her father's birth year to an unspecified date, while pushing back her birth year to 1957/1958. I think this is a much better solution than canon, and it puts all three Black Sisters in school together with the Marauders.
