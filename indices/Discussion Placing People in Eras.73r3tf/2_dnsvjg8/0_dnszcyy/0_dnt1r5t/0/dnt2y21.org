She could, but she would still have to be older than Andromeda, since she's on the left of the burn mark in the family tree (according to the fifth book), and Andromeda was probably out of Hogwarts when she had Tonks in 1973 (+11+7(Hogwarts)+3(Auror training)+1(as an Auror)=1995).

If she was born in 1954 or late '53, she could have been a seventh year when MWPP and Lily started Hogwarts.
