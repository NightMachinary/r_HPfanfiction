Lockhart /is/ canonically four years younger than the marauders, though.

As for Trelawney, she hasn't got a canonical age as far as we know, but to me it makes perfect sense that she's not that old. I imagine her spending a couple of years or two on the dole before the Divination job opening at Hogwarts. (If you want a seer as a medium for your 'word of god', you could use her instead of flanderising Pandora [yet-to-be-]Lovegood.)

Narcissa, if you follow canon, is starting her sixth or fifth year if you follow all canon, but otherwise she just have to be old enough to have Draco in 1980. Andromeda has to at least be a sixth year in 1971, whereas Bellatrix just have to be older than the other two (since her name is to the left in the family tree).

Molly must have graduated in 1969, or 1970 if you're really pushing it. Gideon and Fabian are most likely only a few years younger or older than her, but they /could/ be still at school in the mid-seventies without "breaking" canon.

It's a shame that so few fics are set in that era with the MC being at least a few years ahead of the Marauders. (But after my own attempt, I can see why: it's hard to get a plot going, when all your characters are OCs or "semi-OCs" [like teenage Narcissa Black, Amelia Bones, Kingsley Shackebolt, etc.], and Voldemort is still kinda inactive.)
