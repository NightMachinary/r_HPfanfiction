Yeah I think Rowling has stated that she isn't good at math, which makes sense why the other characters haven't been given a year that they were born in. And yeah I did say figure people out who are older and younger then the Marauders as well.

I always imagined Trelawney to be younger then the Marauders myself; maybe a year or two younger at the most. Although I suppose it's possible that she was around Bellatrix' age at the most.

There's just so much to debate with the characters. It's really interesting.

Fudge being older then Molly and Arthur makes sense, although how much older is the question here. I say maybe a 5th year by the time Molly and Arthur started Hogwarts?

And I have Fabian and Gideon older then Molly in my headcanon personally. Just the idea of older protective brothers is always fun.

Although I suppose it could be possible that Trelawney could be around Molly and Arthur's Era, we really don't know how old she is.

I tend to have Emmeline Vance in Molly and Arthur's Era. Although I don't know if her age has been stated.

Professor Septima Vector could possibly be around Molly and Arthur's Era, maybe a bit older just depending.

Charity Burbage I see older then the Marauders, although I'm not sure how much older myself.
