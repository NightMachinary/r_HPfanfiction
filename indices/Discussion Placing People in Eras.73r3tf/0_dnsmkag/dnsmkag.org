I think a lot of it is just trying to include all the characters at once. I personally always have Lucius in Seventh Year when Snape & the Marauders begin; Narcissa in her Fourth Year around that time, and Andromeda and Bellatrix in their Sixth and Fifth Years, respectively.

People don't think to look this stuff up. They just want to include everybody, you know?

Many young readers do think of all the characters as being "old" or "older" rather than so many years older, so the Marauders era becomes a catch-all for all of these "old" characters, although the timelines don't make sense.
