Shezza's trilogy is the obvious answer, but I guess you already know of it. I will add linkffn(The fallen renegade) which is a spinoff of said trilogy. If I remember correctly, Harry is an even bigger asshole in that one.

Edit: The really good part starts from chapter 9. The earlier stuff is introductory.
