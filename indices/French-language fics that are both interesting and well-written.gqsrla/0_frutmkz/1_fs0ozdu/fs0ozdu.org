I'm going to second the recommendation for Les Cicatrices du Temps because I read it in English via Google Translate, and even with the horrible translation it was an excellent story. I can't imagine it would be a bad story in the original language, without the horrible translation errors.

Maybe I should brush off my French (and pull out my French-English dictionary) and try it in the original language.
