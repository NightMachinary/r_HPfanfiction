I'm French but I only read fanfictions in English. I have a friend who tried to recommend me some in French though so here they are (haven't read them myself because there is so much to explore in English...)

This one is a trilogy, quite additive, according to my friend: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7007114/1/Les-Cicatrices-du-Temps][Les Cicatrices du Temps]]

This one is funny, according to my friend: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3645228/1/Une-%C3%A9trange-association][Un étrange association]]

Edit: now that I think about it, to be honest, I don't read in French because I can't find well-written ones... And you can feel the community is actually reading in English, because they use literal translations for terms from fanfictions (Lord Noir for Dark Lord is actually horrifying for me. Even "le côté de la Lumière" for the "Light Side" is terrible...) So, yeah, to read in French, you do need to be somewhat tolerant of this, I'm afraid... I would actually recommend reading French-translated canon books instead. Those are a great way to rediscover it and it's well-written.
