Hello, fellow French-speaking person. I actually... don't quite agree with you (sorry).

I actually love the adaptation they did in canon books. It's always clever wordplays and it's part of the magic. Don't forget that Harry Potter is child litterature. I don't believe I would have understand the wordplay done with "Hogwarts" if it wasn't "Poudlard" when I was 7 years old (so when I first read them). "Serdaigle" for "Ravenclaw" is awesome, even if it's not the same animal. "Serpentard" for "Slytherin" is really cool. I agree it's not the same as the original, that you lose some stuff (the Gaunt link with Marvolo, indeed) but it does adapt well the magic of it so I love it. Translation notes are a great way to preserve the original, that's true, but it does bring a fourth wall in your reading and kind of bring you back in reality, which is not fun when reading fantasy, I believe... Anyway, French-translated canon books are great, imo, which why I advise OP to read it in French as a way to rediscover them. For me, the original books are well-written and well-adapted.

But that's my problem with French-written fanfictions, actually. I don't feel this creativity in the adaptation of the concepts borrowed from English-written fanfictions. So I find that sad and just don't read it, that's all. Well, I'm also much more difficult to please in my mother-tongue that in any other languages, so maybe there's that also...
