Well fellow french, I too am ashamed to only read English fanfiction (or fiction in general), I cannot bear to read in french anymore because author|editor and Translator tend to translate everything, even the Family name, Like Newt Scamander is Norbert Dragonneau in French (Hogwart = Poudlard and it's the fucking official translation) , For fuck's sake it's bad it doesn't work! Stop translating the proper nouns or anything else that's matter honestly.

It's strange because The Toubon Law does not concern thing like books, and translating Name, Cities, Place or Organizations doesn't make it more appealing to me, it's like they are "Francizating" (Excuse-me for this horrible word) the British culture (or any culture being concerned by this phenomenon) and it's not making the translation better, that's just insulting.

Another Exemple *Tom Marvolo Riddle* was switched to *Tom Elvis Jedusor*, because they really really needed to get /"I am Lord Voldemort"/ translated so we could read /"Je suis Voldemort"/ and honestly, by doing this, they removed the connection to The Gaunt family, it fucking removes the connection to his Father's name that he really hated, and this is fucking insulting toward the source material, just put some fucking subtittles or a note in the book at the page concerned.
