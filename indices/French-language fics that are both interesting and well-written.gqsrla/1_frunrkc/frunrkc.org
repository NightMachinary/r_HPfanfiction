I did the same 8 years ago with Spanish. I noticed really quickly that the translations of the big English fics were my best bet, so maybe it is the same with French. Many of the all time greats have well done translations into various languages, and are usually mentioned/linked by the author themselves.

Sorry I don't have any specific links for you since I don't speak French, but thought I would drop the advice in case you hadn't thought about that.
