As your standard English speaking, no second language USAian, I've long wondered:

How did the French editions of the Potter books (and I suppose by extension the French Language Fan Fiction) deal with the Pepe LePew version of French the English editions had Fleur and company speaking?

With everyone already speaking French, what set Fleur and her classmates/staff apart?
