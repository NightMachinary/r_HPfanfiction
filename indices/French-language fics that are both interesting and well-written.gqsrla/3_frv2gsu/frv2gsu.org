Hello. I am a French reader. Here is one of my favorite fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10776037/1/Survivre-sans-magie]].\\
This fanfiction follows an SI that was thrown into the world of Harry Potter. Unlike most fanfiction, the SI remains a muggle. The plot is original. Unfortunately, the fanfiction was never finished.

I also recommend you this fanfiction:\\

It takes place at the time of the marauders. Through the diary, a young Tom Riddle takes Serverus under his wing.
