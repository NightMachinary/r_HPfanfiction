I Headcannon myself that Fiendfyre is fueled by pure rage which also explains why it's so hard to control. There are six basic emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, Surprise and Fear. If Happiness and the desire to protect the source of it brings the Patronus, and Headcannoning that Anger and the raging desire to consume everything brings out Fiendfyre, I imagine something like this: *Fear: Using your own source of primal Fear you can cast a defensive barrier based on terrorizing attackers (thus creating a Boggart). *Sadness: You channel your worst moments in life to summon a happiness-eating creature (thus creating a Dementor). *The other two I have no ideas.
