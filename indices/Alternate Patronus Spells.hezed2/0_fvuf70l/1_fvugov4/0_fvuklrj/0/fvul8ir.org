I like the idea that sadness and fear being about the existence of dementors and boggarts. Maybe you are right with the Fiendfyre idea although I guess it is up to the writer to decide its mechanics. I would say that surprise and disgust are not really core emotions. Happiness, sadness, anger, and fear certainly. Perhaps envy or jealousy as was previously mentioned? I'm no philosopher nor am I an anthropologist etc, so I cant say definitely what every humans' core emotions are. Perhaps envy brings about Ron Weasley? Btw what is Headcannoning?
