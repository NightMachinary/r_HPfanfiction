I get that idea. That being said the Patronus is never said to be that powerful. Harry's is pretty powerful but only because he has a unique perspective of love (assuming it's based off love). That being said the scene in the films when harry casts it is absolutely fucking amazing and gives a real sense of power so you're probably right. Cant remember the book scene but I get the idea it's similar.
