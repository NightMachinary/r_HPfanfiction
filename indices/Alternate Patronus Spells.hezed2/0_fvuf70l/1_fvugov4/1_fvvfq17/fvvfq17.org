See, envy and jealousy get pretty intense - hence fuck off huge poisonous dragon/serpent. Admittedly, I'm drawing somewhat on a sort of vaguely Christian interpretation, inspired in particular by Handel's Eldest Born Of Hell(lovely piece of music about Saul going mad over his envy of David).

So I reckon the eldest born of hell is going to be the classical serpent in the tree turned up to 11. The patronus isn't weak, after all, so an envy equivalent wouldn't be either.

Of course, that's for the Envy equivalent of the Patronus. An envy powered stunning spell for example might do exactly what you say re withering.
