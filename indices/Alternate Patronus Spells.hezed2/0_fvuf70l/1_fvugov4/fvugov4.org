Its funny that you should mention Fiendfyre as a spell that requires hate to perform. My belief is that, in canon, it is labelled dark due to its power and destructive nature. In many fics, Harry or other characters use it in fights and dont use hate to power it. In a few fics I've read, it is written as a spell that is easily summoned but very hard to control. That being said maybe using hate could be a way to control it. Thanks for your ideas. Envy I have always thought of as being a subtle killer. Maybe an envy powered curse would wither or weaken or maybe sap the strength of another and return it to the caster?
