To me the Patronus Charm utilizes happy memories of that which you LOVE the most, true, but only to fuel one of the most primal instincts: To protect that which we love, if you fight to save your life you Will fight with strenght but If you do it to save someone else, specially someone you love, you'll find strenght you didn't knew you had. Thus the Patronus acts as a defender fueled by primal love.
