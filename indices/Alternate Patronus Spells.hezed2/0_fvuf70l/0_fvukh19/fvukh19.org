I always figured the Patronus spell was actually fueled by love, not happiness. This also explains the spectactular backfiring for dark Wizards using it -- they use "happy memories" fueled by hate/cruelty rather than love. And the confusion in canon about using happy memories make sense -- usually, your happiest memories also feature love in some way. Why, otherwise, would Harry fail to accomplish anything at all by using memories where he was clearly very happy, but not very loving memories (such as his first wand)?

Harry's memories fueling his Patronus weren't exactly /happy/ but they definitely feature love. I'd argue that Snape was probably in a similar situation as Harry, which also explains why his Patronus is the same as Lily's. This would also explain why Umbridge was able to cast a Patronus -- she was probably at her happiest doing some kind of sadistic task, but if she used a memory fueled by love -- be it for her cats or something we don't want to know -- it explains why it was stable and didn't backfire on her.

This would also explain why the Patronus was so hard to cast -- because of the misconception about you needing happy memories, rather than loving ones. Harry, an average wizard, was able to cast the Patronus at 13, and aside from resisting the Imperius, that was basically the only things he did that suggest that he is truly magically powerful -- otherwise he's rather average in general.
