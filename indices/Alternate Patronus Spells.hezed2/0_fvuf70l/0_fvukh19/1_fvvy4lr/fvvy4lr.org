I really like your concept and I think I'll adopt your point of view about the love rather than happiness. I agree harry is pretty average on general. I love good god!harry fics but in canon, Harry is average but lucky. Thanks for your input. Its greatly appreciated. Btw what if a spell could be powered by sadistic love or happiness?
