Emotional manifestation as a branch of magic is quite interesting.

I would suggest that Fiendfyre should technically qualify if it requires hatred of something to cast.

Then, of course, there's whatever made the dementors - depression incarnate, in my view(lacking all good things, eventually making you just give up and stop.)

That of course leaves things anger, hope, sadness, love, faith, envy and so on.

Anger: Creates some form of animated weapon, with potential other effects, such as a hammer that can be used to break down a wall, a flaming sword, a spear that is wreathed in lightning, and other overt elemental effects. Variations on cold anger could instead include ice or the like.

Hope: Would create something like a patronus, I think. Hard to see what to do with this one. A passive presence slowly warping the world towards what one hopes for?

Sadness: Think water, darkness, and not necessarily cold. Field of magic in which fighting is harder.

Love: Probably something bloody terrifying in actual appearance, if the room in the DoM is anything to go by.

Faith: A manifestation of what one believes in, possibly a counter to Hope, sadness, Fiendfyre and anything the caster does not want to see enforced magically on them. Dunno.

Envy: Eldest born of hell. Giant fuck-off snake/dragon that breathes highly corrosive magic, poisoning everything except the object of your desire. Repeated use of the spell causes severe harm to the user.
