I agree too. He'd be more trusting of authority figures, but wouldn't say he'd lose this trait completely. Rather, his trust in adults would be selective and based on those who have shown he can trust them, so maybe confined to Order members alone.

Also, one of the reasons why the Order was formed was because "the Ministry's efforts were ineffectual", according to the HP Lexicon, so I think that sentiment would carry on in Harry and he'd not trust political authority figures which have proven time and time again to be incompetent in canon.
