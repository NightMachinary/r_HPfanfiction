It was never completely finished as a story. It kind of stops once the main ship of the story gets together. After that the authors just gave how the story would've ended.

As for the story in itself, it's ok. It started off pretty well but after a point, it relied on tactics that leave a reader unhappy in general, merely to keep the readers glued to the story.

It's a basic WBWL plot with more focus on romance.

However the humour that's there through the course of the majority of the story is definitely entertaining, particularly the last few lines of each chapter.
