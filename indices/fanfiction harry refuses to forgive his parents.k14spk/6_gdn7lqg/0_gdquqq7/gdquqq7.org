I would say so, yes, if only because it puts a slightly unusual spin on the tradition WBWL tropes - Harry is also an obtuse arsehole. He had to get his ungodly obliviousness from somewhere, right? Along with a couple other major things that would be plot spoilers if I mentioned them. :)

But yeah, not a spectacularly life-changing fic by any means, but it has some interestingly novel elements I'd recommend reading.
