#+begin_quote
  There is no Boy-Who-Lived; Albus Dumbledore defeated Voldemort and destroyed his Horcruxes. Harry grows up as an ordinary boy---a very ordinary boy, with barely more magic than a Squib. He sets out to prove himself, but in private, because he doesn't want to see the disappointment in everyone's eyes if he fails. And that leads him to a very strange relationship, mediated by stubbornness on both sides, with Severus Snape.
