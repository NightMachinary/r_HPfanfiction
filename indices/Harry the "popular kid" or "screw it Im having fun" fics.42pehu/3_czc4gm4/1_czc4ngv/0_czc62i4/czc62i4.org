Browncoat, Green Eyes has a bit of a change of pace part of the way through, so if you find yourself not really enjoying the story after (I'm phrasing this so it's not a spoiler but you'll know the point I mean) Harry gets his hands on an endless supply of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, it's probably best to give it up there. I didn't finish it myself, and the last few chapters I read I didn't really enjoy since the premise changed a lot.
