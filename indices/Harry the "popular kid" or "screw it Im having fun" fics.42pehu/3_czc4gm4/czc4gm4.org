A lot of stuff by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] is enjoyable. He's not the best technical writer, but he has great ideas.

linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot) is probably his most well known and is the beginning of a series of fics.

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is by the same author of A Black Comedy and quite good as well. Firefly crossover, so be forewarned.

edit: Posted to the wrong place. Still, both are 'screw it i'm having fun' style. Enjoy!
