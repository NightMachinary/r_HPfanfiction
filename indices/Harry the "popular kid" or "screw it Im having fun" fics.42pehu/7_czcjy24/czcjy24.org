I like OOC Harry like this because it gives you more space to play with regarding fanfiction. Canon Harry will always react like canon Harry to whatever threat an author can come up with, which is cool and all, but it can make "new" stories fairly predictable or frustrating. Predictable when you know Harry as a character would ONLY rush into the cave to defeat the monster and save the damsel, frustrating if he's been canon up to that point and then doesn't.

Anyway, you want a "fuck it" Harry? Try linkffn(Where in the world is Harry Potter) and it's sequels. Bordering on crack fic, but fairly great.
