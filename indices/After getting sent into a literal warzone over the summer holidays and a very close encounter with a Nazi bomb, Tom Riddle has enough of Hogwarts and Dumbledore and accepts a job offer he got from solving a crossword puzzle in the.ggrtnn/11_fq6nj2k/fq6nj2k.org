I LOVE IT!

A TMR that is in fact a genius and does not suffer from villain stupidity meeting an actually genius muggle. This could make for a great story, it would have to be from a really good writer though. I have read way too many 40ies AUs that were so historically inaccurate they were basically crack. (I will never forget Hermione and Tom getting Indian takeout and some nice lattes. 1943 in London.)
