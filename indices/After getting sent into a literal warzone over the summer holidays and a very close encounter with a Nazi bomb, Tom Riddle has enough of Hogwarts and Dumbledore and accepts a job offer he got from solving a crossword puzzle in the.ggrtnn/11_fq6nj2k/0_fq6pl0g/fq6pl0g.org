Hello and thank you for calling Jewel of India! Unfortunately our restaurant is currently closed as our shipment of spices is currently on the bottom of the Atlantic after the ship was sunk by a German submarine, our cook is currently busy invading Sicily and our kitchens have yet to be rebuilt after they were hit by a bomb during the Blitz.

We thank you for your patience and are doing our best to reopen soon!
