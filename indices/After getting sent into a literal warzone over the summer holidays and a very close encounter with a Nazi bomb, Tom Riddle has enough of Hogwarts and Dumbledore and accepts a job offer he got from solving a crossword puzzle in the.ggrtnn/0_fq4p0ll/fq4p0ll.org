I LOVE IT AND NEED IT

- As a mathematician, Math! Represented as good!
- Math for ultimate power!
- Non-stupid TMR!
- I would really, really love to see Tom /destroying/ the British government when they try to do to Turing what they did to him IRL - and considering Dumbledore, /he might actually not be entirely opposed to joining in./ In other words, I would read such a thing to pieces just for the epic revenge-fantasy fix-fic for Turing.
