Ikr? Math always being 'snobby' or 'evil' or 'only for geniuses' or some other crap. All that 'no one actually needs math irl' thing that people have going on and not realizing that math literally made modern world possible.*angry angry*

The thing that bothers me, however, is dragging real people in fanfiction. It just really makes my uncomfortable - what if someone somwhere has written something about me? That's quite terrifying.
