While I equally agree mugglewank method are generally lame, I feel like you're delving into a big grey area of Harry Potter. One, is that magic you mentioned even possible in cannon? And secondly is Voldemort really that way because he was a well thought out villain, or is it because that's the way JK made him when it was still a children's novel?

I think it's more ludicrous that JK never had anyone try muggle methods in the book. At least she could have ruled it out then. Desperate people would try anything.
