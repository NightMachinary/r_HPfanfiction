That's why I dislike mugglewanky methods of beating him. He ultimately decided magic had more potential, and his talent lay with it instead of muggle science, but he is very much paranoid enough to have defenses against any muggle weapon he knows.

- Automatic shield charms on his person that activate on gunshots and only stop kinetic energy.

- enchantments that prevent large-scale combustion around his bases.

- alert charms for radioactive material, and specifically developed transfiguration spells to neutralize them.

- Specialized enchantments that make any sort of bomb bounce off the building and surrounding land, perhaps even back towards the plane that dropped it and/or the cannon that fired it

- anti-kinetic charms that rob any physical projectile faster than human movement speed of its energy

etc etc. Beating voldemort with muggle weapons is ludicrous.
