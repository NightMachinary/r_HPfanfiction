My own headcanon is /entirely/ on board with Riddle knowing just how dangerous the muggles could be. It's why he used purebloods for his power-fantasy trip: if he'd gone for a muggleborn revolution to get his megalomaniac jollies there was every chance that they'd go Grindelwald on him and the results would be un-pretty.

There's also the fact that his muggle life consisted of an underfunded orphanage up until his 14th birthday and homelessness after, that being the age you were expected to fend for yourself in those days. Borgin & Burke was his summer job that kept a roof over his head when Hogwarts was closed.
