I was thinking that he'd have spent a lot of time asking Dumbledore and all the other teachers to be allowed to stay at Hogwarts, and after getting refused and getting sent back to Wool's for the holidays only to find it to be a bomb crater and after almost dying from another unexploded bomb it would make him hate the teachers at Hogwarts because they clearly didn't care that the entirety of London was a warzone and not a happy holiday place. Then he'd think of how Dumbledore could probably stop Grindelwald and end everything right now and comes to the conclusion that clearly Dumbledore doesn't care when people die, and consider not returning after his O.W.L.s and studying the dark arts on his own. He'd still need a place to stay so he applies for the mysterious job just to see what it is, and after realizing just how powerful information is in a war he decides to join just to get revenge on the Nazis that almost killed him.
