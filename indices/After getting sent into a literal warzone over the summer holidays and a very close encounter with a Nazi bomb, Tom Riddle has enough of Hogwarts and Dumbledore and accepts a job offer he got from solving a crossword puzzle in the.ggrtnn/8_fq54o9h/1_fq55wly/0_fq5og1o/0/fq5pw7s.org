Dear Professor Dumbledore

You were right, murdering innocent people is stupid. While you spent the last few years doing nothing, the Nazis and Grindelwald's wizards killed millions. I happened to have a good source of information on what was going on on the continent, both muggle and magical, so I was able to keep track.

I also happened to have some very clever people here who helped me with the arithmancy that I needed to develop a new dark curse. I spent the past few months testing it on Grindelwald's soldiers, it works like a charm. Don't worry, they were definitely not innocent.

According to my sources, Grindelwald himself is going to be inspecting a dark ritual site near Vienna on Friday. Meet me at the following coordinates at 10:30 and we can ambush him together.
