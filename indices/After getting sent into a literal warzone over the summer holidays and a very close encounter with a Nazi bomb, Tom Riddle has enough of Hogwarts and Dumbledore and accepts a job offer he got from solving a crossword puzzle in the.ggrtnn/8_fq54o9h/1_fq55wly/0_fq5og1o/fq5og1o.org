Oh, you could do some gorgeous character development with that.

Tom hates the Nazis for very selfish reasons at first: Fucked up his summer, almost killed him. A petty grudge really. Then he joins Bletchley Park and is surrounded with people who have deeper reasons for fighting against them, trying to help end the war. Their families, friend, love for queen and country. Tom scoffs at that at first, but he comes to understand, then emphasize, then adopt some of their motivations.

Then in 42 the allies first get information on the holocaust. Tom, sneaky SOB he is, gets his hands on it. Morbidly fascinated he starts studying nazi ideology, about the master race and the inferior sub-humans, and suddenly makes a startling connection:

That sounds a hell of a lot like his own thoughts about wizards and muggles.

That's unsettling. He rationalizes, of course. He's not going to just... go around and kill muggles. (Did the nazis start out planning to kill everyone they deemed unworthy? asks a little voice in his head.) Hitler's delusions of grandeur have nothing in common with his past plans for immortality. (Or do they?) The way he was collecting... followers in school, the way he enjoyed their groveling and how easy they were to manipulate to do things they would have never done on their own... that's nothing like the power Hitler holds over Germany. (But is it though?)

Finally, painfully, he comes to the realization how close he came to descending into madness and inhumanity. Horcruxes! How low had he sunken to even consider something so disgusting! It's not like he didn't read the warnings about horcruxes mutilating the soul in incomprehensible ways.

He just didn't care.

He's changed forever and swears to cage the animal parts of his personality that almost condemned himself to a half life, more beast than man. Man, not wizard or muggle, truly, who cares about that anyway.

Dumbledore understood, he musses. While Tom was gallivanting down the path to demise, Dumbledore saw it for what it was and tried to stop him. Perhaps he even really cared.

He ought to write him a letter and reassure him he came to his senses in time.
