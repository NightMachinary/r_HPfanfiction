I haven't given it that much thought, I just watched The Imitation Game on Netflix and thought "how can I turn this into a HP fanfiction".

Then I thought of just how crazy it'd be if Dumbledore was about to duel Grindelwald only to find him dead with a note from Tom who spent the last few years listening in on Grindelwald's wizarding wireless communications and occasionally apparating over to try out one of his new dark inventions on a few of his soldiers until he single handedly defeated the entire Grindelwald army, mostly thanks to knowing more about where everyone was than Grindelwald himself.
