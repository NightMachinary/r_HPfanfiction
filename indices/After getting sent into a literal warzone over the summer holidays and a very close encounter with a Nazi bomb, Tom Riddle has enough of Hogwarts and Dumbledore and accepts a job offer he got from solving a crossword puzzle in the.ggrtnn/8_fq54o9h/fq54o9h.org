Wouldn't that make him hate all muggles even more, though? When he sees what they've done across the globe he could just go: "They obviously can't rule themselves and need to be subjugated for their own good."

Voldemort never struck me as very patriotic. He killed lots of British wizards. Why would he suddenly protect the muggles? Hell, he never even cared about his Death Eaters. Helping the war effort would require selflessness and empathy that Voldemort simply lacks.
