Because it's fanfiction. I'm all about Romione in the actual books, but I find it more interesting to read other ships. The exception is if I'm reading a Harry/notGinny as the main pairing, then I actually prefer background Romione. I read a bit of FF back before the books ended and I dabbled in Romione stories but that was to satiate my adolescent heart's need to see them together. Once the books ended and about a decade later I entered that black hole we call AO3.

Yeah, Draco's a massive jerk in the books. But he's written morally grey and a good fanfic author can write a compelling story that thoughtfully redeems him. The books jumps from the battle to the epilogue and there is a lot of space to reimagine his life. Sure, he was a coward. He's not brave and chose to tout pureblood nonsense when he was younger but I still felt sorry for him in book 6. His support network looked a lot different than Harry's. If it's not a dramione/drarry story I still don't like seeing Draco written as an Ultimate Villain for those reasons. Snape got redemption and forgiveness (both by Harry and a large majority of fans) and why must Draco be so different?

The childhood bully history is their hardest obstacle to overcome. But again, there are some great authors that can use canon and still write a powerful story of forgiveness. It's good for Draco to grovel and make amends for his past douchiness. If that part is ignored, then I tend to skip those stories because I find it too OOC for Hermione. There's no way she'd forgive without some conversation.

I'm not really picky about ships, it's more of what I don't like then what I do but what I especially like about Dramione/Drarry is the enemies to friends to lovers tension.

Maybe what makes me a bit of a hypocrite is I find Pansy/Harry stories to be a bit odd. She tried to turn him into Voldemort. Like, not even Draco did that in DH. However, I've still read stories with that pairing because the author wrote a post-war world where that kind of forgiveness was possible. Like I said, it's fanfiction. Personally, I'm not there to read epilogue compliant slice of life stuff.
