It's the weird trope that "opposites attract", which is not true at all, and actually leads to miserable relationships. As always, it's a dumbed down version of "differences complete eachother" - but it has somehow been warped into hatred transforming into love, which surprise surprise, doesn't happen. Of course, hormones are weird like that, and people that age can't differentiate, but in general how you feel about a person is a pretty good indicator of how much you love them.

And she /hates/ him. Much more than either Ron or Harry. They have it fine, they're just scarhead and the blood traitor, but "at least" they're somewhat "pure" - she's a full muggleborn.

I don't read fics which pair the two if there wasn't

A) a real redemption arc

B) a change of character before the books.

I'm just not into completely fucked up relationships or the tired, sexist trope of "fixing him".
