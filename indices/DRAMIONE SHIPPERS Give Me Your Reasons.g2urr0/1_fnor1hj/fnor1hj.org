My original reason was pretty simple. I loved both characters. Hermione was my favourite from the very first book and Draco quickly jumped up following Half-Blood Prince. It felt pretty natural to shove them together and see what happens from there, especially since I've got a major fondness for enemies-to-friends-to-??? pairings. Forgiveness, empathy, and surprising connections are major draws for most ships I enjoy.

For the characters specifically, I like pairings with a fiercely competent (yet flawed) woman and the guy who will never be good enough for her but is trying to be something better. I like that both characters have important relationships (Hermione & the Trio, Draco and his parents) which motivate them and which they'd struggle to deal with if they were to form any type of relationship. I like that Hermione cannot be easily slotted into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl or Gentle Girl type tropes which are common with this type of ship. I like that Draco is similarly a far cry from the typical Bad Boy male character since he's... Well, pretty pathetic honestly.

Also, while Cursed Child may be largely a mess, the line /I'm being bossed around by Hermione Granger and I'm mildly enjoying it/ is great and I'd be lying if I said it didn't reinvigorate my interest in the pairing.
