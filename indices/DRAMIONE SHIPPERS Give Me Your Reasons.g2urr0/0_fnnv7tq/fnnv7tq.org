Well I wasn't always a dramoine shipper but I started reading some stories with them as a pairing. An excellent writer I followed had written them as a pairing and I thought I'd give it a go to see what the fuss was about. 1. Intelligence was one aspect of the relationship that shippers enjoy. I can't remember the books very well I'm an old lady now but I think Draco was quite academic before the whole Voldy tasks started happening so some people have them bond through academics. 2. Overcoming stereotypes and vulnerability - Hermione and Draco have this stereotypes that divide them. Draco is higher being, aristocratic, anti-feminist, anti-muggleborn stereotype and Hermione is lower (mudblood) being, working class, pro feminist, access for all magical ability kinda stereotype. They are more than their stereotypes, they are characters who experience pain, fear and vulnerability and some stories have them bound through shared human experience and overcoming their stereotypes. 3. Sexual chemistry - they both cute as hell. I think in real life the actors are very good friends and Emma Watson had a crush on Tom Felton at some stage so that may influence readers. 4. Opposites attract 5. Conflict - It's like a Romeo Juliet fantasy where the two can't really be together because there are too many variables. So anyone who loves tragedy or angst would love this pairing. Draco couldn't hang out with the trio without drama and Hermione couldn't visit Malfoy Manor without angst. 6. Character building - Draco is a product of his environment and we don't really begin to see him as than a one dimensional character (in the movies) until he can't bring himself to kill Dumbledore. We only get Harry's perspective of Draco in the books and movies but it is plausible that Draco is as misunderstood as Harry and with the amount of Hermione/Harry fiction you could easily swap Harry out for Draco for this reason. I remember reading somewhere that Hermione is so popular to write pairings for because she is a well rounded and relatable character who is easy to pair with others because she is adaptable.
