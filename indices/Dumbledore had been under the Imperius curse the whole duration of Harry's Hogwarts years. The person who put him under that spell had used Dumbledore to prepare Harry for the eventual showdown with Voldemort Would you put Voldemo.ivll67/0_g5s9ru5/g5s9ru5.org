As long as most other things we know from canon stand I'd think Voldemort is still a baddie. The person controlling Dumbledore is /also/ a baddie, but in a way I think it is more interesting to have two bad guys on conflicting sides (one with an unknown agrnda which may go welk beyond "fight against Voldemort in ruthless wssys" and one we know the agenda of), than the alternative.
