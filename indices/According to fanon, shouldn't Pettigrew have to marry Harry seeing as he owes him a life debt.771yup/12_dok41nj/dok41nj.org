Correct that's something I've noticed as well. Another character that owes Harry a life debt is Ron Weasley (book 6). Of course Harry owes Ron a life debt as well after being rescued from the frozen lake in book 7.

Not sure how life debts work in that regard. Do Harry and Ron now have a soulbond^{^{2}} ?
