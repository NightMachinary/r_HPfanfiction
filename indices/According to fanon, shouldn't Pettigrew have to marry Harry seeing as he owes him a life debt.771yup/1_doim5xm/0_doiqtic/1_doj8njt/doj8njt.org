Ahh, the possibilities. Someone should write a fic where Snape wishes Harry was his son, and he goes back in time where James rescues him from the Lupin, they are forced to marry because of the life debt. Then there could be an awkward sex scene because the magic is forcing them to, and then 9 months later, Harry is born.
