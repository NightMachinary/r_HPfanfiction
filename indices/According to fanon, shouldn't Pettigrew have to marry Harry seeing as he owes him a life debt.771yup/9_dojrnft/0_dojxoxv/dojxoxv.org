  Also, I'm not really sure Peter did owe Harry a life debt. JK said the hand killed him for hesitating, not because of some magic to do with life debts.

I personally believe life debts are just a wizarding tradition as opposed to a magical phenomemon, but either way, the idea in this scene is that the life debt /caused Pettigrew to hestitate in the first place/.
