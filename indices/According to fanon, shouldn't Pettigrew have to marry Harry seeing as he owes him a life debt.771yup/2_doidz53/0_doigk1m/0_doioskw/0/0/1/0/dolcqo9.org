I'm female, and I don't find Alan Rickman attractive. At all. Ralph Fiennes isn't bad, but decidedly less attractive as Voldemort. (Personally, I like people to have proper noses, y'know?)

But as someone that doesn't mind Snape-ships, I'll say it's not about looks. He's an intelligent and intriguing character who's interesting to read about, whether alone or interacting with other people. Even grouchy gits like him have relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and when you're writing that it's an appealing challenge to keep him IC while handling those relationships. When you write about him wanting a relationship, you can dedicate an entire story arc to his understanding the give-and-take of any relationship and having to adjust himself to that, that he may have to learn to temper his words, be a bit nicer even if he has to work at it---or have him decide that he just doesn't want to work that hard at relationships (or a specific relationship) and having to accept that he'll never have a close relationship for the rest of his life and whether that's okay with him.
