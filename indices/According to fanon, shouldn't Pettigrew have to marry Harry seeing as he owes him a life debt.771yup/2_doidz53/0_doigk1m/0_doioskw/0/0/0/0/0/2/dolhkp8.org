Bringing up the law isn't an argument proving they can't ever redeem themselves. Provided wizards even follow Muggle laws on that one, all this proves is that if caught, the Death Eaters /would/ have to be sentenced to death if one threw the book at them. This is not at all evidence that one /should/. I for one am opposed to the death penalty in general regardless of the convict's "redeemability", but again, none of this has to do with whethe or not the Death Eaters were "beyond redemption", which was the point you originally brought up that I was disagreeing with.
