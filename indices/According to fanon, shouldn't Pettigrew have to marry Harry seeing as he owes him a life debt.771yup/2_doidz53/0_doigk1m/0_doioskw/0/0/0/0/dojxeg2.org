That's an... uncharitable way to look at it. There's a middle ground, methinks, between "Draco in Leather Pants" territory and "Kill them all, none of them have any chance of ever redeeming themselves!", especially with the examples of Snape and Regulus to specifically prove that turncoat Death Eaters who realized Voldemort was going too far were /totally a a thing/.

/However/, all this is entirely besides the point because I honestly don't think Pettigrew was your average Death Eater. It's sufficienly vague that you /could/ characterize him as pure evil, but I find it more interesting to think that he was a genuinely nice person and a good friend to the other Marauders... jus weak and cowardly in the face of danger. Voldemort had barely threatened him and immediately he turned, hating himself all the while but never finding the strength to resist. He betrayed the location of James and Lily because of his pathetic cowardice, and after that was forced by this same, almost clinical /terror/ to keep obeying Voldemort.

Bottom line is: I don't /think/ it's quite fair to say that Death Eaters like Malfoy or Rosier are beyond redemption, but even if /they/ are the same doesn't have to apply to Pettigrew.
