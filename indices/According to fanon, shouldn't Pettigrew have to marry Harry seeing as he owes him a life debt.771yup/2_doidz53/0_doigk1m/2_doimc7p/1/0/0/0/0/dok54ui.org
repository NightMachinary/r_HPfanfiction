Who says anything about the Aurors? I was thinking about a year five or six scenario where Ron and Hermione are murdered and the ministry does nothing.

Harry has an almost perfect invisibly cloak and knifes are easy enough to get. Slicing somebody's throat while they sleep os not that difficult, especially if you have nothing to lose. Or just sic Dobby at the Death Eaters.
