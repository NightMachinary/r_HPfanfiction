Yeah, I don't get this either. Harry saves Ginny and Gabrielle and Draco just because he is a good dude. No life debt. He asks Remus and Sirius not to kill Peter: life debt.

Snape saves Harry's life at the quidditch march, no life debt. James stops Sirius from murdering Snape. Life debt!

Looking at this, the way to life debts is to stop Sirius from murdering someone.
