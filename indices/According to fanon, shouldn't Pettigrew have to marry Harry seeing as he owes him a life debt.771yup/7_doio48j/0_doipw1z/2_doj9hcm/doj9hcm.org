Since Peter apparently was forced to pay it back, it is likely a magical thing. But in my opinion, it's just another plot hole since as you point out, in numerous cases, lives were saved and no debts created.

I usually assume in my stories, if I use the trope, that a life debt is only created when someone risks their own life to save someone who would have died otherwise. (Throwing yourself in front of someone to catch a shot while you or the other are bullet-proof, for example, wouldn't create a debt.)
