I don't get the concept of life debts. If it just requires one person saving the life of another, there are a bunch of examples that did not turn into life debts, like Harry saving Ginny, Gabrielle Delacour or Draco Malfoy. Does it even involve actual magic or is it just someone feeling indebted and wanting to repay the favour?
