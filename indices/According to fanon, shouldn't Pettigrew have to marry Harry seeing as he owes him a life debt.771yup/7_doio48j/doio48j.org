I have to wonder why Peter would owe Harry a life debt in the first place; Harry pretty explicitly says he intends to hand Peter over to the Dementors, which probably means life imprisonment or a Kiss for Peter, both fates worse than death, and that he's only sparing Peter at all because he doesn't want Remus and Sirius to become murderers.

I mean, by that logic, if that earned Harry a life debt from Peter, then the Death Eaters should have tons of life debts from their victims, every time they decided to keep one to torture later instead of killing then and there.

Voldemort: "Good news! I've decided that instead of killing you right now, I'm going to drag you back to my base and give you to Bellatrix so she can torture you into insanity for my amusement. Also, because I'm technically sparing your life at the moment, you owe me a life debt, isn't that fun?"

Maybe it'd make sense if it's less a thing of 'saving someone's life' and more 'granting someone's wish'. A wish debt. Peter dearly wished to not-be-murdered at Remus and Sirius's hands, and Harry (technically) granted that wish, so that created a reciprocal debt (a get-out-of-being-murdered-free card) that Harry called upon way later in Deathly Hallows.

Or maybe it's a magically-enforced slavery thing; by having complete control over Peter's life in that moment, Harry's magic created a master-slave bond between him and Peter. But the problem is that by /that/ logic, Voldemort should have a so-called life debt over Harry because of the graveyard scene in Goblet of Fire (though see above, he'd probably have one anyway).

...Eww. Does that mean that because Voldemort spared Harry in the graveyard and gave him a chance to duel, wand and everything, rather than killing him outright, he has a life debt which means Harry has to marry him?
