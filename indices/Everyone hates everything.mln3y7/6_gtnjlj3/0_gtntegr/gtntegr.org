Poor grammer is the only true non-trope thing that turns me away from a fic.

Trope wise, there are only a couple of tropes I will not read. I won't read any harry/male pairing. /NOT/, and I can't stress this enough, /NOT/ because I don't like gays, but because the pairing just doesn't do anything for me. I'm a straight male, so I just can't wrap my head around such a pairing, it provides nothing for me.

The other trope I refuse to read I'm not even going to name because I will get flamed into oblivion because of currant bullshit culture.
