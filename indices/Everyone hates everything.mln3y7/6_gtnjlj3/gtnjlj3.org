I've read a lot of trashy fics and I predict that I'll read many more in my future, but the one thing that'll annoy me enough to quit a fic is creatively awful punctuation. I can't help it - it gets distracting and I can't unsee it!

Dialogue punctuation has like three basic fucking rules, and the number of people who can't do it is /astounding./ To the point where, if an author manages to use a comma inside the double quotation mark (or outside if using British style single quotes) and then not stick a capital on 'said' I'm legit impressed. And that's just fucking sad.

That being said: gimme all the tropes. I like almost all of them.
