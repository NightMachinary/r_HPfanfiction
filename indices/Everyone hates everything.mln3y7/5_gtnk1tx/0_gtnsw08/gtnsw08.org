I don't get the hate for americanism. Like come on, for one, it's the 1990s, air travel exists, americans visit brittain, Brittains visit america, there is GOING to be cultural bleed over. I think dropping a fic for using some american terms or phrases is downright pathetic and they should prob stay away from fanfiction unless they think that /only/ british writers should be able to write HPFF.
