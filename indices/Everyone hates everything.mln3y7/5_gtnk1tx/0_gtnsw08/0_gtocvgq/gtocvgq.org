I think I remember reading a review once where someone was saying that the author using the imperial system was an Americanism and it just made me crack up. I mean sure, the metric system was invented in 1791, but quick research shows it wasn't made compulsory in France in 1837, and probably much later in Britain. So it doesn't really make sense for a culture that is 200 years behind the Muggle one and doesn't abide by their rules anyways to use the metric system, on top of all of the cultural bleed over that you listed.
