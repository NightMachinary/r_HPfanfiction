Chocolate Chip Cookies are 100% a thing here - Maryland Cookies anyone? As is 'my bad' - these were undoubtedly imported in from the US linguistically, but they're here. 'Biscuits' and 'my mistake' are more common forms, but they're still valid.

Not to say that there aren't americanisms that haven't made the cultural leap yet - we still say 'boot' instead of 'trunk' and 'bonnet' instead of 'hood' for cars, we say 'rubbish' in lieu of 'trash' or 'garbage,' etc. But cookies are here baybee.
