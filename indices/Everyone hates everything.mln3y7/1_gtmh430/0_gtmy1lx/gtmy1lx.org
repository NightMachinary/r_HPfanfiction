I do know that sometimes you don't even realize that the British will use a different word. Like all the basics (jumpers, trainers, biscuits, etc) I know, but sometimes somebody comments that "British people actually call it this" and I'm like woah, that's a new one. Sometimes I change it, sometimes they are just changed for ghe future chapters. But Google is a mess trying to find all the differences between the two.
