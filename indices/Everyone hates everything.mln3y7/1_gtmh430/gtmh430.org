I don't hate on much. Terrible spelling and grammar is my biggest issue and if I see “cuz” instead of “because” I'm not going to read it.

When it comes to Americanisms I assume they are young and/or lazy writers who haven't bothered to google something. If it's too much and is throwing off the story I just stop reading. But if Harry is head cheerleader and Ron is on the Hogwarts (American) Football team it better be labeled AU. (I haven't seen anything this outrageous, but you get my meaning.)
