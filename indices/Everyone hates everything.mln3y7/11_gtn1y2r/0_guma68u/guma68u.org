I mean the Mum and Mom thing isn't even a big deal, the Brummies (people who live in the Midlands) tend to use Mom, so both forms of the word definitely exist here in the UK.

I'm generally fine with americanisms in stories as I know there is no way they would know all the authentic British ways of life unless they lived here. The only time I've quit a fic because of it was when they celebrated Thanksgiving! (the fic wasn't particularly great before that anyway haha)
