I will disagree as what you describe I think refers to as 'character criticism' rather than outright bashing.

In my experience, and opinion, there are 3 elements to bashing:\\
1: The character has NO redeeming qualities within the fic. They essentially exist only to be a fool, a flaw, and a mistake within the fic. They can LITERALLY do no right and will never do anything right.\\
2: the universe itself seems to hate the bashed character (Aka the author clearly hates the character and is just using the fanfic to partly 'punish' said character for some hate-boner)\\
3: The bashed character is WAAY too much in focus compared to what they should be, as they pose literally no threat to the main protagonist and the lead of the story. They are not a threat, they are not a danger, they are not an antagonist. They are a comedic entity that is treated as a serious enemy.

In short: The bashed character has no good qualities, the author clearly hates the character and they serve no function to the story beyond 'HA! LOOK AT HOW BAD CHARACTER IS! LAUGH NOW PLEASE!'\\
And therefore the bashed character should be removed from the story. It has no purpose and serves no real function for the story or plot.

The ONLY time a bashed character works are in a crack-fic or comedic take. You literally can't make a serious story and have a bash character be in there and have it fit well.
