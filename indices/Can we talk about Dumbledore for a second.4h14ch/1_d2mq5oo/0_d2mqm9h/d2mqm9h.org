That interpretation, that he is more afraid of doing harm than failing to do good, makes him deeply flawed though. A total failure as a Headmaster and politician. When faced with Death Eaters, especially the second time around, there is no excuse, none at all, not to act. Decisively, and lethally. At the end of book 5, all other options have been tried in the past, and shown to not work. The imprisoned DEs have been freed, the ones citing Imperius revealed to have lied, and the murders have started. At that point, killing the Death Eaters would have been the only moral option, whether by pressuring Fudge to have them executed, or by doing it himself in the Battle fo the Ministry.
