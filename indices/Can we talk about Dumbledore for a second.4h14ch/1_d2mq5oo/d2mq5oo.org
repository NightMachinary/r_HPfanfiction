I'd add item D) Dumbledore does not trust himself with executive power or with power over life and death of others, which unfortunately leads him to sometimes treat his enemies better than his friends.

In other words, he is not a perfectly rational, utility-maximizing actor. He is a wise old man with more magical skill than he knows what to do with, and baggage from his attempt to take over the world with Grindelwald, the death of his sister, and his subsequently having to fight and imprison his former best friend (and possibly the love of his life). He is happy to /guide/ others as the Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock, and the Supreme Mugwump, but he does not want to /rule/ them as the Minister. He is also keenly aware that actions have consequences --- especially where magic is involved --- and is more afraid of doing harm than he is of failing to do good.
