I don't care for bashing fics, not because they present Dumbledore as a maliciously manipulative mastermind. No, that isn't the problem. It's because the majority of them do it so /poorly/.

Most of these fics tend to take place when Dumbledore is the headmaster of *the* school in magical Britain; the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW; and the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. The second position is in the magical version of the UN, while the third one possibly oversees different trials or functions of the Wizengamot, wizarding Britain's court of law. The first allows him to shape generations of witches and wizards. Dumbledore was also a former friend to Grindelwald, not to mention the man who single-handedly bested him. (Here, you may imagine Churchill delivering a KO punch to Hitler.) He's also the only person whom Voldemort fears.

With all that considered, if Dumbledore were truly malign, if he were truly pulling strings from the shadow of the throne, if he is as bad as you could possibly make him out to be, then there's little chance that he would allow a smug, high-minded lordling to ruin his plans. The typical indy!Harry spoilt turd would be Obliviated and sent on his merry way within seconds of confronting Dumbledore with all the facts of his machinations.

But with a man as brilliant and experienced as Dumbledore, I doubt he'd ever allow Harry to get that close. He'd probably mindwipe the kid the second little Lord Potter started questioning his depleted coffers.

Anyway, being manipulative is hardly indicative of an "evil" nature. It's a tool. In this series, it is a tactic in a war being fought by an enemy cloaked in shadows. And like all wars, there are losses. Dumbledore left out the full truth in order to better lead a young wizard to his prophesied sacrifice. That's bad, but what choice was there? A prolonged war to save one boy? One boy against how many others?

Sacrifices are ugly but they are a fact of life. Someone had to be a leader. Someone /was/ a leader and it wasn't Fudge. And leaders have to do terrible things sometimes. One might even say great but terrible things.
