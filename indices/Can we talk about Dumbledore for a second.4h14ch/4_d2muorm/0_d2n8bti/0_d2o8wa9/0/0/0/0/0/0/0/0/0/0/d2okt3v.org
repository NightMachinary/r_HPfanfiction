  I think you do not understand just how corrupt and rotten Wizarding Britain is. The law doesn't work there. Summary executions
#+end_quote

Where?

#+begin_quote
  kill on sight orders
#+end_quote

Such as?

#+begin_quote
  torture of prisoners
#+end_quote

And?

#+begin_quote
  and corruption on a level that makes third world dictators green with envy.

Please don't make assertions about the developing world if you've never lived in it

  Dumbledore couldn't even get Sirius a trial - one of the most basic rights anyone had.
#+end_quote

And what gives you the indication that he wanted to? Not to mention that we see the Ministry involved in a whole slew of trials (from Karkaroff to Crouch Jr. to implied Snape's), but yeah let's ignore those. Rather hypocritical of you, given that you're arguing for him to execute people without trial.

  In such a fucked up country, Dumbledore should have taken the law into his own hands, since that would have made things far, far better.

I'll repeat that you're entitled to your justice boner, just not to sheathing it in "moral" crap. Taking the law into your own hands, especially where homicide is involved, is far from a moral or ethical high ground. It's why society tends to frown on vigilante justice, you know.
