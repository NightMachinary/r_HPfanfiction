Summary execution: Barty Crouch Jr. Kill on Sight: Sirius Black - they sent the Dementors out.

If you don't know how corrupt dictators in the third world are, then you obviously haven't read any newspaper in the last 40 years. Not surprisingly, since you seem unable to understand that the law can be so wrong that armed resistance or vigilante justice is the only moral option, despite dozens of examples in history proving that.

And are you honestly arguing that Dumbledore didn't want Sirius to have a trial?
