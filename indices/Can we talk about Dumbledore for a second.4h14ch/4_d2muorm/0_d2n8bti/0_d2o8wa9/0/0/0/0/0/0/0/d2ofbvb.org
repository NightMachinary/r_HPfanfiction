Are you honestly saying that it's immoral to take action if the law is not protecting the innocents? Are you honestly saying that taking up arms against Death Squadrons protected by the government would be wrong? If upholding the law is a crime, then breaking it is the right thing to do.

There is no list of people killed by the order in the first war because we don't know anything about the first war.
