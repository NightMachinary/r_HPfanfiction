And you can't see how "no-one can punish me if I do this thing" is terribly immoral justification for your actions? Now this is just bizarre.

Dislike Dumbledore for not taking more lethal action all you want, but don't try to couch it in some half-baked moral argument. I don't get why fans are so averse to admitting that they just /want/ a thing instead of building justifications for it.

Also I'm still waiting for that list of people the Order killed in the first war.
