You do realise that the Order did far, far more than "apprehending criminals"?

Dumbledore has the skill and power to battle Voldemort to a standstill. That makes him pretty much top dog in Britain. Not using his power to save innocents is a sign of utter moral failure. And if the law of a corrupt system protects the criminals and will lead to dead kids, then the law can go to hell.
