  Are you honestly saying that it's immoral to take action if the law is not protecting the innocents? Are you honestly saying that taking up arms against Death Squadrons protected by the government would be wrong? If upholding the law is a crime, then breaking it is the right thing to do.

And I repeat, I'm sure you're doing the moral thing and executing criminals in your hometown because the law doesn't catch them all. Oh wait, you don't because the law exists for a reason, and while you have leeway to capture and/or stop criminals and hand them over to law enforcement you have exactly zero right to summarily execute them. But sure, keep pretending that killing people is the only way to "take action" against them.

Since you don't seem to get it, /it's not Dumbledore's place to be judge, jury and executioner/. You want him to be. And that's fine, but stop making it out to be some sort of higher moral calling.

  There is no list of people killed by the order in the first war because we don't know anything about the first war.

And that's why you didn't imply that the Order had killed Death Eaters in the first war...oh wait

As mentioned, outside situations of extreme self defense (see Battle of Hogwarts for instance) the Order's leeway only extended to obstruction and apprehension of Death Eaters. Because, I repeat, it's not their place to be judge, jury and executioner. They're not Aurors, and even Aurors aim to bring people to trial, not [figuratively] gun them down in the streets.

It's not a superhero franchise.
