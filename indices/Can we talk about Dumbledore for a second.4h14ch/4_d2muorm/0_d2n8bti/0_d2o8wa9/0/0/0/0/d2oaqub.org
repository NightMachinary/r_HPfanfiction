Do you have a list of people actually /killed/ by Order members in the first war (who were not also Aurors, for instance Moody)?

This is not a superhero franchise, where whoever can don a cape and a mask and leap out to fight crime or some shit. In the real world even people with stupid amounts of resources still answer to the law. Killing Voldemort is one thing given his status (much like killing Osama bin Laden, or Kim Jong Un) and debatable humanity, but Dumbledore absolutely does not have the right or jurisdiction to go after any of the Death Eaters with intent to kill. It's frankly illogical to see law and order as "corruption in the system", while righteously proposing vigilante chaos.

But I'm sure you regularly patrol the neighborhood gunning down criminals, because something something morals something something fuck the law. Yeesh.
