I think you do not understand just how corrupt and rotten Wizarding Britain is. The law doesn't work there. Summary executions, kill on sight orders, torture of prisoners, and corruption on a level that makes third world dictators green with envy. Dumbledore couldn't even get Sirius a trial - one of the most basic rights anyone had.

In such a fucked up country, Dumbledore should have taken the law into his own hands, since that would have made things far, far better.
