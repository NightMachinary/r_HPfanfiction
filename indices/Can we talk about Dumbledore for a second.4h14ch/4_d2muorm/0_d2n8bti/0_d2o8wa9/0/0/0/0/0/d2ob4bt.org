This is Wizarding Britain, not the real world. Dumbledore hasn't the right to go after Death Eaters, but if he chooses so, there's nothing the Ministry can do to really stop him, unless he's making very stupid mistakes.

In the HP world, individuals have far more power than you seem to realise. Voldemort was feared by the wizards because he was personally so dangerous. Grindelwald was defeated in a duel, and the war was over.

If the Aurors were actually capable of handling Dumbledore, Voldemort wouldn't be feared either.
