I don't think Dumbledore had an ego in the sense that he thought himself better than everyone, because I don't think he felt prideful enough for an ego. I think he recognized that he was intelligent and influential, but those weren't things he valued in a human being. I don't think it would be called spiritual in the Wizarding World, but it's a decent enough word to explain what I mean, so I think Dumbledore is spiritual and cares for people's souls, and intelligence doesn't really matter for the soul, but love and acceptance of death do matter. "It is our choices, that make us who we truly are, far more than our abilities".

I also think Dumbledore underestimated Harry, he was a fool and tricked himself into thinking Harry was too young, too innocent, and yet Harry /had/ proved himself. But that doesn't make it any easier to bring a young child into a dark world. The touble is, the Dark World keeps finding the child anyway, and there's nothing Dumbledore can do.
