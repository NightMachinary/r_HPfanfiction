i think it was because dumbledore underestimated harry, much in the same way he kept things from him. I don't think Dumbledore initially viewed Harry as a person despite all the ways he proved himself, which is probably because of how powerful dumbledore himself was. i think he had as much of an ego as Voldemort except he wasnt overt about it. Dumbledore had no colleagues / equals rather people that followed him and believed in him (no one knew his plans fully). i dont think dumbledore just manipulated Harry, i think he manipulated everyone
