  i think that random violence and death is more traumatic than death with a reason; knowing why Voldemort did it is important for Harry imo

I would agree, and I believe that Dumbledore had fooled himself into thinking he was doing right by Harry, just as he had fooled himself he was doing right by Grindelwald, because he loved Grindelwald and because he loved Harry. He swore after Grindelwald he would be more careful, be more in control of his emotions, and yet fell into the same trap. It was not intentional on his part. He admits his own mistakes at the end of OotP not because he was "caught", but because he's finally realized they even /were/ mistakes.

  which also could have been made easier if dumbledore put more effort into actually preparing him instead of making him just blindly trust him.

Can you explain this mindset? I don't understand why Manipulative Dumbledore /didn't/ train Harry more explicitly, given Harry trusted him blindly. Why all the secrecy? Why did Dumbledore go out of his way to be manipulative when, clearly, outright training would have done the job and so much better. It seems so illogical, and yet is the base on the entire Manipulative Dumbledore viewpoint.
