idk, i think given that Dumbledore was the one who dealt with baby Harry he has higher expectation for checking up on him. i think you make very valid points but Dumbledore was such a brilliant and powerful wizard that i find it hard to believe that he can make such mistakes and that all his actions are pure. especially given his history with grindelwald
