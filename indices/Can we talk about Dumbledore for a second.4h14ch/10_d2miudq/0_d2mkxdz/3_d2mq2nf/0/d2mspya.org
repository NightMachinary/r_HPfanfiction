(1) Dumbledore is the headmaster of a school. That is what he is before all other things. I think we tend to forget that a lot. He is not child protective services or whatever magical equivalent exists. If I go with your argumet from point (6) than he /did/ check on Harry through Ms Figg. He cannot be blamed for neglecting him because even if he had just dropped Harry of there, that would have been all we could resonably expect from a school teacher, or even the leader of a rebelion that no longer existed (though I have no idea when the Order disbanded it must have been around that time). Also, the whole thing with the Dursleys calling him "freak" is fanon. Never happens in canon. I checked. Petunia calls her sister a freak, once in front of Harry and a few times in Snapes memories and Dudley calls Hogwarts Harry's "freak school" twice thoughout the series but the word is never actually adressed at Harry.

(2) Harry knows that there was /a/ reason why Voldemort targeted him and his family, Dumbledore tells him as much at the end of 1st year. He knows it wasn't random. Dumbledore just refuses to tell him exactly why, which I suppose was because JKR wanted something to make sure the sequel sells and also because, again, Harry was 11 and Voldemort wasn't back yet so it wasn't an active issue. Adults lie to children all the time, for their own protection and this is one of those cases. As I said before Harry should have been told at the beginning of 5th year, but not earlier. And yes of course, everything we know about all of the HP universe is filterd through Harry's eyes but with that argument we cannot trust anything anymore because Snape could have been less cruel, Hermione less smart and Molly less motherly, ect. Just because it's Harry's perception that shows us Dumbledore in a positive light doesn't mean it's not true.

(4) It's important to remember that Sirius wasn't actually imprisoned in that house. He could (and did) leave it at any time. He'd been on the run for two years befor that. He knew how not to get caught if he really wanted to get away, he would have. He stayed there, even though he hated it, because he wanted to be involved in what the Order did and because he wanted to be close to where Harry was. I'm sure if he had requested it, Dumbledore could have found a suitable overseas mission for him but the wizarding world is a very small one. It's reasonable to assume that Sirius Black was infamous enough that he would not have been save in any wizarding place in Europe and the war with Voldemort never branched that far (though we're going into the realm of my assumptions here). The situation with Sirius wasn't handled very well but putting that only on Dumbledore is a bit much. He had his hands full trying to keep the ministry out of Hogwarts and stopping Voldemort wherever he could.

(5) Dumbledore (in my eyes) is an idealist. He wanted for Snape to be redeemed (same as, lets face it, most of the fandom does since his history was revealed) and he wanted that redemption to involve Harry, Lily's son. Also Snape is a potions master and since the position just opened after Slughorn left it would have made sense to offer Snape a teaching post. He also needed to be close to Dumbledore to keep up his spy status for Voldemort. Voldemort had to believe Snape was still spying for him and what better position for that than in Hogwarts, where Dumbledore lives? I still agree that Snape is an utter git and that he should have been reigned in by Dumbledore more. His treatment of Harry was explainable, if cruel but his treatment of Neville was just plain horrible. Still, he knows his potions and I assume that is why Dumbledore let him stay (since there are apparently very few people capable of teaching potions. Dumbledore gets Slughorn from retirement rather than find a new teacher.)

(6) I don't trust the HP wikia anymore since I tried to figure out the respective time tables for Harry and co using it but let's assume that's true for the arguments sake. So Dumbledore knew that Harry didn't enjoy his life at the Dursleys as much as one would hope. Well we knew as much from book 6. He actually says as much. He knew Harry was unhappy but he judged Harry's happyness against his life and decided the blood protections were what was needed to keep him save. It was the wrong decicion, probably. Maybe. I'm not even sure if it was, seeing as the blood protection was what saved Harry from Quirrel at the end of book 1. We will probably never know because the blood protection and what it does exactly and what it depends on were never explained in detail.
