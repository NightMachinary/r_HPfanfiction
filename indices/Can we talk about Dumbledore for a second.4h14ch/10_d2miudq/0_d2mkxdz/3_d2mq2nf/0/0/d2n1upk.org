No no no, you're doing it wrong, you're reading the book and looking for references! You're not supposed to do that.

Just kidding.

I know, though, Dumbledore had a lot on his plate, and his plate was the size of fricken Texas. Yet me expect perfection at every turn.

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the care and thoughtfulness you're putting into your comments, so thank you so much for that.

Having said that, I see things just slightly differently, so why not share, I guess. :)

(1) Mostly agree on this point, but merely adding that he knows very little of Harry's future /except/ for knowing or guessing very accurately about what Harry's scar means - that's Harry will have to die before Voldemort. I know a lot of people read this and think Dumbledore, like, shrugged, or something (who cares, it's just the life of a child!), I think Dumbledore emotionally distanced himself from Harry so that he could make a logical choice, not an emotional one.

(also just realized, somewhere else in this thread, someone said Dumbledore should have compromised Draco despite the threat on his life, to prevent accidental victims. Fair point, but how does that fit in with Manipulative Dumbledore compromising Harry to save the world? What is different between Harry and Draco? Why is Manipulative Dumbledore blamed for not sacrificing Draco, but for sacrificing Harry?)

Anyway, I think Dumbledore intended to stay emotionally distant from Harry, thus putting himself in a position where he didn't pay close enough attention. I don't remove all the blame from him, but I also don't think he's literally omniscient.

  which I suppose was because JKR wanted something to make sure the sequel sells and also because, again, Harry was 11 and Voldemort wasn't back yet so it wasn't an active issue.

Dumbledore explains this himself. Of course all books are done so they can be entertaining, but also, his answer to Harry is the first instance of his main character arc,

#+begin_quote
  "I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young.‚Äù

He was falling into his trap, he grew to care about Harry, and it affected his judgement. He began making mistakes, and one of those mistakes was not recognizing that although Harry was young, he was capable of handling the news much sooner than 15. Dumbledore's flaw, in my mind, was not in manipulating a young child to do whatever, but in attempting to protect him at all costs while knowing, deep down, that he can't, and that he shouldn't, that doing so would not only inevitably fail, but would result in thousands of deaths.

(5) I don't think Dumbledore is an idealist. I very much think he was a realist. But magic exists in his world, and things like love sacrifices exist, and things like sould breaking when you make Horcruxes, so in his world, being a realist might look very much like an idealist in our world, where there is no magic. In his world, being a good, enlightened person is magically tangible, because choices effect magic, and out ideas effect choices.

As for Snape, Dumbledore can't have known everything, but he also clearly didn't think he was a saint either. I think he just knew there were more important things going on in the world than, my gosh, a mean teacher. It's telling, too, how often Dumbledore defends Harry in front of Snape, but Snape refuses to change his view. Should Dumbledore fire him? Sure, but then we're back at wondering why Draco's life is okay to risk and not the thousands that would be killed if Snape were no longer in the position of spy.

(6) the HP wikia is, I'm convinced, a giant troll. Can we get Quirrell in here to knock it out for us? Or someone got a club around? I hate that thing so much.
