Dumbledore is the head of the ICW and the Wizengamot, is on the Judiciary, rules the most prominent school in magical Britain, has the Minister of Magic calling him up for advice, defeated Wizard Hitler Number 1, was the only man Wizard Hitler Number 2 feared...and he gets removed by a fat ostrich. He's literally holding on to his Headmastership, which shows that he's all kinds of garbage at actually using any kind of power for good or ill. I'll repeat it again, the most powerful, influential and politically powerful wizard in Europe has his jobs stripped from him in less than two months by Cornelius bloody Fudge.

It's nice and all that you think he can't convince the world or something, but in canon Voldemort returned and conquered magical Britain in less than two years. The groundwork was already put in place, with his minions holding official jobs - Lucius is simply the most obvious - which shows that Dumbledore did nothing to actually prevent it.

As for Malfoy, three strikes - Ron, Katie, Rosmerta. Then came the Death Eaters, but everyone was holding the Idiot Ball in that book. Hermione thinks that the the poster boy for Voldemort Youth isn't working for Voldemort, Harry not pointing out that Draco was about to attack with an Unforgivable or offering a memory, Dumbledore and his trips down memory lane that ultimately did little other than serve as exposition for Voldemort's backstory, etc.

As for the racism, the problem is that this is the same attitude that gave Voldemort his army. Less than thirteen years after Voldemort went poof, and Malfoy can swagger around and hurl slurs and death threats. This is less nigger/oreo/chink/uncle Tom/raghead and more children of Nazis and ex-Nazis hurling racist epithets at Jews while gloating about the Fuhrer's return while the authorities do nothing. Slytherin House is still reviled and its members seem to revel in it. Not a single Slytherin calls out Malfoy on his slurs, every single one of the teen Snakes are comfortable enough with the entire racist terminology.
