  Remind me where Draco is reprimanded for his use of racist slurs?
#+end_quote

Remind me where he had the guts to bully in front of a teacher.

With your logic, racism shouldn't exist in the real world, because teachers would have just /stopped/ it. And if you'r referring to Draco shouting, "you'll be next, Mudbloods!", how do you know he didn't get in trouble?

#+begin_quote
  he tortures Neville psychologically via Trevor in Book 3 and dismisses the prank on an insecure Hermione with a contemptuous "I see no difference". It's made even worse that he's a teacher who gleefully taunts and mocks an orphan's father in front the orphan's face, and Snape is the reason the orphan is parentless.
#+end_quote

None of this contradicts what I said, so not sure your point bringing it up. Do you think I'm defending Snape's every action?

#+begin_quote
  As for Snape's role in Book 6, he can't control Draco.
#+end_quote

Also, /yes/. He thinks he can control Draco and can't. That /is/ bad, that Draco got farther than anyone expected him to. I'm not sure what point your making. Are you saying he should have realized Draco was lying to him? Should have realized how good Draco was at Occlumency, even though it's very nature makes it hard to tell what's being kept from you (how else did Voldemort not realize Snape was using Occlumency against him?)? That if Snape and Dumbledore were just /better/ there wouldn't have been a war because it's their fault for not catching things sooner?

Dumbledore does do diddley squat about the Dementors. Fudge wanted them in the school, Dumbledore refused. Hogwarts is his jurisdiction. You are mistaken when you say Dumbledore is the most powerful. You believe it because the kids think he is, but in reality, he is a principal at a school on a lot of government boards, which a higher corrupt power removed him from /so that/ he no longer has the power you insist he has. It is far too simplistic to expect one person to be able to just... convince the world he's right. What a boring book, and so unrealistic. He has no power to override a corrupt government and implement his ideas over Hogsmeade. If you insist it makes sense that Dumbledore is all-powerful and can override his own government on his every whim, then that will be enough proof that I should stop responding to you.

  And yet we don't actually see anything being done to curtail the eventual probability of Voldemort's return.
#+end_quote

Does Dumbledore not researching Voldemort's past, learning what his Horcruxes are not count? Or do you think he just whipped that out of his ass between fifth and sixth year?

  Rowling turning every adult into a two-bit caricature
#+end_quote

She could have, but in Snape and Dumbledore's case wrote character far more complex... too complex for some maybe.
