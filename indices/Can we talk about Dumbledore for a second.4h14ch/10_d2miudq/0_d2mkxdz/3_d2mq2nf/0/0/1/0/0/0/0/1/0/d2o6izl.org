Remind me where Draco is reprimanded for his use of racist slurs? All of once. Also, ignoring the terrible bullying Snape inflicts, he tortures Neville psychologically via Trevor in Book 3 and dismisses the prank on an insecure Hermione with a contemptuous "I see no difference". It's made even worse that he's a teacher who gleefully taunts and mocks an orphan's father in front the orphan's face, and Snape is the reason the orphan is parentless.

As for Snape's role in Book 6, he can't control Draco. He's never actually shown to actually discipline his charges; Slytherins aren't hated because everyone else are huge jerks, they're hated they're absolute assholes, a large amount are Voldemort Youth, and because almost every adult Slytherin we meet is a huge ass. Hell, this leads to an army of Death Eaters storming a school full of children.

As for Dumbledore...he's also ousted in Book 2, in 3 he does diddly squat about the Dementors. The problem with the whole 'corrupt government' thing is that Dumbledore did literally nothing to curtail it. He's the most powerful wizard ever, the most respected wizard ever, and the head of an international body, but then he's either so terrified of mismanaging power or so bad at actually consolidating it that some fat ostrich neutralizes him and a sadist tortures his students, only he's such an imposing figure that not a single student is willing to tell him about Umbridge's quills. Hell, he's not the only one, nobody went to Minerva either, but that's fairly in-character since Minnie is terrible at being a decent parental figure to her wards.

Dumbledore is head of the ICW and the Wizengamot. He was the only man that Voldemort feared. He sat on and is implied to be chief of the Judiciary. He's the Headmaster of the the most prestigious school in Britain. Fudge can't wipe his arse without asking for Dumbledore's advice. And yet we don't actually see anything being done to curtail the eventual probability of Voldemort's return. In fact, the dude with all the power does diddly squat when a pompous little upstart like Lucius has him thrown out of Hogwarts. Voldemort's lackeys still hold power in the ministry, the racist ideology that gave Voldemort an army is still prominent, and Dumbledore doesn't seem inclined to do a thing despite being practically Merlin the Second.

I suppose some blame lies with Rowling turning every adult into a two-bit caricature so a plucky hero could save the world from the Evil Overlord with the Villain Ball taped to his forehead.
