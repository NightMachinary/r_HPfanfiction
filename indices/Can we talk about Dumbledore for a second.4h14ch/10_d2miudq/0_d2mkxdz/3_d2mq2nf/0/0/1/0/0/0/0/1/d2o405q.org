  with nothing being done to curtail the use of terms like Mudblood or the sick joy some people had at the deaths of Mudbloods

Was nothing being done?

  We see that he kept Snape around in an official position instead of employing him as an independent researcher or something, and Snape was a terrible teacher and authority figure obsessed with vengeance and petty jealousy.

Totally fair point about Snape having another position. Hagrid had a unique position, after all, and Dumbledore kept Trelawney at the school despite not being a professor anymore when Umbridge fired her. Snape was a horrible to Harry, but it's possible he was the worst to only our main characters and perfectly fine with Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws and students in general. Not defending his actions against our main characters, but to say he was a horrible teacher suggests he can't teach, and he seems to take teaching Potions pretty seriously and was most likely fine until the year we are introduced to him, the first year he has to interact with Harry. It's not nothing that McGonagall has a lot of respect for him (up until she thinks he killed Dumbledore in cold blood anyway).

  keep them between himself and Draco Malfoy, who's doing the equivalent of firing a loaded gun in a crowded room trying to hit him.

Fair point, it was incredibly risky, though how does this support your point about Snape?

  we realize that Dumbledore is so utterly incompetent at wielding power that Fudge has him booted out and disgraced within two months.
#+end_quote

It's fairly clear in the books that the government is corrupt. History is littered with examples of powerful people being thrown to the dirt, so I don't take this as evidence that he was incompetent, only that Fudge was corrupt.

  We realize that Dumbledore had all this power and did diddly-squat with it with regard to taking steps against the eventual rise of Magic Hitler.

You nearly had me until this point. /Do/ we realize Dumbledore had all the power? I give this the firmest "No" I could. If he /did/, then I could understand your viewpoint. But why do you think Dumbledore had all the power in the first place? We /literally/ see the moment he is handed the idea of Horcruxes and yet so many blame him for not defeating Voldemort sooner when it was /impossible/. Where does this idea that Dumbledore knows everything and has all the power /stem/ from anyway??? It is shown over and over and over again that he doesn't know everything, and yet people keep thinking he /does/. Is it because he talk eloquently and has a white beard? Is it because Harry think he knows everything? Where does this idea come from?
