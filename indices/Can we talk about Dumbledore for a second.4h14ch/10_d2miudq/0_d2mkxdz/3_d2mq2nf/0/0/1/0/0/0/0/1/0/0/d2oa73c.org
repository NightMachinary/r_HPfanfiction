Dumbledore beat Grindelwald and was known to be the only one Voldemort ever feared. In canon, he should have just had to remind Fudge that there are lines that if crossed will drive Dumbledore to take action, and Fudge should cave. At least before Voldemort is back.

If Fudge honestly believed that Voldemort was not back, then why did he all he could to make the single most powerful wizard in Britain his enemy? Would he have done that if Dumbledore had even shown the tiniest amount of political understanding, and had let slip a sliver of a threat?
