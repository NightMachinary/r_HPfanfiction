I was commenting on your reply to No. 5. Snape's rep as a spy is overblown; he had a cushy job, job security and pay for almost 14 years, and his spying didn't actually pay off that much. His actual deeds in the seventh book mostly revolve on Dumbledore still pulling his strings from beyond the grave.

Admittedly, Snape's spying isn't helped by the fact that he's a thoroughly unpleasant git that nobody trusts, and that the Order of the Phoenix is 10% competent fighters and 90% people who think the sun shines out of Dumbledore's ass but have virtually nothing to contribute. Compare Arthur and Kingsley. Kingsley could successfully blend in with the muggle PM's detail, Arthur is a blithering twit who still can't pronounce electricity.
