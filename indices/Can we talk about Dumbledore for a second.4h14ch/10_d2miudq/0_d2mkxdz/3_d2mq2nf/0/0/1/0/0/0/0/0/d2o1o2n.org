Think about that fight when Harry stumbles on Draco crying in the bathroom. Draco tries an AK. Harry does a Snape special cutter. Harry knows instantly that he's in it deep. He will be blamed and punished for winning a fight he didn't start against an opponent trying to kill him. He scurries to protect the resources he has. He is blamed and punished.
