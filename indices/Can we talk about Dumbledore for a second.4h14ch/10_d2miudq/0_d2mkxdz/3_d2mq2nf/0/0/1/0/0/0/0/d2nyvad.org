It shows that Dumbledore is horrible at making decisions or priorities. The same ideology that ran rampant in the years before Voldemort's fall was present in Hogwarts, with nothing being done to curtail the use of terms like Mudblood or the sick joy some people had at the deaths of Mudbloods. We see that he kept Snape around in an official position instead of employing him as an independent researcher or something, and Snape was a terrible teacher and authority figure obsessed with vengeance and petty jealousy. By the sixth book, it shows that Dumbledore is so utterly disconnected from his wards that he's willing to keep them between himself and Draco Malfoy, who's doing the equivalent of firing a loaded gun in a crowded room trying to hit him.

In the fifth book, we realize that Dumbledore is so utterly incompetent at wielding power that Fudge has him booted out and disgraced within two months. We realize that Dumbledore had all this power and did diddly-squat with it with regard to taking steps against the eventual rise of Magic Hitler.

By the fifth book, we also realize that Dumbledore and the staff are unwilling to stand up for any of their students. Harry gets the brunt of this, as the student body turns against him three times in five books while the teachers do zilch.

Dumbledore is basically terrible at anything not related to magic or Byzantine schemes that rely on luck.
