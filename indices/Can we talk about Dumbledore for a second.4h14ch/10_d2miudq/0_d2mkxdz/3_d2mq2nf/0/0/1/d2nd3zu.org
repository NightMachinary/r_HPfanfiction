Mmm, let's see Snape's history as a spy.

War: Voldemort's winning, Snape turns and Voldemort's still winning.

Voldemort's death to 1993: Snape has a nice, cushy job and proves that he should never have been given power over anything, ever. In First Year, he saves Harry's life, but I'd argue that as a teacher and an authority figure acting as a substitute to a parent, that's his actual goddamn job. In second year, he gets Draco to set a snake on Harry and persecutes him at every turn. In third, we learn that Neville's worst fear isn't the monster that tortured his parents but Snape, Snape attempts to poison Trevor, and then starts foaming at the mouth when he loses his chance at fame and glory via Order of Merlin.

Fourth: Yeah, no.

Fifth: Voldemort's winning.

Sixth: Voldemort's winning, Snape can't control Draco, end result is Death Eaters invading Hogwarts.

Seventh: Simply carrying out Dumbledore's orders, and then gets his throat torn open by Nagini. Why Voldemort didn't just kill him or stick around to make sure he's dead is anyone's guess.

Snape isn't a spy, he's Dumbledore's glorified screwdriver.
