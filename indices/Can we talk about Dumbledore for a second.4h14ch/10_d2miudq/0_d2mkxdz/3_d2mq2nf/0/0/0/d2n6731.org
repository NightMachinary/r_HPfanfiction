You make some very valid points and I agree with much of what you'e saying. There is just one thing that I'm not sure I agree with. I don't think Dumbledore knew about the horcrux in Harry that early on. I always read the books in such a way that, while he was looking into Tom's past beforehand, he only ever came to think of horcruxes after Harry brought him the diary. Let's face it, horcruxes are a very obscure piece of dark magic and the jump from "Tom Riddle has done something to himself in the hope not to die" to "he split his soul into several pieces" is not an intuitive one. After Harry presented him with the destroyed diary, which had possessed Ginny and resisted her atempts to destroy it until Harry used a basilisk fang, that is when I think he activly began to think of horcruxes as a more then just a theoretical possibility. I do agree that he was trying to distance himself from Harry since early on, but I don't think it was because of the horcrux in Harry. I believe it was simply because the prophecy stated he had to die at Voldemort's hands of kill him himself. Harry was most likely to die at Voldemorts hand sooner rather than later because even if we now that Dumbledore doesn't put much stock into prophecies, Riddle did. He would hunt Harry down until either one of them was dead and I think Dumbledore tried to protect himself from the loss he would inevitably face when Harry died. And then Harry kept proving him wrong, simply by not dying. And Dumbledore began caring for the boy but he also figured out that Harry was most likely a horcrux himself so now he had another reason to keep himself emotionally distanced only, as you said, that didn't work out for him.
