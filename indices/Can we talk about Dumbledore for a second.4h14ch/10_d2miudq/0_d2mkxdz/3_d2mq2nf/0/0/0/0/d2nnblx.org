  but I don't think it was because of the horcrux in Harry. I believe it was simply because the prophecy stated he had to die at Voldemort's hands of kill him himself.

I think this is the main point on where we differ, because I don't think Dumbledore is working under the idea that prophecies /have/ to come true.

  “You are setting too much store by the prophecy!.. ...Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecies has been fulfilled?” (Book 6, U.S. p. 509)

In a super simple example, if Trelawney were to say in her prophecy voice, "Next Saturday, Hagrid will trip on a unicorn", Dumbledore would not necessarily think it will happen. However, if he sees that Hagrid is now keeping a unicorn in his yard for class this week and also sees that Hagrid is limping due to an acromantula bite, and is therefore less steady on his feet, and has also invited people over on Saturday for firewhiskey, then Dumbledore may look at the situation and think, "the scenario is ripe for Hagrid to trip on that unicorn on Saturday".

So I think Dumbledore isn't putting too much faith in the prophecy, but looking at things outside the prophecy, and if he happens to come to the same or similar conclusion the prophecy stated, then, well, will you look at that!

I also don't know what Dumbledore knew the night he saw Harry's scar for the first time. I think there is a range of what he could have known that fits with the story. But I think the range is him suspecting what it is, just has no proof, to knowing what it is for certain. I'm definitely more in the "he suspects what it is" boat.

/But/ that doesn't mean he knows Harry will have to /die/, because he doesn't know when Voldemort is coming back. So in my mind, Dumbledore knowing what Harry's scar is, as scary as that is, doesn't /necessarily/ destine Harry to death later. If Voldemort were to remain hidden for 200 years, then literally /nothing/ would have happened with Harry's scar, and he'd live a fully normal life with a scar on his head and then die normally. Sucks for the people in later generations, though, when Voldemort finally does return, though. But Dumbledore, suspicious as I think he was of what Harry's scar meant, doesn't necessarily mean anything will happen with it.

  He would hunt Harry down until either one of them was dead and I think Dumbledore tried to protect himself from the loss he would inevitably face when Harry died

Firstly, don't mean to be negative, it's sooo refreshing talking about Dumbledore with you, and I'm so glad we have similar ideas. Howevre, I disagree with this point, because I think Dumbledore makes it clear that caring for Harry was a flaw, not because he wanted to protect his own heartache, but because it would ruin his plan to defeat Voldemort, and if his plans to defeat Voldemort were ruined he would be responsible for the deaths of thousands.

I think we have similar ideas about Dumbledore altogether, only differ on the timeline, haha!
