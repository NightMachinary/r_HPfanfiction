i'll try to explain as best i can my thoughts, though i do think what you say is valid, but maybe a little too giving(? not sure what the right term is in english)

(1) i think it is a little ridiculous for Dumbledore to drop Harry on the door step and never think to check on him. even if he had no idea about his relationship with the Dursleys, never sending a single person-- harry was underweight, referred to as "freak" and "the boy" and kept in a cupboard. i don't think checking up on him is a huge expectation since Harry is so important. but if you view it as severe oversight maybe...

(2) I think yes if Harry was a normal child you could argue that withholding to protect him makes sense but this boy has been targeted by Voldemort since he was a baby. and i think that random violence and death is more traumatic than death with a reason; knowing why Voldemort did it is important for Harry imo. no it wouldnt be easy but it would be right, something dumbledore claimed to believe. also, by telling him and including him in the da and generally making Harry feel like he was part of a movement to stop Voldemort instead of having all the pressure on him and keeping him in the dark about certain things until the end i think would be better for Harry. and i think harry is very susceptible to manipulation until he overcomes it the hard way. which also could have been made easier if dumbledore put more effort into actually preparing him instead of making him just blindly trust him. it's important to remember that everything we know about the man is in Harry's perspective and he described dumbledore positively

(4) I'm sure he could have put him in a safe house elsewhere, disguised him and have him do overseas things, etc. kingsley shacklebolt wasn't going to catch him, so i think it was an act of disinterest in Sirius' feelings and past at a minimum by locking him up there

(5) dumbledore controlled snape not because of physical closeness but because of the lily situation. he could have put him anywhere and have had him monitored. being a complete asshole to children and picking on students is a form of abuse of power and it's absolutely not ok. hes not harry or nevilles classmate he is their superior and has so much power over them

(6) from hp wikia: "She made sure he didn't particularly enjoy his time with her, and took care never to reveal her heritage to either Harry or the Dursleys, to ensure that the Dursleys would not withdraw Harry from her care"-- she was in constant contact with dumbledore so he knew at minimum that the Dursleys didn't allow harry to enjoy being in her presence and went along with it

(7) yeah on second thought this is true
