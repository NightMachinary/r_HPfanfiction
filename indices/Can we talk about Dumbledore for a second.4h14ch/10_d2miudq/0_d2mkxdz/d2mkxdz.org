Okay to you points, because some I understand and some not as much.

(1) Harry was not (physically) abused by the Durslesy. They didn't like him and the was neglected and the fact that he was living in a cupboard is fucked up but Dumbledore couldn't have known about that one before Harry's first year. If he could have reasonably known, tell me how. They are his closest blood relatives so even without the blood protection, leaving Harry with them would have been reasonable. That he left him with them after first year was a bad decicion but I still believe that Dumbledore never knew how far the Dursleys took their dislike of Harry.

(2) He withheld the prophecy from Harry and it lead to Sirius' death. A fact that he regretted. I will agree that he should have told Harry about it earlier but I also see why he didn't. Harry was 15. I wouldn't want to be the one to tell a 15-year-old he's going into a kill or be killed situation with a powerful dark lord. That does things to a child/teen. Still, Harry should have been told after Voldemort returned, I agree. I don't see how that was to groom Harry into anything. If anything we know how resistant Harry is to all forms of manipulation. Are you telling me Harry wouldn't have fought Voldemort if there was no Dumbledore?

(3) I totally agree here, that was shitty.

(4) What else should he have done with Sirius? (No this is a serious question. I've wondered what a better solution would have been)

(5) Again, what would have been a better solution? (again, serious question) Also, Snape is unfair and snide and an asshole but he doesn't abuse students. Fake Moody abused students. Show me one instance where Snape is abusive towards a student in a teaching setting and I'll shut up.

(6) Where is that ever said or implied? Ms Figg was as nice to him as she could be, being the strange, old catlady that she is.

(7) I think the explaination here was that Harry already had enough on his plate and, seriously, he did. Making Ron a prefect also might have had more to do with encouraging Ron and making him feel less in Harry's shadow than it had to do with Harry.
