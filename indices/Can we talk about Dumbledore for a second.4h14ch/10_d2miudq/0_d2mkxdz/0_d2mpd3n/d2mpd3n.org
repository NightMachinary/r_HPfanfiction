  (2) He withheld the prophecy from Harry and it lead to Sirius' death. A fact that he regretted.

I'd go farther than that. Forget Prophecy for a moment. Harry went to DoM believing that he was going to /personally confront Voldemort/ and who knows how many Death Eaters. If he knew about the prophecy, would that have changed anything?

  If anything we know how resistant Harry is to all forms of manipulation.

I disagree: Harry may be able to resist some forms of magical coercian, but he is pretty easy to manipulate, if one uses the right levers. Voldemort played on Harry's Saving People Thing to lure him into DoM. Umbridge played on Harry's stubbornness to get him into her clutches. Heck, Draco in PS played on his loyalty to Ron to try to get him in trouble with the duel challenge. However, /Dumbledore/ did not use any of those levers.
