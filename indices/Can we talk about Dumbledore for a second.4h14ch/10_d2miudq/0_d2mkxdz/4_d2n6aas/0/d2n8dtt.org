Snape was in a shitty situation when it came to the Occlumency lessons. He couldn't really teach Harry, because that could have compromised his position as a spy with Voldemort. He couldn't /not/ teach Harry because Harry /had to learn this/ and also Dumbledore ordered him to. So, in my oppinion, Snape did the best he could. He used what he knew: The battering ram as you call it worked before when Crouch Jr taught Harry to throw of the imperius curse, something Snape said was simmilar to resisting Legilimency. From his point of view, throwing Legilimency at Harry until he learned might have been the best option. He didn't factor in that Harry respected fake-Moody and hated Snape. Harry didn't aply himself to the Occlumency lessons half as much as he did to the Imperius lessons the year before partially just to spite Snape. That was stupid of him but he was 15. Teenagers are stupid. I'm not saying that Snape did good here. I'm not denying that he hates Harry for a metric shit ton of reasons, most of which are stupid. I'm also not denying that the lessons could have been handeled better by Dumbledore teaching him but the reason why he doesn't do that are explained in the books so I'm not going into that one again. All I'm saying is that Snape wasn't trying not to teach Harry, which is something he's accused of a lot. He just went on what he knew and chose the best option to protect himself and his spy status, rather than Harry's privacy. Which makes him a git but not unreasonably cruel.
