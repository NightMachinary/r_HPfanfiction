you are very reasonable which I appreciate. I disagree with your point that Harry wasn't abused. He plainly was. I can accept that Albus might not see it that way. If you read about the treatment of orphans at the time Albus was attending Hogwarts, Harry's treatment would not be remarkable. He might hope Harry would be well treated but he might not be shocked when Harry wasn't treated better. As for Mrs. Figg, she's a squib, a class known to be savagely oppressed. The same could be said for her.
