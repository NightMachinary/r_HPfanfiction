Sorry if I wasn't clear. I meant to say that Harry wasn't /physically/ abused so that Dumbledore was not completely unreasonable in deciding to give him the blood protection rather than a happy childhood. I'd even argue that it was the right decicion from his point of view since the blood protection saved Harry's life in first year before Dumbledore could step in and again in fifth year when Voldemort tried to posess Harry. He certainly was neglected by the Dursleys in general and verbally abused by Vernon at least. I'm ignoring Dudley here since he was a child and wasn't taught any better but if we include Dudley then, yes he was physically abused, too. I just think that we have to take into account that the first two books, where most of the abuse happens, were childrens fantasy and the narrative of the lost and misstreated 'prince' who returns to his home kingdom is a popular theme there. (there is a rather interesting article about that, btw but I have been told it destroys childhoods of HP fans. It's called "Crowning the King" if you're interested) I imagine if JKR had had any idea of the response she'd get for the HP series, she would have written the Dursleys differently. We can see that in their later character development. But what would have been is not an argument and we have to go with what is actually in the book so yes, you're right. Harry did suffer abuse from his guardians.
