Yep, that's the one. Had to read it for uni a few years ago and I found it very interesstion as well. It was written before the 5th book was published though so it doesn't analyze the entire series. I can check some more articles of a similar nature if you like but I don't know any more specifically dealing with Harry Potter, though I'm sure they exist.
