as a person who rather dislikes Dumbledore, I'll try to explain why I view him as manipulative and terrible...

(1) Dumbledore knows full well that Harry is neglected and abused by the Dursleys, yet he leaves him there with the excuse of it being for his protection and to prevent him from struggling with the hardships of being a celebrity. sounds like bs to me, he could have put Harry under the protection of the fidelius or a myriad of other options /that don't involve abusing and neglecting a child/. and the whole "it will be better for Harry to grow up without all that fame" thing--that's a really convenient excuse, especially since Harry's newfound sense of belonging in the wizarding world makes him all the more manipulatable, after years of Dursley treatment.

(2) he purposefully withheld information from Harry so that Harry would keep doing what dumbledore wanted, and purposefully groomed him into a pawn willing to sacrifice himself to "save the world"

(3) he knew that he going to die in the Half Blood Prince and didn't tell Harry and oh yeah Harry WATCHED HIM DIE

(4) he locked Sirius up in Grimmauld Place after he was in Azkaban for 12 years, the place where Sirius was abused and escaped from as a child, and had him watch all of his colleagues in the Order actively hell while Sirius had to stew in feelings of worthlessness

(5) he lets Snape, notorious for abusing students, teach in Hogwarts so that he's closer to him

(6) didn't let Ms Figg be nice to him??

(7) didn't let Harry be prefect because he didn't want to be obvious with his favouritism when Gryffindor gets the house cup EVERY year bc of Harry

I can spend essays going through these points with evidence from the books, and if I wasn't on mobile I'd link a bunch of tumblr posts on the subject, but yeah.

tl;dr you cant have dumbledore be both the wisest most powerful wizard alive AND the guy who accidentally fucks people over to get what he wants
