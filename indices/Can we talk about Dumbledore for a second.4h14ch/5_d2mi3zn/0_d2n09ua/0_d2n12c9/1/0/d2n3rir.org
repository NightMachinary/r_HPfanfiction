Part 2/2;

I'm a fucking idiot and copied it over to paste and then accidentally copied something else..... (and stupidly closed the original thing)

Rather than figuring out how to retrieve that, if it's even possible, I'll rewrite the second half tomorrow. In the meantime, feel free to refer to the link in the original post's edit. It's a paper I co-wrote about Dumbledore.

The long and short of what I accidentally copied over is that these /are/ mistakes, they are what makes Dumbledore an interesting character with faults. He is a fool and is often cowardly. He can face Voldemort and Death Eater without blinking, and yet is often cowardly at very basic and human levels. Discovering the reasons why are what make him, in my opinion, infinitely more interesting than a scheming manipulative man who is extremely self-aware and doesn't make any mistakes except getting caught.

If I forget to respond, let me know, I might have just gotten busy.

Okay, here's the second half now

  In the fifth year the whole ignoring Harry thing was a mistake, as was giving him and occlumency teacher that hated him. Also Dumbledore's secrecy with the prophesy alowed Voldemort's trap to work, though the last point is understandable even if it is still a mistake

It was definitely absolutely a mistake. Again, I'm not trying to say Dumbledore did everything perfectly, because he definitely did not. I just think people are keen to think of Dumbledore as manipulative, that they read Rita Skeeter's and Aberforth's take, which gives us a view of Dumbledore that is very self-aware and power-hungry. The books tear Dumbledore down to pieces, and I think people stopped there and must have skimmed straight over the King's Cross chapter where Dumbledore gives reasons for all his actions that present them in a slightly different light than what the tabloids and those who didn't know him well said. They end up not being mistakes of sly miscalculations, but mistakes of deep emotional blindness. If they were simple "oops, I manipulated people the wrong way", I doubt Dumbledore would be filled with the immense shame he presents in King's Cross.

Okay, so actually talking about fifth year now. This year is essentially the year Dumbledore royally fucks up. For four years he's watched as this boy (a boy he knew he should stay emotionally distant with) went through so much hardship, but at the same time showed so so /so/ much bravery, loyalty (Fawke's went to Harry's in CoS), and love (fighting for his friends and family). And Dumbledore, despite knowing this would ruin his plan, began to care for Harry, began to prioritize him over Voldemort.

But he knew, deep down, that he shouldn't, that there was no way to give Harry the life he deserves this way. He won't live forever to protect Harry, and the immortal Voldemort would still reign supreme. We all know, and Dumbledore definitely knew, Harry would hate living a life of hiding and go after Voldemort anyway and die. Prioritizing Harry /would not have done Harry or anyone any good/, so Dumbledore knew that he must not think emotionally, that that would not solve anyone's problems.

So he tried to avoid it, just like I'm avoiding thinking about how much debt I'm in, and yet it creeped up on him anyway because how can it not? This is war, and things are happening whether he can control them or not. But he prioritized Harry's life and the result was doing nearly the opposite of what Harry really needed. Like an over-bearing parent who doesn't let their kid learn about sex-ed or, well, read Harry Potter books, he over-protected Harry, keeping this enormous burden a secret from him, because as any emotionally weak parent, you forget to do what the child /really/ needs, and do what you /want/ them to need.

And Dumbledore knew, though he pretended not to, that Harry could handle it.

Furthermore Dumbledore was /absolutely/ correct in being paranoid about what Voldemort would do with Harry's mind. I mean, Voldemort totally planted a fake vision, isn't that evidence enough that Dumbledore was right? And yes, he chose the wrong preventative action, but Occlumency is the accepted form of blocking mental attacks, so... what else is Dumbledore going to do? Dumbledore isn't even as good at Occlumency as Snape is, and who else is going to do it? What, should Dumbledore fly in someone from France and say, "Sir, please, this is really confidential, so like... don't tell anyone about this kid's connection with Voldemort's mind, it could lead to lots of deaths. Speaking of death, how's your life insurance plan?" No. And he can't do it himself, because Harry feels Voldemort rise inside him in Dumbledore's presence.

And it's not like he can look up other examples of people who have bits of other people's souls in them and see if it works any differently. Dumbledore is /guessing/ and he guessed right, only Snape was a poor teacher and Harry was crap at Occlumency. But his worries and his reasons for acting that way make sense with what he knew at the time. Dumbledore didn't know until he witnessed it with his own two eyes that Harry didn't need Occlumency at all.

  "That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.‚Äù (Book 5, ch. 37)

  Sixth year the Gaunt ring although it was his hearts greatest desire so its kind of understandable and I won't hold that against him. Dumbledore also seams to take a great deal of time giving Harry a very small amount of information about Tom Riddle.

Another thing that is ultimately a huge moment in Dumbledore's (in my opinion wonderful) characterization. He touches the ring. And he does it to bring back his dead sister, quite forgetting she is at peace. He failed, poetically, as a master of death, because someone who was truly master would not have made such a folly, but he also failed Harry. He did not plan to die so soon, but now he has to */COMPLETELY FUCKING RE-THINK EVERYTHING/*.

And so I just want to go on a tangent. Do people who think Dumbledore planned everything from the get-go think he planned his own death too? Serious question. Or do they think his plan, like... didn't change much after he touched the ring? Was he just like "oh, well, I guess I'm dead, but at least my plan to totally manipulate the shit out of Harry can still work! If anything, I get to manipulate more!"? I don't understand how his touching the ring fits into this theory and am /so curious/.

Anyway, now he has to re-think everything, and who is the best option to carry on? Well, Harry of course, not because of the prophecy, but because out of all the willing candidates, he is the one that can't be killed by Voldemort and also the one with a connection to Voldemort's mind and /also/ the one with a wand that recognizes Voldemort as a foe and /also/ with a wand that absorbed Voldemort's own deadly power. Harry may be young, but he is /seriously fucking powerful/ against Voldemort and /nobody/ knows that better than Dumbledore.

It also should be noted that /nowhere/ does Dumbledore tell Harry he needs to act alone. That was Harry's choice. He told Harry not to tell anybody about Horcruxes. That's it, and that was also really fantastic advice, because if Voldemort even had one inkling they were after Horcruxes, he'd make another, or more for good measure.

Also, Dumbledore's speed at which he gives Harry information was slow, but why should it have been faster? What, really, is the benefit in this case. Everything was covered -- plus, towards the end, the speed was dependent on Harry's ability to get Slughorn's memory, so really, we should blame Harry for that 'cause he took his sweet time.

As much as I wrote, I know I could have written more to help explain my points (and indeed have, if you read the post linked in OPs edit). If any part of this is confusing, or you disagree, let me know, I'd love to keep discussing it.
