  He is a fool and is often cowardly. He can face Voldemort and Death Eater without blinking, and yet is often cowardly at very basic and human levels.

I remember reading one well written story where, after Ariana, Dumbledore was so afraid of being personally responsible for another disaster that he became manipulative and only guided other people to do what he wanted. If it blew up in their face, he could rationalize that he wasn't responsible or accountable for their actions.
