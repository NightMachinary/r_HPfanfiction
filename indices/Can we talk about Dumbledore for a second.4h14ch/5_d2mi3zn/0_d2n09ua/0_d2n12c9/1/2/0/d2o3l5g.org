Can't remember what comment I said it in, but I mentioned the same thing, he could have brought down students.

Voldemort certainly could have found some way /eventually/. But he did not know how the stone was protected until he got there and saw the mirror. He could escape and return, but then he'd likely have been found out due to the evidence that he had been through the obstacles once before, in which case, the stone might be moved again. Hindsight really is 20/20. I could obviously have caught my friend's ex cheating, only I can't read minds. I could have also put a $20 in my car to pay for gas when I accidentally left my wallet at home, but... well, that require foresight too, doesn't it?

As for Voldemort being at the school for a year around students. I know. I really don't think any of the characters besides the main trio were really fleshed out, and although there might not be gaping holes, there are a lot of scenarios that are hard to imagine happening in, say, HBP - they seem laughably innocent. I don't really have specific examples for why I feel this way, except that it seems to me as if it was written with absolutely no idea the magnifying glass people were going to put to the book. Later, the plots seems much more airtight.
