Prophecies, as a rule, are vague bullshit. The "either must die at the hand of the other" line was basically Fate going "yea boi we gonna have a /dank-ass/ showdown" and doesn't actually mean he can't die from his house being burned down if Voldemort wasn't the one who did it. It's fire, fire doesn't care.

I do think the Mirror would have stumped Quirrelmort. Even if he could figure out the trick to the spell that hid the stone (Selfish,no; Unselfish, yes) he wouldn't have been able to get it, because the spell used the Mirror's properties, i.e. seeing your heart's desire, to see if you actually wanted the stone for unselfish reasons or if you were just saying that. It's possible a master occlumens could trick it (Assuming that's possible with canon occlumency), but I don't think Quirrelmort was capable of that at that point in time.

There's also the fact that all of this was just meant to delay Quirrelmort until Dumbledore could get there. So even if Quirrelmort could have gotten it eventually, there likely wouldn't have been enough time.

He probably couldn't impersonate Moody perfectly, but I don't think he would need to. All the teachers are /busy/. Dumbledore, even more so. Any interactions would have been quick and shallow how do you do's.
