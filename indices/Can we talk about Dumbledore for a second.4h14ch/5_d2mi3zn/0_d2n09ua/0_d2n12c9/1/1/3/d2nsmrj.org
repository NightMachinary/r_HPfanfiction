  would it be fun if I went easy on you? :)

Definitely not as much fun! :D :D :D

  the death eaters are literally unable to kill him

How are they unable to kill him?

  to assume that voldemort wouldn't be able to figure out the mirror is a hell of a fucking gamble
#+end_quote

Everything is a gamble. Are you suggesting there /is/ a fool proof plan and Dumbledore just... didn't choose that one?

  Still on the first year there has to be a fic that contains Voldemort and Quirrel doing lesson plans together that would be amazing "you fool teach them about bogarts first it will help them deal with the panic of dealing with a grindilow"
#+end_quote

Hahaa!! That's sound brilliant! God, I love imagining Voldemort getting frustrated at students' wrong answers about him.

#+begin_quote
  I concede the point about the second year you are correct though he could have legilemencied it out but that is a weak arguement
#+end_quote

Fair enough. As I get older, I definitely think the first three books are much more childish than I would have admitted when I was younger. I don't consider this a bad thing, though. It doesn't mean I don't enjoy them any less, but just consider things like Voldemort sitting through class all year, and Peter Pettigrew living as Ron's pet rat as significantly different tones from the later series, and I don't want to ignore that clear change in tone when analyzing the books. I think Voldemort, Dumbledore, and almost everyone besides Harry, Ron, and Hermione, (and I'll throw Snape in there too) are much better written in later books (the main trio, and Snape, I think are written well from the get-go). Not because they were poorly written before, but that Rowling had a much better grasp on their characterization at that point, having been in their heads for so long.

All this goes into my thinking about the over-all plot and characterization, so if it's weak that Dumbledore should have realized there was a monster sooner, then it's a weaker plot structure, but that doesn't necessarily mean that makes Dumbledore stupid, it just means that the plot existed in such a way where Dumbledore had to be stumped.

  nobody is that good
#+end_quote

I don't think your conclusion is bad, but I don't consider this a very good argument. I understand it feeling extremely implausible, though, but think there are much better arguments than that. I could use that argument for anything, "nobody is that evil" "nobody is that brave", but in a fictional world with ghosts and magic, maybe somebody /is/ that good, you know?

Also, this, once again, seems to fall under plot structure rather than characterization. Not that that makes it any less valid, but as we're talking about characterization, it seems relevant to say.

I think Moody likely would have a "this is me" codephrase, but there is still a /way/, whether or not you find it plausible or not, for Crouch Jr. to get that phrase out of him. In a weakened state, people are much more susceptible to Veritiserum and the Imperius Curse, so he could have gotten it out that way. Certainly Moody is paranoid, but in a world of magic, maybe paranoia isn't a strong enough defense. Pre-planning can only take one so far even in the Muggle World. Having mace on my keys isn't necessarily going to prevent anything just because I thought to put mace on my keys ahead of time.
