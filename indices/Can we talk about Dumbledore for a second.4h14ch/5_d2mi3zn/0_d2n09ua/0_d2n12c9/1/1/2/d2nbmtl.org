  I still disagree about the Dursleys the prophecy states that one can die at the hand of the other without a body Voldemort is no threat to Harry and the death eaters are literally unable to kill him.

And? That's not the only issue that had a hand in guiding Dumbledore's decision. Harry was a counterpoint /and/ mirror to Dumbledore's failings in dealing with Riddle's childhood. Both were, when away from Hogwarts, living in a place they intensely hated yet were sent back there each summer. But, and to Dumbledore that made all the difference, Riddle grew up without family and so, in Dumbledore mind, rejected them right back as they had rejected him. This view stems from Dumbledore's own broken family and his guilt about them. He did not dare let another child grow up without family, as bad as they may be.

In Dumbledore's internal narrative external issues can be traced back to lacking family. And as flawed as this view may be, it drives the character in all his good and bad points.
