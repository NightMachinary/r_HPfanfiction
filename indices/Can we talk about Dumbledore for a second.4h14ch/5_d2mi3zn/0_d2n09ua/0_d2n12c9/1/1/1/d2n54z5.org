  on the point about the first year being a childrens book I agree but it is still a plot hole, and to assume that voldemort wouldn't be able to figure out the mirror is a hell of a fucking gamble .He has many times done what was thought to be impossible in many ways he is a better wizard than Dumbledore and if I were Dumbledore I wouldn't be that confident in the mirror.

Now I want a fic were Quirrellmort gets tired of the mirror's shit after five minutes and just puts the whole thing in a mokeskin pouch and absconds with it. He has months if not years to figure out the enchantment, no? Or find some other gullible kid to extract the Stone that won't actually burn his face off. It would actually be a lot more realistic; when you're conducting a heist you don't hang around longer than you can help it; if you can take the whole safe with you you don't waste time trying to crack the code where you can be caught.
