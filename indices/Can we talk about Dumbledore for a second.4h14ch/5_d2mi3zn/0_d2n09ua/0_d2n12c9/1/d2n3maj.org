Part 1/2:

Not going to make it easy for me, huh? ;D

  Leaving Harry at the Dursleys was unnecessary as the one person who could kill him had no form.
#+end_quote

Harry already cannot be killed by Voldemort due to Lily's sacrifice, body or no body, which suggest that Dumbledore has other reasons than preventing Voldemort from murdering this child. The added protection Dumbledore added on top of Lily's provided Harry a home in which he could step outside, not be watched constantly, go to school, and essentially live a normal life. Other forms of protection that were introduced in the series (which is all we can work with) would limit these aspects of his life. Naturally we can say "there's another way not introduced", but in a world of magic, that is a very cheap response, in my opinion. Also, we know from the Seven Potters chapter that Harry was protected by not only Voldemort, but Death Eaters as well.

But bison, he was neglected! Yes, he was, and Dumbledore knew Petunia was a piece of work, but how could he predict her parenting/gaurdianing style when she was a new parent herself? Yes, it's clear she's not ideal, but we're really expecting god-like abilities from Dumbledore, aren't we?

But bison, why did he keep Harry there ten years? It is my belief that Dumbledore's main characterization centers around him attempting to emotionally distance himself from Harry so that he can do what is best for the lives of thousands, but begins to love Harry, thus failing at his original plan. Therefore, I believe this to be the time that he distances himself and is largely unaware of the true nature of Harry's neglect. I never said he was perfect, I just don't think most people are looking at him critically enough to appreciate his characterization. I do no think he was Big Brother-ing everything as much as others do. It makes him seem to god-like.

  In the first year the stones' "defences" are a gauntlet so trivial that three eleven year olds with less than a year of magical training and Quirrel a mediocre wizard could beat it.
#+end_quote

The first book is full of things that later seem absolutely ridiculous, and I think it's really important to consider this when looking at the book. I mean, imagine Voldemort being okay with sitting through a year of class? It's hilarious!

Also, the only reason the Stone was at all at risk of being stolen was because Harry fucked it up and went after it. Quirrellmort could not have retrieved the Stone out of the mirror. They /would/ have failed. I think this is proof that Dumbledore /didn't/ want Harry to go after the stone when he did, even if he /did/ want Harry to understand a few things, like the mirror, I do not think that necessarily means he wanted that to happen when Harry was 11.

  “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn't you?” (Book 1, U.S. p. 297).
#+end_quote

Considering he, Hermione, and Ron were in the library researching him for ages, and considering they casually mention his name aloud to Hagrid, even a minimal level of omniscience or manipulative intent would have meant Dumbledore already knew this.

Four years later,

“... well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you, and sooner --- much sooner --- than I had anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort.” (Book 5, U.S. p. 837).

Being unable to find enough evidence that he is lying, my only conclusion is that Dumbledore means it --- he did not intend Harry to meet Voldemort at age eleven. This fits in line with how royally Harry fucked up the protection and undoing a years worth of Dumbledore's hard work to keep the stone away from Voldemort. However,

  "You delayed his return to full power and strength. You fought a man's fight. I was . . . prouder of you than I can say.” (Book 5, U.S. p. 837)
#+end_quote

Harry proved that he was quite special and I believe whatever plans Dumbledore had held for a decade for this child were cracking under pressure, as much as they shouldn't. I think Dumbledore is beginning to love Harry, and wants to protect him, even while he knows the terrible consequences, he convinces himself he doesn't have to face those problems /yet/,

  "I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young." (Book 5, U.S. p. 838)

  In the second year if Hermione can figure out that it is a basilisk then Dumbledore should have figured it out long before her as he is supposed to be magnitudes above her in terms of intelligence
#+end_quote

Hermione knew Harry was hearing voices. Even Dumbledore didn't know that because Harry lied to him about it, which to me suggests he understood Harry's connection a lot less than we think he did at this stage. He is skilled at Occlumency, but even Snape asks Harry questions directly rather than just "reading his mind" because it is more complicated, so I don't think the idea that Dumbledore could have known is very strong.

  In the fourth year there's the whole Crouch jr impersonating Moody for a year without drawing suspicion when they were supposedly old friends (as much as a man as powerful as Dumbledore can have friends)
#+end_quote

I have no reason to dispute this. The impersonator did an excellent job.
