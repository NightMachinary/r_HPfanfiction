Well all of it speaks to the lack of creativity of the good guys and the Ministry. Unlike in real life, when the Death Eaters fire off lethal spells at our heroes, they can reply with stunners that are super effective. So, I don't have a problem with good guys not killing, *IF* after the fact they act appropriately. Again, unlike real life, there exists mind magic, both in the form of spells and potions. There is no need for Azkaban, just mind-wipe a person until they are no longer a threat. Obliviate, Obliviate, Obliviate. Its the most humane thing to do.

Edit: Even Hermoine Obliviates her parents, in the worst possible character decision in the entire series. The above was slightly tongue in cheek, but seriously now, what she did was horrific and completely un-acceptable.
