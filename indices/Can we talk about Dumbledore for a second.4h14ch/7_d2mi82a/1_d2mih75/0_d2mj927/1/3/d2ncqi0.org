When the official military was given the go-ahead to use lethal force, I think the whole "we'll be just like them" thing falls flat on its face. A decade later, the same culprits are in positions of power, the same values that gave Voldemort an army are in no danger of being stamped out, the Headmaster and staff are unwilling to stand up for any of the students being persecuted, and Fudge stripped Dumbledore of all his vaunted titles and political power in two months.

Examining the book series closer portrays Dumbledore as an idiot content to twiddle his thumbs and forget that Hogwarts is a school, not a place where he can work on his redemption projects (Draco), keep a teacher so horrible that he attempts to poison a child's pet for funsies, or set traps for Evil McWizard.
