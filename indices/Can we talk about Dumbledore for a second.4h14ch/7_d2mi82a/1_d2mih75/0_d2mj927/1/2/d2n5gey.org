  no better than the Death Eaters themselves

I love it when people say that. Would killing the Death Eaters be murder? Yes, and that's bad. Would it be vigilantism? Yes, and that's also bad. Would it lead to a slippery-slope issue concerning unwilling followers and unnecessary deaths? Definitely could, yeah. Would it put them on the same level as rapists, torturers, and genocidal psychopaths?

No, no it would not. I'd say that in the end they'd still be quite a bit better than the scum they were killing.
