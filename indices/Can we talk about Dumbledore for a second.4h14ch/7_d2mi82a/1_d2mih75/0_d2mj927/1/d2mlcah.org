Okay, agree on the Draco in 6th year front. 100% agree, no further comment.

But again to the not killing Death Eaters part. If he had gone around killing them (or if any of the order members had, which they didn't until the final battle) they would have been no better than the Death Eaters themselves, which is not something you write in a book that started out as a childrens series. Also it would have been vigilantism. As someone who was Supreme Mugwup (whatever that may actually be) of the highest wizarding jury, I don't see him resonably doing that.
