  loss of life? no. if that were his motivation he would kill the killers rather than stun them.

Thats an opinion, not a fact. It may be your opinion (and mine) that the best way to deal with the problem was to kill the death eaters, but Dumbledore didn't believe that. It might seem unrealistically optimistic, but he thought that he could imprison the death eaters rather than kill them. He strived for the best case scenario (the least loss of life), and even though it's not what I would have done in his situation, I can understand the desire to try, even if it's unrealistic.
