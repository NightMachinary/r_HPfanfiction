Harry obviously realized that the Dursleys, being his closest blood relatives and all, would have been the ones he'd end up with since he didn't have any godparents or other family, at least not to his knowledge. Even if it was Dumbledore who dropped him of there, can you honestly tell me that Harry wouldn't have gone to the Dursleys if he hadn't?
