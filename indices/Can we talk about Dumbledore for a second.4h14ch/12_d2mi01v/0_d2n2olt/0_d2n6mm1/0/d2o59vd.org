  Even if it was Dumbledore who dropped him of there, can you honestly tell me that Harry wouldn't have gone to the Dursleys if he hadn't?

He could have put him anywhere, though, couldn't he? No one really knew who he lived with.

Put him somewhere secure and give him parental figures to watch over him. Tell the government that he's with family and they would believe him. He's Dumbledore. He can do no wrong. Right?

My problem with Dumbledore is that even though he's magically powerful and has great political clout, he doesn't use it. He's so afraid of slipping and trying to take over the world again that he's paralyzed.

Yes, hiding Harry with someone who wasn't family was probably illegal. But it was the right thing to do. He should have listened to McGonagall's concerns but he didn't.

Smushing Lucius Malfoy into paste after /Chamber of Secrets/ would have been illegal, but it would have been right. This man tried to kill basically everyone in the school and got away with it.

Yes, it would be illegal. Yes, it could be a slippery slope. He needed to get over the fear of going Big Bad and do a job that no one else was willing to do.
