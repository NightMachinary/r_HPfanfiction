Okay, first off all, thank you. That's a pretty good argument.

Yeah, I see now how having more than one antagonist would be appealing. But we already do have two antagonists in canon, the second being the ministry which usually falls flat in a lot of HP ffs I've read. I feel like evil!Dumbledore has become a trope and as such invites a lot of lazy writing. As you said, most Dumbledore bashing is poorly written. Also, his being evil has been accepted as almost canon so by now it's more surprising to find a helpful Dumbledore in a ff rather than a manipulative one and I don't think he deserves that.
