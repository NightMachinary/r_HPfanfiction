I personally am fine with Dumbledore Bashing stories. Mostly because I like having more variety in antagonists. The idea that the person you should be able to go to for help is not only the most powerful person in the country, but also in reality not so good natured. It can be a great read of the underdog fighting against a far greater power. Adding Voldemort and you got two antagonists with (normally) far greater power than the main character with an added evil vs. evil & order vs. chaos flavor.

The main problems with Dumbledore bashing are two fold. The first is like you said, there are a lot of them, meaning that you gonna have a lot of similar ideas floating around, and a lot of questionable writing. The second is also connected to the first, poor quality. I lot of stories featuring Dumbledore bashing spend more time emphasizing Dumblemore having bad intentions for the main character and less so emphasizing competence. And that makes a poor antagonist.
