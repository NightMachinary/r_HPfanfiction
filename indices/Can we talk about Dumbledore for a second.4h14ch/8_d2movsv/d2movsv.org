Eh. I don't mind it.

1. The alternative is we get stuck with the black and white, ministry is competent and Voldemort is evil! Dumbledore antagonist gives us some variety.

2. It's a bit hard to reconcile a Dumbledore that is both competent and good--and not have the story just be about him saving the day. Fanfics that say he is neither is incredibly hard for me to swallow. Then it's just bashing.
