  it's hard for me to ignore the disregard for Harrys well being before Harry arrives at Hogwarts.

Exactly, and we /shouldn't/ forgive him. I think the trouble with defending Dumbledore is that, by talking to those who find him cruel and manipulative, then clearly I must just think exactly the opposite. The truth is I don't.

The problem I have with Ultra Manipulative Dumbledore is that, if you look at the the timeline of the series, it is nearly /impossible/ for him to have manipulated as much as people give him credit for. If you read the prophecy, just take your later knowledge of the books away and it says /almost nothing/ that can be immediately understood. /Voldemort/ jumped to conclusions borne from his fear, and that was the /problem/, he lost his mind due to his fear. /Dumbledore/ did not jump to conclusion about the prophecy.

If one takes time to see what Dumbledore learned throughout the books, then it becomes clear that those things /could not/ have been part of some giant scheme planned a decade earlier, because he learns these things when Harry is 11, 12, 14, and 15. How could have have planned for them if he didn't know these things?

This Ultra Manipulative Dumbledore, therefore, must be a god. How else can he have such amazing foresight, such perfect intuition, and be completely omniscient? There is /nothing/ he can't do, therefore everything he does is clearly /on purpose/ and some form of manipulation to get /his way/. Why?

*/Why?/*

I can't tell you how confused I am trying to figure out what this Dumbledore's /motivations/ are. /Why is he bothering to do all these things?/ And I know we're on a fan fiction sub, but I think people /really do think fan fiction is canon/ sometimes. I have /actually been linked fan fiction/ to justify people's ideas of Dumbledore. *Fan Fiction!!* I love fan fiction as much as the next person, but it is /not sourceable material/.

Earlier I said Voldemort lost his head when he heard the prophecy, went after Harry without being reasonable about it, that's how strong his fear is. Dumbledore, though logical about the prophecy, loses his head over other things - when he sees the Resurrection Stone and wants to bring his sister back. He is weak there, but how poetic that weakness is. Voldemort's fear is death, and he loses his mind where death is concerned. Dumbledore is not scared of death, he readily accepts it, but when he thinks for a moment he can bring his sister back, he loses his mind, and forgets his enlightened view and wishes to bring her to him. He failed, and Death takes him.

Both are fools, opposites, but fools, and Harry is the one, least magical of all, that controlled both his fear and his love, and that is why, poetically, he survives where both Voldemort and Dumbledore die. It is not a story of magic, but of choices, and the reasons behind those choices - our love and fears and conquering them.

It is Dumbledore's wonderfully poetic faults and how they tie in to the themes of the books that make him so fascinating, and yet /so many people/ see him as manipulative, who never loved, an yet his foolish love is /the very core of his characterization/. I feel like those Christians who want to save people by telling them about Jesus. I genuinely feel that people are missing out on a huge wonderful and meaningful part of the series, so convinced are they that Dumbledore is manipulative.

And how do you suggest he's not? It's so easy to call something manipulative, because it inherently requires very little to back it up. "Dumbledore knew that would happen", "He looked sad on purpose to make Harry think he was sad". How can one dispute that? It doesn't matter that there's /no reason/ for Dumbledore to work on such a level of secrecy. It doesn't matter that Dumbledore's backstory is centered around his cowardice and not his desire to manipulate.

And above all, it doesn't matter that it was /Rita Skeeter/ and Aberforth, who so clearly knows very little about his brother, that many people believe. Sometimes I wonder if people were missing The Lost Prophecy, Horcruxes, and Kings Cross Chapters entirely in their books, that there was a huge mis-printing, because the more I talk about Dumbledore, the more I get confused and want to shout to the world, 'It's all in the books!"

Dumbledore is introduced as a perfect omniscient god, then he's broken down and we're meant to question him. Then he's built back up in a single chapter, but not as a god this time, but as a human, and I think people have trouble with that.
