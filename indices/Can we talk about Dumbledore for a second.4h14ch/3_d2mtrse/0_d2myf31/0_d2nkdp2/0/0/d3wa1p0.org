Sorry this is so very late(I'm trawling through old stuff), but while you have a good point in your post, you do pass over a couple things; Dumbledore was specifically warned by McGonagall about the nature of the Dursleys and Dumbledore chose to ignore that, then he chose never to have Harry checked up on.

Those two things, to me, make Dumbledore a fool. It's not helped by him trying to do everything in a roundabout, enigmatic fashion either.
