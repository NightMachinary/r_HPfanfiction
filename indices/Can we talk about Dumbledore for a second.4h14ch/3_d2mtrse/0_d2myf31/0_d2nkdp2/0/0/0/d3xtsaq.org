Never too late to talk about Dumbledore!

Did I skip over those two points? I don't think McGonagall's information was new to him, but I suppose if it was, it doesn't really make a difference, he chose to put Harry there either way. I believe Dumbledore when he says Harry was in extreme danger, even while Voldemort was in exile, and for that reason, I think Harry would have lived a very closeted life (pun intended) somewhere else, and the Dursleys is the only place he could be protected while still being able to step outside a house and go to the store and travel. That is, live a normal life.

As for McGonagall's warnings, all she said was they were not "like us" and described their son acting bratty. I don't really think that compares to saving Harry's life.

Secondly from that, maybe Dumbledore did check up on Harry? How do we know he didn't? But I actually agree with you - I don't think he did, I think was Dumbledore being neglectful. He didn't know how horrible it was because he wasn't looking.

  “Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine. An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong.” (Book 5, U.S. p. 837)

I think Dumbledore knew that he had to stay objective or else Voldemort would win, and at first intentionally stayed distant from Harry. But once Harry began at Hogwarts and began to prove how great he was and his loyalty to Dumbledore (Fawkes helping Harry in the Chamber, saving the stone, etc), Dumbledore's heart weakened and he grew to love Harry despite knowing he shouldn't.

Dumbledore position is written to be extremely difficult. On one had, what does it say about him that he placed Harry at the Dursleys, on the other, Harry probably would have been killed if he didn't, so did he do the right thing?

On on hand he kept Harry's necessary death from him, but on the other hand, keeping the secret ensured his survival.

On one hand, he let people think Snape was a Death Eater, but on the other hand it ensured Voldemort did not suspect Snape, thus allowing Snape to become headmaster and protect all the innocent students for the length of the war, which could have gone on for ages.

Most of Dumbledore decisions can be seen as immoral, and yet the alternate is (in my opinion) usually worse. I think it's what makes the writing /so brilliant/ and especially why he's such a controversial character to this day.
