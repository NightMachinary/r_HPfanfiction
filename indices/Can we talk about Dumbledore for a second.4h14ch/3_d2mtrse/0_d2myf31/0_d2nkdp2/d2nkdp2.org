I don't think he's a monster. But since we bring ourselves to books we read it's hard for me to ignore the disregard for Harrys well being before Harry arrives at Hogwarts.

And that Dumbledore admits to leaving Harry there. That he admits to knowing Harry would have a difficult time but does nothing.

I certainly can't paint him in a good light.
