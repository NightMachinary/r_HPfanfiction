Totally agree with this, though I also think this particular character is one of the best written characters I've ever seen. Maybe too subtly written, though, since so many people think he's a monster. But I think he's a hero that tripped a lot on the way but ultimately made the right choices and I am not at all surprised Harry named his kid after him.
