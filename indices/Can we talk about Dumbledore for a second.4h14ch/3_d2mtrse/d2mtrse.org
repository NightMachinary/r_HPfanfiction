I think people need to remember the suspension of disbelief in Harry Potter extends beyond accepting that magic is a thing. Some of Dumbledore's actions are written because they move the story in such a way that Harry can be the hero. Alot of Dumbledore's mistakes take the story in a direction that is entertaining, which is the main reason people read books.
