The problem with Dumbledore and this community is that the moment childish innocence leaves your brain his actions begin to make absolutely no sense. Just like the action of many, /many/ other adult characters. It is a series targeted to children and teenagers.

Then you combine that with the fact that you /know/ he's very intelligent. You know the man has a sense for analytical thinking, problem solving, empathy,...

Why did he never check up on Harry (or literally /anyone/ else)? Why did he build traps for freakin Dark Lord Voldemort that first years could overcome? How is it that one of the most knowledgeable people of the wizarding world kind of forgets that there is such a thing as basilisks? Why isn't he protecting Sirius even if he /knows/ that he is innocent? How does one of the most observant people in the castle not notice that his life long friend isn't quite the same? How in the world is Dumbledore going from decade-long politician to government noob while trying to let people see the truth about Voldemort? What the fuck is he thinking when he sends three teens on a chase like the Horcrux hunt?

You arrive at the point where you ask yourself: "What the hell are you up to, old man?" and if you don't remember that, yes, this is all tailored so that Harry can be in the spotlight, you may end up convinced that the old man planned something.

I'm actually writing the outlines to a fic where Dumbledore acts as adults would think of the awe-inspiring wizard. Age Line at the 3rd floor with no announcement of "horrible death if entered". Hogwarts budget gets up in flames for truckloads of roosters in second year. Dumbledore goes chasing after Sirius himself. Goblet of Fire also gets a nice little Age Line for anyone /over/ 18. And fifth year... well, theres where my story starts. And yes, Harry (or Poppy, as this is a fem!Harry) has nothing to do but be a student and merely gets this all from the sidelines.
