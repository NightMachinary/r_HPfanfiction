To make kids heroes, you gotta dumb down the adults. Death Eaters, the Ministry, and the Order were all paragons of incompetence.

Dumbledore, as the leader of the Order, had to be made incompetent and ineffective, or else Harry and Co would never get their chances to shine.

Those kinds of plot are of course fine for teens and children, but as adults looking back at them, we no longer feel satisfied.

Since we are unwilling to attack JKR, her characters in the Books, Dumbledore predominantly, get the bash instead.
