My headcanon is that Dumbledore wanted to Destroy all horcruxes so that Riddle didn't know they were gone and toss him in prison. When he did eventually reconstitute--Long after Harry had died of natural causes, killing that horcrux as well--then Riddle would die from anyone fighting him, breaking the prophecy that he didn't truly believe in but knew Riddle did.

But Dumbledore's shite choices caused Harry to fulfill the self-fulfilling prophecy.
