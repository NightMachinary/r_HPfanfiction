There's probably a difference between actually being arrogant and coming off as being arrogant. I don't think Jo wrote Hermione as arrogant, especially after Harry and Ron befriend her. Draco is actually arrogant; Hermione is socially retarded and tries way too hard to impress professors and the like, which often backfires and makes other students think she's arrogant, but isn't meant to be.

That being said, there are a hell of a lot of fics where she's arrogant as all shite.
