Honest question I've gotten 2 or 3 chapters into this before, I assume Ginny is introduced later on in the story since the characters I remember were Harry, Neville and a female OC. Is Ginny pro Harry or on the magical side. I've been meaning to get back into the story but stories with "bad" Ginny usually get me to stop reading.
