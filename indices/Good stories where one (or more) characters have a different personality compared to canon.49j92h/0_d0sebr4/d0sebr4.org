I've seen very few fics with a competent Draco. In canon, he's just a little arrogant twatwaffle with delusions of grandeur. Linkffn(an old and new world).

My favorite take on Hermione comes from jeconias' Blue Steel. The fic is a bit devoid of meaningful conflict and most all the characters are OOC, but it's still an enjoyable read. This Hermione feels like what canon should have been to me. I almost universally despise fanon Hermione, and I'm not too fond of canon's version either. This one hits it just right.
