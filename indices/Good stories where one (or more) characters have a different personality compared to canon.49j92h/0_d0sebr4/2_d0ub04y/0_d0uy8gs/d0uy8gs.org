Her flaws are different (maybe a strength or two too), making for an overall more likeable character, imo.

I'm having a hard time phrasing this, but I guess the best way to put it is that the Hermione in this fic is more relaxed or "loosened up". The arrogance has gone away, and the nagging tone has changed from annoying to affectionate. She never really seemed to grow/change/mature in canon to me, just like Harry didn't really either. This is like what I think her personality should have become by 6th/7th year, so while I do think it's a bit early for the transformation, it is still more satisfying that the lack of growth in canon.
