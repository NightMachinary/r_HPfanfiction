Dobby ends up as the Boy Who Lived due to a time travel mishap. Goes back in time to save Harry from being cursed initially, however his extreme love for Harry, that transcends the bounds of rationality and reality, creates a time paradox in which Dobby's love overwhelms and "eats" Lily's (making her a sociopathic Dark Lady) and then protects Dobby from the Killing Curse because his level of love for Harry protects him, due to magic. Harry then starts to live with Dobby.
