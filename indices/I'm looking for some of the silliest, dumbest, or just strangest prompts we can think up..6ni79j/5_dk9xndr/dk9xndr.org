A story that starts as a generic time-travel fic but when ________ goes back in time they overshoot by 600ish years, so their soul tries to latch on to the only person that could live long enough to kill Voldemort (or whatever) - Nicolas Flamel, but they get absorbed into the Philosopher's stone instead and spend 600 years trapped in a Gringotts vault as a rock.

Another idea is basically one of those self insert fics where someone from the real world whose read the books is sacked into the HP world, but with more than one person being sucked in. Bonus points if everyone has conflicting goals - for example one person who tries to stick to Canon, one person who tries to solve everything , one who tries to mess everything up as much as possible, one who tries to resurrect Voldemort to gain power etc. Essentially, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers]]) but with self inserts.
