Here's a ridiculous idea. Starts during Easter holidays of second year.

Harry sees Hermione get petrified, researches all of the creatures that can petrify. Assumes it was a Gorgon, and immediately hares off to Magical Greece. (More on Greece later) Ron, when he gets back to school, starts looking for his friend, discovers he left for Greece, but never sees it written down.

Ron starts asking students about "Greece" but finds the one kid who likes musicals and musical theatre. He is told that Grease is on Broadway, so Ron leaves and tries to find Harry in New York City. Ron doesn't even think about the country because magical Greece has been under a travel blockade from the ICW for four hundred years.

Meanwhile, Harry finds out that Magical Greece is fully run by magical creatures rather than wizards, hence the wizard-centric travel ban. He then finds himself forcibly apprenticed to the Oracle of Delphi since he is the first person to come into Greece in centuries who has in any way studied Divination - since he chose it as an elective for the next year (edit). Harry will now have to spend the rest of his life making up his divination homework.

Hermione gets left in Hogwarts after the school is abandoned due to the monster attacks. Twenty five years later, Ron is fabulously wealthy, a leading star on Broadway, and meets up with Gilderoy Lockhart in a Famous Wizards convention, which prompts him to decide to return to Britain with him to try to finally figure out what happened to his sister.

I dunno, imagining Ron as a musical theatre kid who is as foppish as Lockhart would amuse me.
