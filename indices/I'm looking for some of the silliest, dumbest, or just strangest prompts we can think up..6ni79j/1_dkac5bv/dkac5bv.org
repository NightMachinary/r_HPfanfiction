During 5th year when fudge tries to arrest Dumbledore, Dumbledore after stunning everyone in his office sends Harry off with fawkes to be trained by some friends from wwII. Dumbledore then polyjuices himself to look like Harry and takes his place in school. They use Dobby and the penisieve so Harry can commute to his classes.

Dumbledore has no idea what he signed up for, it's been a long time since he was truly a student and now he has to socialize, run the DA (who's name he first thought was charming but in actuality it's a little overwhelming seeing all these children gearing up for a war that shouldn't be their problem) and deal with his long time friends as a position of an inferior instead of an equal for the first time. He would have to deal with Umbrige from Harry's position and we could see how the author thinks Dumbledore thinks Harry would act, versus how we know Harry would. It could be very telling about how Dumbledore sees Harry and his actions as Harry could change over time as he gets to know him more by walking in his shoes.

Meanwhile we can flash over to Harry learning gritty details that he thought he was ready for intellectually but finding the reality of things to be a bit difficult, and the old soldiers and warriors can help with his ptsd and anger issues, largely avoiding angst harry.
