Alright, I've got one; Harry goes back in time to the era of the Founders of Hogwarts, only to discover that they aren't all they're cracked up to be.

Decent folk yes, but their real accomplishments, all the school development and spell theory and whatnot, really came from muggleborn friends of theirs; because British purebloods in the future didn't want to credit muggleborns with the creation of Hogwarts, they claimed the Four Founders had done it all themselves.

Naturally, Harry decides to take this opportunity to right this pureblood mania before it starts and ensure credit goes where credit deserves. But, in a plot twist that's never been done before in Harry Potter fanfiction, this ends up changing the names of the houses at Hogwarts when he returns to his own time! Shock!

--------------

Or, in the same vein...some pureblooded nincompoop, tired of all the muggleborns and their culture and their innovativeness and equal rights and whatnot, goes back in time to help Salazar Slytherin ensure that muggleborns stay out of Hogwarts.

Have fun imagining how the wizarding world breaks itself when it only has pureblooded nincompoops in charge.
