How about a Bloodborne crossover? Six year old Harry Potter was diagnosed with an incurable disease, so Petunia, despairing at the approaching death of Lily's son, takes him to Yharnam for blood ministration. Six years later, in the Chamber of Secrets, he prepares to fight the basilisk by taking some Beast-Blood Pellets and using bolt paper on the Sword of Gryffindor. Alternatively, terrifying Madam Pomfrey with the plethora of eyes on the inside of his brain, due to large amounts of Insight. Obviously crack.
