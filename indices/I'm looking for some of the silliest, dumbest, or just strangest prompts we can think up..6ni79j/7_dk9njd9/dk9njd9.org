Something I've never seen: Harry gets sorted into Gryffindor but is a bit more of a 'lad'. Doesn't hang out with Ron because he a bit pathetic, Hermione because she's an annoying know-it-all or Neville because he's shy and instead hangs out with Dean, Seamus, Lavender and Parvati who, as far as I can tell, are about the only people in his year that are never portrayed as his closest friends in fanfiction.
