Here's one: a day before the full moon, a muggle man on a backpacking trip stumbles upon a sickly, starving woman on the woods. Persuaded to help her by his fellow backpackers, the man is bitten by the woman who turns out to be a werewolf! Although aurors are quick to show up (previously trailing her), detain the woman, and obliviate the backpackers, the protagonist finds himself separated from everyone due to the chaos. In pain, lost, with no supplies, and having just witnessed the impossible, the protagonist attempts to seek some way out of the woods with a crazed determination, but the aurors want to stop him. The story then continues in a Rambo-like style, with hunters and hunted shifting at at a moments notice.
