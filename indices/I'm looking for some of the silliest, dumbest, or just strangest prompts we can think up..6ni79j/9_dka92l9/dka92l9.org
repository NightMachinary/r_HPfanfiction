Merlin reincarnates as Harry Potter. There was a Prophecy before he was born that said the he will kill dark lord. It also said that he will be equal to Dark Lord. Someone hears this prophecy and assumes Harry Potter will become Dark Lord. So they orchestrate events which will result in Harry and Voldermort dying at each others hand.

Harry had no memory o his previous life. He is so powerful that he doesn't even need to learn any battle spells except expelliarmus. In the final battle Harry kills dark lord with disarming spell.
