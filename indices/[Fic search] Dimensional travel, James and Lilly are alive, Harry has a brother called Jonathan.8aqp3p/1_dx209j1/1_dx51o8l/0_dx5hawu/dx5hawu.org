Its really really good, though with a lot of angst, imagine a more emotionally unbalanced Harry meeting himself (though older) and his parents from another dimension that haven't had any break during the war. Combined with AU Harry's problems and his sister (which I forgot her name, but I'm pretty sure its flower-related) and 2 Voldemorts and a suspicious Dumbledore against him. Though its mentioned abuse, its mild compared to most fanon. The most interesting thing is the relationship between Canon Harry and AU James, and Canon Harry and Canon Sirius. Its been a while since the last update, but the author haven't abandoned, and he responds to reviews, which is nice. IMO, is worth. IF you want another fic, though this one is A METRIC FUCKTON Dark , there's linkffn(Imprisioned Realm) which is fantastic but really really dark, with a lot of graphical analysis(medical reports) of rape and torture (on Harry) and its generally angst-filled, but not in the teenage emo-way. Real heavy shit. If you can stomach that, you'll get a fan-fucking-tastic fanfiction, which is about 2 chapters to ending.
