The author said that he purposely ignores anachronism for humor reasons. This story is perfect if you only want to laugh, but you'll be really disappointed if you expected a serious story. I have to say this story has in my opinion some of the funniest scenes you will see in fanfic and i would advise anyone to give it a try at least to the second task
