You made me immediately think of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press]]) . I think there's some more stories like this in which Harry just tells everyone to just shove-off.

While I take issue with many indie!Harry tropes, any story in which he doesn't cooperate in this insane tournament has a special place in my heart. You're being forced to fight in a deadly tournament against your will, the least you could do is not to obediently dance for your puppet masters when they tell you. "Oh, a weighing of the wands and taking pictures? How fancyful. How about, no?"
