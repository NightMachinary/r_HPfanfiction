shameless *self-rec* here. linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)

Don't know if you're interested as it's a wip and the pairing is Harry with male!Death. Premise: Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it. Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.

Some additional info: Basically, MoD!Harry get's influenced by Death and slowly turns dark, though he starts out rather grey already. I've put a bit of focus on Dumbledore's manipulative side as to justify some resentment Harry displays. He's not a dark Lord, more indy!Harry. I've got a few clich√© tropes in there but it isn't my intention to delve too much into them.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/30/]]) Dreams and Darkness Collide. Serial Killer Harry, Minister Tom Riddle. Features, mindgames, bad ppl being killed, Kingsley as head of Aurors and an opposing force, Tomarry. (Discontinued? Ifk can be read as open ending though)

I'm currenly also following some *WIPs*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26949952][Fine Line]] Harry stumbles over the Diadem!Horcrux while he hides the book of the Half-Blood Prince, which possesses him. So basically he's got Tom Riddle (in his 20s) in his head, who of course follows his own agenda but corrupts Harry alongside the way. Eventual Tom Riddle/Harry Potter

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278][If Them's the Rules]] Not quite dark Harry but soo good. Love the worldbuilding and characzerizations. Very on point. WIP Eventual Tomarry

Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15558741][Choices]] Harry Potter's choices have always been restricted to almost nothing. After learning that he is the subject of a prophecy, he wants desperately to be able to choose something for himself - even if he knows it's the wrong choice.
