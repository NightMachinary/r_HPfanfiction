Summary: Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

Harry and Draco both get sent back in time and work together to stop Voldemort. Not exactly what you're looking for, but I remember it being a fairly good read. NOT slash.
