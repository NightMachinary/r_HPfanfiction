The [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48618][Rewritten in Time]] series is pretty decent. I've only read the first one but it's promising so far. The first part sticks a little bit closely to the first book (although the author did say they realized it was a problem and takes steps to change that in the later chapters), and there's an OC that I don't quite like, but she's generally taken out of the picture after the first few chapters. I'd definitely recommend it, at least "Regrets Collect Like Old Friends".
