I'm using Scrivener this nano because I feel like it's fitting my work style really well right now.

I like having chapters as folders and then scenes within those. I'll typically have 3-4 "scenes" per chapter I think. They may all happen the same day, one chapter spans a few weeks according to my rough outline. It makes it feel more manageable - I can sit and just write one scene and that's cool!

I also really like the option to "compile" it and view either the whole chapter or whole fic all in one doc.

I like having separate areas for characters (I have a handful) so I can quickly refer back, like "shit what was so and sos job again?"

For this fic too I have a bunch of stuff all ready to go in my research area too. An outline, a thing full of inspiring quotes, a whole file with references for a character's detailed tattoo. I have one just for things I'd like to include but that don't fit super well into the outline. (Like, "x and y have a conversation about z" - I outline roughly so that doesn't work, usually just a sentence or two per scene/chapter, but I'll check back to this doc every once in a while to see "oh yeah! I want this to happen where can I make it work?")

Yes, I could probably do all this in google docs. But having it all conveniently in once place, being able to switch back and forth a lot? That's really useful for me and I've really enjoyed it in the planning stages so I'm going to stick with it for now!
