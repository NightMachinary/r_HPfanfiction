I normally use [[http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter5.html][yWriter]] (since it's free) for the writing and organizing of scenes/chapters. I use OpenOffice's version of Excel for my timelines and lists. And plain old Notepad for ideas and prompts because I don't need all the extras for what is basically scratch paper.

I did download the trial that Scrivener is running for NaNoWriMo [[http://literatureandlatte.com/nanowrimo.php][here]], and about the only feature I like that yWriter doesn't have is the corkboard. Still don't know which program I'll be writing in tomorrow.
