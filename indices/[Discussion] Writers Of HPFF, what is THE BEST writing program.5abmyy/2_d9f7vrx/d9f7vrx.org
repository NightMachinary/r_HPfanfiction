Depends on what your needs as a writer are. Personally I am partial to yWriter when it comes to stories and Word when it comes to things of other kind (wrote a few user's manuals in it), as well as Notepad++ for random notes and simple things like patch notes; that said, there are a plethora of other programs (and not only programs) that one can use.

So, rather than it being about what is good or better or the best, it's about what you happen to like the most for your writing.
