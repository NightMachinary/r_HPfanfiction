As a beta, I love Google Docs; I can pick up a story on my phone, which makes me more prompt than my laptop, which I would reserve for a line-by-line parsing for mechanics later in the process. Authors can have conversations with me about an individual word, and it makes for a deeper, more productive dialogue between us.

I also like how easy it is to flip the screen to black; more than one author uses this visual difference to see errors pop. Others tell me having Google read their work aloud is helpful.

(I will never give up on a notebook. I'm currently using a homemade traveler's notebook with a stack of Moleskines and a sharp Blackwing pencil, which is too expensive for a repeat purchase, but the eraser is glorious. Not like you asked, but anyway.)
