Google Docs. I mean, I don't think you really need much beyond the ability to type, make bold, italic and underline, which almost all word processors can do. So beyond that the main factor for me is convenience, and the Cloud nature of Google Docs makes it extremely convenient. You can pick up your work wherever you are.
