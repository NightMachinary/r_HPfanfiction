I personally use QuollWriter for all of my writing and planning - it's free, it's open source, and it allows me to use numerous tabs, as well as being able to look at statistics. Statistics and tabs are my twin passions.

For planning I also use GoogleKeep, which is Google's online post-it note app. It's great for jotting down and organising snatches of dialogue or ideas.
