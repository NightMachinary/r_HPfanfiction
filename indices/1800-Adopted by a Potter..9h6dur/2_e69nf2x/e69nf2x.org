Harry adopts a witch he gets acquainted with during his "8th" in Hogwart. He doesn't adopts her immediately but a bit later when the girl's family (grandparents) gets unable to take care of her anymore. Bit of an old canon post DH fic and the adoption wasn't the main theme of the story. Part of an ongoing (if really slow updates) series.
