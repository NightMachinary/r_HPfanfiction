Not sure this is what you're looking for, but it has a great HP/Flamels dynamic. I'm pretty sure it features a fully grown Harry Potter dimension traveling, and the Flamels become technical guardians, but they're more equals. If I remember correctly the Flamels also fit all your details. Be warned though, it's pretty good and has a nice length, but it's unfinished and the last update was in 2013. It's at the top of my "please update" fics actually.
