I really don't believe in this trope of immortality making people not care about anything. We all know that we and everybody we know is going to die, and even really old people who have seen lots and lots of friends die care about their remaining friends or grandkids. And for every death immortals would see, they'd also see that much more life, so I just don't think they'd somehow become numb and uncaring. Maybe some might, but not in general.

The idea is plausible enough for a premise, in any case, and fresh.
