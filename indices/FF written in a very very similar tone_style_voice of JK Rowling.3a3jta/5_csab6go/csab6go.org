The three fics that I consider the best at preserving the spirit of the books --- particularly the early books --- are linkffn(Weasley Girl by Hyaroo) and its sequel, linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpont), and linkffn(In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life by SilverWolf7007).

Others that are good at whimsy include linkffn(Harmless and Easily Domesticated by Angie Astravic), linkffn(Time on my Side by Mark Geoffrey Norrish), linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss), and linkffn(Compound Interest by Cillit Bang Bang).
