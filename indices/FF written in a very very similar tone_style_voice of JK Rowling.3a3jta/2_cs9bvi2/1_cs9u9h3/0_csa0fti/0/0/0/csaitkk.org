I find it stylistically and tone-wise to be in keeping with the first half of the HP books which were unashamedly childrens books. It's far more expansive and silly about magic and the sport dragons fill out the same role as the Midnight Barking in 101 Dalmations. Since the fic is Petunia-centric and about her torrid affair with magic and taking things in stride, it takes quite a few of the fanfic cliches and focuses them on her instead, eg, the aforementioned weird inheritance and a reverse-harem. There are a couple of other plotlines central to the story as well like their ancestral family's feud with TMR which will predictably culminate with Harry but Petunia is trying her best as a reponsible adult to circumvent the prophecy. The chapters tend to be short so I feel that counters the 100+ chapter count.
