D: My curse-thought to be joking when I'm serious and serious when I'm joking. I have a junk sense of humor! In this case, I'm serious. It's been awhile since I read it, so I don't have many specifics (is that the joke? I didn't "accurately describe" it?).

The premise of the story was interesting and I was initially curious to see where it went. However, it became more ridiculous as it went on with cartoonish talking dragons, previously hidden family, mansions, Weasley-esque twins, unexpected parentage, becoming an Animagus too easily, etc. To be honest, I would have loved it when I was twelve! I'd say it's worth trying, but not forcing yourself to complete it.
