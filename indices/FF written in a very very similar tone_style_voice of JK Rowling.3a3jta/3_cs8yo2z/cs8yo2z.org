Ooh. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is incredible. It is quite whimsical at times, but it is not pure comedy, and does, in fact, have poignant moments.

linkffn(Forging the Sword) is also a really good one, and keeps with the Hogwarts arc while being incredibly engaging. A bit dark, though - something more along the lines of what you would expect from the last two-three books Rowling wrote.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone) *would be my top pick in this category.* Rowling's voice and style is emulated well, but there is much more focus on Harry's personal development. It can be whimsical, it can be sad, it can be surprisingly poignant at time, and it's a great read.
