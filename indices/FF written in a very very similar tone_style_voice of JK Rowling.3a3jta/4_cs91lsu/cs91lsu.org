Linkffn(hermione granger and the goblet of fire) linkffn(dumbledore's army and the year of darkness)

I love both of these. Obviously neither of them are perfect, but I think they do a great job of exploring the universe that jkr created without going into a whole new genre. The other thing that stands out to me about these fics is that we're pretty much following one narrator, which is a major feature of the cannon. Fics like linkffn (innocent) are great and have good tone, but the inclusion of so many more narrators gives a very different feel to the story.

Can you link me the James fic you liked?
