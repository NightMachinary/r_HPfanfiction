No, "canon" has no agreed upon definition in the HP fandom. In general it is, to quote Wikipedia

#+begin_quote
  [...] the material accepted as officially part of the story in the fictional universe of that story
#+end_quote

And depending on the person what is accepted goes beyond just the book.

For example (in no particular order):

- The biggest Harry Potter wiki accepts Pottermore as canon, and also the movies, Cursed Child, the three additional books (Quidditch through the ages, ...) and much more
- [[/u/Taure]] considers basically everything created by JKR herself (including interviews and tweets) as canon, but in a hirarchial manner, but choses to (for example) ignore the movies.
- The [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/canon/][HP Lexicon]] works pretty similar, with only small differences.

With that, three of the best sources in this fandom *all* opt for "Pottermore is canon". Sure, a lot of fans don't consider it canon - and that shows in my downvotes - but in general, I'll stand by my words that "Written by JKR" is canon by word of god.

Sure, feel free to disagree with me on specifics - but your statement is wrong.
