You can certainly make that your own barometer for determining what's canon but it's ridiculous to imply that's the only method or the correct one. The books also contain contradictions and plot holes that JKR obviously wouldn't have done intentionally but by your standard we have to accept the contradictions and such as canon, no if ands or buts.
