It definitely depends on when the birthday is- and perhaps blood status. In Hermione's case, for example, her birthday is 19 September. Which means that if she got her letter on her 11th birthday, it would have been nearly a whole year before she started attending. Could you imagine expecting an 11 year old child to go to muggle school after learning that magic is real? I think it's more likely that she may have been informed early Summer - perhaps around the time that Harry would have been receiving his?

I think that this happens because Harry receiving his letter on his birthday was dramatic and memorable. People kind of gloss over the fact that he'd been receiving letters for weeks, but the Dursleys weren't letting him read them. But think about it from a logistics perspective. The letters aren't just letters of acceptance; they also act as equipment lists for things that must be bought for school; uniforms, books, wands, potions supplies, everything that they might need. Take it to the extreme youngest that a student can be in a year at Hogwarts: turning 11 on 31 August- the day before the school year starts. It'd be unreasonable to expect that such a student purchase their items the same day that they receive their letters, and leave the next day.
