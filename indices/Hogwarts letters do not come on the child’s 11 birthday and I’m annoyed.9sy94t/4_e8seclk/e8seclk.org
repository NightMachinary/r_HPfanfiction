It was one week before his birthday, but yes. And some years, the letters didn't come until August because the book lists weren't finalized. In second year, it was about a week after Harry's birthday, and in fifth year, the letters didn't come until August 31 because there was no Defence Professor until Umbridge was appointed, and /everyone/ had to scramble at the last minute. It has nothing to do with birthdays.

Unfortunately, as [[/u/m777z][u/m777z]] pointed out, JKR made a couple of statements about letters coming on people's birthdays, apparently by mistake, and it stuck.
