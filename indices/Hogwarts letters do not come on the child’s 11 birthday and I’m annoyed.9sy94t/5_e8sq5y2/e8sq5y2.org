Can I also add 'equipment lists signed by Lucinda Thompsonicle-Pocus' to the pile of complaints

There is no such person in canon. There is no such office as Chief Attendant of Witchcraft Provisions in canon. Having her sign the equipment list first year screams 'I copied the letter off the Wiki and haven't reread canon'.

The source for that person/office/signature is the now defunct harrypotter.warnerbros.org and since the page in question is no longer available even via the wayback machine, I have no idea why it was created. So basically it's bullshit which the Wiki has decided to use as a source for reasons beyond my ken.
