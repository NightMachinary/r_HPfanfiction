I had to check the thing, and WTF? This one is worse on the canon scale than Cursed Child, as Rowling did not declare Warner Bros's fanfic ideas to be canon.

  So basically it's bullshit which the Wiki has decided to use as a source for reasons beyond my ken.

They have a history of doing that. If you check the compiled history part of the page for basically anything that if referenced in some weird way by some rather non-canon thing (such as the video games), you'll find that on that one particular wiki it does not make a difference and they just throw it all into the blender. It's the one reason why people concerned about making stuff canon recommend not ever looking at it and instead using the lexicon.
