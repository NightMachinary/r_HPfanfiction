For sure. I just meant that at least students who have parents who went to Hogwarts would at least have some guidance even if they didn't have their letter yet, whereas muggleborn students not only need that equipment list but also need time to accept that there's this whole other world that they're a part of. No decent parent would get a letter saying “hey, accept that your kid is this thing you've never believed in and send them to a boarding school literally tomorrow” and go “yeah okay, sounds reasonable.”

But yes, the birthday-letter setup would have been horribly thought out if that was the case in canon. As it stands, it's just a coincidence that Harry's letter coincided with his birth month.
