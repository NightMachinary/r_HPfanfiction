*The Serpensortia Series*

Just an AU where Harry isn't entirely clued up on the houses and doesn't meet Ron quite as quickly as in the books. So he has no qualms when the hat suggests Slytherin. Nothing crazy, just a different sort of life.

I really liked how Harry was wrote, he very much just came across as a clueless child. His reaction to the hat suggesting Slytherin is literally /Um, fine? Anything's fine, really. Um. Thank you?/
