[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/431269][Saturdays are for Football (The Rest of the Week is for Everything Else)]] linkao3(431269) is a really unique post-war fic, featuring two less common characters (Dean Thomas and Blaise Zabini).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3366683][the war is over and we are beginning.]] linkao3(3366683) is also a post-war fic, this time with Andromeda.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10799454][Dulce et decorum est]] linkao3(10799454) is very short, but an excellent Dumbledore character study.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5354324][Reindeer Games]] linkao3(5354324) is a silly James/Lily fic, just in time for Christmas, and I find it hilarious that any fic could get jossed by /The Tales of Beedle the Bard./
