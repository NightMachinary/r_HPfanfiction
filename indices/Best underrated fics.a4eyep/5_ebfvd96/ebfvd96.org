*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1048010/chapters/2096059][Holly at Hogwarts]]*

It's a next generation series focusing on Dudley's daughter Holly going to Hogwarts in the same year as Albus.

It's one of my top favorite post-canon series of all time, mostly because it manages to stay close enough to canon to feel authentic, while at the same time introducing enough new and original ideas to recapture that feeling of wonder and discovery you get from reading the books for the first time, which is something that is usually missing from stories focusing on the children of any of the canon couples.

It's also currently sitting at just 55 kudos which is positively criminal.
