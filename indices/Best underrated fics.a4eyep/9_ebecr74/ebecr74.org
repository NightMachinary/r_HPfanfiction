I definitely have to say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12858961/1/The-Sparrow-Suite][The Sparrow Suite]] by Red Garden Gnome. It's a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger story about the two of them taking up teaching posts at Hogwarts a year or two after the war (him Care of Magical Creatures and she Defense Against the Dark Arts). This story is different due to the fact Charlie and Hermione hate each other at the beginning of the story. Most stories involving them having them hooking up and having hardcore sex in Chapter 1. But their personalities are more drawn out here and explored. It's told from Charlie's POV. It's my favorite story involving them.
