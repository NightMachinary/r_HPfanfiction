11. Harry's brand new custom wand has a core combination that the wand maker (usually some shady guy in Knockturn alley) has never seen before and those cores help with transfiguration and charms and defence and enhance the flavors of the meals in the great hall but none of these bonuses will ever be mentioned again. Besides, Harry's so good at everything that he could have used dragon-poop for a core and still gotten the same results.

I have a plot bunny in my mind where Harry is attuned to each and every core/wood that the wandmaker has and his custom wand ends up being the size of an actual tree. Too powerful to use and too big to wield.
