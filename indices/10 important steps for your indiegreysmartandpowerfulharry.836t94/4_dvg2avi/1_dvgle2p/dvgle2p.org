That one reminds me of a spoof I've seen in some fic where Harry's magic got so strong that no wand could actually channel his magic, so he got a repurposed and remodelled pencil from Ollivander. His wand was thus some random wood, with a core of graphite.

On the other hand, the whole thing was a parody so ... yeah.
