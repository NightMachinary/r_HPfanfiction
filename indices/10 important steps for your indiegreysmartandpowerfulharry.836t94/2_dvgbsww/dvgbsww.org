You also need an entry for where it turns out that that harpy Hermione had been spying on him for Dumbledore all this time (because he told her to, and she can't disobey authority), and so he finds a different, better woman. Maybe it's Daphnie "Ice Queen" Greengrass, a scion of a "neutral" pureblood family, because no commoner woman is good enough; or maybe he needs one who is magically unique (Tonks) or magically beautiful (Fleur).
