The best way to achieve a truly "light" Harry is for good adult guys to become competent and prevent throwing kids to the wolves.

Examples of such fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione time travel to her two years old self. She tells Dumbledore the necessary intel, who takes things from there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): 21 years old Ginny time travels back 10 years, fixes up things efficiently and almost painlessly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): Competent UK government and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort. The Trio only has to help a little on the Horcrux hunt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore takes the Basilisk more seriously, and solved the canon plot with Amelia Bones. It's very refreshing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Harry is raised by his loving, BAMF archeologist aunt, Dr Evans. Although Harry has to pitch in a few times, Petunia, Sirius, Bill, Fleur, and Dumbledore have done most of the heavy lifting against Voldemort.
