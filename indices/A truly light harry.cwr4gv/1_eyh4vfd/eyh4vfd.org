Canon Harry cast two out of three Unforgivables, and I suspect he would have been quite capable of casting the third, better than he was with the torture curse.

What about Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres? He's not everyone's favourite person, certainly, but he tries very hard to live ethically, stands firmly against bullying, would never cast Unforgivables, and wants to make the whole world better.
