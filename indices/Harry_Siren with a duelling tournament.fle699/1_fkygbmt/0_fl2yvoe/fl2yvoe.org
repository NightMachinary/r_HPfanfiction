I kinda like this trope.

It becomes so casual that most people are like "wtf is wrong with you" when they find out.

Harry goes to the edge of the cursed lake, just out of a (practiced) arms reach of her.

She greets him, and playfully asks if he's going to come closer so she can 'hug him'.

He just rolls his eyes and, for the millionth time, says "no", despite her pouting.

He then tosses her a sandwich from the local shop ('notSubway*cough*') and they casually chat about things, as per routine.

When a friend comes with him, he casually says, "don't get too close, or she'll drag you in, drown you, and eat your face".

"It's true," she says unabashedly, munching on her ham and rye.
