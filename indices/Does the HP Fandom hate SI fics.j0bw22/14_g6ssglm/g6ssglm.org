I actually love SI fics. But theres barely any well written ones out there. Some people seem to think since its a self insert, naturally you should be using 1st person narrative. Please. Don't. SI is the premise, it shouldn't govern the whole structure of the story you know? Somewhere out there, theres probably a heap of well written first person stories, but from what ive seen theyre all shit. 3rd perspective is the best
