SI fics are fun conceptually but they're difficult to pull off, mainly because most of them start exactly the same way. The SI will go from "Oh no I fell into my book" or "gosh darn my TV sucked me into this universe" to "ohmygoshitsmyfavecharacter" and after the billionth time it gets pretty annoying. Just watch out for pitfalls like that and you'll be fine.
