Just give them some dimension and they'll be fine. A lot of SIs lack faults in their characters. Like if they're really good at dueling, then make them bad at potions or give them a horrible temper or make them a snob. My SI is a terrible duelist she makes up for it with runes/rituals and relies on other characters as hype men.
