Harry Potter is so central to the setting that is dificult to diviate from it, you dont see many SIs but there are many SI! Harry and Hermione fics.

The most important thing is really making it interesting and for that you need conflict.

SI frees Sirius during third year, goachs about the SI and invs him for Christmas as thanks-> Harry recents SI because it was suposed to be Harry first year with his family and fells inadequade because he wasnt the one that saved him.

They dont even need to be friends in first place but now it kinda gives another dinamic to these two characters.
