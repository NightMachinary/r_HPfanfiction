It's also something that I think has to do with it being rather easy to solve the main big conflicts in Harry Potter with outside knowledge. I think other series lend themselves to good SI fanfic better than HP does. Like, look at Worm, any self insert has the problem of “well fuck, I'm in worn, doesn't matter that I know how to “win” it'll still be a massive struggle” or Star Wars, or Star Trek or A Song of Ice and Fire. The HP plot just makes it harder to write a si fic that is good.

Most HP SI fanfics I've read just tend to basically be a Peggy sue fanfic... but worse. The plot of speed run Voldermort kill is just done better in time travel fanfics and with characters people care about. The couple good ones I remember one didn't focus on fighting Voldemort and the other took place in the marauder era
