This is true for a SI in the 90s. However, we know very little about the Marauder-era, and the little we do know lends itself very little to trivial solutions. Sure, you might be able to hand Dumbledore early knowledge about the Horcruxes, but you wouldn't really solve everything that way, it would be nothing more than an advantage.
