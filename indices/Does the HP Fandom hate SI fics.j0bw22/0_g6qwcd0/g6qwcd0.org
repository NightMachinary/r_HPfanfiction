It's more the quality of the SI fics than the genre itself. SI fics, for most authors, tend to be wish-fulfillment fantasies. The bad authors run with the fantasy; the good authors know it's a fantasy and just treat it as writing practice, really. So, for the most part, SI fics just have a really low standard. That's not to say good SI fics don't exist, though.

I have a few low-hanging fruits for your SI: - Skip the â€˜oh no I'm in the Potterverse' scene. It contributes nothing. - Write from the POV of other characters. This tends to be fascinating, because we don't immediately know the consequences of the existence of a new character. - Please, for the love of God, don't have your character take Ancient Runes and discover something in three days that the Wizarding world couldn't figure out in hundreds of years.

I would be more than happy to read your fic once it's out. Shoot me a link!
