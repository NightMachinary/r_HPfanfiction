I can't speak for the fandom as a whole (but as a general rule, the story speaks louder than the subject, and most SI/OC fics tend to be bad), but personally I don't hate them, I will just never read them. I read fanfiction to read about the characters from Harry Potter, I really have no interest in the author as a character. I feel that way about most OCs as well, unless the author does a really great job grounding them in the universe.
