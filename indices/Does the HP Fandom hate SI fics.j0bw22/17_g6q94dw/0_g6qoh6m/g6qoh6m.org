A Curse of Truth is an excellent work from start to finish, with an excellent twist ending. Highly recommended.

+I found the writing is good up until about half-way (where I'm at) and then the storyline becomes very rushed. Also, there are religious parts that are a bit weird.+

edit: I was wrong. The fic I was thinking about was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695419/1/My-Gilded-Life][My Gilded Life]].
