SI is great in any era except the canon one in my opinion. because JKR doesn't leave much room for another main character at Hogwarts besides Harry so attempts to share the spotlight end up kinda blah... But there are writers who can make brilliant ones even then. I just think its a lot more fun to navigate the Marauders era with more interesting characters to play with and a lot more unknowns!
