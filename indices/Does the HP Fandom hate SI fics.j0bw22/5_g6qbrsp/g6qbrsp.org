The HP fandom has a very small amount of SI fics given its size compared to other fandoms like worm or naruto but they aren't necessarily hated just less prevalent for some reason.

I personally enjoy SI fics and think that they can be great if done right, my only problem is that a lot of the protagonists either become completely broken without any effort (which gets boring fast in a non-crack fic) or are extremely average which is strange as not only are most self inserts essentially adults amongst children but also tend to have near encyclopedic knowledge of the setting which makes a lack of motivation to learn any magic kind of jarring.
