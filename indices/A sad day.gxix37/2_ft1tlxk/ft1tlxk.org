Sorry to hear that. I hope you get them back.

That's one of the reasons I connect to my laptop and make a copy of my files every so often. It's also why i use a downloader and retrieve the story renaming it to include the number of chapters and the date of the last updated chapter. If the story is completed then the filename is just the story title.
