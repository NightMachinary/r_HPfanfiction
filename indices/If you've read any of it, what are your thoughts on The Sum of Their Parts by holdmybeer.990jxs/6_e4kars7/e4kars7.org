I'll quote myself from elsewhere:

  It has some major problems. First off, I thought that the prose, while serviceable, was rather plebian. Maybe I was spoiled by reading Circular Reasoning early in my fanfic days, but this lacked this X factor that would draw me in. I thought that the author wanted to paint a particular picture of a fairly crooked, bleak reality, but lacked the words to do it. The writing ties into the second issue.

  The big moments, when they happen, have no oomph. There are fics that left me feeling like I've just been punched in the face and it was awesome. There's none of that here. Oh, Harry's killing people now? Okay, I guess. Ah, his big Dark Lord coming out. Yaaawn. Something's missing. I believe that a part of getting across the impact of those "big" moments is setting up the atmosphere of the story's environment and, like I said, the author didn't succeed in that.

  The author had some cool ideas, but once they were introduced, they were handled badly, though not all. Walburga's portrait was a horcrux? AWESOME.

  But becoming a Dark Lord was run into the ground. Same with Occlumency. Harry can't learn it because of "Black madness". Cool. And then repeatedly "well I'm not super mad, but I got the recklessness". Things like Dark Lord being an actual legal thing, the stiff adherence to Hogwarts House stereotypes ("Gryffindor-Slytherin Dark Lord", oh for heaven's sake) made my blood boil every time they were brought up for ruining what had seemed in the beginning like a potentially good fic. I won't elaborate on the Ministry full of idiots and bigots, because there's no more juice to squeeze out of that nugget. Just blergh.

  I confess that I skipped chapters 9 and 10 because I was bored out of my skull and wanted to know if Harry's Dark Lord career ever gets anywhere. The finale in the Ministry was skippable. And then the timeskip happened.

  This, I think, is this fic's biggest fault. The author had an interesting idea for a story, but wrote all the wrong scenes. The story that should have been written is in that timeskip. How did things go from "grrrr, burn everything" to Harry being the Dark Lord of Britain? Everything interesting was skipped over. In effect, the story feels incomplete. There should have been another 100k words between "BURN THEM ALL" and the epilogue. Overall, terribly disappointing.
