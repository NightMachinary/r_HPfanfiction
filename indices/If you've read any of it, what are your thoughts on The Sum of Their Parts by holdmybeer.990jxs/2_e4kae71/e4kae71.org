It's great, however the ending is awful. I understand the author achieved what they desired in the scope of the story, but it left me with a sour impression.

Another thing I disliked as well, is the scene where Auror . DMLE turn up at Harry's house and he incinerates them etc. I think that was just outright silly, though it served the story as needed.
