Linkffn(warcaster) A Warmachine crossover. It is still in its early phase yet amazing action scenes and writing will keep you riveted and will make you read and reread the fic.

Linkffn(Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe) typical OP Potter with an Avengers crossover.

Linkffn(The Stormreaver) Warcraft crossover with Warlock!Harry. It might turn you off in the initial chapters yet good writing will keep you reading. A nice balance between the lore of HP and Warcraft.

Linkffn(Swords and Roses) not your typical GoT crossover where Potter is inserted as a Stark nor Lannister. He's a Tyrell here.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Whole New World: Rising from the Ashes) Titlegore. The writing is on par with the others and its also still in its early stages. Updates semi regularly and it is one of the few gems of the Warcraft crossover genre.

Linkffn(Ripples in the Force) starwars crossover starting with Phantom Menace. Good writing and lore of the series is well explored. Still in its early phases.

Linkffn(Death has no Master, but Life has Servants) Baratheon!Harry seldom updates and So-so writing. Early stages too.

Linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) the staple crossover. One of the most recommended too. Can't believe I havent seen it recommended yet in this thread.

Linkffn(The Alpha Wolf) Typical Stark!Indi!Harry

I have more if you want yet i think those are my choice picks for now.
