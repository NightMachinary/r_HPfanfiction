Warcraft crossover. Backstory is Voldemort was an agent of the Burning Crusade. Harry won. Now on Azeroth a Dreadlord screws up a summon and gets Harry.

As far as 'reasonable harems...' I haven't finished yet, but so far Harry has 2 night elves, 2 draenei, 2 dragons (including Onyxia) and Sylvanas appears to be joining the group.
