aw, I hate it when your favourites are abandoned. Mine might as well be :( Oh well, atleast he gave me good ideas for my story.

Thank you for your recommendations.

Prince of a Dark Kingdom. Well I don't know... I tried reading the first chapter but it just make me shake my head.

Personally I don't enjoy the way MoR has turned out. I liked it previously, but his "Harry" makes me cringe too much.

I will try out Butterfly Effect and Unspeakable things, and see if they are any good. I can't stand the disappointment of not knowing what will come when stories are abandoned.
