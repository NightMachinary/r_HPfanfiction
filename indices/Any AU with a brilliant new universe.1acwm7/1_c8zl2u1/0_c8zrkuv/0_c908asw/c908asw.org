Butterfly Effect is indeed spectacular... although it's not really AU in terms of creating a new universe {it's more AU in terms of plot and character development}. There's a lot to like if you can tolerate femmeslash and hurt/comfort.

Unspeakable Things is also very good. Better by far than the majority of Darth Marrs' other stuff.
