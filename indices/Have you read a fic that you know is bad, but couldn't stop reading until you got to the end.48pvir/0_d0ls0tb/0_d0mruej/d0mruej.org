Impossible for me. Interesting concept, believable beginning (I could imagine Uncle Vernon to drop off baby Harry at first wizarding establishment he finds) but it's just... incredibly long and boring.

There's no real threat for Gary Stu Harry and Mary Sue Hermione, and if there is, it's resolved in like 3 pages. Pretty much everybody is same, boring and OOC without any flaws (except few bashed characters like Ron and Dumbledore for example)

Only characters I liked and rooted for were Rookwood and Bellatrix. Don't know their fate since I gave up around 50-60%
