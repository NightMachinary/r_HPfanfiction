There's very few fics that I manage to read in their entirety to begin with. I'm fairly liberal in dropping a fic if it turns bad, or even if it turns boring, I'll start skimming to see if it picks up (usually doesn't). If I see a fic that is draco/hermione/scorpious, I wouldn't even pick it up to begin with, since there's almost no chance something like that can be good to begin with. And that 1% chance that it actually isn't, it isn't worth the mental agony of sifting through the other 99%.
