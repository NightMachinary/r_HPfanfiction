I'm sorry, what? Hermione bashing is so unbelievably common depending on what pairing you read. And if Harry/femHarry is a thing, why can't it be true for any other character? But besides that, just because you haven't personally read something doesn't mean it hasn't been written.

Accusing me of being high or not being able to tell reality from a dream simply because you lack imagination is incredibly stupid of you. However, if you were to say the author must have been high, I wouldn't be able to disagree with your opinion.

Hell, I once thought Mpreg was unbelievable until I started getting into slash. Now I believe it and really, /really/ hope I don't accidentally stumble upon one. Definitely not my cup of tea.
