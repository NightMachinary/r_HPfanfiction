I did this for genres. If you can call it that. Perhaps themes or tropes? I read almost every soul bond fic over 40k words, and same with oc/si. Well, I'm currently working my way through the oc/si.

I /love/ terribly written fanfics. If I can't make it past chapter three I get a perverse joy in it.
