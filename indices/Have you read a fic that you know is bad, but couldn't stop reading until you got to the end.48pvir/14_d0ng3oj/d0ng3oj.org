linkffn(5336173) The Ideal Daughter

The spelling is awful. (I'm not aloud, It's over their, your so wrong)

It's clear the author is working through some teenage issues...

Rose Weasley is sorted into Slytherin! (OH NOES!) Ron/Hermione take it poorly. As do the rest of the family. Rose decides to rebel, Rose starts smoking, drinking, sleeping with Scorpius and gets her belly button pierced. Ron/Hermione (after 5 years or so are coming around to her being a Slytherin) only to find out that she's dating a Malfoy! They immediately cast her out of the family! She responds with telling her parents all of the super-duper rebellious things she's done and leaves. She moves in with the super understanding Malfoys. Ron/Hermione only find this out 2 years later when they attend her graduation! (Because Ron/Hermione would totes not try to find out where their daughter was living...)

And something that drove me completely nuts, beyond the teenage angst plot line, was the author's lack of exposition. Scorpios was her best friend. Okay, so why? What did you do together? Did you bond over your love of gobstones? Did you fight a troll together? Did he teach you a really neat hex? We're the most popular people in the school! Why? You're a bunch of 4th years. You've done literally nothing of note. What made you the most popular? WHY DAMMIT WHY?

Given all of the above, for a teenage writer, I thought it was pretty impressive.
