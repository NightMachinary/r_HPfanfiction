THIS FIC. UGH. I HAVE SO MANY WORDS ABOUT THIS FIC. It's the one that turned me off of BDSM-themed fics for the rest of my life. I was tolerant of it, kind of digging it, for like the first five chapters, then I just kept reading and it kept getting more uncomfortable and when it came to a point where [[/spoiler][Snape basically asked her to stop being herself because he didn't want her to help Harry and Ron]], I had to stop it. I couldn't stand that. Sexually exploit Hermione Granger all you want, but don't [[/spoiler][strip her of her entire personality and being just for some sexual gratification]].

Also, I quit like halfway through, would you be willing to PM me a synopsis of what happens so I don't have to torture myself reading the rest?
