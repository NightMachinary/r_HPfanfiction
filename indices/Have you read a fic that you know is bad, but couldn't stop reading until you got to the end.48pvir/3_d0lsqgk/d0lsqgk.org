For the Potions Master's Amusement by snape.submission. I won't lie, the first few chapters are pretty interesting and hooked me. But then the BDSM shit comes out full force. I could barely read the last chapter of how much Snape resembled a hero from a romance novel. It was describing how buff and strong he was iirc. In its defense, it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.
