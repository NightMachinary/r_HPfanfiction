This is one of my guilty favorites as well. It has some interesting ideas interspersed in it that sort of mesh together to make a beautifully strange trainwreck you can't look away from. Honestly I feel like if the veela parts were taken away from this fic, it'd make a lot more sense; it'd still be a super!Harry trope, but at least then it'd be a much less complicated one.

Still an oddly okay fic for what it is though.
