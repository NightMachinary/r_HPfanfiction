*My Immortal* is the fic I struggled though, but couldn't stop reading. I first read/listened to a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdv6Q68EutU][dramatic reading]] of it on YouTube.

 

Some think the author is a troll, but I like to believe that Tara Gilesbie really was a teenager who loved My Chemical Romance and hated prepz.

 

The premise of the story is that a self-insert of Tara, named Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, who is a vampire that goes to Hogwarts in England. She has a best friend named Willow, a self-insert of Tara's friend, Raven/Jenny, who co-authored the story. Ebony and Draco are deeply in love but [[/spoiler][Ebony finds out Draco and Vampire are both bisexual and sex addicts]] which turns their relationship into a love triangle with a few other characters thrown in. Tara and Raven had a falling out, so Willow was written off by [[/spoiler][being expelled, murdered by Hermione, and raped by Lupin. Yes, in that order]]
