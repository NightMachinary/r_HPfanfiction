Yeah...

I think that story had potential but there are some critical flaws.

1. Move the earlier smut to later years. 11 year old children engaging in oral sex is right at the top of my "why the fuck is that here" list.

2. If Harry and Hermione are going to be uber-intelligent and deceiving at least pick decent opponents. Just stop being friends with the Weasley's if you don't like them. You are already memory charming the shit out of Ron anyways.

3. Some more world building for years 1-4. So much critical stuff occurred in those books, it is criminal to neglect that time period in fanfic.
