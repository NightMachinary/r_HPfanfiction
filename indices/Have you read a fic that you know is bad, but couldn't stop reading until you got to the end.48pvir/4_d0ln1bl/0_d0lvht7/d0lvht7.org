So, reading through this right now, I'm seeing a lot of OOC, which I personally don't mind, unless it's used to make a character functionally retarded (in this case it's Ron), cringy and awkward dialogue, and... I don't know, there's something else that's bothering me. Can't quite put my finger on what.

The prose is like a 6/10--barely passable by normal book standards, but for fanfiction, it's okay.

But I also feel like I have to finish it, if only because it paints Dumbledore in a good light, which is a once in a blue moon event for all the HP/HG, "here's-how-it-really-went" fics.

Flash edit: ah, fuck. Arrived at the first smut scene minutes after posting this.

Double edit: this is getting much worse at a rapid pace. I don't know if I can continue.
