[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] is an /amazing/ Hermione/Bellatrix story that basically converted me to the ship. It has two short sequels: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9978601/1/A-Good-Elf][A Good Elf]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10487189/1/As-The-Pendulum-Swings][As The Pendulum Swings]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118152/1/The-Scientist][The Scientist]] is an ongoing Hermione/Narcissa story that's reasonably good so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7850423/1/Five-flavours-Katie-Bell-likes-and-two-she-doesn-t][Five Flavours Katie Bell Likes and Two She Doesn't]] is a wonderful little Katie/Alicia vignette.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3357118/1/Come-Fly-With-Me][Come Fly With Me]] is one of the oldest wonderfully written Katie/Alicia vignettes that's around - it's from 2007.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/107440][Two's Company]] is yet another Katie/Alicia Vignette on AO3.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8315000/1/Elysium][Elysium]] is a good short Hermione/Lily story.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/970216/chapters/1905703][Snapshots in Serendipity]] is a cute little Hermione/Luna story on AO3.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/897183][The Letter]] is another story from AO3, and it's a wonderfully angsty piece of Hermione/Ginny.
