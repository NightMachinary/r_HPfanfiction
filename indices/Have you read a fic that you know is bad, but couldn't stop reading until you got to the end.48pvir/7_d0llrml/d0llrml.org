"Written In The Body", a Hermione/Ginny fic I only read for the pairing. I was just getting into femslash, and I knew the writing was clunky and the plot was a bit forced, but I read till the end just because I liked the pairing and there wasn't much out there. I tried re-reading it recently and it was /painful/.
