Likely blood loss, but that's mostly because it was a more immediate problem. Had someone been around to heal the wound itself, he'd probably have died from the poison. Then again, the poison mostly seems to have been some sort of aggressive anticoagulant (see Arthur's case), so he might have survived at that point if he had a diligent healer familiar with the prior case.
