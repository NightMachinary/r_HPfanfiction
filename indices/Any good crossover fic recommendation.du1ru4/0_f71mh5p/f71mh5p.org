linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) Funny fic about a DnD wizard who is aware of all the DnD rules getting transported into the HP universe. It does get more serious as the series progresses and also the series isn't complete.

My personal favorite crossover is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality) This one is complete and is a crossover with the Matrix. I loved all the mystery, plot twists and how the author was able to incorporate the Matrix universe into Harry Potter.
