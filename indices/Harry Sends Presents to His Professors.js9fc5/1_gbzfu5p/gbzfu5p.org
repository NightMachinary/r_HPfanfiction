The only one I can think of offhand is the expansion of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][Enter The Dragon]] (FFN original written by Doghead Thirteen, expanded on QQ by Dunkelzahn). After finding that a giant snake has been raiding his spider-stash, Harry confronts it and kills it by breaking its neck, then he drags its 60ft corpse to the great Hall to ask what he should do with it.\\
After getting instructions on how to preserve the meat, Harry decides that there is too much even for him to eat before it goes off, so he gives huge steaks of meat to the teachers and some other friends (including the Centaur Herd of the Forbidden Forest).\\
Dumbledore later uses the meat he was given as part of his moves to intimidate Lucius Malfoy into not being so obviously evil/law-breaking.

Note - The QQ version of the fic (at the time of writing) hasn't (as far as I can tell) gone near NSFW levels, but it does make references to things like brainwashing, slavery and human trafficking. As such, I am refraining from posting any links towards it.
