Yeah, it's unfortunately not the fix I'm thinking of but also was never a fan of that fic because of the like, shame put upon Harry for not giving his relatives a present and also I dislike, his forced involvement of Dudley. Not to say Dudley is unreemable, but why does the person whom he bullied always have to be involved. It's just a toxic narrative imo.
