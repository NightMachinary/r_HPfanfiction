Maybe try Linkffn(Prince of the Dark kingdom). Harry is not dark in there, but he is definitely on Voldemort's side and has no desire to join the light. His confrontations with Dumbledore(who is very much the competent leader of resistance) are very interesting.

Not complete, but worth the read either way. And it's enormous!
