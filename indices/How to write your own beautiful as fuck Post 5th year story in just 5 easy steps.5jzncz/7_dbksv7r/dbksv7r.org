There's something missing. Harry is obviously the heir of all four founders and owns Hogwarts, because through some unfathomable circumstances his parent's and grandparents were unaware that they belonged to the big four's houses, and despite the fact that most of the British wizarding world population is interrelated the title goes only to him.

Harry needs to get acquire an OP teleporting familiar on accident, preferably with lighting or fire affinity, actually make those at least two, that he then proceeds to ignore for the duration of the story.

Harry calls Dobby who manages to build him a mansion with a sex dungeon and 20 underground levels. No expenses needed because Dobby can just blindly rob all of the purebloods of their property without anything being traced to Harry.

Also there absolutely need to be crazy naked goblins beating on gongs when Harry gets his new titles and lordships so that everyone in Gringots knows that something important has happened. Obviously the monumental event needs to be broadcasted live across Hogwarts by bells deafening everyone unfortunate enough to be in the Great Hall at the time.

Basilisk Hide Armor, duh. Because it's the best one out there!

Oh! And Harry doesn't need to go along with Dumbledore's manipulations anymore, since he managed to purge of all the potions in his system that created an adverse reaction and he is now a super powered intelligent demigod or something. All of that suppressed angst has to manifest into something big!
