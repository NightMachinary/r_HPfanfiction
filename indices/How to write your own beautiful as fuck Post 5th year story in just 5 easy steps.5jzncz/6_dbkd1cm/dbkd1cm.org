I'd love to see just one more try, where step 3 goes like:

"... And he headed for Diagon Alley.

[scene break]

As he lay drifting off to sleep that night, he mentally reviewed his purchases to make sure he hadn't forgotten anything:

1. A multi-compartment trunk just like Moody's. That had looked dead useful.
2. Enough properly-fitting clothes for two weeks before he needed to do laundry, plus several pairs of shoes and boots
3. Contacts, because no one with any sense played a violent sport with glasses on
4. Boxes and boxes of energy bars and several cases of bottled water, in case he ever got locked in his room again (and some wet wipes, 'cause not being allowed to shower sucked)
5. 3 "decoy wands" in case Vernon tried to confiscate his
6. Books on how to actually learn Occlumency, and a few other interesting topics he'd noticed in the bookstore

Yeah, he thought that pretty much covered his essential needs. Not like the stores were going anywhere, he could get anything else later."

There you go, no extended shopping scene needed, or extremely detailed account of his purchases. Fill in later, as needed (i.e., book titles).
