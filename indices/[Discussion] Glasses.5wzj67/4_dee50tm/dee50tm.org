Rowling said that damage caused by spells that have backfired can cause damage that lasts forever like it did with Lockhart and spells that targets the eyes would probably be really complicated so maybe its just not worth the risk. I imagine the first person wanting to invent a spell being reluctant to try it out on themself. I think it should be possible to transfigure someones eyes in fully functional ones but that would probably require someone to be really adept at transfiguration and could be reverse by a simple revelio charm
