Because their poor eyesight is completely natural? Regrowing bones and reattaching limbs is not, which is why magic works really well for those things. Fixing other health issues (like, say, broken bones or cuts) is a matter of speeding up the healing process magically, or undoing the action done to them, I don't know.

- expensive

- difficult

- in the realm of dubious legality

- social stigma
