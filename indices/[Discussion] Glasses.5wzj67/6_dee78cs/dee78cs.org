We don't know what they're using glasses for. Myopia? Magi-Visionâ„¢? A transparent map beamed directly into their eyes?

If magic utility glasses are common and muggleborns are rare, then people who see Harry wearing glasses might think he's showing off his wealth in a somewhat nerdy way. Or, since his father wore glasses (to show off his wealth but let's not speak ill of the dead), it might be in honor of his father. Maybe they think he's wearing his father's old glasses, even (thus the tape).
