The children had to walk up to the castle gates, most still clutching tokens of family and love from their weeping parents.

No children summoned to Hogwarts had returned since that terrible day and they were only the latest class.

They walked through a quaint little village, finding nobody to greet or even just watch them; it was deserted, silent.

Bunched together, the First Years trudged for the visible castle; there were no lights to welcome them, despite the lateness of their arrival. No sound, no movement, no anything.

Muggleborns and halfbloods began to whisper amongst themselves, throwing out words like 'apocalypse' and 'zombies'.

They came to the great iron gate, watching as it opened without human aid and they shivered as they walked through. It closed behind them with a horrid finality.

Someone screamed, "Oh god! He's dead!"

They were pointing to a mountain of a man, collapsed only a few feet further up the path. One of his arms was outstretched, a set of rusting iron keys clutched in the hand and pointing towards the gate.

At his side, looking like he had been trying to help, was a dog.

The children had no choice though; the gate would not budge open and the night was quickly growing ever colder.

So they gave the bodies a wide berth, the more religious of them offering quiet prayers, and walked on.

They came to the great oak doors to the castle and found that they too opened on their own, rusted hinges creaking.

Into the castle the children moved, only to stop as one. More bodies.

Students slumped against the walls; some had their wands out, gasped in their hands.

Students face down, on their sides, on their backs, in praying positions, away from the walls. Some had clearly been crawling to the doors.

Some bodies had animals curled up to them, some had animals in carriers; cats and toads and owls, all dead.

"Oh children," spoke a voice and they startled to find a ghost in front of them.

She must have died young, older than the students certainly, but clearly not a death by old age.

"Wha--what happened here?" said one of the braver students. voice trembling.

"I made a mistake," the woman said, grief-stricken, "I...I called on magics beyond my understanding. Beyond my control. Oh, children, I'm so sorry I've killed you too."

And the children couldn't answer as they were compelled to go further into the entrance hall, beginning to tire and yawn, their limbs like lead and...they were so very tired all of a sudden.

Away from the doors they walked, into what was obviously some sort of dining hall, "the Great Hall" a pureblood murmured sleepily, "S'it's beautiful...like Mummy said."

The children began separating, into four groups, and made their ways towards the empty tables.

The ghost floated along behind them, sobbing her apologies and begging forgiveness, even as the children began dropping.

Collapsing and falling asleep on the cold stones.

Never to wake.

Within hours, Lily Potter was alone once again.

Alone with the price of her choice and actions and knowing that it would always repeat.

After all, there was a new class every year and Hogwarts would always welcome them home.
