Thanks!

Del is Draco. He was found with a baby blanket that had the initials DLM on it. Not knowing who this baby was, someone gave him a new name--think along the lines of David Luke Moore. He doesn't care for that and Del came from trying to pronounce DL as a word. He's stubborn enough to make it stick and even the adults call him that now.
