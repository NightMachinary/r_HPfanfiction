The train does not run up the track the way it used to, not that the kids know this. Instead, it plunges through a glowing portal that closes so quickly that it nearly nips the last car (one student declares the fright shaved years off their life).

Confused children mill about the corridor, introducing themselves, while others hide in a compartment, watching a formless mist that oddly never touches the train. The constant movement is mesmerizing and lulls several children into a trance.

They are all ages between 10 and 18, and the eldest among them remember magic, although it had been consigned to dreams and overactive imaginations. Younger children cluster around them eagerly, hoping for insights.

Most of them are considered orphans in the wider world and a number of the have been gently interrogated; such a jump in abandoned and orphaned children is not natural. The government is concerned that it doesn't happen again but there are no real clues as to what happened, much less /why/.

In fact, almost none of the children come from what is laughingly called normal families. No, they are orphans, abandoned, living with unpleasant foster families and guardians, and the like. A couple had even been living on the street. All of them had taken the leap of faith and found themselves walking through a solid wall to find a scarlet steam engine, straight out of a holiday program on the telly.

A cluster of children from London share a compartment; they're quiet and on edge. Their leader is a girl that, while always recognizable, is subtly different every time you see her. She and one of the younger boys had engineered their grand escape from the orphanage, squirreling away food for weeks, cadging bits of soap, empty bottles for water, and even paper and pens ("It's a school, in'it?" one of them had demanded. "We'll need that stuff, betcha!"). August 31, all of them had stealthily packed bags with their things, shoved water bottles and fruit and sandwiches in, next to the books and clothes, and snuck out. Dora was technically aged out of Wool's, but since she was so helpful with the children, there had been no rush to turf unpaid labor over the summer. And she had made sure to know all the exits in the old building. She cheerfully copped to having an...interesting career at the orphanage.

Life at Wool's had been difficult for all of them. Strange things tended to happen around them. One of the teacher's hair had turned blue when she scolded Harry one day, and much to the dismay of several of the adults, he had also picked up a fondness for snakes. Del (he refused to use the name the authorities gave him) frequently was caught with treats the matron was sure had been locked up. Angelina was considered a daredevil tomboy, found on rooftops and hanging out windows--once again, with no indication how she could have gotten there. Penelope, who repaired the book a bully had torn apart. Susan (frequently teased for her stuffed unicorn) who had been dragged off to many revival meetings by one of the staff who was convinced she was a divinely-blessed Healer. And Terry [Higgs], who was given a wide berth by the other kids because bad luck dogged those who picked on him.

The Wool group shared out their supplies with each other and settled in for the ride. Harry and Del, adventuresome types, scouted for the loo and took the measure of their fellows.

"Magic, the letter said," Susan breathed. "D'you think it's true?"

"I told you, Sue, I remember my parents doing magic," Dora huffed. "Mum would pull out a wand and clean the room. She fixed a vase I broke so well you'd never know it had been broken. Dad didn't do as much, but he would make my toys dance at night."

"I dream about a man who could turn into a dog," Harry said. "I really hope that's true!"

"It is," an ethereal voice said from the door. None of them had heard it open. "There's a cart with food coming down the corridor. I thought you might like to know."

Terry stuck his head out and looked past the blonde girl. "Yeah and it'll probably be out before it gets to us, given how the others are mobbing it."

"I think it refills magically," the girl said. "Considering it's come from the first car and it's still full."

"How do you know that?"

"Oh, I've been following it. Well, is it following when you stay a little ahead?" She smiled. "I've been letting people know it was coming. I had been sitting in the first car with my neighbors, but I was curious, and so here I am."

"I'm Harry," Harry said finally, holding out a hand to shake. "An' this is Dora, Terry, Sue, Angelina, Del, and Penny. Do you know where we're going?"

"I'm Luna," she replied. "We're going north, so Scotland, maybe? There's a lot of people waiting for us." When she realized they were all staring at her, she blushed. "I just know things, sometimes. They've been true, though," she added defensively.

The group shared a series of glances. "We know how that goes," Penny said gently. "You can sit with us, if you like."

"I'd like that, very much! Once I finish letting everyone know about the food cart."

At the train's ultimate destination, people were beginning to gather on the train platform.

"You know the train won't be here for a couple hours yet," Amelia Bones told her brother.

"I know that, and may I point out, you are here just as early."

Soon the platform held such diverse people as Arthur and Molly Weasley along with their eldest son who was already attending Hogwarts when the Cataclysm had happened; Andromeda and Ted Tonks, carefully on the far side of the platform from Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy (tensions had eased, but still existed--best to play it safe); the Longbottoms--Frank, Alice, Augusta--were there; Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, hoping against hope that young Harry believed his letter and would be arriving. All were nervous, and excited, and anxious--there was no way of knowing until the Express arrived who was on it. The Headmaster had assured everyone that there were multiple children, but that was all he could say. Magic simply did not cross the barrier.

McGonagall appeared on the platform 30 minutes before the train was due and took charge.

"All of you off the platform," she ordered. "We don't know how many children will be there, nor do we know what they'll be like. They will likely be nervous and skittish. And I will remind you that since all of them were under 11 when IT happened, most will not remember you and some of them may not know their proper names. 'Twill do nae good to overwhelm them."

[AN: Children arriving are those who would have been graduating classes 1991 (Tonks, Charlie) through 1999 (Ginny, Luna). Might not include Hermione, Colin, Dennis, or Dean; Ron and Ginny may have been adopted outright and despite Charlie's tales and the improbable things that happen around the twins, may not be interested in going either. James and Lily are still dead, sadly, having been killed literally minutes before the Cataclysm happened.

[The Cataclysm is an event (possibly engineered by the ICW) that separated the magical world (or just England) into a different dimension. A ritual from the Myrddin Codex called the Avalon Equations (apologies to Bobmin356) was performed with the intent to confine Voldemort---which it did (and got his Horcruxes as well, as a happy side effect). But it also yanked everyone and everything magical out. The Myrddin Codex (aka Merlin's Grimoire) is an ancient document alleged to have belonged to Merlin. The Codex is unfortunately old, singed, missing pages, and all the other things one might expect of a 1000-1500 year old document as well as including things unrelated to magic (there's a hot debate, for example, if one page really is a shopping list or coded instructions for another ritual). The Equations are not as complete as the ritualists believed. For some reason, all magical children under 11, Magical or Muggle, did not go.]
