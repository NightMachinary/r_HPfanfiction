I remember reading one theory that posits the idea that Hermione's relationship with her parents was somewhat distant. The idea being that with both parents working as dentists, they weren't around for much of young Hermione's life, possibly pushing academic pursuits onto her at a very young age as a way to distract her from that fact. It likely explains in part why Hermione was such a teacher's pet to begin with, as that was probably the only real approval and positive attention she received while growing up.
