Confundus is in the movies. Hermione uses it on Cormac in HBP

Movie chose obliviate because it's more dramatic and emotional, and because they never have the scene where she tells Harry what she did, unlike in the books. So just showing her saying "confundus" and then leaving the house wouldn't be clear to audience members who hadn't read the book what it was she'd done, because film viewers only know the confundus charm as the mildly harmless thing she used to get Ron on the Quidditch team.
