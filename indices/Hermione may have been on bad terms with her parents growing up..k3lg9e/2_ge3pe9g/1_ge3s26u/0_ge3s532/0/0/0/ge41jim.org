Oh I agree it was dumb. It was beyond dumb. I remember watching HBP for the first time and thinking "the fuck" when she faded out of the pictures.

You know what else is dumb about it? Confunding them to think they are different people who want to move to another country makes sense because it's specifically the move to Australia that protects them. Them not knowing they have a daughter and some pictures having one less person in them isn't going to protect them from the Death Eaters. They might not know they're Hermione Granger's parents, but the DEs sure as heck will, and they'll come knocking anyway. And I can therefore only assume that, in the movie universe, Mr and Mrs Granger were tortured and murdered /and had no idea why./ And that, that is some of the darkest and most horrific shit I can think of.
