One thing is canonically Hermione didnt obliviate her parents. She confunded them to make them think they were a childless couple named wendle and Monica wilkins and convinced them to move to Australia. The obliviation was a movie thing that I for one never understood. As for her relationship with them I dont believe she had a bad relationship with them. I agree she might have planned to send them away for their safety early on after the world cup but couldnt have until after her 6th year maybe that christmas as she would have been of age by that point.
