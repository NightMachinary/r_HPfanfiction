We only know about one gift and that's because Crookshanks was important to the story.

It's entirely possible she had a bad relationship with her parents, but I think it's all overblown conjecture, especially in a universe where people without magic don't matter unless they can benefit a witch/wizard. I mean we don't even learn their names. They don't matter that much.

Everyday people do things for others without their consent or opinion because they believe they know what's best. This is the big issue with SPEW, so it's not unbelievable she modified her parents' memory because she believed she knew what was best for them.
