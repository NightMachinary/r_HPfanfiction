One thing that is never really picked up is that for all the bashing of Ron being an insensitive git in book 1, he is not wrong. Hermione's social skills are objectively terrible, just spewing out what she has memorised from a book without giving anyone else a chance to reply. This is incredibly rude and makes holding an actual conversation with her impossible. It is possible that upon entering a new world, and possibly with bad experiences from being too quiet in her previous schools, she is suddenly overcompensating and has never acted like this before. However given she is just eleven I feel that the blame should lie with the parents setting her up to fail. Either through negligence or their own failings, they didn't teach their daughter how to behave with others properly and she suffered for it.
