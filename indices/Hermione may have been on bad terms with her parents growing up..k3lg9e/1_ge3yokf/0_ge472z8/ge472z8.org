Another reason why Hermione might not talk about her parents may be that we're wrong in assuming she doesn't. The books are very strongly from Harry's POV after all. As important as Hermione's parents may or may not have been to her, they really weren't of much importance to Harry, who never even met them. It could very well be another "Dumbledore's gay but it wasn't relevant to the plot." Hermione could love her parents loads and casually mentioned them as much as any other loving kid, but it wasn't relevant to Harry.
