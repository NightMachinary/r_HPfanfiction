I think it's less bad terms and more that they've grown distant over the years. They could have been really good parents who Hermione loved very much, but that's meaningless when you can no longer relate to each other at all.

Hermione, in particular, is keeping so many secrets that being at home likely feels like a field of landmines. There are so many things she wouldn't be allowed to tell or else have to downplay if she was to be able to return to Hogwarts.

As for why she never talks about them, there are many reasons. It could be out of respect for Harry being an orphan. It could be the distance between them is hard on her, and it's hard to talk about, especially when her friends can't understand. It could be that her focus is so much on school and on Harry, that they simply slip her mind.

Lastly, Hermione had always chosen duty over her friends. Obliviating her parents is merely an extension of that. It wouldn't matter how good her relationship with her parents is, she'd have done it if only because that was what she deemed the best way to both keep them safe and maintain operational security. Duty comes first for Hermione.

Anyway, the interactions between the Grangers are so few that there is really no concrete evidence either way. The most we can conclusively say is that Hermione has gotten distant with her parents. Outside of that, everything we have is a matter of speculation.

As for fic recs where the relationship is indeed bad,[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25660273][[FIC] The Brightest Witch of Her Age]] by julchen_in_red is a really good one.
