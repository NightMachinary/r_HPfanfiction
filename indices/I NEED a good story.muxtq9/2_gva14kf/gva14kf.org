If you want a retelling of the series with oc/fred/George as the golden trio with help from Percy and Cedric to save the school through the years you can give mine a glimpse. No real pairings to distract from the story. On/off with Charlie Weasley, one year dating Sebastian Krum Triwizard year, fake fianc√©/baby daddy with Barty Crouch jr.

Summary- In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.
