this is one I've enjoyed. [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=3393&chapter=1][The Red Right Hand.]] I like this post war Snape--cynical and conniving, though not as hopelessly dark as he's presented in some stories. The Harry displayed in this story is a little too happy-go-lucky for my preference, but the overall story is fun little redemption tale.
