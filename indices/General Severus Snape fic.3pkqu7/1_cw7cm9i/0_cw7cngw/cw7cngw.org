  Severus thought he'd already imagined every possible order the Dark Lord could give him. He was wrong. Set at the end of GoF.

  #+begin_example
      Written for the Snapecase fest on LiveJournal\.  My thanks to my expert beta readers, Moira of the Mountain \(aka Mountain Moira\) and The Real Snape\.The first line of the story comes from Goblet of Fire; the rest is mine, though of course the characters are JKR's; I make no claims to her empire\.

  No owls, more than a little magic, and quite a few books. After the war, Snape comes back to Hogwarts.

  #+begin_example
      Beta: regan\_v\. Amazing\. To her this story owes both clarity and compassion\. Mistakes are of course my own\.Additional canon\-picking and grammar by Dementor DeltaBlack Story was written for rexluscus\.Warnings: Black Story contains scenes some readers may find distressing, in particular the explicit depiction of child sexual abuse and sexual dysfunction\.

  During his brief stint of freedom from St. Brutal's, Severus discovers that buggery---while not the cure for boredom---is an acceptable stopgap measure.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape is going straight to hell. The people he calls his friends are helping him get there.

  #+begin_example
      Although I wrote Into the Fold meaning it to stand independently, it can also be read as a sequel to an earlier fic of mine, Apothecary and Auror, which can be found here\.

#+begin_quote
  Submission to the Bring Back the Bastard fest at the Deeply Horrible comm on LJ. For margi_lynn's prompt: "During the first war, Snape pulled shifts at St. Mungo's to make up for their overwork. Most of the time he does help the healers. But what about the times he doesn't? Why those people?"

  #+begin_example
      Huge, huge thanks to the deeply\_horrible comm mod for her endless patience with my request after request for extensions\! Also, enormous thanks to my betas, Wiski and Nahsiah, without whom this story would still be laying deformed at the bottom of a garbage heap\. <3 All remaining mistakes are mine\. 
  #+end_example

  Warnings: descriptions of injuries, homicidal intent.

  When his son James is wounded, Harry goes to Severus Snape for help. Snape, of course, has a price. Harry pays it---and Snape finds himself paying his own price in worry, doubt, awe, and something very much like love.

  #+begin_example
      This was written for gingertart50 during the HDS\_Beltane fest in 2008\. It was my first Snarry, and this is probably one reason there is no actual sex\. Warning for a brief scene of violence\.
