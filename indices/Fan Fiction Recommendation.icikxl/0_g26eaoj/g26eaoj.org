To me, Abby being a muggle is only half of what makes the story. The other half is how Harry is (not entirely) coping with losing Ginny and raising his children alone. The main significance of her being a muggle, I think, is that she's a complete stranger to his life, and remains so for a while because he has to keep secrets from her.

Sorry, though, I don't have any similar recs.
