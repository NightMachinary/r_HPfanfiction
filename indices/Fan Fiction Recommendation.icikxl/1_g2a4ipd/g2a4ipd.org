I've been reading Grow Young with Me because it's been mentioned in quite a few threads recently, it's making me bawl. So thanks /s

linkffn(3461008) is a fantastic read. It's a Harmony from Ron's POV, it doesn't have Harry fall in love with a Muggle after, however it does have the same theme of dealing with (or no being able to) the loss of his love.
