Well, canon Harry is a rather disappointing character... I understand his point. Honestly, it is always better when they use an AU Harry for this things.

I also get your point, both with HP and Naruto many times people just give a random dude in another world that has nothing to do with them their names, but only look similar without any memories or abilities. Utter crap.
