Because if you use him as a base for a character you get access to stuff like the hallows, the basilisk, the sword and countless other things that could be inserted into that character with little fuss like metamorphic magic and gold. With a few small changes you can get the perfect character for your story, it is easier for both the author and the reader, and a better Harry is always popular.

It doesn't have to be completely different, you just have to alter a few events and some of his Ronald-tendencies, once you get rid of that moody Harry full of laziness you have the Harry from before Hogwarts so it isn't that much AU.
