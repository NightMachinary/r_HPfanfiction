But Harry is neither perfect nor powerful, he doesn't have any merit to speak of aside from learning the patronus after months of personal tutoring and holding a sword upright while being attacked by a big snake... Truly his victories are always by luck and plot armor, his personality is that of a moody teenager with anger issues and suicidal tendencies. You don't need to make him powerful or perfect, just salvageable.
