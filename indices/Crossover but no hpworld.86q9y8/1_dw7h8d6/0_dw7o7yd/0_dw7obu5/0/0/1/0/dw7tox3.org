Exactly. Harry ISN'T perfect or powerful, and in my opinion that's one of the best things about him as a character.

I mean, Harry is pretty bland and dull. He doesn't have half the personality that Ron or Hermione do. And yeah, this is mostly done on purpose; Harry is bland so that it'll be easier for the readers to put themselves in his place, and so that he'll provide a contrast to the more interesting side-characters. But it doesn't make him all that engaging for someone like me, who never gravitated to "main character" type chars.

What makes Harry even marginally interesting is the duality between the "chosen one" that the wizarding world sees him as, and the just-slightly-above-average wizard that he in reality is, that's what saves the character for me. He gets by not because he's /sooo awesome,/ but through a mix of luck and a knack for improvising when things get bad. and I'll take that over DBZ-style "he trained really hard and now he's super-powerful and can blow up the moon" type of characterisation any day.

Replacing him with "generic kickass vaguely Americanized action hero #7403" does not seem like an improvement to me.
