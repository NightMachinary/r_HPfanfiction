Snapegirlkmf on ffn has some very good severitus/sevitus stories, my favourites are

linkffn(Away in a Manger by Snapegirlkmf) and linkffn(Season of Warmth by Snapegirlkmf)

linkffn(Glimpses by LilyIsAwesomerThanYou) and its sequel linkffn(About A Boy) and also good

The one I love the most is linkffn(The Boy Who by Dream Painter); it has great character development for everyone - Harry, Snape and even Draco.
