Some favorites of mine that aren't listed yet. These are actual, Snape-is-Harry's-father Severitis stories. Let me know if you also want found family/adoption fics and I'll do a separate post for them.

- Blood Magic by Gateway Girl linkao3(10678911)
- In Blood Only by EM Snape linkffn(2027554)
- Mine Series by Gillian Middleton (Mine, Snape's Vocation, The Owl and the Puppydog, Fossils and Frog Spawn, The Absence of Unhappy). First story linkffn(1963825)
- [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/snarry_games/245035.html][Tracking Changes]] by Montana Dan. EWE, Snape lives. Not in the standard archives, so here's the summary: /When Harry Potter finds out he is really Severus Snape's son, he runs off to America to race cars (yeah, you read that right). What will Severus Snape do when he finds out someone is using his name and his face?/
- [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=202][The Art of Forgetting and Forgiving]] by Scorpia, two stories on Potions and Snitches. Angsty. First story is pre-Hogwarts: /Every year it was the same, Severus Snape cleared his face of all emotion, apparated to Privet Drive and visited a little boy whose only desire in the entire world was to have someone that would love him ./ Second story is post-canon EWE, but you can read just the first one if you're looking for kid!Harry.
- [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3028][Fade]] by JA Worley, also angsty and also on Potions and Snitches. Summary: /Harry has a little problem, followed by a little freak out, and compounded by a confusing conversation with the Sorting Hat, who has special things in mind for him and Professor Snape. A (sort of) Christmas story as a lot of it revolves around Harry's wish for a good Christmas./ *
