I have a soft spot for severitus fics. It's hard to choose the best. Were you looking for straight up related or were any snape becomes Harry's parent ok? Some of my favourites are

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4307359/1/Harry-s-First-Detention]]) I haven't read this one in a while, but I remember liking Harry learning what normal relationships were like.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13357839/1/The-Potions-Apprentice]]) An underaged wizard can not use magic on summer break, but what if Harry could use potions at home instead? I really enjoyed the idea of Harry desperately needing to learn potions and slowly building a relationship with snape through his own efforts rather than being thrown together for various reasons

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19394749/chapters/46152751]]) One of my favorite Harrys. Harry is an artist that is featured in an exhibit. Snape is curious and chaperones him to it once no one else will and Harry surprises him with his talent.
