Well let's start with the positives.

First, it's good that you've taken the plunge and started to write a story. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step and, well, you've taken that first step.

Second, I like that you decided to explore a clear "what if?" scenario rather than doing something really boring like simply retelling the canon story as you think it should have gone, which happens far too often.

So there's something good to take away.

On the negative side, spelling, formatting, punctuation and grammar are poor and make reading difficult.

The main plot point, that Lily and James survive, has almost no impact on the story. Take chapter 4, for instance, where the entirety of HP Chamber of Secrets is described in a couple of hundred words and Harry's parents' contributions are to be summoned into Dumbledore's office and then for James to laugh.

Again, you've taken a brave step in publishing your story and you're to be congratulated for that but I think you need more practise in writing English before you take it any further.
