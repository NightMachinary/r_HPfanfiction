Actually although I could accuse [[/u/TE7]] of a lot of things, even in the absence of the CCTV from that incident outside the pet grooming salon, I'm not going to accuse him of laziness. Procrastination, maybe, but it's not exactly lazy to write a 65,000 word (and still growing, ffs) "epilogue" to one story purely because you don't want to write the next bit of your main story.
