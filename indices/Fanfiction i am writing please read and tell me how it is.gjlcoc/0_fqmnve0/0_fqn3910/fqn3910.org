A beta isn't to fix laziness. Although I suspect that riotous laughter you hear now is [[/u/rpeh]] after reading my opinion there...

It doesn't capitalize proper nouns. The sentence structure is choppy at best. ESL is a bit of an excuse but the only real coherent part of the entire story is the part plagiarized from Goblet of Fire.

It is not the beta's job to fix everything for you. He needs to read more about writing and come up with a better understanding of Grammar.

I'd recommend Strunk and White's 'The Elements of Style'. If I were to beta it and my first thing is that it cant be bothered with basic capitalization and punctuation..why would I bother? Why would I even think it would listen to me.

If it's not even going to capitalize names it's pretty much a lost cause.
