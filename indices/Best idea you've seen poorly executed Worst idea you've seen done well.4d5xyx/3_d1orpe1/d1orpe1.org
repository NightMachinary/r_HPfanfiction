*Best Idea Done Poorly*

linkffn(11033616) You're my Density By: robst

Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.

The great idea here is that timetraveling Harry doesn't actually know any magic. But he has the memory of an adult muggle. Does away with the OP timetraveler, but while changing things in an interesting way. It fails at this because its a robst fic.

*Worst Idea Done Well*

linkffn(9622538) Travel Secrets: First By: E4mj

Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET.

This series features bad!Dumbledore and clueless or equally bad followers. Yet it manages to turn them bad without feeling like bashing. Not quite sure of the distinction myself, but most bashing fics feel like the author is trying to persuade me of something, and that doesn't happen here.
