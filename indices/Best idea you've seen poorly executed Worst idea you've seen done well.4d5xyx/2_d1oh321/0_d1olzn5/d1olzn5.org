It's the fic that got me going on 40k humour stories. Trust me, for a series that gets about as grimdark as you can get, there are some awesome 40k humour fics out there.

This just happens to be one of the best. It kinda helps that I rate it amongst the top 1% amongst Hp crossovers of all time if only because I get more & more jealous every time I read it. It's just one of those 'I've read it before, I know what's coming-oh fuck it I'm /still/ laughing at the image of Sirius Black in a cage wearing nothing but a golden thong' * fics.
