  I'd really like to read a story about a goblin-raised Harry where the tiny creatures who run Gringotts aren't predictable plot devices.

Just in case you haven't come upon this, you should definitely check out linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)

If I remember correctly, this one's level of writing is a few notches above almost everything posted on FFN. And of course, the story is very interesting. Unfortunately though, as is the case with many great ones, it is abandoned.
