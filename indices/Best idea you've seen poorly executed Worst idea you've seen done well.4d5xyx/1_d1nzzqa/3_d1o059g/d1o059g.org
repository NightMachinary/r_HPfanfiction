I've read and agree with both of these. On another note i'd love to read Harry in Hufflepuff more, he never gets sorted there. :/

Oh and there is a goblin story out there that's like 100k words where it's typically indy!Harry and he goes to the goblins for help, then in the last chapter they rob and murder him and it just ends.
