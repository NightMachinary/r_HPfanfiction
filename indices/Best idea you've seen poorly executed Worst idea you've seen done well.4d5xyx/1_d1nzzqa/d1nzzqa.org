linkffn(8186071). I'd /really/ like to read a story about a goblin-raised Harry where the tiny creatures who run Gringotts aren't predictable plot devices.

'Lazy Harry' sounds like an awful idea. Protagonists who aren't motivated to do anything have the potential to be quite boring. How on earth could a character who spends most of their time asleep ever find the opportunity to have entertaining adventures?

But linkffn(6466185) does a great job convincing the reader that a lazy Harry has a lot of potential. It's hilarious from start to finish.
