I would have to say linkffn(In Atlantean Caves). The idea of this kind of ever-changing maze to explore is super fascinating, as are the Atlantis connections (although the story was abandoned before that).

Sadly, looking back, the writing is kind of shoddy. A lot of tell over show, the romance builds way too fast and probably shouldn't be there at all, and as mentioned, it's abandoned.
