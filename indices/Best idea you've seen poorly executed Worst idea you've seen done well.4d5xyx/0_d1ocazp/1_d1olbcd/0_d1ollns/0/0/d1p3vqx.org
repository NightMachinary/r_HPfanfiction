Actually, I became frustrated with the story because Hermione wasn't Mary Sue enough. This fic constantly teeters between whether Hermione or Harry is the main character. It doesn't cause enough fundamental changes to canon to make me think the former, and it ends out with Hermione having all these brilliant ideas and new spells, but giving them to Harry to deal with X superficial change. In many ways, I am hoping that she gets to unless a can of whoop ass on the death eaters soon
