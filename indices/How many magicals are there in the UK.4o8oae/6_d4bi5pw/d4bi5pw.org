I always worked on the assumption that they're around the size of Iceland in population. Why? Because Iceland is one of the smallest societies in the world that has been big enough to prevent extensive inbreeding. Also, 300.000 is a nice sweetspot where economies and social structures get interesting. Its big enough for a few artists to make a living, have the funds for soldiers, and so on and so forth.

That also means that I assume that there are other schools of magic in Britain, or at least other ways of education. I created the Dartmoor School of Magic, the St.Helena Academy of Magic and the North Rona Academy of Witchcraft as well as a structure for apprenticeships in magic.

For Law Enforcement I always assumed 200 Aurors and 300 Hit-Wizards and another 500, Officers (like Mr. Weasley) and Officials (secretaries, archivers, prosecuters) in the bureaus.
