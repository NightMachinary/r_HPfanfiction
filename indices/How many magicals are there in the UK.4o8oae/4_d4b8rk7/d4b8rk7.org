I think JKR would freely admit that numbers are not her strong suit. A great world-builder. yes, but a maths person she is not. Any attempt at trying to figure our the numbers of the wizarding world, whether it be the economy or population, is going produce conflicting or unsatisfying results.

I would personally put the population of wizarding Britain at around 10-15k (because it feels right), and would say that Britain has a larger proportion of the world's magical population than the muggle population, if only because I think British magicals are more likely to have stayed at home when their muggle counterparts emmigrated throughout the British Empire.
