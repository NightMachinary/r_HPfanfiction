Of the 40-ish names we know of in Harry's class at Hogwarts, I believe only three of them are first-generation magicals (Hermione, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Kevin Entwhistle) which suggests the British ratio is about 5-10%. If the Chinese ratio is the same then Chinese muggleborns /alone/ might be double that of the entire British magical population.

My headcanon, I imagine that China still has an imperial magical court, despite no longer having an emperor (that we know of, at least). I wonder how the CCCP deals with their magicals -- they might see them as a regressive† threat, but I imagine the Indian government has a much better relationship with their magical population which would be an incentive for China not to risk a poor relationship with their own (let alone "conquering" their magicals).

† That's not quite the right word. What word am I looking for here?
