/shrug/ We're dealing with magic here. Maybe there's more magical energy in the air? Maybe inbreeding causes magic to die out, so countries with less prejudice against muggle/wizard unions don't produce as many squibs? Or maybe is the exact opposite and more conservative countries do have more wizards being born?

Could be a variety of things considering we don't /actually/ know how magic comes about. It seems to be genetic, two wizards are not certain to porduce a wizard. And two muggles can. So we can just make up our own scenario, really
