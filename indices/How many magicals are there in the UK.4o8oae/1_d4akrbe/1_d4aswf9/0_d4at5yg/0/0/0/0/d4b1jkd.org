I noticed on the wikia that [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mahoutokoro_School_of_Magic][Mahoutokoro]] is described as having the smallest student body of all the schools (apparently, only eleven in the world?) -- which struck me as odd because Japan has about twice the population as the UK. Maybe a lot of Japanese magicals go to the Chinese magical school (which isn't on the wikia, but there /must/ be one, right?).
