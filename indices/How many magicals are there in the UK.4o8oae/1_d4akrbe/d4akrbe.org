I've seen numbers from 3000 UK human magicals to 100,000, all attributed to JKR in some fashion.

It's an interesting area to speculate on. I've tried to work out what level of population would be required to have an extensive government sector, a publishing sector, 2 shopping districts (Diagon and Hogsmeade), a daily paper and so on. It would certainly need a population larger than 3000 if there was no magic.. but there is.

iirc Arthur said there were (100 or was it 500?) wizards building the World Cup stadium over the course of months? a stadium seated 100,000 and was filled..

whatever the figure anyone is comfortable with, 'magical world 'isn't really possible, at least to me.. magical cult/ magical subculture/ hidden magical tribe but not world..
