I know I've linked [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][this]] before, but it's a very thorough examination of Harry Potter by the numbers. The conclusions drawn are essentially:

- At least, but not much more than, 10,000 wizards in Britain.
- Around 2,000 of them live in Hogsmeade.
- The population of Hogwarts is around 600. Harry's year is irregularly small -- Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin each have about ten students, and Ravenclaw has about twenty -- so 50 students as opposed to around 80 in other years.
- The Ministry of Magic has around 1,000 workers.

The logic is very thorough, but relies on the numbers Harry, Ron, Arthur, Lupin and the like to be close to accurate. (Which I think is pretty reasonable to assume)
