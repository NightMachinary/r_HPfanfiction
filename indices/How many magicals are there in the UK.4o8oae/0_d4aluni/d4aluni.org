The thing is, we see no evidence in canon that Hogwarts has 1000 students. It seems to be a lot less. For example there's only one teacher per subject. I would put the number at closer to 40-50 students per year, which means if people live to around 120 on average, there'd be 4800-6000 magical people in Britain. This fits quite nicely with the small town "everyone knows everyone else" feel of magical Britain.

Also, remember that Aurors aren't really police. They don't do day to day law enforcement, rather they're dark wizard hunters and do some VIP bodyguard duties too. Most law enforcement seems to be done directly by civil servants (e.g. Arthur Weasley both writes legislation and enforces it by going on raids), and "beat cops" are the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.

My headcanon for Auror numbers is around 10-15.
