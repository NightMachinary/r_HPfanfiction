My headcanon is that half of the world's magical population (from China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan & Bangladesh) decided to handle the Statute of Secrecy by migrating to a hidden land. A few stayed behind, always looking for muggleborns in order to quickly spirit them away. Some call it Xanadu, or Nirvana, or the Celestial Bureaucracy or freakin' Hotel California, but the essence of the matter is, if you're East Asian and not directly descended from European colonial wizards (or part of the ever-defiant Japanese-Korean peninsula holdouts), you go there.

So around 10k UK magicals, <1 million non-Asian worldwide.
