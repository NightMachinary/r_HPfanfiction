  Spin-off AU of Per Ardua Ad Astra. Harry lost his magic and became an elite soldier. Ziva lost her sister and became a spy. Theirs is an unlikely bond, a friendship forged in fire, blood and loss that endures despite divergent commitments to duty, country or agency. First friends, who became comrades, then something more - something deeper. They are, and always will be 'khaveyrim'.
