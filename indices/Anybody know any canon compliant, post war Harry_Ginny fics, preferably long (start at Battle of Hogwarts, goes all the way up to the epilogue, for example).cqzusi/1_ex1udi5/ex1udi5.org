FloreatCastellum has a lot of ficlets about Harry's life post-Hogwarts and some missing moments from the books in her [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/LinksToFiclets][tumblr]]. Each fanfiction is not long, but you'll still be satisfied with the amount of fanfiction she wrote. She also posted some of it on AO3, but I don't think she posted all of her ficlets.

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/13075][mischiefmanaged!verse]] by irnan on AO3. It's a short series on ~50k word, but still a good Harry's post-Hogwarts life.
