Hello, I liked the update! This fic is interesting so far. Can I suggest improving your summary though? I saw it in my alerts and was very confused as to why I ever followed your fic because I would have never clicked on it if I did not see the summary on Reddit. Maybe make it closer to what you have posted in this thread?

Dumbledore teaming up with Grindleward and overtaking magical and muggle worlds sounds interesting while your current summary on fanfiction.net only really tells you that it's a time travel fic which is fairly common and not really interesting.
