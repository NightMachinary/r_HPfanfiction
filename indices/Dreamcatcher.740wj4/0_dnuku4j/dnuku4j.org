Summary: This is a time-travel AU. A major point of divergence is between Dumbledore and Grindelwald as they've teamed up together.

Let's just say shit goes down and Grindelwald/Dumbledore dominate both the Magical and Muggle worlds. Magicals are treated as equals in terms of blood but are still segmented by way of wealth.
