I think I recall one where Harry was at a Wizengamot meeting and he announced that he was calling in the life debt from Malfoy being "released from the Imperius" when the Killing curse rebounded.

Everyone freaked out when they realized that Harry essentially had single-use ironclad blackmail material on every single death eater who'd used the imperius defense.
