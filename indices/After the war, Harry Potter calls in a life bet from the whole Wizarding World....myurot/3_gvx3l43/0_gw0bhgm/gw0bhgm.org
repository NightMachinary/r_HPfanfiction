AAAAAAH I'm so glad you linked this! I loved watching Harry's bullshit tolerance run out so hard. Also I kinda of wanted to slap the shit out of Hermione for parts of this She doesn't just not understand, she /refuses/ to understand Harry's point and it's infuriating. Also I like Ginny, but whaaaaat a bitch.
