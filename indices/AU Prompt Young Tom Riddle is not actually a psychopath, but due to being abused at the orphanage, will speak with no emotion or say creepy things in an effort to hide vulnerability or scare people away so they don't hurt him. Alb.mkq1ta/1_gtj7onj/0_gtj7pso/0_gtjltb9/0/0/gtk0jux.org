  ‘But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,' Harry started again, ‘and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?' ‘I think you know,' said Dumbledore. ‘Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.' ... ‘He took my blood,' said Harry. ‘Precisely!' said Dumbledore. ‘He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!' ‘I live ... while he lives? But I thought ... I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?' - Deadly Hollow

Dumbledore Knows Harry will survive since book 4, he probably plan this to happen, he just didn't foresee Harry and cedric will both take the goblet.

Because he knew Harry cannot die by Riddle's hand, So he plan harry to sacrifice himself to Riddle willingly so achieve two things:

1. Harry will live(obviously)

2. a "second blood protection" on Harry's allies, making it so that spells Voldemort tried to place on them quickly wore off, minimize the casualty.(most likely)

  "You won't be killing anyone else tonight," said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. "You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people"

  "But you did not!"

  "I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?"

Go reread the book, and between the lines, the hints are all there.

Besides being manipulative is not inherently bad, it was only the intention that matters.
