I'm working on an AU, too: my take on him not having done all the things that we're told he did is /Mrs Cole being an unreliable narrator/. It doesn't even need to be malicious. We know that muggle-distracting and muggle-repelling charms are a thing in canon, and I bet they could result in odd memories.
