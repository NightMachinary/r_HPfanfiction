We're not supposed to pretend anything. As much as I used to love getting additional information from JK on her story... I really hate it now. She should have let the whole thing be one of Dumbledore's assumptions and be done with it. That would have given fans more wiggle room to toy with the idea and they could have gone either by Voldemort's version or by Dumbledore's.

As for Merope... we know very little about her. When Harry encounters or hears about her she's at some of the lowest points in her life. It's up for interpretation whether she would have been a good mother (even for the sake of her former lover and to oppose her dad's practices) or an abusive one like Marvolo.

Also Harry was raised by a not so loving Muggle family and he turned out alright.
