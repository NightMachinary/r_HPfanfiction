I always kind of hated the part about „had mereope raised him“. We're talking about the person who drugged and raped someone because she „loved“ him, so I'm kind of concerned about her definition of love. It would have been way better for Tom, had he been adopted and raised by a loving muggle family.

On the other hand we're also supposed to pretend Tom Riddle (the muggle one) was the bad guy for leaving her. So it's not really surprising. The poor guys worst crime was literally being slightly snobby. He deserved better.
