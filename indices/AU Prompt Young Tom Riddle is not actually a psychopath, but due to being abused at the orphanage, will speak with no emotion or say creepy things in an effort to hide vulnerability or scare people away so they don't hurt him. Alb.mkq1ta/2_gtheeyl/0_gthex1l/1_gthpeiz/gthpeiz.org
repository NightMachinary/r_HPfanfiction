Assuming Merope raised him, it is in no way guaranteed that he would have been raised in a way that would have given him a different approach in life. From what we know of Merope, she didn't have the best character particularly given the amortentia and the following non-con due to the love potion. In what way does that indicate a particular affinity for raising a child? Also considering that as Tom was born in 1926, she would have to have been a very firm in her parenting having the increased stigma of being a single mother in the 20s and 30s.
