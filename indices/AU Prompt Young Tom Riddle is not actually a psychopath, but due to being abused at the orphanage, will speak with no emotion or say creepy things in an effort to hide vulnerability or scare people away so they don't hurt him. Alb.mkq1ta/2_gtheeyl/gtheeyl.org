I think this is a really interesting prompt, especially considering that JKR has said before that because Tom was conceived under the use of a amortenia that Merope Gaunt used on Tom Riddle sr. that Tom wouldnt be able to feel love. I don't particularly agree with this, considering that this would essentially make a large proportion (I'm assuming here) of the wizarding population psychopaths. I like the idea that Tom simply acted the way he did because of his childhood, and so was the product essentially of nurture over nature, as I think it is such a cruel thought to have a child born into the world with a set path of never understanding or feeling love.
