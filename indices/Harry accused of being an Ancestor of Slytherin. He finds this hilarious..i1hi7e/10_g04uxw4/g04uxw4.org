That puts me in mind of the throwaway line in "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," in which it's mentioned that Zaphod Beeblebrox is the son of Zaphod Beeblebrox II, who in turn is the son of Zaphod Beeblebrox III due to an accident involving a time machine and a condom.

I'm unaware of any stories with OP's premise, but in this [[http://home.exetel.com.au/jaina/ASIAF/ASIAF.html][story]], in which Harry wins early (5th year, I think) and adopts a couple of war orphans, Harry uses that joke to explain to Dumbledore where the girls came from:

  "They're from the future," some stray whim prompted Harry to 'explain', just to see how much further he could push the usually infuriatingly all-knowing headmaster. "Something about an accident with a Time-Turner that they're not allowed to discuss for fear of causing a paradox. We've spent half the morning at the Ministry going over what can and can't be done about it with the Unspeakables."

Also, in linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter), he has a daughter who actually did come back from the future.
