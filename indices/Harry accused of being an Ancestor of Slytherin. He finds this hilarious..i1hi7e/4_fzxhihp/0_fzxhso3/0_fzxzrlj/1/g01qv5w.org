I read the second book shortly after release in Canada, and it says ancestor. I was really confused at the time at how nobody seemed the pick up on the error.

I'd swear the prophecy in that book was mangled too, I don't have the copy anymore, but it's always bothered be since I am certain the prophecy wording changed and nobody remembers it.
