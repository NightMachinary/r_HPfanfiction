Quick check on ebay, seems like $30 for a hardcover copy.

The real value (3-4 figures) is if you have genuine first editions, meaning the first batch printed in the UK. I have copies of Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secrets with typos, but they are Canadian, so significantly less valuable. The typos themselves aren't actually important.
