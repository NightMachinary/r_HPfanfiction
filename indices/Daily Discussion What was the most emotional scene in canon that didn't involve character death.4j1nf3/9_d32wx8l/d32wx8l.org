When Harry and the Twins are banned by Umbridge from playing Quidditch ever again- the run up of injustices came to a sharp point then, when Umbridge essentially trumped the Deputy Headmistress and abjectly abused her authority in a way no one could challenge. Half the scenes with Umbridge drive me mad, but this and Hagrid's first lesson truly bring visions of violence to mind.
