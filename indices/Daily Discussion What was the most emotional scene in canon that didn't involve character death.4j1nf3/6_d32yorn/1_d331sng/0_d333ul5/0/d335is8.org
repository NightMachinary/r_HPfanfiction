Well they didn't really talk about it, Harry did fantasize about winning it, who didn't? Now, I might have missed the page where they discuss it in detail, that I will admit freely. Ron let his jealously run wild, which is always below the surface, which makes it hard for me to like him....then again, I was older when I started the books and Ron was not endearing himself to me. I find him to be nothing more than an enabler of Harry's worst habits, along with Dumbledore himself. (Yes, Hermione and Harry can irk my nerves too, though Sirius was the worst offender. Sure I gasped at his death, but his death didn't shake me as others did)

I agree that racist doesn't equal evil, but Ron kinda saw it that way (of course, he never saw his own racism). He tells Harry that Slytherin is basically the house of evil, which solidifies what Hagrid told Harry. It's a bunch of hypocrisy that NO ONE seems to call out. History is repeating itself and nobody seems to wonder why! This is one of the reasons that I like the name for Harry's second child (though not the wife, too clean, too fairy tail ending. High school sweethearts is too damn cliche), also about what they discuss. Of course, the fandom seems to ignore the underlining significance of epilogue scene, just complaining about the name.
