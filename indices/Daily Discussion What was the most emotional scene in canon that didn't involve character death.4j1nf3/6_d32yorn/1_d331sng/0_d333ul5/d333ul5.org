The night before the Goblet fiasco Harry and Ron were talking about entering the tournament. When Harry's name came out, it's not too farfetched for Ron to believe that Harry got it in using the cloak or some kind of Parseltongue loophole or something. Also, Ron was 14; he underestimated the dangers of the Tournament enough that he totally wanted to enter, and he probably thought that with Dumbeldore overseeing it that nothing too dangerous would be chosen as a task.

As for being a flip side of Draco, I agree. Ron is can sometimes be unintentionally racist, what with casually mentioning how they don't talk to his mother's Squib cousin. But again, he's just human, and he's not being malicious about it. Racist =/ Evil.
