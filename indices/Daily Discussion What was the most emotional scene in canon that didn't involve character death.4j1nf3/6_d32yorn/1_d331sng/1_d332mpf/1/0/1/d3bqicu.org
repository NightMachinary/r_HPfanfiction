No I'm not, though it seems people think I am by pointing out instances where Ron's loyalty flip flops. Or when I point out that someone didn't completely read my comment. Hermione is a better example of loyalty, Ron isn't. Sure, his disloyalty is triggered by jealousy and perhaps a cursed object, but he still left or abandoned Harry when he needed his support the most. Ron does come back, but the fact that he leaves is a glaring sign. Ron allows his own jealousy to come between him and his friends. So yes, Ron's loyalty to Harry flip flops, when Ron let's his jealousy consume him, Harry becomes the enemy, that's not a good thing.
