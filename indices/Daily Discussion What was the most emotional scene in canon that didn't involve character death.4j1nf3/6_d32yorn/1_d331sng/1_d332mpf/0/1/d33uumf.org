  The same Dark Lord who wants to kill him, his family, the girl he's in love with, his best friends and really everyone else he knows. The Dark Lord that has tried to kill him and them.

Voldemort didn't try to kill his family in DH. Hell, he even allowed Arthur and Percy to continue working at the Ministry. Not that this clashes with loyalty, of course, it practically confirms it; Ron has loyalty to his family and friends, which is why he fights. And he could easily decide not to fight, to abandon Harry, and live the untroubled life of a pureblood under Voldemort's reign.

The rest of what you said in the continued argument is equally retarded; very few people would do what Ron did, especially in the wizarding world. With the Horcrux, he was a victim of circumstances - he didn't know the Horcrux was affecting him until after he left. The fact that he "took the responsibility" to destroy "wizarding Hitler", at age 17, when he could have benefited greatly from not doing so, shows just how loyal and brave he is. I doubt... no, I flatly don't believe that you would do anything of the like. But I suppose it's easy to talk about loyalty and bravery against an unbeatable monster when you sit in front of your computer screen.
