Ron and Hermione are two very different people who both have very different situations surrounding them.

Hermione basically cut ties with her family by obliviating them and sending them off to Australia. She was a direct target of Voldemort, being a Muggleborn, and thus didn't really have anywhere to go even if she did want to leave Harry.

As for Ron, a large part of his character is his inferiority complex, always being just second best. Everything he could do has already been done by his brothers. His best friend is the Chosen One, while the girl he likes is the Smartest Witch of Her Age. Compared to them, he's just the ginger tagalong.

Ron also had to deal with worrying for his family, all of whom are basically on Voldemort's shit list; most of his family was in the Order, and he knows Snape must've told Voldie about the identities of the members.

Hermione =/ Ron.

Read pg 325 of Deathly Hallows, during the destruction of the Locket, to really get an understanding of how much the Locket effected Ron.
