Again, the Horcrux was playing on his emotions. I don't know how many times I need to repeat this. Ron had very real fears that the Horcrux preyed on, more than Hermione and Harry.

The Horcrux turned Ron and Harry against each to insure its own survival. You can't keep blaming Ron for breaking when he had a fragment of Wizard Hitler toying with his emotions on and off for several weeks.

Again, the Horcrux was toying with his emotions, which led to him leaving. The Horcrux attempted to turn Ron and Harry against each other to insure its own survival- best seen when Ron is about to destroy it, and it latches onto Ron's insecurities surrounding Hermione and Harry.

I'll repeat this one more time: The Horcrux was manipulating Ron's emotions, which lead to him leaving.
