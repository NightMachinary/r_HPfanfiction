  I don't know how many times I need to repeat this.

At least once more for me. Be careful, you're bordering on snark. I'm sure you're capable of making an argument without resorting to being rude.

  You can't keep blaming Ron for breaking
#+end_quote

Yes I can. You don't get to dictate what balances morally for someone else. Ron doesn't exist in a vacuum.

We have a standard to judge Ron by: *Hermione.* She wore the horcrux and didn't leave. Why did he? She realised Harry didn't have much in the way of a solid plan and didn't leave. Why did he? I'm certain that she missed her parents and the Weasleys every bit as much as Ron did and didn't leave. Why did he?

If there were no standard available to judge Ron's actions, I would agree with your points (rudely phrased, they might be). But since Hermione was in the same spot and stuck around, then Ron's actions fall short.
