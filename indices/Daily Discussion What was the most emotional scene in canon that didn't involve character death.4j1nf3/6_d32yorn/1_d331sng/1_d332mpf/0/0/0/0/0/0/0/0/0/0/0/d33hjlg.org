We're just going to have to disagree. In my view, none of the other criteria you mentioned matters. Hermione isn't the standard because she's purported to be more intelligent, Muggleborn, or a pseudo-orphan.

Both were Harry's friends, both were committed to stopping Voldemort and the Death Eaters, but only one found the strength to see it through when the going got rough.
