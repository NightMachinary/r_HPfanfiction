Ron was also wearing the Locket Horcrux at the time, and was stressed out over how Harry seemed to be shooting blind when it came to the Horcruxes. He was also worrying about how his family was a major target for Voldemort, having been in the Order and all, and how Ginny was currently attending Hogwarts under the Snape regime.

But no, let's just focus on the fact he left, not that he had a dangerous dark artifact around his neck toying with his emotions, on a seemingly impossible suicide mission, not knowing whether his family would be safe or not, and let's completely omit the fact that he tried to return several times but failed due to Hermione's charms and shit.
