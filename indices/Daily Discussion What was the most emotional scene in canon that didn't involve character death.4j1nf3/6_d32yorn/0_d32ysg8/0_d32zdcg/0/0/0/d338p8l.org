sorry guys, beg to differ. I've never watched the movies, not all of them. And as lovely as Miss Watson is, I prefer the book Hermione, plain and shrill and bushy haired and bossy and all the other stuff. Part, in fact a lot, of why I like her is she isn't gorgeous. That's also a big part of shipping H/Hr for me. The smart plain girl would get the hero for once.
