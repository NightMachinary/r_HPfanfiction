The final chapters of PoA are such an emotional roller-coaster ride. Buckbeak's "execution", Sirius' attack near the whomping willow, the Pettigrew reveal, Harry hoping that he could leave the Dursleys, only to have this hope shattered by Pettigrew's escape, the dementor attack, Sirius getting captured, Harry and Hermione travelling back in time to help Buckbeak and Sirius escape.
