Harry Potter: How come you're not at the feast?

Luna Lovegood: I've lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.

Harry Potter: That's awful!

Luna Lovegood: Oh, it's all good fun. But as this is the last night, I really do need them back.

Harry Potter: Do you want any help finding them?

Luna Lovegood: I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

[clasps his hand comfortingly]

Harry Potter: Are you sure you don't want any help looking?

Luna Lovegood: That's all right. Anyway, my mum always said things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.

[they look up and see a pair of her shoes hanging from the ceiling arch]

Luna Lovegood: If not always in the way we expect.

Awww. This always makes me melt. Harry/Luna OTP.
