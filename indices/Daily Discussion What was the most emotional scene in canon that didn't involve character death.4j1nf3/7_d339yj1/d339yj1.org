When Lupin and Sirius meet for the first time in the Shrieking Shack, and Lupin easily forgives Sirius for believing he was the spy, and there is just a real sense of pain to me there: Lupin realising that their lives were ruined essentially because his friends, his best and only friends, had believed that he, as a werewolf, was the most likely person in their group to be a spy and betray them all, and had discussed this as a group and conspired a conspiracy which they kept from him.

Sirius and James decided Lupin was likely the spy. Because he was a werewolf. And Lupin realises this, and forgives Sirius so quickly. Lupin had every reason to believe that Sirius had killed his friends, but Sirius's belief that Lupin would do it appears to have been based on nothing but a prejudice that his friends had tried to convince Lupin they did not hold.

And it is, in some ways, such a throw-away moment in the middle of a packed scene, but it hurts my heart.
