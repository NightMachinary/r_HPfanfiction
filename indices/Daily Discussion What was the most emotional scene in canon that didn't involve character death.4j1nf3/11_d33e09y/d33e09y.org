"Always."

Snape is a divisive character: an unlikable, unattractive jerk with few redeeming features; a hero and a villain at turns; a bullied child who became a bullying adult. But in one word, one simple "always," is a world of feeling. Lily Potter was quite possibly the only person who ever liked Snape for Snape, not because he was on her side, not because she could use him, but because he was her friend.

And that was enough to make him defy Voldemort. Even if it was a horribly obsessive, selfish, one-sided love, the outcome was sad as hell. A man who could never move past his past ultimately sacrificed himself for the memory of it.
