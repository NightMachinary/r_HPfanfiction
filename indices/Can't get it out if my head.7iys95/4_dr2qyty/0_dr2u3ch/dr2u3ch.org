A goatee? What?

Also I mean you're free to picture him however you like but John Nettleship, the person Snape's teaching style and appearance is based on, was not all that ugly. Personally I think that the way we perceive his appearance in the books owes a lot to the Potter filter, since we only ever see him described by Harry, who hates him.

I mean before he hates him (at the feast in Book 1) he just says he has sallow skin, greasy hair, and a hooked nose. None of those things necessarily make a person ugly, so I'm willing to believe that seem from the POV of someone who doesn't hate him, Snape might not ever win any beauty contests, but isn't a total gargoyle either.
