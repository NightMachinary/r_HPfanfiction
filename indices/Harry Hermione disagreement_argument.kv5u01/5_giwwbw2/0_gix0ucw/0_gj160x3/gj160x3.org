It's Independent Harry which usually means that he do his own thing alone without anything or anyone linking him to Hogwarts or the Wizarding World or whatever. Since in canon Ron and Hermione mean so much to Harry to the point where he would never do something without them, it means that something has to separate them and most Indy!Harry have Harry start hating his friends for whatever reasons just so that he can go independant on everything else.
