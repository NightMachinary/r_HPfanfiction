Almost 300,000 words. It's the most slowest slow burn you will ever read. The plot twists lead to a lot of untold secrets and when everything explodes they have a pretty pretty pretty pretty big fight. Beware tho, this Harry is very out of character. But the fight and everything leading up to it made me cry.
