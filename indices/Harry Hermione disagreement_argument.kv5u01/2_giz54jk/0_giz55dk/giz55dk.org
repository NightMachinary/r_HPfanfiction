  The first time she performs the charm and it comes out negative she rationalizes it, because plenty of women took a few months to become pregnant. The second, third, and fourth time she gets a negative result she tells herself that maybe she needs fertility treatments.

  Just what the world needs, another Harry and Hermione fall in love in the tent fic. But! Hopefully this is done with heart and definitely no bashing.   They were a few spots away from the last location they were together with Ron, but it didn't stop Hermione from glancing up at the sound of breaking twigs, or the rustle of leaves, or the quieter whispers of wind. By some animal instinct, every time she glanced up he did too. He couldn't help but think of frightened deer, their ears pert and rotating, eyes focused, alert, listening for wolves. The main difference for them was that they wanted the wolf to come. His glanced away from the empty forest to Hermione's dark eyes, still searching. "He won't find us." He used the sharp tone again, he still didn't mean it that way. Her eyes moved to his, injured, her mouth bowed in pain. He felt a stab of remorse. To his surprise she moved closer to him instead of turning away. Their spheres of sadness had been separate the last few days, their moroseness quiet, however loud it felt inside his head.
