I'm in the American southeast, so maybe it's different here, but there's a ridiculous amount of child endangerment going on in the schools here right now, and they're generally still open.

Also, when I lived in the northeast, this happened at a school near me: The gym had a wall that moved to divide the room into two rooms. The wall had a safety feature, that it could move only if a person was turning the key while standing right in the spot where they could see the wall. All the teachers did as they were told by the administration and overrode this safety feature by turning the key, then hanging a weight so it seemed like there was still a person's hand turning the key, then leaving that area to supervise kids elsewhere.

One kid, a class clown, thought it would be fun to squeeze past this wall as it was moving. His backpack got caught and he was slowly crushed to death as he screamed for help, in sight of all the other kids, including the son of a friend of mine. That school didn't get shut down.

So yeah, I can believe Hogwarts didn't get shut down.
