My little school district is doing distance learning only, but nearby districts are doing various other things, including face-to-face only. I'm seeing stories from people in nearby districts about teachers telling third-graders to take off their masks and huddle close together for a class photo. This is right up there with the worst of Hogwarts's dangers.
