I do note that this incident happened in January 2001, which was not far off from the wild and wooly days of the 1990's that HP took place in.

IIRC, the modern school safety measures that kids today deal with began with the Columbine Shooting in April 1999. That started a conversation about bullying which was simply not happening before that. Bullying was taken as morally wrong on the part of the bully, but just something that happened as part of the childhood experience- maybe something that was even good for kids so they could "toughen up". No one gave a shit about it otherwise.

Then 911 happened and security really ramped up, plus continued school shootings and zero tolerance policies.
