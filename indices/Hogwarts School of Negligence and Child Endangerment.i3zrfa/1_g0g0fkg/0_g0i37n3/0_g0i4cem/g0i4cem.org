I found a [[https://www.eschoolnews.com/2001/03/01/students-death-prompts-examination-of-automatic-door-use/][little]] about the story. The school did some staff training.

I don't think the administrators got any punishment for setting the policy of bypassing the wall's safety feature in the first place.
