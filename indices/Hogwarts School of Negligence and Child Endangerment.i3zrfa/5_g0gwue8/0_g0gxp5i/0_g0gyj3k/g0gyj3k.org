Depends on whether the magic automatically reacts or if there's some manual intervention required. Lead poisoning is very subtle and may go unnoticed even if it were fixable with a super simple magical cure. Wizards aren't immune to the effects of alcohol, for example, so purely chemical substances that aren't lethal poisons but have other effects aren't automatically blocked by magic.
