Something as gradual as lead poisoning could explain the erratic and irresponsible behavior of the faculty. If wizards and witches have a tolerance to lead poisoning the students only drink the water for 7 years and they have no ill effects. But if you've been there for 50 plus years like some of the faculty have it starts to make you do stupid things.
