I think there's a difference between bodily damage and inebriation.

JKR does not look kindly upon alcohol consumption. Yet, as far as I'm aware, she does not mention any of the common long-term health consequences of alcohol.

I think the evidence points towards wizards possessing resistance towards harmful substances. Dumbledore grows up in the 1800s and is executing perfect breaststrokes with a dead hand at 115.

Mundane toxins seem harmless. JKR's pretty clear that mundane illnesses and health issues are not threats to wizard, at the cost of magical illnesses and substances that pose significant threats to wizards.
