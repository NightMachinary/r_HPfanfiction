The detail about physiology was first mentioned by Clearence's (Aurelios'? I am still confused by that plot twist at the end of CoG) care-giver (can't think of a better way of calling her) it was only implied that magicals have distinctive esthetic characteristics and even that doesn't make much sense since she never saw it in Clearence. Newt never said that he was immune to physical damage, only that forgor his name was vulnerable to it, it could easily be that he was confident that he could cast a protective spell fast enough to save himself but didn't want to risk it with another person who isn't able of using magic while he was worrying about dealing with a Rhino with an explosive horn. And I also remember what JKR wrote in Pottermore, it was in the section on healing and she directly said that wizard healing could overwrite non-magical health issues, a wizard won't be able to just ignore a scorpion poison, but he will be able to deal with it with absolutely no problem. You want to quote someone, be sure they are saying what you think.

We know that the Firebolt /can/ go up to this speed, now I ask, if there are plenty of different kinds of brooms on the game that are slower why isn't the difference more remarkable? Harry should be able to fly in circles around any other seeker. The answer is that while he can get to this speed inertia is still a thing, so if he goes too fast he won't be able to just change directions on a moment's notice when the snitch change it's path, to say nothing of things like the risk of just flying straight outside the field or the risk of him colliding on other players. And then it still doesn't answer how wizards would be able to beat bludgers around if they really are as heavy and moving as fast as you are saying, even more considering that they would need to gather velocity in the movement of the bat in relation with their bodies to prevent the buldger of just knocking the bat out of their hands while messing their balance. Either they are super-strong in and /out/ of the field or they have equipment helping them.

Fred and George managed to put a spell that protects against magic in their hats, in no moment was there said anything that suggests that there weren't spells in the clothes protecting against physical damage. I will be the first to admit that the protective spells on clothes is a HC more than anything, but the resistance thing is also a HC, the fact that it is widespread doesn't make it cannon or logically sound and I still say that my protective clothes HC is more reasonable as in it doesn't create so many plot-holes. The players use different clothing for games and it is also not addressed in the book, if the use of protective charms in clothes is widespread enough it would have been considered implicit.

And yet Draco broke Harry's nose at HBP, Neville broke his wrist at PS, Snape was bitten by the Cerberus, Umbridge felt threatened by the arrows in OoTP, Harry wasn't physically stronger than the Dursley's... I stand by what I said, either wizards are more durable than muggles and this applies to all situations or they are physically the same but have ways of solving the problem afterwards.

This wasn't even mentioned in cannon, do your research right before declaring something cannon or call it what it is as I did: *HEAD* cannon

Yeah, I did take specific situations in cannon and used it plus logic to create a theory, news flash: you are doing the same thing.
