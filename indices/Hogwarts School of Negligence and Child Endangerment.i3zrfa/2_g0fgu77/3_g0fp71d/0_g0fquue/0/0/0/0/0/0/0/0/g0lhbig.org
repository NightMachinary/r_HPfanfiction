From one side we have Lucius let's-kill-all-muggles Malfoy and from the other Arthur let's-study-their-mating-habits Weasley, no, they aren't big on respect for muggles.

They play Quidditch in a school where the nurse actually can deal with any problem caused by the game, in their houses we only see the Weasley's who don't use Buldgers (let's be frank here, without the Buldge the sport isn't much more dangerous than football) and even in school people worried that the Buldge could cause damage when it was cursed in COS, a small child being attacked in the head by what is comparatively a very, very smaller-scale buldge in an environment where there /isn't/ someone capable of dealing with any problems in seconds by someone who barely anyone in their society and government would consider even human would cause problems.

I generally regard the danger of Quidditch and it's reception by society by comparing with the punishment for thief in ancient societies. In that kind of society thief was taken much more seriously than today, with the punishment sometimes reaching even mutilation and death. But thing is, at that time it actually made sense to punish thief harder than today, there wasn't any form of global surveillance, and what they had was limited by the available technology, the time it took to pass information along, misunderstandings with the information that was passed on, politics... which made it much easier to get away with stealing; considering that there was also much less products and the production of what they had was much slower and the many problems related to distribution of food and thief become a much greater problem than it is today. All this sums up to a need of trying to curb such practice so as to not let it grow to the point of creating large-scale problems for everyone, and the way they found of doing such was using gruesome displays to create fear of the consequences for those who were caught.

It all comes down to how easy or hard it is to repare the damage and what would be the consequences if it becomes widespread, Quidditch results in a great deal of damage, but it is relatively easy to solve (taking at most one night to completely re-grow bones) so it isn't an issue, at least while there is a competent healer around, but Harry didn't have the luxury of having a healer to help him at that point, so while the injury itself wouldn't be as grave as the ones from Quidditch the reception to it would be much harsher.
