For wizards its probably not even worth mentioning. Dude, they let children play Quidditch where they regularly get hid by solid iron balls moving over a hundred miles per hour, a hit with a frying pan by a non-athletic woman isn't gonna do anything to Harry. Also wizards do look down on muggles, but they still respect them as humans deserving of protection and rights.

Also the only reason why Coroporal Punishment isn't used at Hogwarts is because Dumbledore, its not illegal.
