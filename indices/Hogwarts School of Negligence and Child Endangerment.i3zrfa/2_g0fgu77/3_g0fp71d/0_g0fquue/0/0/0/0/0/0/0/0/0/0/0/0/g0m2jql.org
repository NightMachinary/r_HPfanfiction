Well from the two one, or wizards are more durable than muggles or wizard clothes got imbued protective spell, we have about the same amount of evidence for both (almost none), so you also don't get to say fuck you to biology and physics because you feel like using the fact that the magic system was barely explained to justify child-endangerment. Between wizards being more resistant and wizards having better protection my explanation is actually more in line with biology. Of course we wouldn't see it in Quidditch through the ages, same way we don't see that wizards are more resilient, why the hell would information about clothing be at all relevant in a book about the history of a sport, even more so if such protection is the rule instead of the exception?

If the bludgers are as you describe then the beaters must be moving at a speed even higher than that, have the adequate reflex and not only be tougher than regular humans have any right to be, but also much stronger as well to be able to beat the balls in other direction when moving at full speed, the bats would also have to be enchanted to not break on contact.
