There is archaic punishment and then there is straight up murder attempt.

Now consider this, the Wizard world as a rule consider muggles more akin to animals rather than citizens, they have a history of bad interaction with muggles from at least the burnings, the second-Salemers and Obsurus in general; Harry is famous, comes from a relatively wealthy family (though I am reluctant in calling him rich without knowing if he has any regular income, how much exactly he has in liquid assets, and how much does it translates in proper purchasing power) and at least at the start well-liked by the public.

A muggle stuck him with the intent of harming using an object that could potentially end killing him, at which end of the spectrum do you think it would fall under wizard law?
