Striking a small child (less than ten years, though I admittedly don't remember the actual age) with a frying pan to the head is definitely a Big Resoundingly No as far as laws are concerned and this one is just the most potentially dangerous example I can think of from the top of my head.

If in that time period it was actually a Ok thing to do then maybe Voldemort and Grindelwald were onto something with their world-conquest plots. Yes, their new worlds would probably be even worse, but that kind of society needs to end ASAP, preferably Denis Diderot style ("Men will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest." ).
