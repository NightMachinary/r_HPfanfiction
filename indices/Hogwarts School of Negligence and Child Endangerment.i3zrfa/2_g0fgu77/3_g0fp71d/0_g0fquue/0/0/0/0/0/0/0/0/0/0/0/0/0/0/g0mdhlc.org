Actually no, I guarantee that I am equally annoyed at you for insisting that Wizards being more durable due to some supposed effect of magic that we never see (at least I hope you are not attributing it to some quick of genetic or biology because that's not how biology works).

I literally pointed many reasons to why “wizards are more durable” can't be the explanation as it would also mean that they are physically stronger than muggles to a frankly ridiculous degree and have reflexes so fast that it wouldn't be out of reality for them to be able to dodge bullets (which is very much never shown in any part of cannon and in fact have certain situations that points to it not being the case). In all senses they having equipment capable of making the game safer is much more believable than they being kriptonians as far as physical attributes are concerned.

The book describes the development of the game and it's history, but assuming that all clothing has protective enchantments then they wouldn't have any reason to put there “Oh yeah, the clothing has the same charms as all your other clothes so as to protect the players from being killed by our super deadly sport, so be sure to never play naked, Have Fun!”.

Of the two options you have to chose one, either wizards are so physically better than muggles that there is no conceivable Redon for Harry to even feel anything weaker than a cannonball to the groins as even mildly uncomfortable or cannon is actually a thing and the Dursley's don't get an excuse for child-abuse.
