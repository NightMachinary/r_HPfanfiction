You'd have a point if the frying pan actually injured Harry(or even just hit him), but as it is few people in the government would have cared to do something about it. Parents were allowed to hit their children as part of 'reasonable punishment' as long they didn't leave permanent injuries, which we know Harry doesn't have.
