Assuming it's velocity is about as high as a cannonball if not higher and that their vests have absolutely no protection? Maybe. Remember that the bludgers move at a slow enough pace as to be dodged on brooms (fast, but not really something otherworldly) and the force the balls create when at full speed is enough to only break a bone, Harry didn't suffer anything worse than that during the incident at second year despite having been bitten at full force on the arm, this, plus the fact that the beaters are capable of sending them in other directions at all imply that not only are the bludgers much lighter than we would first imagine but probably also hollow and moving at much more manageable speeds.

We also have to take into consideration that their clothes must have at least some minor kind of protection. The Weasley Twins figures out how to create protego imbued hats and they were barely out of school to say nothing of not having expressed any focus towards enchanted clothing, so it stands to reason that the clothes used specifically for a dangerous sport might have some protection to stop things from getting too bad. At a stretch it would make sense (though I'm the first to admit that it is only conjecture with little to no evidence) if every article of clothing had some protection against trauma-damage.
