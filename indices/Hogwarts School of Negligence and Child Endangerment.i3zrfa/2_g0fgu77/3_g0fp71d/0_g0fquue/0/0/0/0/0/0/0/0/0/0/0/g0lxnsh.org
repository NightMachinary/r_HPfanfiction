Bludgers move over a hundred miles per hour and are made of pure iron, we have seen several wizards get hit with them on their bare head with cracked skull at worst.

Thats significantly better than muggles who'd die instantly.

Also no, you dont get to make up some extra protections the player allegedly wear, Quidditch throughout the ages is a real book and mentions no such thing.

Harry Potter wizards are undeniably more durable than muggles and a frying pan would have barely affected Harry.
