Newt saying their physiology is different

  NEWT

  Ah, that's definitely the Murtlap. You must be particularly susceptible. See, you're a Muggle. So our physiologies are subtly different.

  Why -- why would I have to wear something like this?

  NEWT

  Because your skull is susceptible to breakage under immense force.

Rowling about Wizards being immune to scorption sting *in addition* to having access to better healing.

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; *he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula.*

Werewolves are primarily wizards, because muggles are more likely to die of their wounds.

#+begin_quote
  He also learned from the werewolves that Muggles ‘taste' different to wizards and that they are much more likely to die of their wounds, whereas witches and wizards survive to become werewolves.

We see countless scenes were Harry puts in full speed when aiming for the Snitch, hes faster than other because of his broom, but not much more, Draco for example still catches his broom at one point with his hand, And we see several scenes especially in Chamber of Secrets that show that Bludgers are faster than brooms.

There aren't distinct charms to protect against physical damage or magic, the shield charm is used for both and thats what the Weasley twins invented protective clothing with.

If Neville had been a muggle child a fall from over twenty feet would have done much more than just break his wrist, especially since he didn't know how to fall properly.

And breaking a nose doesn't mean much since thats just damaged cartilages, not any bone or muscle, there isn't any reason why increased durability would protect from it.

Snape being bitten by a magical Creatures proves nothing since it being dangerous was the reason it was put there in the first place, you notice how it's not able to get heal quickly either.

Centaurs are beings with several kinds of their own magic, obliviously Umbridge felt threatened when they were literally threatening her.
