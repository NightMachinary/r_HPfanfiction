  Actually no, I guarantee that I am equally annoyed at you for insisting that Wizards being more durable due to some supposed effect of magic that we never see (at least I hope you are not attributing it to some quick of genetic or biology because that's not how biology works).

Newt straight up says in Fantastic Beasts that Wizards have a different physiology than muggles which is why he doesn't need a helmet like Kowalski when dealing with a magical creature and why magical poison affects muggles much stronger. This is canon. Not to mention Pottemore article where its revealed that Wizards are immune to things like Scorpion poison and are much more likely to become werewolves than muggles because they're less likely to bleed out.

  I literally pointed many reasons to why “wizards are more durable” can't be the explanation as it would also mean that they are physically stronger than muggles to a frankly ridiculous degree and have reflexes so fast that it wouldn't be out of reality for them to be able to dodge bullets (which is very much never shown in any part of cannon and in fact have certain situations that points to it not being the case).

They literally have fights and play sports moving over a hundred miles per hour which is very much canon since we know that the Firebolt reaches 150 miles per hour in ten seconds and we know it's not faster than bluders and not much faster than other brooms.

  The book describes the development of the game and it's history, but assuming that all clothing has protective enchantments then they wouldn't have any reason to put there “Oh yeah, the clothing has the same charms as all your other clothes so as to protect the players from being killed by our super deadly sport, so be sure to never play naked, Have Fun!”.

Oh my god, there aren't protective charms on the clothing, the book literally describes how the sport and its equipment developed, it would be mentioned, it literally devotes a page for each ball. And again protected clothes wasn't a thing until the Weasley twins invented it. I dont care if you dont like it, the players not wearing any protective clothing is canon.

  Of the two options you have to chose one, either wizards are so physically better than muggles that there is no conceivable Redon for Harry to even feel anything weaker than a cannonball to the groins as even mildly uncomfortable or cannon is actually a thing and the Dursley's don't get an excuse for child-abuse.

Dont be ridiculous, if a bludger to the skull hurts a lot and cracks a skull they're obviously still feeling pain.

Please just google stuff you dont know instead of making stuff up, these things aren't even ambiguous in canon.
