It takes powerful enchantments to hide and protect a child, according to Dumbledore even his strongest efforts would be futile against Voldemort, so he had to resort to placing the only charm that could protect him on Harry which requires him to be accepted by Petunia.

Voldemort is a powerful wizard, now way around it takes powerful magic to protect someone from him and as far as anyone knows Dumbledore had access to the most powerful magic(other than Voldemort of course).

Like what do you think asking others would have accomplished?
