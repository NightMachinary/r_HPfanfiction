You're assuming DD knew that actual abuse was taking place, and also that the definition of abuse is is the same in the Wizarding World as in the muggle. DD knew Petunia didn't have much love for magic. I don't think that he knew Harry was missing meals, and even though Harry was missing meals, I don't think it's really meant to be to the levels fanon makes it. Canon says he was never starved, exactly. He was made to sleep in a cupboard, was he ever actually locked in, in canon? I don't think so. And there's no one outside the household who even knew about it. He was made to wear Dudley's old clothes- wizards don't know shit about muggle fashion.

So what DD would have known about was Petunia was cold to him, had him do some outside chores- I don't think all day most days to anywhere near the extent that fanon has it- and he wore baggy clothes. Ok, is that removable abuse?
