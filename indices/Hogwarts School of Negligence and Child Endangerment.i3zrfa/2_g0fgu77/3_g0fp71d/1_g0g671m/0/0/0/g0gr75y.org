I mean, the attacks on the Longbottoms happened /after/ Voldemort was dead, and Lucius was only one amongst quite a few followers that walked free. Dumbledore says exactly this in OotP:

#+begin_quote
  “You might ask---and with good reason---why it had to be so. [...]

  “My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters---and many of them are almost as terrible as he---were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.

  “I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.

  “But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. [...] Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”

I'm pretty agnostic on the whole sending-Harry-to-Petunia thing, tbh, but clearly Dumbledore assumes he has this one chance, right now and never again, and if he doesn't take it, it's gone and Harry would end up like the Longbottoms or worse (if death is worse).
