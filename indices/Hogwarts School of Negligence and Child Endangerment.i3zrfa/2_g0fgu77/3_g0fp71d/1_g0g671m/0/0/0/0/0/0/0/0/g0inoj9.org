Ok, and I'm saying that since Harry was effectively in foster care, he should have been more carefully looked after.

I'm not Dumbledore bashing. I am saying that kids need to be taken care of, and that schools are generally part of that process. The Harry Potter books either left that out intentionally or unintentionally. Either way, it sucks for Harry's character, and I don't like it.
