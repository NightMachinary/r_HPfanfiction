Yes, but there's no evidence Dumbledore or anyone in government knew of either of those instances. The twins and Ron knew, and they told Molly who may or may not have taken them seriously, but I don't think it went any farther.

I'm saying whatever Dumbledore knew about did not rise to the level of a removable offense.
