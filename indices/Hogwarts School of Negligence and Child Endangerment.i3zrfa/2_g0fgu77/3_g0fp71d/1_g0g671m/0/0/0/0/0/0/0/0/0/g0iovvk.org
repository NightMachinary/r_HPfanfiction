Next of kin is not foster care. I agree that kids need to be taken care of, I just think people are unrealistic about how much care is actually taken in the real world, when they say that this wouldn't happen to Harry irl. Especially in the 1980's and 1990's. There are tons of abused kids out there right now with far, far, more warning signs than Harry, and shit is being done.
