Mine here are not just novel length, but usually novel quality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] and it's sequel are both dark, but don't let that drive you off. It follows a badass and intelligent main character, does a lot of believable and not irritating world building, and all characters are well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] is a crossover with Marvel Cinematic Universe, drawing some plot details and information from the comics. Primarily taking place in the Marvel world, following Master of Death!Harry being magically badass and shaking things up. Also Harry becomes a magic superhero.

It has been a really long time since I touched it, and now I kinda want to reread it, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmare's of Future's Past]] is an HP timetravel Peggy Sue fic, but from what I remember is well written and very interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8187591/1/The-Savior-Child-of-the-Tardis-Son-of-a-Mad-Man][The Savior, Child of the Tardis, Son of a Mad Man]] is a Doctor Who crossover in which the Doctor, Ten I believe, raises Harry in the TARDIS, and wonderful magical bullshit happens. There's a lot of worldbuilding, as makes sense in a setting that spans as much of time and space as Doctor Who, but it's well written, and worth reading I think. It does follow the actual growing up of Harry, so it sometimes feels kind of slow, but they do pop into mad adventures all the time. Also they meet the founders and Jack Harkness hits on Salazar Slytherin. And it's hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] is a post Serenity cross with Firefly. Basically Harry shows up and does fun magic BS with the Serenity crew. It's been a while so I can't really go into to much more depth.

I will also always recommend this fic when someone asks for Harry Potter stuff. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer is by far one of my favorite peices of fanfiction ever. I've read it multiple times. Technically a crossover with Disgaea, and some elements from Silent Hill and Narnia, but no knowledge of the three are necessary. I actually ended up playing Disgaea and watching Silent Hill because of this fic.

Summary as follows: After Cedric's death, Harry and company summon a demon to kill Lord Voldemort. Except, well, when the hell is summoning a demon ever turn out just the way you planned?

Harry becomes badass, as does everyone else, training is not overdone or too cliche, everyone is well characterized, and a pretty decent romance is in there.

Sorry about all the crossovers. I really like them, and I just grabbed the top few HP fics lengthwise from my favorites. Let me know if you like them! :D

Also sorry about the huge wall of text.
