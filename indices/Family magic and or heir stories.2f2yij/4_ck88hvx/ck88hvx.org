[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger][Living With Danger]] is an obvious one. 5 books, probably a million words at this point and scheduled to be finished in October.

Harry is kidnapped/raised by Remus and Sirius and their wives (OCs) and raised with Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy and an OC. Very heavy on the family magic and heir magic.
