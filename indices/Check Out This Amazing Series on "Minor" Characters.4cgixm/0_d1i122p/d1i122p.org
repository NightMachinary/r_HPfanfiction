Oh wow. This is gorgeous. I've just read Cho's so far, but it is so beautifully written, and makes so much sense. This is why I love stories about characters we don't hear from often. As readers of the books, we fall into the black and white dichotomy that Harry/Ron/Hermione think in, even though they are just characters who are children and think in simple terms. This is the true strength of fanfiction - to fill in the blurred edges of the picture where the trio is the focus, to bring nuance to the right/wrong, good/bad framework, to bring to life the characters who are named but not given anything more than their names.

Thank you for the rec!
