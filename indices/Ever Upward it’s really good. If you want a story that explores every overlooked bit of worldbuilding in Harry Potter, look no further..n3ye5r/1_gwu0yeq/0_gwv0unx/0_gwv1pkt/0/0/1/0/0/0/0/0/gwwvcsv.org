How is it flawed? You're saying that not wanting to read a romance between a human and a different sentient creature is racism, and if you want to hold centaurs on a pedestal as an example, then you also get to include tentacle monsters, sentient trees and whatever else you can dream up. Whether there's sex involved or not doesn't change the fact that calling /that/ racism is downright insulting to PoC everywhere.

And yeah - pretty sure that any relationship concerning a centaur (or sentient tree) constitutes a kink.
