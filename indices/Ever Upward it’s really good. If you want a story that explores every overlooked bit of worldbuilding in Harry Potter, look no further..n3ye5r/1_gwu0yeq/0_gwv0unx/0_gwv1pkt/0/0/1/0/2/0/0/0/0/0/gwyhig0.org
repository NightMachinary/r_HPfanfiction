Because I have two people losing their minds over the fact that I'm not interested in a cross-species pairing, who are telling me it's exactly the same as an interracial relationship. If a goblin is a person, bully for them. I'm still not interested, and I'm not sure why you care so much.

The Flitwick thing isn't canon, but if it was I'd consider both him and Hagrid hybrids. I don't particularly care about it, nor do I want to read about it. No, I don't consider them products of bestiality. It's no different than Spock - they're all hybrids, and I guess they deserve cookies for that?

Anyway - Horse cock just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Spent all day today pulling cock at work, must've been on my mind. (It's usually called 'dacron' after one of its brand names in polite company and its stuff that looks [[https://www.swagelok.com/downloads/webcatalogs/en/ms-02-316.pdf][like this]]. And is colloquially known as, yes, horse cock. So installing it is generally referred to as pulling cock. Sadly, it isn't even the only thing I can think of with that particular nickname.)
