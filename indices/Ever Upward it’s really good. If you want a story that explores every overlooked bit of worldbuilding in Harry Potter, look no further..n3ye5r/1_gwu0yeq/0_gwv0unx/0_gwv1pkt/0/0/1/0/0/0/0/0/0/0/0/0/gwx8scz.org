So calling BDSM a kink is also bigotry? BDSM is people being people, and yet... it's a kink. You having a bad experience with a word being used improperly doesn't change it's definition.

After all, you were harping about the definition of racism - why does that one matter, but kink and fetish do not? Because it comes from me, somebody that thinks that sex is disgusting, /especially/ when a half-horse is involved?

Anyway, your self-righteousness is getting irritating. Have a nice day.
