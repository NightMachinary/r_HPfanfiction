Not wanting to read it? All well and good, I'm aro myself. Calling such a relationship bestiality, and then doubling down by calling it a fetish? Yeah, it's accurate to say that's similar enough racism.

(And if the story had romance between a sapient tentacle or tree and you called either of those scenarios a kink, it'd still be racist (or racism-adjacent) in the same way if there was no erotica involved.)
