  And if the story had romance between a sapient tentacle or tree and you called either of those scenarios a kink, it'd still be racist

Oh dear. First, fetishes and kinks are not the same thing. Second, they're not inherently bad (or even bad /most/ of the time). I mean, getting hot and bothered by touching a woman's nipple is a kink.

A kink is something that'll arouse you. A fetish is something you /need/ to get aroused. THEY ARE NORMAL. So no, calling something a kink isn't being racist or racist-adjacent.

And yeah, I'm going to stand by calling a relationship with something that has the body of a horse 'arguably bestiality' since the definition of such involves intercourse with an animal. Sentience or not, a centaur has the body of an animal.

Finally - I'm ace, and quite frankly the secrecy around the 'surprise relationship' at the end of a gen fic made so many warning bells go off it ain't funny. I asked a simple question, and in return I got a 'NO, SPOILERZ' and some fluffy shit about how it means nothing. No - just spit it out. Say what it is, and say that the romance is barely there otherwise people are going to think the worst. As I did.
