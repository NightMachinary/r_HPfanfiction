I was quoting YOU, who asked "why the fuck is sentience a big deal," in YOUR comment. I was responding. If you don't get why it's a big deal, you're either an idiot, a hypocrite, or...just a plain ol' bigot. And I am not engaging with your ridiculous false equivalences.

But if you can't acknowledge your own bigotry - you never answered whether you think Flitwick or Hagrid are products of bestiality, but I assume the answer must be yes - then obviously I'm not going to convince you to see past your self-righteousness. Anyway, you're too occupied thinking about horse cocks - and you're the /only/ one, including the author of the story, who seems to be hung up on, or even inclined to mention, horse cocks.

You are just so, so far off base in your assessment of this story, it's truly laughable. But it doesn't matter. I'm done with you.
