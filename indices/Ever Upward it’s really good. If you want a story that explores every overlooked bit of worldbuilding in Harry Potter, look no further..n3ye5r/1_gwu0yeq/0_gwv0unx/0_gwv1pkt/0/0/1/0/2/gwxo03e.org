Racist is totally apt. Maybe your avatar should be Lucius Malfoy. Do you think the same of the parents of a character like Flitwick, who is part goblin? Or Hagrid, who is half giant? They are the product of relationships between intelligent, sentient, thinking, feeling people who happen to have different genes and appearance. To call it bestiality certainly reveals the same sort of bigotry that motivated the Malfoy and Dolores Umbridges of fiction, and in our world, those who once similarly labeled relationships between those of different human races. I feel no qualms about calling it racism or calling you out for being "uncomfortable" with it - I've heard that excuse before. Get over it or keep it to yourself, but don't spread that poison around.
