I am not going to confirm or deny this for you, and your refusal to put your theories in spoiler tags is unforgiveably rude and selfish. In addition, you are completely off base and out of line in your disgusting racist descriptor, and using that term undermines the entire point of this brilliant and remarkable story, regardless of who the romantic interest is. I strongly suggest /you/ don't read the story, based on these comments, but I recommend it wholeheartedly to others. It's quite unique and beautiful, and there is absolutely /nothing/ sordid or bestial about it.
