It's mostly gen. There is a romance at the (very) end, but it isn't central - the identity of the romantic interest is, however, kind of integral to the themes of the story, and it would be both giving away a lot, and simultaneously somewhat meaningless, to disclose it before you've read it. I'm guessing that's why the author isn't clear about it. Also because, again, it's really 95% gen.

ETA: But if it matters to you either way, the story is very, very LGBTQ+ positive, and issues of...redressing power imbalances maybe? Hearing those whose voices have been minimized and disregarded... is a huge focus of the story. Romance is not; the series starts when Harry is maybe...6? and ends when he is about 14 or 15, if I remember right.
