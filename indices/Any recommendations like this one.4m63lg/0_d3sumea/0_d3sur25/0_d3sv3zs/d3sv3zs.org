Okay, thanks for clarifying.

I'm going to recommend the only damn story centered on Draco "I'm a pathetic daddy's boy" Malfoy that is good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] is a fic about Malfoy after the war, given an option different than that any of the blood purist, old money Slytherins would ever contemplate. It's incomplete, but it just updated within the last week, and the previous update was right around Christmas, and it seems like it updates a couple times every year.
