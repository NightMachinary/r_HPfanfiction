As Harry's name was read aloud in the Great Hall, the magic of the Goblet of Fire rushed to seek out Harry Potter and bind him to the contract.

+----+

2 years ago, Harry battled Slytherin's Basilisk and upon defeating it, the great beast fell to the floor, crushing his legs and pinning him to the ground. A tiny golden bird impaled on a long tooth and a lot of ash lay inside the mouth of the basilisk as it had snatched him out of the air following the loss of its eyes.

Ginny managed to awake and seeing Harry, presumed dead, laying there fled the chamber with she and Ron climbed up the pipe, leaving Lockhart to wander the chamber with no memory. Once out, no one was able to enter the chamber to recover either of them.

Waking up later on to the cries of a child, Harry discovered his predicament. Trapped and without the use of his legs, all hope was lost. But then there was the cry again 'mother, wake up, wake up' Harry looked around but couldn't see anyone, so he called out, 'who's there? I can't see you?' He heard slithering and immediately closed his eyes. A voice called 'did you do this to my mother?' the voice sounded scared and angry, but mostly scared.

Harry felt sick, just as his mother had been taken from him, he had taken the mother of this young snake. 'I'm sorry, your mother was attacking students in the school, she had brought my friend's sister down here to die, I had to save her.'

The voice of the hatchling replied with the same anger and sadness, 'It was not her, it was me. My mother could no longer fit in the pipe to the school, or the one to the lake. I do all her hunting for her. And just like when the boy came years ago, the girl came this time to tell me to assist him in purging the school.'

Harry became even more sad,' So your mother was just defending you? I am so sorry, I didn't know. But now I am dying too. I won't be able to leave here.'

The young snake replied. 'I can put you to sleep instead, just like I did to the other children.'

'You mean you intentionally petrified the children. In the school?' Harry asked with surprise

'My eyes are too young to kill like my mother's' responded the snake, if you look into my eyes, you will stay the same, until someone revives you.'

'It bears dying I guess,' Harry said.

As he opened his eyes, he saw the young snake, nearly 10 meters long coming closer. The young snake said, right before looking in his eyes, 'I now perform for you the same service that my mother did for Lord Slytherin back when she was a hatchling.'

And everything froze for Harry, he did not perceive the passing of time, but he knew he was frozen and left with the last words from the young snake.

The magic from the Goblet sunk deep into the foundations of Hogwarts, into the Chamber of Secrets where it found Harry. No longer pinned beneath the Basilisk as the body had decomposed and left just a skeleton remaining, the magic rushed through him healing him to be ready for the challenges awaiting him, waking him so that he could face them.

As if no time had passed at all, he blurted out, 'Salazar Slytherin is still alive?'
