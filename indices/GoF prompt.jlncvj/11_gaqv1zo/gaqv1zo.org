I have one in my docs that Harry is the grandson of McGonagall and is a Demon Hunter. Only McGonagall (bc she's head of both The Evans and McGonagall Clans) and ether Cho, Su Li, or Penny( bc they are dating him). A part of Tom's soul (Canon went into Harry) went to the realm of Demons and was found by Balor and together they try to unless an army of Demons on Earth.
