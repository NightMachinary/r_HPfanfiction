My dude, it's fanfic. You can explain it with any number of reasons or ways;

it could be a way of verifying that the boy who lived has really died. It could be a political move in an attempt to make dumbledore look weak/manipulative, as Voldemort can probably afford to move straight to war footing without a prophecy. Or maybe Voldemort really can't bring himself to believe that something other than him destroyed his arch-nemesis (well assuming he doesn't know it was the diary), and dumbledore's using that to convince Voldemort that there really is a chosen one still in hiding, being trained by the greatest minds in the magical world, in order to slow him down.
