Perhaps he was petrified by the Basilisk and thought dead and Voldemort, believing Dumbledore to have faked his death, has his name put in the Goblet anyways. This leads to Harry's survival being discovered and now a second year Harry needs to somehow survive the Triwizard Tournament.

Couple of notable differences:

- No/reduced jealousy from Hufflepuff. Harry obviously didn't put his name in.
- Sympathy from his fellow champions. A second year (third, I suppose) has no realistic chance of winning and only a minimal chance of surviving.
- New methods of surviving the tasks, probably.
- Difficulty making new friends. Ron and Hermione might have missed him dearly but they'll be in different classes, Harry will have to prepare for the tournament, and the age gap may come into play in terms of personality.
- No more protection at the Dursley's. His absence caused the collapse of the blood wards.
- No Sirius? Depends on how third year played out without him.
