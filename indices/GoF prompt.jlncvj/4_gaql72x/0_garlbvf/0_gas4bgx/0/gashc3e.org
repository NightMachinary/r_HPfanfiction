I think the Sirius "abduction" could work well after the Aunt Marge scene. Harry genuinely thinks he will be expelled + Sirius probably is not 100% right in the head at that point and would jump on the opportunity to have his godson on the run with him. The only thing that has to happen for this to work is Sirius realizing that Harry should be his No1 priority instead of revenge on Pettigrew.
