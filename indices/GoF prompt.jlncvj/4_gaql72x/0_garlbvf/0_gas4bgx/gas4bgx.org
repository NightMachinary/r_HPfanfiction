Imagine that the news of Hogwars come to light during the yearly inspection of Azkaban by the minister and have Sirius get his shit together earlier.

After Harry defeats the Basilisk, he meets Sirius and he convinces Harry to get the hell out of Britain and hang out in the Carribian or somewhere like that, relaxing in the sun, as Britain panics.

Then we can have GOF where his name comes out, and either have him forced to compete, with a mental state that is far healthier due to actually having a good parental figure in his life.

Post GoF, he gets hell out of there, when he sees Fudge going full conspiracy lunatic, probably hides under a Fidelius where Remus is the secret keeper or something like that, where Sirius is Remus secret keeper.

Britain goes down in flames
