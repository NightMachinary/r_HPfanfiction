Ok, so rather than Harry being petrified by the basilisk, I have an idea.

Harry deals with the basilisk and Tom Riddle and helps Ginny get to Ron. He remembers how everyone treated him and either becomes bitter or panics. He refuses to go back to the school and instead abandons it. Ron sends him his stuff under the guise of bringing it to the Dursleys, with the help of Dumbledore, who knows. Harry ends up being trained by some teacher or tutor or whatever in private, and everyone presumes he's dead because that's what Dumbledore tells them.

Fourth year is around the time Harry is convinced to stay at Hogwarts, even if he remains hidden. Because of this, Dumbledore tells who he thinks is Moody that Harry's still alive, and fake Moody tells Voldemort.

Harry's name comes out of the goblet, there are cries of outrage, and Dumbledore sends Snape to retrieve Harry (This is under the assumption that either Harry and Snape have some sort of bond {Perhaps mentor-student or a parental bond} or Snape is able to fight Harry properly) Harry ends up being dragged back to the school, and is revealed to be alive.

There's public outrage, naturally, but when Harry tells them why he didn't want to return, some people are better about it.

that's all Ive got, though, sorry
