Idk. Maybe Harry hid in the chamber until it was agreed? Or even that Dumbledore thought he was dead then is told he is, in fact, not? Maybe when Harry was sent his letter for the school year, he declined to return to classes, and by the time anyone found out, he was disenrolled from Hogwarts. Maybe he never even got his letter to continue Hogwarts, considering how he was supposed to be dead.

I don't know. It was kinda a write and go.
