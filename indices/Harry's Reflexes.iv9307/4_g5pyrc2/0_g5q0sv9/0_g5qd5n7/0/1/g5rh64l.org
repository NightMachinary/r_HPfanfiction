I've always had this head canon where the Trace doesn't automatically send out a letter unless it's something serious. For example, hovering a pudding in front of several Muggles (it wasn't mentioned in the letter, but I feel like it would be taken into consideration none-the-less), or casting a rather conspicuous spell such as the Patronus Charm. The Ministry didn't mention anything about the Lumos Harry used in PoA, even though they had just detected him blowing up Marge; same for the Lumos he cast to find his wand (another subject entirely), even though they probably would have loved to nail him with anything they could get.
