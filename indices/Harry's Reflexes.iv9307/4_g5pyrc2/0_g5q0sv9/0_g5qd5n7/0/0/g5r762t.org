Got that's even worse. Like, not saying it's fine to try and hit a 15 year old, but a 12 year old is a lot more defenseless.

Also, the entire underage magic/Trace thing in canon is never really explained well and has so many holes in it. They can detect House Elf magic, but not realize it's a House Elf's so blame it on Harry. But then there are a bunch of adults using magic around Harry at Number 4 in later books and that's fine. But there's a part in canon (I think) that explains that they can't detect specifically underage magic, just magic that happens to be around a child, so kids from wizarding families can freely do magic at home and the Ministry doesn't know if it's them or their parents. So they leave the parents to discipline their children if they use magic outside of school. So why not when the Order use it around Harry at Number 4?
