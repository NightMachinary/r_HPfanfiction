There's that, Harry running away from Dudley and his friends when they go "Harry Hunting" (not sure if it's explicitly stated but it's implied they beat him up), and I think OotP has Petunia try to hit him with a frying pan she was washing, which he dodges. Oh, and Vernon encouraging Dudley to hit Harry with his Smelting's cane. There might be more but while they likely didn't beat him senseless there was definitely some level of physical abuse towards him.
