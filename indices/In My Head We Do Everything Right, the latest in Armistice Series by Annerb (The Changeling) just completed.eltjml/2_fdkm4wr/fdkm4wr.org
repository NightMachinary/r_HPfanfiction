Can't wait for part 4 of the series, especially considering that the best subplot (where Harry always ends up in the Death Chamber) hasn't really been resolved.

Annerb is one of the best authors out there, so I would also recommend their AU mystery-romance [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16044434/chapters/37454639][we can't control (watch me unfold)]]. IMO, it's on par with the Armistice Series, if not even better.
