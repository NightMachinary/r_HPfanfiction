I read The Changeling when it was first published, and didn't realize then that sequels were coming. When I discovered them, did a re-read of The Changeling and blew through them.

I strongly recommend a re-read of The Changeling before you pick up the sequels. There's a lot about Ginny's relationships with her friends in the original that play into the sequel and it was good to remember those backgrounds.
