It's also inspired by the image of Genies- billowing smoke from an oil lamp supporting an upper torso. Generally speaking, someone trying to fly is less likely to need their legs until they need to land. The actual description from book 7 is a trifle vague:

  And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or Thestral to hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again
#+end_quote

So, was JKR being mostly poetic to describe the grace of Voldemort's flight, or was he literally a rolling cloud of black smoke, with only face and hands fully-formed as those parts were needed the most?

BTW - in the films, the Order travels in clouds of white smoke. Battle of the Ministry shows it best. There is a bit of evidence in the earlier films that someone fully Disapparating or Apparating leaves a little wisp of smoke at the center when they do it. That is all at the filmmaker's discretion, so it isn't strictly canon.
