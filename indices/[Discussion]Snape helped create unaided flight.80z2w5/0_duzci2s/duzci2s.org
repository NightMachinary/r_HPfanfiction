  This is, essentially, levitation applied to your feet, which is AFAIK impossible normally

Thats not true. quidditch through the ages mentions that levitation can be used like this but people weren't happy with only hovering a few feet above the ground and invented things like brooms and flying carpets to be able to actually fly without becoming birds.

The unaided flight has to be much more than levitation applied to the body.
