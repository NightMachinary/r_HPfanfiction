They're saying the sentence structure doesn't flow right. It reads as if the person who wrote it isn't overly familiar with the language.

It's minor things that seem just off. Like usage of passive voice that makes it feel more translated than native. Things like the opening two sentences. The first one, the word order just feels wrong. The second one is a fragment.

Then the second sentence of the letter is a run-on.

A lot of it feels like something that was run through a translator app rather than something that was composed in English. Short, choppy sentences with odd word order and a lack of understanding of comma usage are two of the trademarks of ESL writers.

Popping randomly to Chapter 13. It's opens with:

"There were standing outside an old pub that's sign read the Leaky Cauldron."

Apostrophe usage arguments aside that sentence isn't...technically...wrong. (It is, but I don't feel like typing out a grammar lesson about subject agreement and apostrophe usage). But it's just poor. Something better would be along the lines of:

"They were standing outside of an old pub The sign on the wall indicated the building was known as The Leaky Cauldron."

I could go into a stylistic commentary on certain things, like why even bother using a separate clause to identify the building because that's not usually how narration or thinking works and there's no grammatical reason to have the subject be 'pub' then identify it in a secondary clause. But that would be more of a discussion on my opinions of style and not something that you may agree with.
