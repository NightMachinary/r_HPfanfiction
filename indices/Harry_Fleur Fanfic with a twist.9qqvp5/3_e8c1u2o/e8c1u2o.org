I don't know why everyone's saying your summary sucks. It's a bit cheesy with the "bond of love, bonded for eternity" bit (you use bond three times, I'd reword that, it sounds repetitive), but overall, it provides a pretty decent picture of what to expect: a somewhat sappy, emotionally-driven Harry/Fluer fic with Dumbledore playing a positive (possible mentor-like) role.

Maybe the people that didn't understand that needed a picture or a powerpoint presentation or something; I dunno.

As far as tropes go: that word is really overused a lot. It means nothing. If your writing and plot structure is good, then any so-called "trope" will be overlooked.

As far as your story: it's not really my thing. However, I read the first chapter. I think you use descriptors very well; the adjectives are often well placed, vivid, and give a real sense of the event that's happening.

I was not, however, a fan of the character's motivations: for example, at the very start, Petunia enters with a change of heart and there's no build-up for it; which isn't really something I enjoy. One more thing that bothered me was that you don't denote some conversations with a comma at the end (I glanced at chapter 16, you don't do it there either).

So, for example, you have: "I know" Aldrich agreed... ; it should be "I know/,/" Aldrich agreed. It's not a major thing, but if I was reading, I would find it bothersome.

I'm actually curious, is english a second language for you? Don't take that as criticism -- it's not, at all -- but some of the sentence structure sounded more like french...or maybe spanish...a romance language.

Anyway, that's my two cents. Hope you keep on writing! You're doing pretty good; obviously a lot of people are following/enjoying, so keep it up!
