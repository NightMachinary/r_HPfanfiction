  But that's exactly what i'll do

I think that's what everyone here does. Look at the description/tags and go through a mental checklist, For me, said list looks roughly like:

#+begin_quote
  Any Malfoy?

  Snape?

  Voldemort?

  Any other Death Eater?

  Angst?

  Tragedy?

  Hermione/any Weasely?

  Remus Lupin?

  Neville Longbottom?

  Albus Severus?

  Happy Weasley family?

  Hermione bashing?

  Kids in "true love"?

  Less than 1k words/chapter?

If the answer has been no all across the board, I'll consider the story.
