As with your last post, tell us something about your story and don't just leave us with a vague description. It is impossible to tell what the overall setting of that story is (TWT? 5th year? 6th year?) and where this story is going other than the fact that romance will play a predominant role.

Because I will point out once more, that description sounds like a "worst of bad tropes" collection and "Matched only by the bond of love" sticks out like a sore thumb there.
