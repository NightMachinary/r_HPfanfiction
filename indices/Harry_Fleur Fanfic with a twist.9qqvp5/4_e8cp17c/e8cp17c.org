I really like your story, but one thing that you may want to take into account is putting slightly longer chapters out(maybe around 6k-7k words) even if it means taking an extra few days for the chapter to come out. I'm pretty sure that many would not mind waiting a couple extra days or even an extra week if we get longer updates.

Edit: week, as in a singular week. Not weeks.
