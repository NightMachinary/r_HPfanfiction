JKR wanted Harry to be a quintessential hero and those rarely seek revenge, or when they do it is as an obstacle they must overcome, heroes are normally superhuman in the way they can forgive like that, making that journey believable is a challenge(see Luke Skywalker mirroring Anakin)

And the Dursley's were caricatures, until the series became made for YA and then they became awkward.

I think these stories have these.

linkffn(8704528) - Here he's basically Tom 2.0 it has a quite believable downward spiral.

linkffn(12867536) - Here he eventually becomes worse than canon Voldemort, and Daphne, who he marries helps him along. It's quite disturbing in many, many aspects. I have only read the first one and the last one but it's well...see for yourself.

There are many, many others but I don't remember them, in many other people take revenge, in others Harry just outright kills them, I recall one where he obliviates them of his existence and some other things and just leaves them there, in others he ruins them.

I prefer the ones where he just leaves them to whatever fate awaits them without the blood wards protecting the house. It seems poetic, their lack of love condemns them.
