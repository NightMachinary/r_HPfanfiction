Well, here's an idea for you-the final battle took place at Hogwarts. What happened at the ministry in the immediate aftermath?

Another covers the months following the event. Harry becomes an auror, Hermione's parents are AWOL in australia, the Dursleys are still in hiding, Luna embarks on an adventurous creature-finding tour etc... What happens during that time?

In the long term, what are the general repercussions of having such a massive shift in the magical world's balance of power? How does it play out in England and elsewhere, with the Dark Lord gone? What happens to the pureblood movement? Do other Dark Lords rise and fall? How do they do so? Why do they do so?

Plus, how does the wizarding world change with the advent of the 21st century?

There are a /lot/ of themes you can play off here-and that's with canon events remaining in play. The only restrictions canon really imposes is that the epilogue details still have to happen. Otherwise, you're free to play.
