Yes, you've help quite a bit. I had overlooked what would happened to dementors. I've started outlining a way to bring werewolves into the fold, trying not to just force it without saying much. I was planning on making goblin-wizard relations a pivotal plot point in one of my stories. You've also made me think about vampires. they are mentioned in passing a few times, but never elaborated. Should I go for the ultra classic vampire? (garlic, crucifix, fear of the sun). I guess I am just looking for loose ends. The thing is, I am trying to make a continuation fic that stays as canon as possible. JK Rowling has a habit of mentioning something in passing a few times and them WHAM! It's a large plot point. Hell, legilimency had been noted in first book and wasn't elaborated on until OotP.
