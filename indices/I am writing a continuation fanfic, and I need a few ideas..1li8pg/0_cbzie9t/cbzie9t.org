WARNING: SOME SPOILERS MENTIONED. just to avoid an angry mob of people yet to finish reading the books.

It'd be a bit interesting to see exactly what happened to the Dementors after the war. Kingsley disbanded the use of them as guards at Azkaban but it wasn't really clarified as to what happened to them. Obviously the nasty bugger can't just be left to their own devices.

There were also mentions of wizard-goblin relations, giant-wizard relations, and werewolf-wizard relations. The werewolf one would be really interesting, with Fenrir and Lupin gone, what would become of the werewolves. Did they all fight for Voldy or did some separate from the pack? After Fenrir's actions, did the relations worsen or did it push Kingsley to improve them? It could be really interesting.

For prophecies you have: "...and none will come after..." spoken by a young woman "...at the Solstice will come anew..." spoken by an old man. Those are two that I found. Both were smashed ones.

The thing is, you might need to be more specific as to what you're writing about because what you're asking can be very broad. Any little meaningless thing can become a huge plot-device/mover depending on how one interprets it.

Good luck with your writing! Hope I helped a bit.
