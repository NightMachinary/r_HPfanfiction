This idea bounced around in my head after trying to read "Harry Potter and the Secret of the Golden Unicorn". Reading that story I gradually got annoyed that everyone was being very dark with a whole lot of sadistic torture being done by the "good guys" and no repercussions for it. I also read Dresden Files around that time and wondered what if some of the rules of the later applied to Harry Potter verse:

"What makes Unforgivable Curses so special?"

What if: Magic always has a balancing effect with spells having a sort of backlash against that which is used to produce them. Sort of a variation on the natural laws of physics about equal and opposite reaction. With most spells, this backlash is absorbed and dissipated by the wand. Unforgivables are special because they take direct mental and emotional focus - and the backlash is directly against the mind of the caster. Like with many brain injuries, it is not immediate as the brain rearranges and adjusts itself over time(months/years) in response. Back at the time when the laws about Unforgivables were enacted, the effect was known. With time the true reasons for the law became obscure.

What if those spells were declared Unforgivable because every time a wizard casts them, they begin a gradual and subtle process of rewiring their mind/personality to become more psychotic, with variations based on the spell used. Crucio would gradually turn a caster into a sadist. Imperius would bring out desire to control and dominate. The death curse would steer them to serial murder.

Tagline: How would a country that has forgotten the true danger of their most potent weapons survive the aftermath of a war when even their most respected heroes are already being corrupted from inside?
