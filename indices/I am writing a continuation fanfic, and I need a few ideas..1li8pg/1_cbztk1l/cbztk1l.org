A brilliant continuation Fan-fic.

Harry returns to Hogwarts after the war to complete his 7th year, and gradually begins swimming in the Great Lake during the early mornings as a way of getting some exercise. As repeated weeks go past, Derrick begins swimming with him.

Who is this small felshy creature? Why does he only have 4 appendages when Derrick has many? And how can he leave the water. And so begins a romantic comedy brolationship between Harry & the Gigantic Squid (never becoming more than a PG), including Harry stopping first years from throwing stones at him because he's 'scary', the Chosen One gallantly saving The Tentacled One from certain death by choking on a wanton burnt slice of toast that is unchewable, and nobody can ever forget the time that Harry learnt how to surf as Derrick propped him up on a tentacle and glided him through the water.

Come back and tune in again next week True Believers!
