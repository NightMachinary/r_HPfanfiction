The wizarding world has a lot of rebuilding to do.

Everyone in the ministry is either inexperienced or a collaborator. The old death eater families still hold most of the money and prestige. And the ministry was pretty corrupt before this started: even Arthur Weasly was willing to trade pardons for quidditch tickets, and he's one of the more honest ones. They survived that before, but it'll be harder now.

They have a massive list of suspects to deal with, some of whom are guilty as sin, some were imperiused, some were pretending to go along for their safety, etc. And then there are the good guys who still used unforgivable curses and other evil tactics during the war. Though it's not clear they can do anything: their prison system is wandering the countriside eating random people's souls.

A lot of people who suffered under the dark regime will be looking for vengence, and for many of them any slitherin will do. Or any werewolf.

In short, it's looking pretty dark. As bad as the aftermath of most real-world civil wars.
