Antioch Peverell died violently and ignominiously the very night he was given the Elder Wand.

Cadmus drove himself to suicide via Resurrection Stone, and his entire line devolved into a bunch of inbred squibs that found its end in a psychopathic megalomaniac.

Ignotus seems to have gotten a good deal, but we know that the Potter family, despite seemingly being a prolific one, is down to one individual plagued with misfortune by the time our story starts, hunted for the majority of his youth by Cadmus' heir. Technically speaking Harry Potter also dies in the end.

The Death in the stories is obviously not very benevolent.

It seems to me Harry dying while in possession of the Hallows broke whatever curse was attached to them that was plaguing the Peverells and their descendants through the generations.
