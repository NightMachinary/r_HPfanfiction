I'm aware that she's taken her stories down. However, I'm just interested in knowing whether anyone has had ANY recent contact with her and if so, whether they can forward me her contact info? Her Hotmail account seems to be disused and her old wixsite defunct. As a last resort I'm hoping to find someone that at least has the 3rd part of the Ichor series saved themselves and if they'd be willing to share. I actually have one of the earlier, unedited versions of the story up to chapter 10 or so saved on my computer but I'm looking for a newer edition.
