Thanks but I have a hate/love relationship with hp:mor. On the one hand it was my first fanfic but on the other the writing ranges from preachy to pedantic at best. Not to mention a lack of believable characters while confusing convoluted schemes as plot. However, fans of it might like to know that someone out there has the free time and dedication to make a 'series' out of it via Sims 3. [[http://www.youtube.com/user/SamPotter041009][Link]]
