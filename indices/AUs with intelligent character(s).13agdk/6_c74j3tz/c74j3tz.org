The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave (complete) The BEST fanfic I have ever read, Harry is very studious and it is overflowing with magical theory and such. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]] (Beware: the whole series is about 6 times the length of the actual harry potter series)
