Sometimes.

For me it really depends on how much I enjoyed it up until the point it was abandoned.

I also think that there's a weird line, which I only found myself maybe a week ago, where you love a story so much, you just enjoyed the time you had with it.

I've almost always had the experience of reading an abandoned Fic, and then being upset there wasn't more, but recently I read one that I just enjoyed so much that I didn't even care it hadn't been updated since '07. Sure I'm sad it won't ever have an actual ending, but I loved every minute I spent reading it, and that's enough.
