I am similarly perplexed by someone's not being able to enjoy an incomplete story. After all, we all are required do this with our favorite series, /Alex Verus/, /Dresden Files/, /Game of Thrones/^{†} , etc., where upon completing each volume, while we might get a small measure of closure, open questions remain. Do those who cannot enjoy an incomplete story also hold off and wait for a series to be completed before beginning?

^{†} Not a personal favorite; GRRM showed himself to be quite the asshat when I met him, which makes it hard for me to enjoy the series.
