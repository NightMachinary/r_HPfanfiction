Agreed. I read a few abandoned stories when I first started reading ff and I was very disappointed that they didn't have an ending. Now, I don't even bother to open it if it's not complete or updated within the later month. I do have about 5 stories that are abandoned by still favourited, because they really were that good, but that just makes their incompleteness worse...
