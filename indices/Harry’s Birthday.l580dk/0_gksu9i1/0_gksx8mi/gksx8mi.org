I always loved the little nugget JKR gave us. Trelawny says she's descended from the great Cassandra Trelawny.

Cassandra is the Seer is greek myth who's prophecies were never believed until they came to pass. The foresaw the Trojan horse but was ignored and cast aside.

Crash course. She prayed to Apollo, wanted to become a priestess and promised anything in return. She meant gold or shit like that. Apollo wanted sex. She refused. Apollo cursed her so that her prophecies would always be horrible and entirely correct but no matter what nobody would believe her.

To summarise: Apollo's a dick who can't handle rejection and so, in a fashion that shows his immaturity amazingly well, he curses this poor girl with horrible visions of\\
a future she couldn't stop just because she didn't want to fuck him. Prick.
