Since we have a post response already stating when the the best time is mathmatically...

Personally I would say Monday, followed by Wednesday. I say this as a person who works in an office setting and is fairly effiecient. I normally end up reading a fanfic on monday as I work over time and check up on various things monday evening. Wednesday, since I worked over time Monday and Tuesday means I can goof off more openly, and read during legitimate work hours as long as I keep on top of D2D actions. (which in honesty take around 1-3 hours depending on what happened when I left.)
