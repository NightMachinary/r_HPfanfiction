Ok, then here it goes a few. linkffn(The Lies that Bind; Harry Potter and the Homecoming; Valeriana Natassa; Eclipse of the Sky; Earl of the North; La Puissance est le Contr√¥le; The Prince by Lord Dobby Black; Wind Shear; Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun; Porcelain Doll; Resurgence)

There's a few that could be argued about the girl NOT being exactly dark, but more leaning towards grey. So check this list with a grain of salt. Personal opinion for what you actually and should start reading is The Lies that Bind and HP and the Homecoming (Its, so far, a 4-part series that should go over for about 3 or 4 more books. The slope to darkness is impressively detailed and "logical")
