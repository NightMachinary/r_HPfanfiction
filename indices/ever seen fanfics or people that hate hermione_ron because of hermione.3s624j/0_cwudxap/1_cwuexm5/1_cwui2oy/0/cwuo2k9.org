How did Skeeter destroy Hermione or Harry's lives? Hermione received terrible letters (the senders are at fault as well as Skeeter) and a smaller chocolate egg (Mrs. Weasley shares the blame as well). Students teased Harry for his supposed sensitivity (kids bullying each other isn't new). Hagrid was outed as a half-giant, although that should be evident from his large stature. Thankfully he kept his job.

However, none of that adds up to Hermione needing to work outside of the law and committing serious crimes. She kept someone trapped in a jar for at least several days-she imprisoned Skeeter in the hospital and then we still see her in the jar on the train. We don't even know when she was released. Hermione goes on to blackmail her later. That's fucked up. It really is. Although I like Hermione, JKR did /not/ think that through. Jesus, would you want to be forcibly locked up for an unknown period of time with or without food?

As for Marietta, the curse was poorly thought out. A nonpermanent version should have been used. Also, she should have told people about it, either before they signed it or after. That way, it would have been a deterrent as well instead of just a (permanent) punishment and (permanent) branding of the leak's (an adolescent's!) face. Again, why didn't Hermione get in trouble for this? Your kid comes home permanently disfigured and... nothing happens? How would you feel to forever be branded and visibly scarred by a mistake you made as a child? Something you did because you thought it would help your mother. I bet Umbridge (an authority figure) was putting the pressure on Marietta real hard.

Try to put yourself in the recipients' shoes and imagine those things happening to you. I guarantee no one would sign up for that stuff.

Look, I really like Hermione as a character. Doesn't mean I have to think she's perfect. Doesn't mean I should ignore the fucked up things she's done. It rounds her out instead of making her a Mary Sue.
