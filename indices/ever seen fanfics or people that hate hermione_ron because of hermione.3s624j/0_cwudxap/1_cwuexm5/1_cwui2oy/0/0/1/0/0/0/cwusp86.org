From another thread:

  I tend to view the laws of wizarding Britain to be an off-shoot of English law rather than a completely separate legal system. English common law was well-established before the Statute of Secrecy (some cases like the Six Carpenters Case 1610 are still usable precedent), and I think for the vast majority of areas of law the magical world doesn't really need to reinvent the wheel.

  So I would expect, for example, that contracts in magical Britain must have the same essential elements as Muggle contracts: offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to be legally binding, and certain terms. Judgements from Muggle English courts as to the minutiae of contract law would apply in wizard court (as persuasive but not binding precedent, just as Canadian cases can be brought as precedent in English courts).

  But the Wizengamot will have established its own precedents and the Ministry will have passed its own legislation which adds to and adapts the Muggle law to take magic into account - for example, law relating to the use of magically binding contractual terms (for example, since you can't make a contract for your own death in the Muggle world, one imagines by analogy that Unbreakable Vows are considered illegal by the Ministry).

  Similarly, when it comes to criminal law, I expect that the crimes in question are essentially the same: assault, battery, murder, etc. They can have the same definition as the Muggle crimes. It's just that there will be a body of magical law that adds to Muggle criminal law. For example, it's likely that the definition of "grievous bodily harm" is different in the magical world, given the way you can reattach limbs, regrow bones etc. It seems likely that it will be defined in some way relative to permanent injuries/dark magic. And obviously wizards have certain unique crimes such as use of the Unforgiveables on humans.

  I actually think the area of law that will differ most is public law (aka constitutional and administrative law). The wizarding government obviously has a different structure to the Muggle one. It's an interesting question to consider if European Union law applies at all in wizarding Britain.

  I really doubt that there are any lower courts than the Wizengamot, however. The population doesn't seem large enough. Rather, I think most trivial infractions will be dealt with by the executive branch in a hearing by panel. An example of this would be underage magic.
