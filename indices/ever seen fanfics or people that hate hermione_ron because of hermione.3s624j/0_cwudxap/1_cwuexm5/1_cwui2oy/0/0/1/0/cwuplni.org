We don't know that. It's perfectly possible that Harry could have sued the Daily Prophet for libel and he simply didn't want to or didn't know he could.

And even if he had done so, he may well have lost the case. As the alleged return of Voldemort is a political matter of public interest, it could very well fall under the Reynolds defence (old law) or publication of a matter of public interest (new law).
