  R v Saker [2012] 1 Cr.App.R. (S.) 16

  Appellant discovered that her 18-year-old daughter was taking drugs and that property had gone missing. Her daughter told her that she had been obtaining drugs from an older man, who was putting her under pressure to give him sexual favours in exchange for drugs. The appellant and the victim's former boyfriend tied up the victim and detained her in her room for about 25 minutes. The appellant encouraged her co-defendant to hurt the victim. Appellant, of previous good character, pleaded guilty to false imprisonment. Sentence of 12 months imprisonment upheld.

25 minute imprisonment to stop her daughter taking drugs resulted in a year long prison sentence.

Note that is just false imprisonment, not kidnapping, which is considered more serious.

But Hermione's real problem is that a) the imprisonment was for a relatively long time b) she used the imprisonment to extort Skeeter, which means she comes under the following sentencing guidelines:

  At the top of the scale comes the carefully planned abductions where the victim is used as a hostage or where ransom money is demanded. Such offences will seldom be met with less than 8 years' imprisonment or thereabouts. Where violence or firearms are used, there are other exacerbating features such as detention of the victim over a long period of time, then the proper sentence will be very much longer than that. At the other end of the scale are those offences which can perhaps scarcely be classed as kidnapping at all. They very often rise as a sequel to family tiffs or lovers' disputes, and seldom require anything more than 18 months' imprisonment, and sometimes a great deal less.
