That's not how it happens here. 8 years for kidnapping a criminal? That's what you get for killing said criminal in the heat of the moment. As an adult. Given the circumstances, you might even get away with 8 years for premediated killing.

And as a minor? As I said, I doubt she'd even see the prison.
