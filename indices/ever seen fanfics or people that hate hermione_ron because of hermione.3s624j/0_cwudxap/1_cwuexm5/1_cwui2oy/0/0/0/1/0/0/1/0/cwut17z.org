Serious crime? Maybe. But a ton of mitigating circumstances.

Int he real world, this would be a teenage girl catching an adult spying on her with bugs placed all around her dorm and school and then imprisoning her for a few days. Excessive? Yes. Criminal? Yes. But I honestly doubt anyone would sentence her to even a year in prison given what Rita had done to her.

I honestly can't think anyone would try her as an adult for dealing with Rita like that.
