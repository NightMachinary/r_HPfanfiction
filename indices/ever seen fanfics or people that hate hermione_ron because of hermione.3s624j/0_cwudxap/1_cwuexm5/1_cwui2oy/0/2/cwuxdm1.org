Call me Machiavellian, but you have to consider the broader context. Hermione's life had been in grave danger many times by the end of the fourth book when she imprisons and blackmails Rita Skeeter (the troll, the basilisk, Remus as a werewolf). She has also just been informed that Voldemort has returned to life. Hermione must know that she is marked for death due to her friendship with Harry and being a Muggleborn. Under these circumstances, half measures are unacceptable.

Hermione should be judged according to the standards applicable to a soldier or a spy, not those of a child. Under those standards, her actions are perfectly reasonable.
