Concerning Rita, I have reason to believe that she was blackmailed into trashing Dumbledore and Harry by Lucius Malfoy. Like Hermione, he probably found out about her Animagus abilities, and after blackmailing her, instructed Draco to supply the beetle with information, as we witnessed him do (do you really think Rita would have exposed her Animagus status to Draco /willingly?/ I don't).

But, of course, in Hermione's mind she is the judge, jury and executioner.
