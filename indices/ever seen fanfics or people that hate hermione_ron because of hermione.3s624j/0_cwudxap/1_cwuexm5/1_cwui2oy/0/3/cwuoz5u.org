Rita didn't care at all what her lies caused. Getting imprisoned for a few days was actually less than she deserved - don't forget she was also a criminal. And she aimed her poison at children. If I'd be in her place, I'd be glad for escaping justice thanks to Hermione.

Marietta might have been under pressure. That still doesn't mean she should have done what she did. Allying herself with a monster like Umbridge has consequences. Lethal ones, later in the war.
