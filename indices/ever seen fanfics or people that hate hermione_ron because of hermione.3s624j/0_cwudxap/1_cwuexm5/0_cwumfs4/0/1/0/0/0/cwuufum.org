I disagree on all three counts. 1. Hermione Granger developed a healthy disdain for rules way back in the first book. 2. Malfoy, despite being a jerkass snobby rich kid, hasn't actually been all that effective at harming Harry, Ron, or Hermione. 3. Dumbledore is smart enough that the 'almost' in your question is (in my opinion) due to him knowing what's going on. He knew that Snape had to kill him. He also knew that Malfoy straight-up failing would result in 3 dead Malfoys. Dumbledore is ALL ABOUT second chances and whatver.
