The fanfiction portayal of Hermione is far, far worse than canon Ron. There are many stories with Hermione that I can't read since the author pretty much just wanks over how awesome she is the whole time, and how Harry can't do anything without her. I can read about Ron just fine when the story isn't an implicit bashfest. Reading about him being a good friend can be quite entertaining, moreso than anything involving Hermione.

So yes, if you're looking for someone who hates Hermione more than Ron, I'm right here.
