I have read a few Ron/Pansy stories that were quite good. Most of them start out with the break-up of Ron/Hermione.

That said, most authors who write Ron/Hermione -> Ron/Pansy don't hate Hermione. They just recognise that being boyfriend and girlfriend at 17 is not the same as being a couple at 21 or 22 and that Ron and Hermione have fundamentally different interests.She is an intellectual who will drag him to a ballets show and lectures on philosophy while his idea of cultural education is being able to remember the final results of all the Quidditch World Cup games ever.
