The problem with a story like this is that there really seems to be no reason why she isn't good enough that doesn't stem from either blood purity or her Know-It-All waspishness which she mostly sheds half-way through First Year (though there are plenty of bashing fics that make use of it throughout all seven years).

I mean, what else is there to find fault with? The fact that (we assume) she would be someone who wanted to excel in her profession and not give up as soon as she became a mother?
