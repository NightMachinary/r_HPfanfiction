I'm not sure if the fics I know qualify because I don't think it ends up with hermione/ron hate but I know a few that delve into Hermione's character in not a good way that are really good reads. The top one is Caveat Inmici (make sure you read the note at the end) linkao3(681510) Most of the fics I read are very much Hermione-centric but that one goes pretty deep into her flaws. Truth, Amends, and Reconciliation is hard on Hermione's actions linkffn(5537755)
