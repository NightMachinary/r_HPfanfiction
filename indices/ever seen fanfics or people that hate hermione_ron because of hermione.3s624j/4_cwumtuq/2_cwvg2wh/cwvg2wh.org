Although I generally read stories where she is the protagonist, I do ocassionally read fics with other protagonists, and I have seen her bashed quite extensively. From manipulating Harry into a relationship with Ginny in exchange for part of his fortune (without the messy marriage bit for her) to poisoning house elf owners indiscriminately. I've also read several one fic where she became a dark lady and impirius'd Harry and killed Ron for trying to free Harry.
