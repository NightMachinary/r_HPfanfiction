There's a total bash fic where she's setup as the evil post-Voldemort antagonist. In it, she control's everyone via liquid imperious potion she improved upon, until somehow Ron breaks free and goes on a rampage. It's on ffn, but I cannot for the life of me remember the title or author. I'm not sure it was supposed to, but it made me giggle.
