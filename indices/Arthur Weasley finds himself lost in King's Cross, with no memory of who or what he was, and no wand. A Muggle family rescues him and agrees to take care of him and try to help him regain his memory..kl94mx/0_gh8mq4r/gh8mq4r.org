Arthur finds himself inexplicably drawn to the rubber duck he found in the bathroom, and at some point the muggle's find him dismantling their car in the garage with a strange plan to â€˜make it fly'. They eventually need to start hiding anything with wires and batteries from him, and beating Arthur Weasley to answer the phone is like running the worlds greatest race.
