I actually am now about a quarter of the way thru the fourth installment and OOH BOY I cannot agree with you more. Draco and Snape are being particularly infuriating right now, while for once in the story I find myself actually hesitantly liking Connor. I'm also getting mad at Harry for being such a self-sacrificing idiot, even if it's not really his fault. Ugh this fic is giving me emotions.
