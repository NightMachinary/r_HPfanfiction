I really disliked this series. It was well written (or I thought so at the time, it's been a while) and the plot was good and made for a really interesting take on the not-the-boy-who-lived storyline.

But I could not deal with Harry's complete and total inability to ever put himself first. There are a lot of fics that have Harry as someone who is incredible self-sacrificing, always putting others first and convinced of his own worthlessness. But there is a limit to how much I can take and this series went way over it.

I hated Connor because he was a self-entitled little shit. But I hated Harry just as much because he helped perpetuate that behaviour. I never actually managed to finish the series because of just how much Harry's attitude annoyed me.
