Is it, though? His relationship with his family is one of the main plot lines of the series. And since the only thing OP asked about was his relationship with his brother it seems reasonable that his request of no spoilers was targeted at people that were going to tell him how that relationship ends up. You generally don't need to tell people not to spoil an entire series for you if you've already said you haven't finished it.
