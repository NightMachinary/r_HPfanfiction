  I know that casting a patronus has to do with having hope for the future, and the patronus comes from the soul/has to do with the soul.

I don't think any of that's canon, unless it comes from something Rowling said outside of the books. A Patronus just requires a happy memory or some positive emotion. If Voldemort can't cast the spell, it would probably just be because he doesn't have any truly happy memories.

Of course, Voldemort doesn't exactly need a Patronus anyway.
