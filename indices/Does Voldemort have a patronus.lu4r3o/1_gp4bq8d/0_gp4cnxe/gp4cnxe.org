Interesting take. I'd say no because morsemode isn't used to fight off dementors (but then we also see patronus's as communication devices/to send messages, and I /guess/ morsemode's primary usage is as a form of communication). Also, wasn't it stated by the author that Riddle isn't able to love because he was conceived with a love potion? So wouldn't his soul/emotions have been damaged before making the first horcrux?
