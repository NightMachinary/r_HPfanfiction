The thing about BWL Neville is that it doesn't work. There needs to be a reason for Voldemort to spare the mother (in this case Alice) so that her refusal and her sacrifice for her son's life will trigger that Love magic. Snape convinced Voldemort to spare Lily, otherwise he would have killed her right away
