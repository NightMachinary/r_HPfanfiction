[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305455/7/Boredom-Is-Deadly][Boredom is Deadly]] is about a MoD!Harry and Tom Riddle being bored, so they create a parallel reality of Harry's first year to fuck with everybody. Probably my favorite crack fic. Only 7 chapters at the moment, but it was started in June and just updated in January, so a pretty decent update rate.
