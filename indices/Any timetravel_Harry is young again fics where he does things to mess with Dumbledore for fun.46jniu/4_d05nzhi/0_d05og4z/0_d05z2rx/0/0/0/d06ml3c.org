If you've already read the story, [[/spoiler][It's a reference to Harry arriving in that dimension. He settles into Jessica's body and when he tries to talk with her, her soul basically gives up and passes on because she's so broken from the massive abuse inflicted on her. Harry then ages her body so s/he looks like an adult, but is still chronologically a child.]] If you haven't read it, go read it, it's pretty good.
