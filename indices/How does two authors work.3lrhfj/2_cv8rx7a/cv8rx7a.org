My one and only collaboration happened years ago, with the writer I beta for. She decided to write a Christmas fic based on the Nutcracker, but it had to be quick because at that season of the year there were so many demands on her time. The first draft was charming but it seemed to me to miss a lot of opportunities, and my friend told me it was because her knowledge of the fairy tale came solely from the ballet. I grew up reading the ETA Hoffmann version, so I was excited about the idea of incorporating more of the fairy tale's surrealism into the fic. My friend suggested I take her draft and run with it.

It was my first time writing fanfic, and it was deliberately cracky and fanon-y, with lots of hat tips to the original Nutcracker. I worked in as many parallels and amusing touches as I could, then my friend looked it over and cleaned it up. (She has a much lighter touch than I do; I tend to be verbose.) For me, it was a great opportunity to dip my toe into fic writing, plus it was immense fun to work with such a brilliant writer. Our styles are quite different, and I doubt we could pull off a collaboration on a more serious work. But even though there's something "neither fish nor fowl" about the finished product, I'm still fond of it, and I broke through my shyness at using someone else's characters.
