I disagree on the issue of Dawlish's competency. He scored all outstandings on his NEWTS, and was assigned to accompany the minister. I doubt Fudge would have accepted anyone short of exceptional for his own personal protection. He was assigned to defend Hogmeade as well. He's ready to move on Dumbledore, despite Dumbledore's reputation. Sure he blinks (foolishly according to Harry - a biased perspective) when the man who took down Grindewald (and has been smeared for being senile and unstable) casually threatens to "hurt" him. I think it's more telling of his character that he's the first to start stirring, and is the first to "chase" after Dumbledore, even though he had just put down two aurors and some ministry employees. We see hints that Dawlish is a quite capable auror. Being an auror is impressive enough.

His appearance of a lack of competency seems to stem from his behavior under confundus charms, which he has been victim to many times. It seems understandable, however, that having one's mind altered many times would lead to a reduction in ability.
