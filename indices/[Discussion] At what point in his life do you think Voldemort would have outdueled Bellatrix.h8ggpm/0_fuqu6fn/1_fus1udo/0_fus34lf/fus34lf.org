Oh I don't have a problem with him losing to Dumbledore twice, that's expected. His other showings unfortunately don't bode well for his competency. He was one of the four Aurors present to confront McGonagall according to Hagrid, in which Hagrid also says they wouldn't have been able to take on McGonagall without the element of surprise. Neville also says this about Dawlish:

"Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn't need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway, Dawlish is still in St Mungo's and Gran's on the run."

Given that Neville was at Hogwarts and not in the Order, he couldn't have known that Dawlish was confounded and still says he isn't anything special. The straight Os student in NEWTs got hospitalized by a woman who failed her Charms OWL. So much for magical special forces when one of their top operators is more mall cop in efficacy than anything resembling SOF.
