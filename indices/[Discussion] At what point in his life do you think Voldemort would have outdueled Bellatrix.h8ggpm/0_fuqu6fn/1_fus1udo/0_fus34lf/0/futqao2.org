I think the issue is that those commentaries hardly come from a position of neutrality.

You have Hagrid, who's hardly unbiased at the best of times. If there is such a comment, it's hardly good evidence. I couldn't actually find the quote in question in OoTP or Halfblood Prince with a cursory command F search. Would you mind sharing it? I could find this:

#+begin_quote
  Madam Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face. â€œAs if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight!
#+end_quote

Given that McGonagall was known to be fiercely skilled at magic, I don't think it's a mark of incompetence for a biased perspective to have doubts about a single auror's ability. In any case, I think it should be disregarded for bias as well.

I'll admit I'm a little confused by using Neville as evidence as Dawlish /was/ confunded when he went after his grandmother.

Of course he's going to have issues with Dawish's competency, especially from his position of great bias. If anything, this supports my argument as the lack of competency Dawlish seems to demonstrate here is because of confundment. For confundment and bias, I don't think this make for good evidence.

Dumbledore states he has no doubt about Dawlish's abilities as a side note, but it's hardly unbiased evidence either.

Dawlish's outstandings on 5 minimum NEWTS, when the aurors only require exceeds expectations, is impressive. Dawlish's personal assignation to the minister and Hogsmeade reflect a measure of skill as well. He gets a bad rep because he doesn't join the order, like many other aurors, and gets confunded quite a lot and because he's placed in situations where a less skilled auror would have done just as worse if not worse.
