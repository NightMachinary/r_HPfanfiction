My issue with Dawlish is that his skills aren't put to show, we're told he's badass but never gets a chance to prove it. There isn't evidence that being confounded repeatedly makes you weakened over time. Given that Snape confounded Fletcher who's not powerful and yet Fletcher still has the presence of mind to disapparate when confronted by Voldemort and remain undetected until Kreacher caught up to him. Not to mention I'm sure Dumbledore knows how to pull his punches when hexing Dawlish, I doubt he would want a top Auror weakened when Voldemort is back.

There isn't anything in canon that shows Dawlish being a badass. Moody was defeated by Dolohov and got locked in a trunk for a year, but Voldemort still targets him first during Harry's extraction and Snape avoided showing Moody any overt animosity. Contrast when Snape was talking to Moody in GoF where he gets flustered by Moody's "spots that don't come off" comment and where Snape is interrogated by Bellatrix where he keeps his cool. For Dawlish, its a running gag that he gets taken down over and over, which isn't a good look for magical special forces. Then again, Aurors never really did get much of a chance to shine, they only captured Stan Shunpike post OOTP.
