Its hard to say, because we never really see Tom duel, or hear of him engaging in any notable duel, until the wars. We know he had formidable knowledge, skill, and power when it came to dark magic even in school (he was apparently using Unforgiveables and made at least one Horcrux prior to graduation). So its possible he could have taken Bellatrix as early as his fifth or sixth year, if not earlier. On the other hand, none of that demonstrates that he had honed the reflexes, instincts, and experience necessary to be a top tier duelist, where being able to think on your feet, react fast, and cast quickly and effectively under pressure is going to be at least as important as what spells you know or how much raw power you have. I'd note the fact that in his memory, Aragog got past him and Hagrid was able to jump him during is sixth? year suggests he wasn't as focussed or fast in a duel as he was later on.
