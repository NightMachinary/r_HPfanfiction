30 yr old Bella? Any time after he turns 17.

50 yr old Bella? Probably early 30s, though mid 20s shouldn't be ruled out. If all evidence points to gray-haired Amelia Bones putting up a good fight against 70 yr old Voldemort, 50 yr old Bella shouldn't have too much of a problem with a teenage Riddle, barring a bout of intense arrogance of course.
