  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.
