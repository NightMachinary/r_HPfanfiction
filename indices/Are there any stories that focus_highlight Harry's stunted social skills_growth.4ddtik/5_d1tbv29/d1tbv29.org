I haven't really seen this either, which is unfortunate. There's quite a lot of potential there. I'm writing a fic that does use this, though. Harry is sorted into Slytherin and because of his lack of social skills he doesn't recognize that the other students are just sucking up to him because of who he is. It becomes a catalyst for further changes when he finally realizes he hasn't actually made any real friends.
