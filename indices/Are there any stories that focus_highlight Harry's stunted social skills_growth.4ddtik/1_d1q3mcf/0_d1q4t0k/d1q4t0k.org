I agree about Saving Harry. So well written, really captures the cruelty, horror and pain of child abuse. Got me closer to tears than any other fanfic ever did. But it's hopeful, adorable and heartening at the same time, and I still hold hope for a sequal.

About Yellow Submarine: WARNING! DO NOT READ IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME AND DON'T LIKE BAD THINGS: [[/spoiler][I read the first chapter and it messed me up so badly. Seriously. The idea of it alone makes me nauseous and makes me feel all /wrong/ inside, even now, a month or so later. I can't, won't stand it, and I'll never read it fully, or even click a link to it ever again. It's too fucked up. Way, way, /way/ too fucked up.]]

Sorry, I really needed to get that off my chest.
