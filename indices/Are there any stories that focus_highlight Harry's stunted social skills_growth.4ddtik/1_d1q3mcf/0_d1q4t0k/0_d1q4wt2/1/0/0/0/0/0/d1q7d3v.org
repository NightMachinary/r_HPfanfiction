I think you've seen reason. It's perfectly acceptable to say "I don't want to read this right now because I'm not tryna do this today. However, someday, if I'm in the right state of mind, I might want to see what this poor girl went through and how she came out of it stronger than before."

On the other hand, it's irrational and closed mined to say "I'd never even consider reading that because I want to hide from this bad thing that happens because it will never happen to me."

I'm glad you've proven you are reasonable. Have a great day :)
