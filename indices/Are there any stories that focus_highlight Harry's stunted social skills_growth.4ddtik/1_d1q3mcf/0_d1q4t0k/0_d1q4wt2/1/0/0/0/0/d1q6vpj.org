You know, I do agree with the point you make. Rape happens and it won't go away. What, with all the news about India and its problems with rape and the public opinion on it for example. I know it exists, and I know it's horrible.

But in the end I'm here for entertainment. I do often read literature to broaden my horizons and get new perspectives, yes, and logically and rationally speaking, I should read this story as well for the sake of my own consistency, and for the sake of not missing out on apparently one of the better fanfics out there.

I guess my "precious feelings" as you so charmingly put it are indeed precious. I don't want to read this right now. Maybe in the future I'll change my mind, maybe I won't. And that's fine. If you think I'm wrong about this, that's fine too.
