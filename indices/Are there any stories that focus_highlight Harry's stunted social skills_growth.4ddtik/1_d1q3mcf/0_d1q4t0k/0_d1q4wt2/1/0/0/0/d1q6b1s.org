Like it or not, rape happens in the real world. Calling it abhorrent doesn't make it go away. Sometimes literature takes you places where you aren't comfortable, and that's a positive thing, because it gives you a different point of view and really makes you think about something you might have otherwise overlooked or avoided.

Had you continued reading you would have joined Ginny in her struggle with first surviving, then coping, then accepting and finally embracing the love of her family and a kindred spirit who had been hurt too.

You missed out on that beautiful story of Ginny's growth from a victim to a strong young woman because you want to spare your precious feelings. Not me though. I'll take brutal truths over comforting lies any day.
