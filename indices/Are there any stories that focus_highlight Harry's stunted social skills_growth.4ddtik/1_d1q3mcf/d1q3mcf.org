This one is okay. Features a severely abused Harry who is rescued and goes to live permanently with the Weasleys. He works through major trust issues and a speech impediment with the help of the Weasleys. In particular, Arthur is top in this fic. Focuses on the recovery much more than the abuse, to its credit. Probably the best abuse/recovery fic I've read, besides maybe Yellow Submarine (which is about Ginny's abuse at the hands of death eaters). 3/5.
