I disliked the set up, the characterization and the whole " bickering couple" , so yeah, I did not even bothered beyond chapter 3...

In a way, I should feel a bit bad for not even having given a chance seeing that many recommend it, but people also rec other fics I seriously disliked that are, for some reason, well known, and ignore great fics that do not have half the recognition they deserve...so, what i am trying to say is that, in the end,it is pretty subejctive.

I have a HUGE list of fics I consider to be underwhelming at best and shitty at worst that have huge reputation so it might be that I am simply not the target audience for said fics,,,or that my tastes are not popular.
