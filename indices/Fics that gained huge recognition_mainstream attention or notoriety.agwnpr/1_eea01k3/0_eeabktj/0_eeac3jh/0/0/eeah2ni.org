  Most of the popular stories on FFN and Archive are trash. I mean, the most popular Fem!Harry story on Archive has her making child pornography of herself (aged 14 IIRC) and upload it on the internet. The average reader on those sites does not match with the average reader in this sub.

I love AO3 (i found my fav Luna/Hermione fic there) but they may as well list itself as a porn site soon, search any pairing by the most hits and its always some pornograhic smut. Don't get me wrong i like some sexy times in my fics but i like tons of plot and character development otherwise its just some badly written 14 years olds porn script with the names of harry potter characters pasted in there. Think the reason AO3 is getting more attention and stories posted there than other sites these days is for the sheer amount of/and lack of censorship of PWP fics. Suppose as with any medium the platform that is porn friendly-iest rises to the top.
