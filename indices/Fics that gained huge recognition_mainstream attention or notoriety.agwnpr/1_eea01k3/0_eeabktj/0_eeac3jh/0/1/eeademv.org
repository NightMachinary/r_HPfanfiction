Agreed...however, I would say I also do not share the average readerÂ´s view in this sub, so I am kind of an exception I would say.

There is also a problem I think here that the most established fics are the ones people think first when someone sends a Fic Search request, so it can be that some recs are not as widely well regarded as I think they are, they just happen to fit the requirements of a search.
