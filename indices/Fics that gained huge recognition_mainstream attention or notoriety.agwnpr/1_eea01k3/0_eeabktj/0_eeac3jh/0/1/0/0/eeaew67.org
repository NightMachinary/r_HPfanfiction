Well, I would not want to write or read any Harry/Ron of over 100 K, so I understand why it is hard to find :)

Slash is very popular though...I would guess that Harry/Ron is not that beloved because they use to pair Harry with either Draco or Severus, not because people dislike same sex couples (I personally find it difficult to completely flip a character sexuality if there is not an ounce of sign that said character would most likely enjoy same sex company.)

I saw a belieavable Ron /Krum once...
