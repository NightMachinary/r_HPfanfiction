Yeah, at least give Harry a guy like Cedric- they could talk about Quidditch as they cuddle- or even a Justin- who would take pity on Harry poor wardrobe choices and take him to Savile Row?

I had to drop a fic where Harry was in a foursome with Luna, Neville AND DRaco; Neville was all TOP- very macho gay guy; Draco would only get with Harry when Harry was in a gender fluid mode; and Luna would giggle and clap everytime there was sex going on.

Even I have my limits.
