Well, often there are not a lot of stories which fit the request unless it is very broad. I remember someone recently complained about homophobia when no one linked them a pure romance Harry/Ron story with a 100k length requirement. Fact is, such a fic simply does not exist, same as a decent story with Harry/Lavender or Harry/Penelope Clearwater.
