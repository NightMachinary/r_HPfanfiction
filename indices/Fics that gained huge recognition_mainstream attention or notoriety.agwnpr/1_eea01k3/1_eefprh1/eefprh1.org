I'd say that Methods of Rationality drew attention because it brought its own community with it. It's rationalist fiction first, Harry Potter fanfiction second. So, naturally, opinions on it are rather divided, many loving it and many hating it, but either way there are a lot of people who know about it.

And whatever its flaws, it does have notable strengths. Lots of clever jokes. An impressive antagonist. Thought-provoking conflicts, where fundamentally good people can nonetheless have serious disagreements about what is the right thing to do. Very few typos. And it's complete, with a bunch of recursive fanfics.

I tend to recommend that people check it out, if only so that they say first-hand that they dislike it.
