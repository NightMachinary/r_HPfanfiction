I don't know what fic it was, but way back when fanfiction was way removed from what it is now (Pretty sure it was pre HBP release, maybe even pre OOTP) there was a Dutch fanfic that was written by a 13-year-old that got mainstream media attention. Beyond that I can't say I;ve seen fics go outside the fandom. Methods of Rationality is maybe the biggest one that comes close.
