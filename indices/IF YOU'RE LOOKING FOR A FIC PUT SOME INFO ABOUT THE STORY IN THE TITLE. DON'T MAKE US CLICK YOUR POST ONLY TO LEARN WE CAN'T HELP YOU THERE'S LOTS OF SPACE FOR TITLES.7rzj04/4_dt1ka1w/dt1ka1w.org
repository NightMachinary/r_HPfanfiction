To be honest, I find long titles hard on the eyes. It doesn't fit too well with the UI. I agree with you that you should put some info in the title but only generic info that narrows down the story type you want to find like ‘Harry studies Runes w/ Manipulative!Dumbledore' instead of ‘Harry gets adopted by Professor Babbling, whose nickname is Shiva, and he becomes a Rune Savant and he is constantly being harassed by Manipulative!Dumbledore'. The first should already give you an idea about what type of story you're trying to find/look for and would make sure that only the people who know stories in that category would click on your post.
