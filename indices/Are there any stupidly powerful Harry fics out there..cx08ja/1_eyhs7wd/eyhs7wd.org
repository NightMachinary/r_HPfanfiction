I don't remember any of the names but there is the fanfic series called the Lone Traveler I believe. Harry becomes a god of knowledge, travel and free will. There are many well written stories in there, where he goes around different realities, universes and timelines just helping out. Usually helps out another Harry. Sometimes helps out a young Tom riddle to a different path. Sometimes gets sent to star trek and helps out Picard or Janeway. Sometimes star wars. But mostly Harry Potter universes.
