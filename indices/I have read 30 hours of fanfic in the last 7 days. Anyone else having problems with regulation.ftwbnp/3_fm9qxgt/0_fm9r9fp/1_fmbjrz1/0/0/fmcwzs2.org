Ah. For those kind of people I'd just say I'm reading e-books. Those people usually dont care enough to ask, and if they do you could easily just list a classic. Or say your re-reading a favorite book. "Yes its HP for the hundredth time, it's my favourite."

My parents know I read a lot, but they dont know what I read (they've never asked specifics, maybe they just chalk that up to millenial tech addiction or something). My friends know I'm a fanfic fiend, however, but it takes one to know one lol.
