Probably. I think that it wouldn't be an issue except I actually have stuff to do, namely my schoolwork /cough/ and various art projects to work on. And the only time I can really read is at night (well, the safest bet) because I'm not allowed to. At all. Like, disowned and/or shunned, which is not great for quarantine times lol
