Trying different stuff might also help. Part of it could just be you're really bored and are using fanfics as a way to pass the time, which is totally okay.

Part of is probably because you just really like reading fanfics, and again that's perfectly okay.

Set a certain time for bed. Say 9:30 Pm or 10 PM at night on a week day, and 11: PM or such on a weekend. Setting a specific time might help.

Picking up some new hobbies might also help as well. Normally if you had work or school, you wouldn't have as much time with reading, you'd still read of course, but probably not as much. But with the virus going on you're using it as a way to pass the time, which there isn't anything wrong with it.
