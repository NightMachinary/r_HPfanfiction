I don't have autism but was always into reading, writing, playing video games a LOT, so I think it can be a autism thing, but it can also be a just you're passionate about your hobbies thing as well.

Nothing necessarily wrong with it per say, though yeah, the time you need for sleep is definitely important, there's not much to do or places to go currently with the virus going on.

But, I suggest you can do stuff like reading as long as you want, but set a certain time for bed, and commit to that bed time, committing to it might help you go to bed at a decent time.
