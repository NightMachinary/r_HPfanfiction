Been at it for years. Can't get it off me. I usually read it obsessively for a month, then drop it for another, and start the whole process again the next.

It takes up a lot of time, but not so much that I can't live. My studies are straining, but not failing - They're pretty good actually, around an 8 grade.

Some people get badly obsessed, to the point they don't look after themselves. If you are going to read fanfics, find some gems, then don't look for anymore because apart from the few top fics, the other 99 percent is mostly trash and'll waste your time.
