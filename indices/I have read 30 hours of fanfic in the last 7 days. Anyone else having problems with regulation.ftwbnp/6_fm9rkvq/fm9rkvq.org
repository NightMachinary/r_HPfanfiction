Same (binge-reading & ASD).

I find that I tend to do the read-until-the-birds-start-chirping more when I'm stressed...

On the other hand, the following can help:

- Try to specifically read shorter fics when you go to bed, to limit how far "just one more chapter" without end will take.
- Aim for fluffy fanfics, too - calm is good for sleep.
- If you're reading the fics online, consider downloading them to a phone or tablet instead, and using an ereader with a night-mode (I use Aldiko) (white text on black background), and install an app like f.lux or Twilight. Set them to make the screen as dark and red as possible without straining your eyes (if you experience discomfort, slowly increase brightness and decrease redness until it goes away, otherwise you end up with eyestrain headaches). The darker it is, the easier it will be get sleepy enough to put the story down.
