42 hours a week - That's what I normally do, no ASD or nothing, I'm neurotypical - is that the word for it? Anyways, it's pretty common. I don't know /why/ fanfiction is so addicting, but it is. The problem with fanfiction is that there is no end - but to a show you are bingewatching, there is an end.
