Indeed. I'm slightly nearsighted, have trouble with writing at long distance (across the room type distance). I have glasses, and I have my phone all customized with what you mentioned already. I think I'm just tired and reading nonstop will strain your eyes no matter what. Gonna take the day off and just make pasta from scratch.
