What are you reading off of? If it's a computer browser, firefox has a native e-reading pane you can toggle that will shorten the width of the text and increase the text size that can help. Chrome has a plugin you can download that does the same thing.

If you're on your phone/tablet and browser reading, adjust your accessibility settings to make the text a little larger. I do this on my phone, since I find it easier and faster to read off the smaller screen (less distance for eyes to travel = less strain)

Ff.net has something native built into the website (desktop) that does that. ao3 you can download epubs and use an e-reader app if you prefer. You can to the same with ff through ff2ebook.

Otherwise, you probably need glasses. I also needed glasses because of eyestrain when I was 18, but I also do the above as well and it helps a lot. That screen coating for glasses is also a godsend.

Save your eyes where you can, especially since between work/school your probably looking at screens the majority of your day.
