This hit it home for me. There were countless times in my younger years that I have done this vary thing, and in the current climate that we all are going through I could see this thing happening to me again If I didn't have the job I currently have.

I don't recommend it though, as your mental health goes to crap, even worse if your mind is already in the crapper.

Vitamin D is your friend so make sure you take time out of your day to just sit outside for a bit, or at least sit next to an open window and let the sunlight in. Lack of sun/ fresh air after a long time can really mess with your head I have come to find out.

Give your mind a rest from technology for an hour or so when you wake up and/or before you sleep can help too.

Also, I know that it might sound strange but take a break from fan fic reading to actually read a real book also helped me get though it, I reread both the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson books during my last bout of this and it helped me a lot.

Also, if you got friends/ family that you can video chat with, do so every now and then. Talking to people about random things can help as well
