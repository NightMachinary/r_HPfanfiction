*Try making a schedule*- It doesn't have to be harsh and horrible, it can just be a simple planner with the times you'll eat, sleep, take breaks, etc on it. Put a few quirky things a week to liven it up, and life will feel a lot better.

We need structure and rythmth in our lives a lot more than we realise it, and right now everyone's feeling lost AND lonely due to coronavirus. Everything's cancelled, so our normal schedules have broken down, and we can't visit eachother. The covid-19 stress doesn't help.
