THIS IS THE STORY OF MY LIFE. I read fanfiction everyday, I have to read every night to fall asleep. I've done this for about DECADE now and have resorted to reading old favorites when I can't find new material that interests me. I've been trying all year to branch out & read some regular books for a change but I always get sucked back into a fanfiction blackhole. It hasn't affected my life negatively per say, at least not significantly, but my sleep schedule is also particularly fucked at the moment. Mostly because I'm a habitual night owl and no longer need to go to class or do anything in the mornings. Also, I don't read until I'm done, I just read until I'm tired, sometimes only for 10 mins. But I'm on the autism spectrum as well! I never thought it could be related but that's an interesting thought. I have a LOT of problems with time management in general, not sure how it links with autism if at all. I forget I have autism all the time so I don't think about it much. Long story short, no, my friend you are certainly not alone.
