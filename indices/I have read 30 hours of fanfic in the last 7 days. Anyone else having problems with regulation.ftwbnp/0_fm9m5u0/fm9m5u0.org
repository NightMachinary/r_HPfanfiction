You're not the only one. Every once in a while I'll fall into a similar rut, whether it's fanfiction or binging a show.

For times like you describe, something that usually works for me is just telling myself that it's just stories and the reason I enjoy them so much is because I get to put myself in interesting and crazy situations. It's fun. Really fun.

But we live in a world with so many interesting and crazy things that are /actually/ happening and that we can probably share with others (or not). Ever wanted to learn how to draw? Look up some tutorials and start. Always wanted to learn a new language? Download Duolingo and start.

Feeling lonely and isolated in quarantine? Text some friends and set up a video chat. Play videogames to get some social interaction if that's easier.

Still want the experience of reading a story? Get a history (audio)book and start. There's some crazy shit that's really happened that will probably be just as absurd as the HP world.

That kind of thing. Just remind yourself that the "real world" has plenty of fantastic things to devote your time to, and there's no rush to do them. Sleep and sleep early if feel you need to. All those things will still be there when you wake up.

This mindset helps me be get my head out of stories and be more present. Sorry, this got a little deep for a fanfiction subreddit, but I hope it helps you or anyone else with similar binging issues.
