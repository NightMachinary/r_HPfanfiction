Thanks a lot! Tbh my post was a little deep in the first place ðŸ˜…

I think that's a great approach, actually. I do a lot of drawing in my spare time already but taking up another new, interesting hobby will probably help a lot. I think that a lot of my problems stem from when I'm reading, I'll tell myself that reading is good for you. And it is, actually, I guess, in moderation though. Fanfiction itself helps people build their own opinion on different aspects of life, in a juvenile way, because so many people love to project their thoughts, views, emotions and problems onto their characters, things that might get censored or wouldn't be the focus of a traditionally published novel. And this, and the familiarity of the characters and world intigrated into every day life, is what makes it so much more intriguing and raw.

Wow. Okay this deep view of fanfic is totally a product of my three-hours-of-sleep 1:30am post long fanfiction mood. And yes, that is a very relevant thing.

Thanks for taking the time to respond so throughly!
