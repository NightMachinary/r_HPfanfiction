I'm okay with "darker" world building but hate actual dark ideologies if that makes sense? The fic I was reading was actually good, and has aspects of the war, grief and good writing. Heres the link if you wanna give it a go?

Also you've probably already read them because they're pretty popular, but lomonaaeren (on both ffn and ao3) has some great fanfiction and long ones at that. Their world building is great and has a very darkish vibe.
