When I fell into a depression slump weeks ago, I did exactly this. It was a school night, but I stayed up till 7am to read, slept exactly 3 hours and went to class. It wasn't my proudest moment. I'm still struggling with regulating my reading habits now. I know it's not a problem most people face (my friend, for example, are more likely to struggle with regulating their bad habits of watching too much drama or youtube videos)... so not many can understand.

But I suggest keeping accountable. It helps very much to have something you have to do (e.g. studies, work), and I watched a video that talked about doing a dopamine detox day, where you refrain from doing the thing that gives you dopamine bursts (for me and you, I think that'll be reading) for a day, so that your brain can get used to wanting to do low dopamine things such as doing your homework or work duties. I've been trying that out but... it's hard, of course. It always is. All we can do is start, then try. Try, fail, make mistakes, but try again... Let's do our best.
