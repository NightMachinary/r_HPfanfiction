One thing not enough people are talking about is that we're all living through a devastating global pandemic. It's okay to not be as productive, or to fall back into comforting patterns.

A lot of people in my life don't seem to understand that there's nothing wrong with feeling anxious or really tired during this time. Just because you mightn't be directly affected right now doesn't mean the entire situation doesn't suck for absolutely everyone. Nobody can function at 100% and the expectation that we should be fine is so unfair.

That said, you might look into forming a more consistent routine with less time for fan fiction. A proper sleep schedule is really important to your overall health and you don't want to fall behind with necessary life stuff. Could you try restricting yourself to oneshots?

You could also practise writing fanfic during this time! Or even draw some fanart, or write poetry.
