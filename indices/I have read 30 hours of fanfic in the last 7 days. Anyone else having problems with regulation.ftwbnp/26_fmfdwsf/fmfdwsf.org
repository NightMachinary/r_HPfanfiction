I have no advice tbh. I fall into reading fanfic too and I have days were I do nothing but reading for hours straight, go to bed and sleep for minumal hours, get up, head to work and continue reading as soon as I get home. Though I usually fall out of that cycle when I finish the (long) fic I was reading. On weekends I also read till 5 am sometimes if I get a story that really captures me. For me it was always normal tbh. I remember being in 3rd grade and finishing the 6th Harry Potter book at 3 am. If there is a story that grabs my attention, I can't help but devour it. I obly part from my phone when I have to take a shower and then I get back to it as soon as possible.
