Honestly, my desire to complete fics on one go plays into one of the reasons why I hesitate to read longer works unless I have a long period of time where I know I'm not going to do anything. I did the same thing that you did for canon. Within 24 hours of me picking up the books, I would finish them. My first fic (HPMOR) was like 600k words and had me reading that thing nonstop for 3 or so days, stopping only to sleep, eat or use the loo.

My only advice would be to go back to only reading shorter fics. Only read longer works if they are broken up into multiple stories that way you can give yourself a break (assuming that you can stop yourself once you finish one 'book').
