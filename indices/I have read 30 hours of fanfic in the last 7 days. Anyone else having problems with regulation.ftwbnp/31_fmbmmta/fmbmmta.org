I'm not autistic, but I do read constantly.

I mean, reading is never a slump imo. I've always been an avid reader, and it was super encouraged growing up (weekly unrestrained library trips, I would leave with grocery bags filled with books and devour them immediately.)

Obviously only sleeping for 3 hours isn't the best thing ever, but reading a lot isnt necessarily a bad thing.

Make sure to take breaks and focus on other things when they have priority (like work and school etc.) When I was finishing uni, I barely read since my courses were overloaded, and I had to put more energy there then elsewhere.

To this day, I will still lay in bed and read until I cant keep my eyes open, but I've never been a night owl so this is usually around 12am (2:30 at the absolute latest.) I value sleep a lot too, so I still get my 8 hrs in.

I also like to daydream a lot, so I use my time before bed thinking about my own fanfic ideas to fall asleep to, instead of reading fics.

But don't just listen to me, my reading habits are also probably a tad "unhealthy." Just because reading is a more "passive" hobby, doesnt make it a bad thing or anything. Just try to form good habits around it to make your experience better. Save long sessions for weekends or such, and save time for sleep/work etc.

Bonus tips: if your experiencing eyestrain, you might need glasses. Get that screen coating on them and also make the text size larger if your reading off a phone/tablet.

Shorter distances your eye has to travel is easier on them and let's you read faster.

Firefox has a build in e-reading pane that helps a ton, chrome you have to download a plugin. Fanfic has something native to the website that's similar. You can download epubs from ao3 to read in an app if the browser isn't your preferred reading apparatus.

Best of luck to your reading!
