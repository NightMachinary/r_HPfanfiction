People need structure to their lives or circadian rhythms get out of whack.

Forcing yourself to take breaks helps - make a meal, have a hot shower, walk outside if you have a yard/go check the mail, do laundry, vacuum.

Set a time you can start reading, say after dinner or lunch, for a set number of hours (set an alarm).

Make a little schedule for yourself of things to do each day: plan some things like calling/facetiming a friend, writing an email or letter, or watching a movie or a few youtube videos, etc.
