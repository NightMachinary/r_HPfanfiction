I'm in much the same boat - nothing to do, nowhere to go, a ton of existential dread at the thought of this going on and on. Been reading a lot of fanfic (not just HP), playing a ton of video games, and skyping or chatting with friends a few times a week. Thankfully I live with my partner as well so I am getting some human interaction throughout the day.

However, I too am struggling to maintain anything close to a normal sleep pattern - it is 4am as I type this. I settle into a fic at 1am because why not? What am I doing tomorrow? The next day? Next week? Nothing, really.

I feel guilty for wasting time and sleeping in and all that but also, that's the least of mine or anyone else's concern right now. If it makes you happy, if it helps you relax, I say do it! But equally, if lack of sleep and feelings of listlessness start to take over then try and find some other outlets for your time and energy. Stay strong!
