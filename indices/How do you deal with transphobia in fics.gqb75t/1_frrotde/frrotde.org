Do you have examples? In 19 years and many hundreds of millions of words in HP fanfiction that hasn't happened to me once.

Sure, they are made fun of by the expected characters, like the usual Slytherins, but not by the author. Wouldn't be very good writing if Malfoy wouldn't make fun of Harry for being trans. But it sounds like you are complaining about transphobic authors and not transphobic characters, which are a must have if the fic wants to reflect the reality. Sad, but true.
