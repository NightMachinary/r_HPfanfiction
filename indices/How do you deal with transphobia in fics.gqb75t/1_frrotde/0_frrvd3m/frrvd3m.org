I am terrible at remembering fic names. Plus I usually stop reading when I find blatant transphobia. But I do know that I've come across multiple fics that, when metamorphmagi come up, there's jokes about it and you can just tell that the author is the one who thinks it's funny and it isn't just a character being transphobic.
