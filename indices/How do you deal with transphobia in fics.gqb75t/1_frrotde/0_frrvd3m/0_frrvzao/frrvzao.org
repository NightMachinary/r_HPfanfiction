Ah ok, yea the old metamorph gender switch theme. True, now that you mention it that happens more often. When I read your post I only thought about fics that actually had a trans character.

In the case of the metamorph situation, it is often such a small part of the fic, that it will be very hard to know beforehand sadly.

I think the only way to make sure would be to read many pages of reviews in the hopes that someone else called the author out on their bullshit.
