omg yes this like yes its totally possible the wizarding world super transphobic. But it doesn't have to be or it can be significantly less so. This is a magical world gender reassignment could be done in like a day and boom no time period needed for hormones to work or like to recover or even have scars. I mean you can make it be more of a transition. But you don't have to. Its a magical world its a fanfic you can do anything.

I saw an argument once with gay romance in hp fic. There doesn't have to be a stigma even in high class pureblood society. There can be but you can definetly make it so there isnt or much less. And it can be really cool world building

There is definetly bigotry in the wizarding world. But its still a different world its entirely possible that some forms of bigotry that exist in our world don't for them. And it doesn't mean the more elitist purebloods stopped being bigots. They just arent bigoted in the same exact ways bigots in our world are.
