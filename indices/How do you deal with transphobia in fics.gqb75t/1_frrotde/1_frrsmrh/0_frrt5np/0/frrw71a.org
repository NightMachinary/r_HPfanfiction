I agree that if we're positing that these particular Muggle biases exist in the Wizarding World as well, Draco would likely display them. And I'm not, mind you, making a value judgement about whether it's a /right/ move to posit a Wizarding World that's free of all Muggle prejudices and only has to deal with its /own/ flavors of bigotry; certainly I wouldn't want to prevent trans folk from using a HP fanfic as a way to express their own experiences.

But I'm going to have to disagree about which position is more likely to be the AU, compared to what we can glean about the canonical universe. I would find it more surprising than not if there /weren't/ a biological-sex-change potion easily available at St. Mungo's, Divination techniques to find your true self, and so on and so forth.

(As an extrapolation of what the Wizarding World is like in the books /per se/, anyway. If I start to ask myself what J.K. Rowling would answer if asked how trans people are treated in her world, the answer might be as different from the above as it would be... unpleasant.)
