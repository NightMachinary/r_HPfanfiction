I mean its not like I don't see why people do purebloods as being bigoted in all ways. My argument is you don't have to do it that way all the time.

They can be racist as classist but not homophobic and that doesn't make them secretly good if they are Death Eaters who are actively trying to start a genocide. You can have bigoted chatacters while still making homophobia essentially non existent. Race bigots existing doesn't mean homophobia has to too.

My personal headcanon is that it very common for Purebloods to get arranged marriages they get as buisness ventures while having lovers who they openly acknowledge as lovers who they don't have kids with.

The kids they have in marriages are essentially magical test tube babies. It's not necessary they live together and most often live with their lovers separate from their spouses while the child goes between the two.

That way their blood purity is ensured and gay romance isn't necessary frowned on. And now you got this less common culture for purebloods to explore which still fits into book canon
