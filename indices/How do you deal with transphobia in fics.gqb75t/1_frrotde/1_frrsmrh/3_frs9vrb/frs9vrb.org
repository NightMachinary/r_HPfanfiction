Depends on how it affects magical inheritance. There could be something at play that with the way some ancient magics work family magic can only be passed down through a child of a marriage between a man and woman. It could lead to some purebloods being very anti-transitioning even if it wouldn't affect most people. Once you have a cultural belief creeping into a society that way, it isn't weird for it to spread.

Note, I'm not saying you /have/ to do this. Just that it could work as a narrative reasoning. It is already established in canon that purebloods are irrational bigots about some things, so it isn't a big stretch to make them bigots about other things.
