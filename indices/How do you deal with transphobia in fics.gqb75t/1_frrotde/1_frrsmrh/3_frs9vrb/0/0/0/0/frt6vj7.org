  I suppose, but a sex-change spell or potion would just be a particular case of the sort of thing we already know Potions and Transfiguration can do

We do also know that magic is inheritable and that hybrids between witches/wizards and other sentient creatures maintain traits of both. So, specific magical themes running along family lines isn't that much of a stretch.

  and would be consistent with the general status-quo of the Wizarding World not sharing most Muggle prejudices.

I always got the feeling that the Wizarding World held /more/ prejudices than the muggle world. Maybe not necessarily all of the same ones as the muggle world, but certainly more in total. I think it makes for a fair vehicle for exploring other prejudices even if they aren't ones addressed in canon.

  Whereas the idea that blood-purism is based on an actual system of family magic which the introduction of Muggle-borns into the society is endangering... feels tonally dissonant with the whole "the blood-purists are just plain racist" moral angle?

I've actually played with the idea that family magic involves two separate threads. One is a family line of some sort of affinity for an element or concept while the other is the presence of magic in the individual. The former would be present in all families even if the family didn't have magic. Then, when a muggleborn entered existence they do have a tie to family magic, but they just wouldn't know what their family magic is because without a family history of general magic there was no manifestation of whatever the family affinity was. It lets you play with the concept of family magic while keeping the idea that the Death Eaters were still just plain racist.

In particular, I was thinking of using the concept for a Frozen crossover where Elsa is a muggleborn and has her ice powers because the Royal Family of Norway has a connection with ice as an element. She would attend Hogwarts without announcing herself as royalty, so the purebloods would all assume that she was from some pureblood family from Norway that they just hadn't heard of while meanwhile she would think of herself as muggleborn and get offended every time they started being racist. I thought it might be an interesting way to explore the idea of racist people relaxing and speaking their mind around "their people" and not realizing that they are being racist right to someone's face. It is something I have encountered myself IRL being Jewish but not looking like a stereotypical Jew.

Unfortunately, that story idea is currently stuck in development hell and exists only as an outline with no drafts. I have been bugged by some friends who want to read it, but it needs to be a longfic and I struggle getting those rolling.
