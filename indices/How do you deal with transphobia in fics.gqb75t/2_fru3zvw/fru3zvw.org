As I am not trans, I think it's quite possible (and now I'm sad about it) that I've read it and didn't even register it. I think it's good to see posts like this one that can help spread awareness of the existence of such fics so that I can be on the lookout for them in the future, and even better, be sure not to become such an author myself.
