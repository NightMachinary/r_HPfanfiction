I love these small comments in larger stories where just by the way heroes comment on the book. For example in linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) after Draco Malfoy challenges Harry for the midnight duel, Harry with Hermione (they are adopted siblings in the story) look at each other with the look of incredulity, “Who in the world would be that stupid to fall for that?”.

Or I just finished rereading linkffn(Petrification Proliferation by White Squirrel) and his “I am not JKR” notes in the beginning are hilarious (they always are from him). Like “Should a twelve-year-old girl get counselling after being possessed by a cursed diary? Yes? Then I am not JK Rowling and do not own Harry Potter.” or “Is telling literally no one besides your double agent about your secret plan to kill the bad guy a good idea? No? Then I am not JK Rowling and do not own Harry Potter.”
