Most authors who write bashing do not perceive it negatively. Therefore you will be hard pressed to find a self-parody which incorporates bashing. There are certainly fics which throw shade at popular tropes or pairings (eg "I'd rather shoot myself than touch Snape's cock!"), but usually its an offhand sentence or paragraph at most, not entire stories.
