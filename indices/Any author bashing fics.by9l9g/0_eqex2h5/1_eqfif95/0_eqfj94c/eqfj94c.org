The fine art is to set it up in a fashion where it doesn't stand out, eg bantering about UST and then throw something like "Me and Padma? What about you and Snape?" as a comeback. Or, if your story is a little more explicit, Harry (or Hermione) checking out a group of girls and then Malfoy walks through the picture ("hot, hot, meh, nice ass, 7/10, not even when the hell freezes over, meh"). Obviously, the second example is more suitable for erotic comedy like "The Sword of Gryffindor" or "It could only happen to Harry")
