  There are certainly fics which throw shade at popular tropes or pairings

I almost prefer honest bashing to authors making petty meta comments about other pairings. Maybe I'm too contrary, but they always make me defensive even if I don't care for the character/pairing in question. Like if you hate, say, Draco Malfoy with burning passion, make him an antagonist or something, but throwing in a mocking paragraph on how he is completely unsuitable romantic interest out of nowhere in the middle of the fic that has nothing to do with him and where he doesn't appear once just reads as salty (saw that one recently).
