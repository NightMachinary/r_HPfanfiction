I wrote a fairly strange comedy/satire 7th year fic when I was in junior high. It falls into that category because I made fun of a lot of tropes in fanfiction at that time. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2876377/1/Slightly-Screwed]])

Edit: I will add that I prefer the later chapters. Rereading bits always cracks me up.
