  Having Harry mention (whether in the Inbetween or the next scene) that he just seems to understand the language of the time would help me suspend my disbelief a bit.

Done. Good point. Thanks.

I read through the Inbetween scene again and agree that Lily, or Sirius or someone the like would do the scene some good. I'm unsure how I'll handle it. Thank you, though. This gave me some angle to start working on it.
