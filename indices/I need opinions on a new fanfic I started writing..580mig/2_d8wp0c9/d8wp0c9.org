That was really interesting.

Regarding the Inbetween: I liked that Dumbledore and Alrun showed Harry what would happen if he died. I liked that Harry based his choices on what he knew his friends' lives would be.

I think I would have liked to see Harry think about truly dying and getting to be with his family and friends and maybe even having a third person with Dumbledore and Alrun, just so each option had an advocate (or if it's Lily, advocate to live on, no matter which life he chose.)

Regarding the 2nd half: I like the mention of less effective potions and them walking through the bazaar.

I think Harry's gender dysphoria would be a good subplot that moves throughout the story--as Alrun goes through puberty especially.

One thing I find weird. I know the language is English so we can understand it but I'm sure it was different 1000 years ago. Having Harry mention (whether in the Inbetween or the next scene) that he just seems to understand the language of the time would help me suspend my disbelief a bit.

Something silly: I clicked it and thought, '12 pages? I'm not in the mood to read 12 pages,' but read it anyway. By the time I got to the end, I kept pressing the down arrow to scroll farther down. 'Where's the rest of it?' lol. Harry isn't usually my favorite to read, but if/when you post, promo it so I can read it properly.
