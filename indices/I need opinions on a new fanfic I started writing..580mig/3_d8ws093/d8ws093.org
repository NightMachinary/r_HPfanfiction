I loved this! It was a really interesting teaser of what's to come and I can't wait to read more. It will be interesting to see how Harry deals with being a girl in his new life. I do really like how you portrayed their magic differently - i.e potions aren't as effective or well developed yet.

Great story that got me into it very quickly and I couldn't stop reading.
