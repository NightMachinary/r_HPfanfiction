An interesting concept. Three things:

1. The section where Harry is talking with Dumbledore and Alrun is unnecessarily long. It's a plot device and to be honest no amount of "justification" is going to make it feel less of a plot device. With that in mind you might as well streamline it.

2. Some of the names seem strange. Ragnasdottir has Nordic roots, apparently being a Danish name, and the Clan system comes from Scotland. Neither of them are really appropriate for an English family such as the Peverells. England at this time was culturally Anglo-Saxon.

3. In the scene in the bazaar, the word you're looking for is "haggle" not "hackle".
