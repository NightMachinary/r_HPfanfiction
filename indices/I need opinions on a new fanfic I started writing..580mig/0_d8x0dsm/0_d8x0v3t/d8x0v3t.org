1. Yea. I'm not sure what i'll do with it. Maybe I do go the path of just streamline it. But I do like the fact that it is Harry's decision to become Alrun and not just one more thing that just happens to him.

2. Yes... I'm still doing research on that front. It is surprisingly difficult to find some good maps of the times. But I'm confident in my decision to make his new family Norse or Danish (as it will be part of the plot how this family remains in the good graces of the Anglo-Saxon King). I still need to look into the naming conventions of Danes. But I just rolled with it for now, for the drafts sake. I don't even have a timeline yet, so there's that. Rowena is born somewhere around 990 according to the wiki, so the current year would probably be 999 AD, to make Alrun and Rowena the same age. But frankly, I could set the whole thing in the early 10th century and it wouldn't matter in terms of characters. Its more of a decision what kind of setting I'd like.

3. FirstDraftProblems. Thanks for the pointer.
