The sagas from what I remember have family groups living on a farm/farms and referring to them by the farmstead names, which were named after their founders (so Bjorn founded Bjornsted and his family were known as 'those guys from Bjornsted').

Pick-and-mix is a good choice- its impossible to integrate things fully. It's a bit hard to deny magic when the guys you're fighting are using it... so anything is going to be alt history.

Names are very easy to get right though- googling will bring up a suitable list. And doing it will make it feel much more 'Viking'.
