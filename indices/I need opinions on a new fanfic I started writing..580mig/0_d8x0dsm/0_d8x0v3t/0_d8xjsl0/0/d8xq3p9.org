Hey, thanks for the feedback. Yes, I realized that the naming is an issue. I'll leave it like it is for now as I simply have no time to delve too deep into research. But you give a very good tip, so imma check that out.

When it comes to the historical stuff, I'm currently doing research on it. But being a Central-European myself, british history is completely new land for me, so it might take a while. As for now its only a Peverell "Clan" (still searching for a better way of describing a norse/danish kind of that) against saxon land-nobility.

In this fic the Christians/Saxons and the wizards supporting them will be the main villain. It will also eventually change into an Alt-history fic as Ragna and Alrun influence history.

All in all, I think I'll do a lot of pick-and-choose, as adding magic to the mix changes a whole lot up in the first place.

Thank your for the feedback. I greatly appreciate it.
