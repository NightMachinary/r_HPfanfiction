I was also going to comment on the names- so far most of the names are nordic or nordic sounding (for info there check out reenactment websites [I'm in Regia Anglorum, it does a reasonable genral intro to the history and has other useful guides for names/clothes/weapons], the sagas can be used too though they're written significantly later but so far its not bad).

Peverell from my quick check was only introduced in England through the Norman Invasion. (One of William's knightly natural sons adopted the name after his step-father).

I too wince every time 'clan' is used by anyone as its a) Scottish, b) an anachronism, but a very popular one that seems to pop up in all of the Founders fics (well either that or they're generic high medieval fantasy.).

In terms of dates, you are going to have to pick something concrete if you want to use actual history in the plot, or even if you want to be just vaguely correct. The 10th century involves a huge upheaval in terms of how Britain is- east England is being reconquered from the Danes, and England united properly during the first half and the last quarter involves a resurgence in the Danish raids. There are various wars in between too. Obviously the Kings and their relations with the Welsh kingdoms and Alba are very different as well.

As Hogwarts is founded in the last quarter of the 10th cent. You're probably looking at a setting of 925-960 ish depending on how old you want Rowena to be when Hogwarts is founded.

If you go with 920s, you're dealing with Aethelstan's conquest of Jorvik (York) and his assertion of power of Alba and Wales which would tie in fairly well with a Danish family struggling with Saxon politics. If you're in the UK the BBC have just been running a series of programs on this.

I also seriously suggest you look into contemporary views on magic. The Anglo-Saxon legal codes have a variety of stances on it from 'kill every witch you find' to 'its only a problem if they actually kill someone with it' (though some of the religious texts complicate things by denying it exists and requiring fasting from both the accuser and accused as magic is pagan so believing someone is a witch is a pagan thing to do...). A quick skim through the wikipedia page on Volva also throws up stuff on how the saga's views on witchcraft were that it was an incredibly gendered thing and Norse guys could be killed for practicing magic (though obviously sagas are slightly dodgy in their accuracy, being Christian views on the pagans of 200 years before).

Of course, its not necessary to go for something so insanely accurate, even if I would love to see something like it (I haven't found any and am writing my own, hence why I might be a bit over critical. This is also why I am advising on lots of research as I didn't do enough before and the advise above is basically to avoid the mistakes I made).

You are on the right track though! Visits to foreign lands for healing is really great (I might have gone with Constantinople but that would probably be more of a christian one...) I look forward to reading more!
