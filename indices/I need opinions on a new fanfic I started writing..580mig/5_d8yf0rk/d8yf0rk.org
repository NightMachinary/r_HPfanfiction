I tend to be rather negative in my comments, so let me start off by saying: you've written a fair bit, it's already well above average and has good potential, so don't stop writing.

This would be easier if you enabled commenting on the document.

#+begin_quote
  Harry followed Dumbledore's invitation onto a spot next to a young girl.
#+end_quote

Whom Harry had not noticed before then, and now is only noticing in passing. It could have been a rubbish bin or a folded up newspaper, but it's a person.

#+begin_quote
  or rather, to say it in your way, Harry Jamesson of the Potters.”

You're trying to make it seem like she's Anglo-Saxon, pre-Norman conquest. You're making it sound like she's from Skyrim.

Anglo-Saxons didn't start using /any/ sort of patronymic or surname before the Norman conquest. They used epithets -- there was a king who earned the epithet "the Unready", for instance -- though those were most commonly awarded posthumously and mostly to kings. Vikings were much bigger on epithets.

#+begin_quote
  Into the Everything
#+end_quote

"the Everything" sounds like she's trying to be overly mystical and not really succeeding.

#+begin_quote
  “You were tired.” Harry said.
#+end_quote

You have a period before the right quote. This means it's the end of the sentence. I should be able to insert "And then" after it and have it make sense. Instead, that would give us:

#+begin_quote
  "You were tired." And then Harry said.
#+end_quote

Small grammar issue, but it boils my blood.

#+begin_quote
  To experience love like only a mortal can. Emotions stop having the same impact once time is no longer against you. One does not love or hate with the same intensity.
#+end_quote

Is this common knowledge in the wizarding world? Is the existence of an afterlife common knowledge?

If they're both common knowledge, I'd understand that people would be reluctant to commit suicide in the face of a Dark Lord. But it would still be pretty common.

If people knew of the afterlife alone, then suicide would be /way/ more common.

Or if they don't know about an afterlife, why would Harry's instinct be /let me die already, I'm sick of living/? If he came back to life, he could run and hide in the worst case. He could help others. He could actually /do/ things.

How would anyone know anything about the afterlife? Do the dead and living get together every now and then? Do ghosts write to people on the other side? Is there a trade in books and music? Are there famous dead philosophers? What's the deal with ghosts if there's a real afterlife?
