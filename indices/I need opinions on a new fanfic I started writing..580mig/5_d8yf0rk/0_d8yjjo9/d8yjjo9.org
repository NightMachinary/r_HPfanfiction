I totally forgot that. But for any future viewer I fixed it.

Thank you for your feedback. I'll work a lot of it in. For the grammar stuff I'm happy to say that I have a beta and stuff like that will be filtered out by a second pair of eyes.

But I'm afraid I don't understand what you're trying to say with the afterlife stuff. No its not common knowledge and no, the existence of it is not known. Death is and will always be a mysterious thing shrouded in secrets in the mortal realm. When Harry's soul goes into the Inbetween he knows nothing about the afterlife. He is then told those few tidbits you can read about by Dumbledore and Alrun (who are the actual souls of the two and not just two figures Harry imagines). I'm afraid you need to elaborate on your assumptions for me to answer.
