  No its not common knowledge and no, the existence of it is not known.

It came off as if Harry had already decided he'd rather be dead and was reconsidering at the last minute. If the existence of an afterlife isn't common knowledge, I'd expect some disorientation, a bit of confusion, and some time in thought.

Or if his recent experiences were enough to make him suicidal, I'd expect it to take some more time for him to get back into an even mental state.
