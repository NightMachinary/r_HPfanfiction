It's a stupid sex thing based on shoddy research. Original wolfpack social research was taking a bunch of wolves from different packs and locking them in an enclosed space together. The researcher published his study of wolves being terrified and threatening each other and published it as the be-all, end-all on wolf social dynamics. The basic theory was that there is some alpha wolf that forces all the others to obey and the beta wolves, who fight among themselves. (In his defense, he later realized he was wrong and has been begging publishers to stop promoting it.)

Fanfic authors seized on it as a sex thing and turned it into the glorious alpha who magically makes all the omegas want to have sex with them (the fantasy generally maps alpha=male and omega=female, but not always) just by being near. It's a rape fantasy dressed up in prettier terms.

I'd actually read a/b/o that isn't plain aphrodisiac rape and instead dealt with a society where people go feral on a fairly regular basis, but generally the deep worldbuilders with decent plots don't run in the same circles as the shitty porn tropes. Deal with trying to maintain a society when a good 25% or so establish territory and get uncomfortable with each other entering.
