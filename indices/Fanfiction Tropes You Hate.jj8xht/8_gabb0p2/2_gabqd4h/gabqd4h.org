I respectfully disagree about the bashing part. I do think there are some that aren't written very well and come off as rather cartoonish with awkward dialogue; but there are some that pull it off well and it takes skill to twist a normally likeable character into a jerk that we're supposed to hate. Just my opinion anyway.
