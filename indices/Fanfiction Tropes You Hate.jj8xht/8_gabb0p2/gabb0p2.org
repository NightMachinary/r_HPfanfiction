Magic is only intent. In that case, Luna Lovegood on drugs is the best wizard alive. Go read or watch the countless works where magic is only intent. And why the hell do they even bother going to Hogwarts to study?

You can cheat magic with science. That's not HP magic. Go read Dresden or watch The Magicians.

Bashing. Boring and a sign your fic is trash.

Wizarding world is backwards. Someone has a poor grasp of the complexity of the world.

Purebloods were right. Intentions or not, I'm not interested in reading a story that excuses the analogue of racism.

Voldemort or Draco or Lucius or Snape or Bellatrix with Harry. Let's not pair the hero with the racist killer because the racist killer was hot in the movies.

Secret ancient magic/forgotten magic/asian magic/wandless magic is the best. If it was so good, people would be using it all over.
