  Secret ancient magic/forgotten magic/asian magic/wandless magic is the best. If it was so good, people would be using it all over.

I've seen it portrayed as not necessarily being better, just different and not something people organize against. Like a bike rack. People expect bike thefts to come from saws, so they buy good locks and chains. Then someone waltzes up with a massive drill and steals the entire bike rack. Stealing the bike rack isn't better than getting a really nice angle grinder, but nobody's putting up defenses against it.
