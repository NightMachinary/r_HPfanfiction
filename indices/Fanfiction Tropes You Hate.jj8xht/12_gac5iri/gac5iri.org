((Yes I know I'm kinda picky))

- soul bonds

- a/b/o

- marriage contract

- harry (usually) being super involved with politics

- characters having multiple bf/gfs

- kids being married at 11 (I've seen with harry/hermione. They'll have a dorm to themselves)

- oc being daughter/niece/sister, etc of (insert character)

- not sure if this really counts as one but shopping scenes. The ones where Harry gets a new wardrobe, bunch of books and (usually) a pet snake

- fics focusing on daphne greenglass

-long giblin scenes

- making the female characters have zero flaws but the guys are bumbling idiots

- I dont really mind bashing except when it comes to Percy/Seamus/Harry/Colin

- Harry having like 3 parents (it'll be a threesome pairing of, for example, Lily/James/Snape)

- Harry's name being Hadrian (I can ignore it if it's just mentioned) or changed completely

- Harry being a gary sue. Usually he's ridiculously smart and can do all this impressive magic and acts like a jerk

- dont know if this counts but making male characters (specifically Harry) girlish or weepy

- creature inheritance

- Malfoy is a misunderstood character and suddenly is nice
