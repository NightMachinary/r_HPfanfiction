Lol, feel free to use me as a non paid volunteer in your study paper. I already got a few friends in my research circle sending me forms to fill for their data collection (I'm a vlsi research student though). Brains are really cool and we would love to learn more about them ðŸ¤©.

If I'm immersed in my work then the song type doesn't matter at all (I hear it but at the same time I don't know what is being played, or if the song stops in middle then whether it was actually being played). When I'm distracted, I tend to subconsciously focus on the lyrics so it's like I'm just going through the motion of reading and scrolling but the words aren't registering in my mind. If the song stops or my subconscious become conscious, I have to go back to the last part I remember and start reading from there (in fact same thing happens if I read a heartwarming line and I keep thinking about the situation, imagining it subconsciously while reading next part). I guess if it's just music then it's not that distracting but not so sure as I can't experiment on myself ðŸ˜…
