Yes yes they do. Any form of studying (academic or hobby), gaming, thinking (shower thoughts ya know) etc. The overlapping sounds distract me. I'm bad at multi-tasking I guess, cuz if the song plays and I'm reading then either I don't hear the song (if been reading long and completely immersed in it) or I forget what I read and listen to lyrics of song or the rhythm (if I just started reading). But that's OK with me as it allows me to deeply cherish the thing I'm focused at (which is usually fanfiction).
