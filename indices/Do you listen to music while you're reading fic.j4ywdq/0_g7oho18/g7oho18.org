I don't. It's too distracting for me. Once I start reading a fanfic, I loose myself to it. Completely immersed and don't even hear whatever my parents tell me at that time. I subconsciously know there is someone speaking to me but I don't hear anything. Just the fic and the words goin round and round creating scenes and emotions.
