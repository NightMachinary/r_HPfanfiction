Both! It's very fun to me to speculate on the character's musical taste, select songs that sort of carry a mood I associate with them, or contain lyrics that I think describe them. When I work on it, it's mostly for fun but it also makes them feel more relatable to me. When I'm stuck writing their perspective or dialogue, it can also be very useful to listen to their playlists to recapture their voice, so to speak.
