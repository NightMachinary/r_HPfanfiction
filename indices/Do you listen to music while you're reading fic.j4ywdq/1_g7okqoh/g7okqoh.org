There's this composer on YouTube that I really like, Adrian von Ziegler. He's got a bunch of music and it's just grand to click on a 1 or 3 hour vid of his and be swept away in it. I found his Celtic inspired music especially great to read fanfic on.

However, when I'm writing myself? Absolute chaos. Almost any genre goes and while I much prefer instrumental when I read, writing has no such restriction for me. I also really like creating playlists with songs that remind me of a character I'm writing for.
