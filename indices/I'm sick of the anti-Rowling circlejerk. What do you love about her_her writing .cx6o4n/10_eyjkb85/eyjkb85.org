The realistic characters (even when the narrative is childish we can see the shades of grey there), the amazing word building, oh god the humour, and her excellent pacing and tension building.

Yes, some things fall apart on too close an inspection (especially numbers!) - but there are very few series that don't have flaws like that (that are complete and able to be examined critically in full).

I love Rowling, I just wish she would have left the books as a stand-alone thing and not kept dropping extra backstories etc. It's not the same when it isn't written into a story, and some of it outright contradicts what has been revealed previously.
