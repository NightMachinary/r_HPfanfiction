My favorite part of JK's writing is that there are no "filler" chapters. Fanfiction tends to be guilty of this a lot, where Harry and his girlfriend go down to Hogsmeade for the day and have tea and go shopping and generally have a good time, and that's nice and fluffy, but nothing /important/ happens. No plot, no Chekhov's guns, nothing.
