I love how she writes characters and character relationships. The fact that everyone can disagree over who's the best and who's the worst, who's their favorite, who's justified and who's not, tells you that she's made these dynamic and very real characters. They're flawed, and they have interesting relationships with each other and that brings life to the whole story.

That, and I like how creative she is. The technical side of her worldbuilding may not always hold up to scrutiny, but /man/, did she make a world that's fun and breathtaking and foreign while also familiar in all the best ways. There's a reason why I always come back eventually, and it's because the world of Harry Potter, for all its flaws, embraces me and then draws me back into that sense of wonder all over again.
