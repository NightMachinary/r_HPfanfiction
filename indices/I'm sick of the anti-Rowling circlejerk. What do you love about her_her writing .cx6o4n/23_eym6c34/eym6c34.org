I will always dislike her more than like her. The only thing I am grateful for his her creation of a wonderful world (even if gleaned from other writets) and excellent character's.

She writes simplistically (probably not intentionally) but the story is easy to immerse yourself in due to the imaginative descriptions. I think her descriptions are what make her writing style as the images pop in your mind without even trying.

That said... I think she cut the legs off from underneath her trying to overcomplicate and overcompensate to prove she's not predictable, that her character's dont fit into norms, and that her writing is profound. This is what makes me so sad.

Thanksfully fanfic has some good writers out there that have turned HP into it's TRUE potential which I dont feel JKR ever did.
