The way she embraced fanfiction and fandom was so incredibly important for fanworks as a whole, and we should always appreciate her for that. I also like that in terms of world building, she created a very interesting world with enough room for people to explore on their own. She's also excellent at the whole comfy vibe of Hogwarts.
