I love the characters who are not black and white and I love the world JKR created. I love that HP books are fun and engaging mysteries and not an infodump of lore some people think they want. One of my favourite things about the books is JKR's satire; I don't think she gets enough credit for that.

I don't agree with some fans' desire for gritty realism in canon and love that HP books are optimistic about human nature and hopeful about the future. Which is very much not the the case for JKR's other books, btw. And those are worth checking out for people who seriously think she's can't move on from HP universe. She wrote 5 non-HP books since the DH! Good books, too.
