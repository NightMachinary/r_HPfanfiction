[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero][Byronic heroes]] are charismatic characters with strong passions and ideals, but who are nonetheless deeply flawed individuals who may act in ways which are socially reprehensible because he's definitely contrary to his mainstream society. A Byronic hero is on his own side and has his own set of beliefs which he will not bow nor change for anyone.

A Byronic hero is a character whose internal conflicts are heavily romanticized and who himself ponders and wrestles with his struggles and beliefs.

Severus Snape is essentially a Byronic hero, as seen by a protagonist who sees much more of his negative qualities than his positive ones. He's an intelligent loner who's also completely insufferable, with a tragic backstory involving death and unrequited love which caused him to become embittered but also to go over to the side of good.

Sirius is apparently quite clever and used to be very attractive before the strain of being locked up for twelve years for a crime he didn't commit ruined his good looks. Plus, bonus points for being slightly mad, a wee bit homicidal, and the last heir of a noble family from which he inherited a spooky old house. And both he and Snape have a flair for the melodramatic.
