I suspect Remus just followed James and Sirius' lead as a child.\\
As for his behaviour with Snape, he behaves like a reasonable adult, whereas Sirius spent 12 years in hell on earth being mentally tortured, then lived on the run, then got trapped in the house he fled from at 16, so he's got some real issues.\\
Also Snape was a right asshole and lied to try and get Sirius kissed so he had every right to hate the man.
