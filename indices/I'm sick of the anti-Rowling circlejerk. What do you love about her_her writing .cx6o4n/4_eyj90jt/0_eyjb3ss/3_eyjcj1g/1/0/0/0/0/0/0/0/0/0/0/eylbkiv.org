I'm not saying he's thinking very rationally or clearly, am I? But to be fair, if you're trying to get your enemy in trouble (which yeah kinda shitty, but such a petty teenager thing to do) it's easier to believe that perhaps your theory was wrong and they really are just doing something else stupid and probably trying to get /you/ in trouble, than it is to believe that someone (even someone you hate) would actually send you to go in the same place as a transformed werewolf. That make sense? Also we never really hear what his “theory” is. Sure it's likely he had an inkling that Remus is a werewolf, but for all we know, his theory could've been something way off (also possible if one considers that the marauders would've likely done all they could to confuse the heck out of Severus).

And to be honest... even if he did go over there knowing there was a good chance of finding a werewolf on the other side (which is definitely a stupid and bad idea), I don't think that's at all equal or in any way excuses the fact that Sirius actually /told/ him where and how to get there. One is a stupid, misguided thing, the other is attempted murder. 🤷🏻‍♀️
