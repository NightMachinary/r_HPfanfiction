Put yourself in his shoes, maybe even make it a bit more extreme.

The schoolyard bully nearly runs you over until another kid you like even less pushes you out of the way. 10 years later, the bully is about to be put to death - as torturously as possible - for a crime you know he did not commit. Would you or any even remotely decent person try to have him killed?

It's absolutely understandable he carries resentment, but I can't put myself in his mind with his decision at all. It's almost comically evil.
