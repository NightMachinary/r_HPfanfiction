Maybe so.... since there are so many “what if”s left unanswered, we'll never really know for sure who is more to blame. 🤷🏻‍♀️Context matters, and we're missing a lot of it. It was still pretty shitty of Sirius to betray Remus's trust like that, though. If it had been literally anyone else (other than the loner Snape with little to no parental support) Remus would've been in a whole world of legal trouble (even though he's honestly the least guilty member, and actually kinda a victim, in this situation). Back to my original point though, I think that betrayal of trust probably cut deeper than Harry and we ever imagined. I mean how else is it that Sirius suspected Remus was the real spy if there hadn't remained some tension? It could help explain Remus's own ability to believe Sirius of betraying James and lily? (Afterall, he betrayed one friend's dangerous secret...not unreasonable for anyone to think he could've been capable of betraying another best friend)
