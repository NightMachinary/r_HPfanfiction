Do you see what you're saying? Lol even thinking they're doing something sus, they're all used to thinking Hogwarts as the safest place in the world. If you're saying that Snape should've known what he was walking into, I'd have to disagree. also I'm a bit worried for and about you and the people you know if you think it's reasonable that someone you hate would try to kill you if given the chance... He probably expected the worst it could be was another cruel prank, and prepared to defend himself for /that/, but boom it's a rabid, transformed werewolf instead.
