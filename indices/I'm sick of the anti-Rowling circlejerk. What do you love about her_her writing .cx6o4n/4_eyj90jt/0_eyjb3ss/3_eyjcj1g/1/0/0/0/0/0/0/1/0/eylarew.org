You're simplifying it far too much. Way wayyyy too much. Besides, my original argument isn't that Snape /lied/ about Sirius's innocence in the Potter murders. Think about it. He shows up at the shack to see 3 students scared, unarmed, and confused. And black and Lupin like bffs again. All in the room where he probably still associates a lot of his trauma. Then he's stunned and doesn't wake up until it's all over. Not to mention, he can't be sure of what else he saw in those moments leading up to him being stunned, because as far as he knows Sirius is a dangerous criminal who likely had an accomplice (that's another point against Lupin I won't get into now. I understand why he didn't say anything about the animagus transformation or the Map for plot reasons) Anyway my /point/ is that Snape probably actually believed his own words when he said Harry, Hermione, and rom were confounded. Because Sirius being capable of that fits neatly with his world-view since he (and the rest of the wizarding world -/including Sirius' own friends/) still thinks he's guilty.
