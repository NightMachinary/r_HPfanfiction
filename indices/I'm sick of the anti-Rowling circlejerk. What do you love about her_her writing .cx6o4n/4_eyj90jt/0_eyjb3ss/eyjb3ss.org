I disagree on the black and white. The story is very much a good and evil story. The only "grey" character is Snape and MAYBE Malfoy. Voldemort is evil because "Mwauahahahaha" and Dumbledore is the good guy who is always right in the end.

Part of why I love Fanfiction is that it breaks these themes and unlocks the untapped potential the series didn't explore.
