I disagree that you disagree on the black and white.

JKR shows that even the good guys can make mistakes and the bad guys can still do the right thing. Yes there are some character that are pure evil, but there's no one that's purely good.

Dumbledore is right in the end, but did that excuse his treatment of Harry, especially his Horcrux? Did that makes him a bad person? Even Harry did two of the Unforgivables, one of them for a fairly selfish reason. Ron's first reaction about werewolf, half giant, and house-elf shows that even the good guys can have a shitty prejudice, but they can grow themself out of that prejudice. I don't even have to start on Hermione.
