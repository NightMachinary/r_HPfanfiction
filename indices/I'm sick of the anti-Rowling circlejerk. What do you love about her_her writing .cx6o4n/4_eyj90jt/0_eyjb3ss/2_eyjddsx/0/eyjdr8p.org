Rowling has her own form of "morally questionable", but it is absolutely nothing like what most stories would see as good, grey, and dark. Canon Voldemort barely qualifies as random thug levels of evil in many stories for example.

Rowling had a very black and white view. These people are good and these are bad. There are few exceptions and those exceptions tend to be only slightly lighter/darker than pure black and pure white.
