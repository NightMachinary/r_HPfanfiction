I do like how she put together various aspects of British folklore all together to create some form of unified "world" or history and how it's just slightly outside normal society in a way that it creates the idea that you wish it could be real.

It is a shame that much of it does start to fray and fall apart the moment you put any particular part under a microscope but just as a broad brush that you just accept exists as a place to tell at least the first few books it was great.
