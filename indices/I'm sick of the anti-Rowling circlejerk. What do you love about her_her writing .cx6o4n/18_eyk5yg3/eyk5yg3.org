JKR knows how to tell a good story with proper character development and foreshadowing. Also as a non-Brit, the series has a complete British vibe to it. She drops plenty of clues and has hints of non-PG humor that make re-reads enjoyable!

She also utilizes common tropes well. OotP was very relatable as a somewhat rebellious teenager. PoA and HBP give me teen drama/movie vibes. She created a magical world that is very relatable
