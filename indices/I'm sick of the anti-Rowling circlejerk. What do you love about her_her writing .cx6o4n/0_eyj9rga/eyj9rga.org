Sneaking lots of really profound stuff into a children's book, I guess. I mean, there are a lot of problems, but... a lot of thought went into the original 7, if not into anything else in the franchise. A lot. Foreshadowing, complex characters, social commentary, allusions...

I am the perfect age to have grown up with HP and I did read the books in real time, but I dismissed them because I was a snarky know-it-all who was too good for them. Fast forward to a couple of years ago, a terrible period of insomnia got me reading them again, and... immediately re-read them. Re-read a couple of times since then and I also listen to a podcast called "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text" which I recommend to everyone, it's great. It's like, suddenly all this beauty that was always under my nose revealed itself to me.
