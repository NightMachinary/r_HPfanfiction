That's really very true. And yet even book 1 has heartbreaking moments for adults.

The most painful part in book 1 to me is Harry telling Hagrid there's no way he is special because if he were, he could handle the Dursleys better. I want to yell at the page, stop blaming yourself, Harry! Then you read book 6 and see Tom Riddle's reaction and he's like hell yeah I am special. This is not only insightful but super subtle character design.
