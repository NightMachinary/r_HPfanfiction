I was also the right age to have grown up with the books as they were published --- approximately the age of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in Books 4-7 as they were released --- and I absolutely loved them at the time (and still do now).

That said, I completely took for granted how considerate JKR was to the mindset of the characters at their various ages. OotP is often called out for the elements of “teenage drama” and “angst,” particularly based on outbursts from Harry. I was fairly close in age to book-Harry at the time it was released, so while I understood the scenarios that annoyed other older readers, to me the characters' behaviors weren't so remarkable. To me, the characters' thoughts and actions were mostly within the spectrum of what I'd expect, especially given the intense pressure the characters were under.

I know I didn't fully appreciate the age-authentic tone and relatability of JKR's work until much, much later. One of my siblings recently read the books for the first time, and her adult reactions were so different from my teenage reactions. In my re-readings, I still carried with me my teenaged impressions, but through my sibling's eyes, I finally fully appreciated the significance of an adult being able to effectively capture a pre-teen and teenage experience, to the point that readers of that age don't even think twice about it.

Despite recognizing and relating so strongly to that age-authentic writing then, and appreciating it now, I highly doubt I'd be able to replicate it. I did a re-read recently just to fully experience it, and sure enough those books grow up precisely with the characters --- in terms of tone, plot, insight, and language --- while still carrying enough weight to engage much older readers as well. I think most authors would be hard pressed to do the same.
