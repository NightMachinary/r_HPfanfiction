The whole reason there's an anti-rowling circle jerk is she's gone back and gone completely against a lot of what we loved about her.

What I loved is how far out of her way she went to make her story internally consistent. Like, there's a clearly established timeline and she goes to a lot of trouble to make sure everything doesn't just fit, it makes logical sense that it fits there and why. And she's real REAL clever about adding stuff to it, introducing Barty Crouch Jr, arguably horcruxes (unarguably clever, arguable if it's timeline related), the whole bit with the time turners... (and Fantastic beasts 2 fucks a LOT of this...)

I love how consistent her characters are. They felt REAL. You can take specific lines and know exactly what character that's probably from even if they're not familiar. It's why IMO HP Fanfiction has taken off so much, because they still feel like the SAME character instead of just saying lines and putting a name on them (again.....issue with CC and FB).
