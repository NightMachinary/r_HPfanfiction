Regardless of what has happened or how long it's been since I read them, even the thought of Harry Potter always makes me smile. She wrote them in such an amazing, wondrous way, and I just absolutely adore every single book in the series. It's truly amazing how she subtly included more serious themes even in the first books, in a manner than made it so that people of any age could read and love them because there are elements for all ages. I don't really know how to put it into words. I'm just really grateful to her for writing them and going through the effort of sharing it with the world despite how difficult it was.
