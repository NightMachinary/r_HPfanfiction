It's a fantasy shop trope - the ancient doodad that's been there since the owner's grandad's days that only gets attention by the 'right customer'. It might be a British Literature thing, but it's pretty well known. There's even an entire book series based around the concept that I can't for the life of me remember the name of, and Terry Pratchett used it twice.
