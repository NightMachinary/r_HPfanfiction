Good news: I think most of your questions get answered during book 3. If I remember right the thing with Quirrel was the Baron or one of the other ghosts possessing Harry and wiping his memories afterwards and the ghosts wanted him to get the locket for something that happens later. It's been a little over a year since I read the fic so it's all a little foggy.

Bad news: It's only going to get more confusing from here on out but there's some really neat world building in there. I don't want to spoil anything but the author's version of Durmstrang is pretty much my headcanon now.

Suggestions: Since I read it over the course of a couple months I started jotting down notes about major plot points character decisions to keep things straight. Really helped once the Merlin time travel stuff started cropping up because my God was that convoluted. Give it a shot if things are starting to get too much.
