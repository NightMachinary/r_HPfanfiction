WOW. Just got done with the first three chapters --- you were right. I'm hooked.

CW: NSFW, and spoilers for the story: It's really, really rare to see sensitive depictions of female on male sexual assault in Fanfiction, so I'm really glad I found this. Harry is so in character, and even just two chapters in, I'm glad to see Ron being himself, and Hermione herself.
