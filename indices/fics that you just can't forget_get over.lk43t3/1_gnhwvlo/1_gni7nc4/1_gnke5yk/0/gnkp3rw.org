here's the bio: "Harry's doing just fine: being Quidditch Captain and 'the Chosen One' doesn't leave him with time to worry about much besides school and the growing threat of war. He's especially not worrying about the fact that Sirius is dead. Or about an embarrassing, uncomfortable night with a classmate he'd rather just forget. Really. He's fine." (set in year 6, canon compliant but obviously follows an extra story line.) i suggest reading the warnings inside as well. the characterization and the reactions they have are so well done, it truly is an amazing fic.
