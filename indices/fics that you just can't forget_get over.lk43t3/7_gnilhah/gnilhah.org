Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. This is a hill I'm willing to die on. Yes, it was abandoned as the writer couldn't think of how to continue and the ideas were taken from his/her other fic. But the plot and world-building are glorious.

2 of TheEndless7's fics really left an impact on me. Vitam Paramus for how empty I felt while reading it. The other one is probably the most infamous alternate ending in this community - the one in Letters.
