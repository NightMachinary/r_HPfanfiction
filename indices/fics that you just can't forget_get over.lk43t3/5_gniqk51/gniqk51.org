Few stories have captured my attention like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]

I just really enjoy that kind of story and its take on magic.

Oh my God the author updated recently. I thought this fic was abandoned (after 1.2 mil words). Literally just made my day seeing the author update.
