Eyes of Gentry Green. It had AMAZING original ideas, characters were well thought out and original while still being Canon compliant.

The writer lost all interest due to some horrible reviews and bullying and it will never be finished. I reread it occasionally and it just kills me that it will never be done.

Which is part of why I am adamant that writers take care of themselves and offer no explanations and readers can fuck off with their entitlement and bullying.

The Marriage Stone is another one that was new and original and amazing and wasn't finished. Its inspired a least a few attempts by other writers to wrap things up.
