I don't know why you're having such a reaction to this. No fics are entirely canon compliant, because only what JK Rowling writes is really canon. It does not take place in an alternate universe is all I meant, and it does not change anything we learned in the books. Maybe Sirius and Remus aren't clearly bi in the books, but honestly, we don't have enough information to say they aren't. Gay and bi people look and act just like "regular" people.

I apologize if I mislead anyone with my original comment.
