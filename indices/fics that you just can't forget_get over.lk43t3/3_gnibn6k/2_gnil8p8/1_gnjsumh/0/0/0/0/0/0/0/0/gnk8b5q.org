I meant that it's misogynistic. You're fighting ignorance with ignorance. And it implies that it's wrong for men to be emotional. Not every man needs to be aggressively masculine.

I do appreciate your frustration with the way gay guys are often depicted, however. I acknowledge that it's a problem and I've noticed it as I read fanfics and original literature alike. And on TV and in movies. I just don't agree that Sirius' characterization in ATYD is terribly OOC.
