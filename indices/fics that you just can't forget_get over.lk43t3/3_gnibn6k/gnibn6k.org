All the Young Dudes rips my soul out every time I think about it. It's a really gripping Marauder's Era retelling. Very canon complaint, with a Remus/Sirius main pairing. It follows them all the way from first year to the end of the war, with a few little sequels that button things up nicely.

At the same time, it gives you this feeling of "it can't be over. It can't be." It does such a great job of tying you up in the storyline. I have only read it twice because it is such an emotional ordeal.
