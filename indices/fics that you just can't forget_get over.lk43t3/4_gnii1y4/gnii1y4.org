Probably the Pureblood Pretense series and the Alexandra Quick series. I just find their world building really interesting. Also several of Carnivorous Muffin's fics. And The Boy Who Lived by Santi, RIP sweet fic, you ended too soon. Maybe 0-800 Rent A Hero. Never seen such an interesting take on divination before. It's something that has the potential to be so useful if it was usable in a practical manner, and I wish there were more non abandoned fics exploring that.

Actually now that I think about it a bit, one fic comes to mind. It was on Ao3, I have it bookmarked but don't remember the name offhand, but it was a HP Naruto crossover where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the same people as Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura, and were living both lives simultaneously. Unforunately it was a short fic with only like 1-2 chapters per person, and only got about to the point where canon starts for both franchises. The author mentioned eventually wanting to do a sequel longer fic that would actually cover the canon time periods of both, but that was a few years ago, and would in any case presumably take 10x-100x as many words as what is currently there, so is probably a pipe dream. But this might be my favorite concept for a crossover ever.
