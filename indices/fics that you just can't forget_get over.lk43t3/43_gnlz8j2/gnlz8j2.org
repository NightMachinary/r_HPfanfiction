My personal favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7168800/1/Crimson-with-a-Silver-Lining][Crimson with a silver lining]] which is beyond amazing. I wouldn't even say it's well written. I'd say it's written like a traditional novel. I also really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14513535/chapters/33531078][Belladonna]] Which is Fred Weasley x OC. WIP Another that I enjoy immensely is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5203025][The Destiny You Sold]]. I cannot begin to describe this. It has got to be one of my favorite Drarry fics. Another I liked is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21788248][The Calm Before The Storm]] well written WIP though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25248820][No Magic, No Life]] Even though I know next to nothing about Naruto, I couldn't put down this Fic until I had finished it. Sadly WIP. Some that I am currently reading are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28512861][Becoming One]] TW: suicidal thoughts but it's pretty good so far. I also really liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1078809][An Unexpected Universe]] it was so good. I could go for hours but I shall spare you.
