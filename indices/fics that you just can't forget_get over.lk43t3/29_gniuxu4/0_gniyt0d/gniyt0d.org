I love the wartime chapters ( which start about halfway through from memory). The politics and the gradual corruption of pre-war principles sucks me in everytime. The characters are so well written and true to how they are in canon IMHO. I tend to skip the post-war chapters (which the fic begins and ends with) just because they depict such horrid events. While I managed to watch the Handmaid's Tale series, I have trouble reading about a similar scenario here, even though it's expertly written.
