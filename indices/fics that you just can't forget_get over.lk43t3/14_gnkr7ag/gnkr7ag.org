It's very unique, extremely well written and it just stays in your head. Voldemort goes back in time and raises himself. Everyone is true to their cannon form, there is no bashing, it gets a little dark in some places, but not too much.

It's a great character study of Voldemort, through the eyes of his younger self, who doesn't know who Voldemort is and is spending the story trying to find out, more and more obsessed and fascinated with this very odd man that took him out of Wool's, saving him from a bad life.
