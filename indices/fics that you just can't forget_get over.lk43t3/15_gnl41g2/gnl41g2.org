linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7)

Antithesis has a way of staying with you longer than you expect.

I'm not sure how to explain why without going into spoilers, but it had a believable representation of the consequences of child neglect, and some of my favorite characters in HP fanfic. Its by far the best WBWL fic I've read, and apparently the only one of reasonable size that's been completed? At least as far as I know.

Its also quite dark and depressing. Don't read it if you're not in the mood for that. As I've mentioned, it tends to stay with you.
