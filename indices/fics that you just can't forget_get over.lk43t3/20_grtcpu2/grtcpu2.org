I hope you're still looking for recommendations! I saved this on mobile last month hoping to come back when I had time.

Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete.
2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.
3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.

These are unranked but I love them all

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1471166][HEX]] is a series that takes place in an AU. I can't quite catch where the point of deviation is, but it's just too fun to matter. It's more of a series of character studies than super plotty and it's very much coming of age. Hermione is a black Muslim activist and daughter of immigrants. Harry was adopted by Remus/Sirius when he was ten but still struggles with issues regarding food and control from then. Ginny struck a chord with me because, when I was a teen, I definitely let my boyfriends subsume my identity. Definitely recommend this one.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind. oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15834660][Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)]] is a great, nuanced look at an ace character struggling to come to terms with his identity and learn how to set and maintain boundaries.
- A new favorite of mine is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one.
- Actually, I've loved most things by the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][Lettered]] (same as Away Childish Things). My favorites are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22062673][By the Grace]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708][Another Mask Behind You]] (fair warning: there is SO MUCH sex right from the start), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1343047][The Fall of the Veils]] (after war with Muggles and Draco is ace), and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392764][The Pure and Simple Truth]] (Slytherins and Gryffindors are all grown up and off to pubs in various combinations).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. It is complete. The writing really stuck with me, especially a poem towards the end
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]] is an oldie but a goodie. It's 15 years young. Harry spends his days volunteering at a children's shelter. He doesn't remember magic or anything about his old life until he sees a familiar face.... It is complete. It's kinda weird, maybe, but I thought a lot about a part where one character is surprised that another helps him, to which he responds, "I said I would, didn't I?" It made me think about my reliability and if I could honestly say that.
- Like And So Life Goes On, I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] when I was in high school. I haven't read it in a while, but it sparked a long love for the poetry of Yeats, which inspired a tattoo.
