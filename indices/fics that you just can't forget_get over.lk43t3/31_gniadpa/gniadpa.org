I don't think I'd necessarily word it as “can't get over” but I go and reread parts of Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin at least once a month.

Oh but if you are going to try to read it I have some things to note:\\
* I really dislike the prologue (or i guess chapter 1? Idk what exactly to call it). It turned me off the fic for a while until I eventually just skipped to the next chapter, at which point I was hooked.\\
* Yes, James and Jim start out really shitty. They do improve (that's definitely not saying they become perfect, but they do get better).\\
* While I liked book 1, I truly fell in love with the fic in book 2.
