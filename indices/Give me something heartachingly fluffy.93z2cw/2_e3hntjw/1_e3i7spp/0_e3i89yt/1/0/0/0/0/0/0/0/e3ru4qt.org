Ahhhh too true. Hopefully we get some new blood or content coming with the new Fantastic Beasts film.

I sometimes pass the time with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9484157/1/The-Flurry-of-Life][Flurry of Life]] but it's more like a one a day thing. I would recommend getting an account and looking at Jeconais fics if you haven't read them already. Some pretty good fluff there.
