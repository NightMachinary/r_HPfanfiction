Okay, so in the available Flowerpot fics, 98% of them are trash. There is a VERY good reason why my flair is Garbage Sifter. A perusal through the top reviewed Flowerpot fics on FF.net will not help matters much. Most of the most "popular" fics are pretty bad harem fics. I've tried to give you what I consider the best of all the ones I know of, but I encourage you to do your own sifting if you like any of these!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] - This is a really fun angsty, power fantasy. It was abandoned unfortunately, but what's there is a ton of fun. Don't take it too seriously. Top 4 fics of all time for me.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Enslavement/index/][Enslavement]] - This one was originally a one shot, but was expanded when Jeconais remade it (don't worry I don't only ready angst!). This is kind of fun and is only loosely Flowerpot in reality, but a fun quick read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power]] - Possibly one of my top 4 fics of all time, it's just a really great read. Beginning is a little rough, but once it gets going its so wonderful. Unfortunately it also was abandoned, but it's quite the read!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters]] - Written by TE7 this one is a really good read! Wonderful romance! It recently got a new chapter this past Christmas. I haven't read this one in a while, but I really like it when I did.

This last recommendation isn't Flowerpot but is Harry/Gabbrielle but is really fluffy and sweet: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]].

Now if you read all of those and do a little more research into Flowerpot fics, you may realize that there is a glaring omission of the most popular Flowerpot fic that happens to rhyme with Vadmean Cictory. This is a very polarizing fic that people either love or hate. I have been on both sides of the argument, in so far as I used to openly defend it but then moved to relentlessly ridiculing it. DO NOT READ THIS FIC FIRST NO MATTER WHAT. It will give you a very poor impression of what Flowerpot can be. All that said, if you loved what you read, you might want to give it a shot. and form your own opinion. Just be warned.
