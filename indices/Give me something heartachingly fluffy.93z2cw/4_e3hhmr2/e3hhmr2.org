A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy (just google it, on FFN) is pretty fluffy, though Dramione (sorry if that's not what you're looking for). Post-war reformed Draco has a super cute kid from a previous marriage whom he sends to preschool where Hermione's the teacher. Fluff ensues when she agrees to be the boy's mother figure. There's no violence or any sort of conflict, mostly slow and heartwarming.
