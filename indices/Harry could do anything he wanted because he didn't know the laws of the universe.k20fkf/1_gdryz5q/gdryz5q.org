For a moment, I thought that it was [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]], where Harry learns to do things because he doesn't know that the things in question are impossible, but the other details showed me that it was not the fic you were after.

Ironically, I've read the fic you want to find and I can't remember its title either!
