Kinda wish I did. Nowadays I write a review from pretty much every story I read, no matter how much of it, so I could create like a ratings sheet if I wasn't lazy. But I wish I started when I first started reading fics, if only so I could see how many of those stories no long exist. Right now the only historical evidence is a mix of my favorites and my reviews.
