Yeah, I keep a detailed Excel spreadsheet of the long fics I've completed, with a detailed rating system, reviews for each, and subgenre/tropes, as well as a running ticker of how many I've finished.

I've thought about sharing it online, but it's constantly under construction as I think I only have around 70% of the fics I've finished on there (and missing many more short ones that I've read). And since all my email accounts are at least indirectly linked to my real name and I just don't want to go through the hassle of creating a fifth or sixth email, I don't see myself doing that anytime soon.

If anyone wants the list, PM me and I'll try to make a plaintext version that I can copy/paste into a PM.
