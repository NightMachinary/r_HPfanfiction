I have a 4000-entry LibreOffice spreadsheet that's a combination "fics I've read/fics I plan to read/author pages" database. It's not online, and I'm not planning to post it, because:

a) I keep adding fields to it to make it more useful to me, and I haven't caught up many of the entries since the last new field was added, and

b) I've decided I'm not happy with it, but I haven't decided what to do about it. My rating system needs work, and the field that contains comments to help me recognize the story doesn't have enough information in many cases.

It's also not just HP stories - I have a lot of Ranma 1/2 and Naruto stories in it, as well as a smattering of other fandoms.
