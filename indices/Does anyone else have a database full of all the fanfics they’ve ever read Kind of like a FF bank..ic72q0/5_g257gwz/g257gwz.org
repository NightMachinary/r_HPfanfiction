Do you want something like goodreads for fanfic? Are the existing archive sites not already something like that?

I don't have anything like a db or spreadsheet myself, especially for fanfic. I couldn't imagine it having 1000s of entries, given the length of some HP fic. I'd also be reluctant to post detailed comments on some of the stories.

Most fanfic when you get down to it is pretty bad, and I consider it worth reading if it has enough good or interesting parts to keep paying attention anyway. But I know that the authors write the stuff because they love to, it's for their own satisfaction as much as for anyone else's, so I usually won't want to post that someone's story mostly stinks. I'll either not read it, or appreciate it for its non-stinking parts and forgive the rest.
