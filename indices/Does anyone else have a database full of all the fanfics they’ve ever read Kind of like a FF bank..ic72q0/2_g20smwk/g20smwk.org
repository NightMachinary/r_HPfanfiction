I generally skip oneshots, but I mostly read with my kindle and therefore download everything to calibre. (Skip as in I don't download the short ones)

I'm in the middle of reorganizing atm (added a trope category / cleaning up the 'genre' one / plus a decent sized backlog of unlabeled fics) but I can use the catalog function to make a list if you like. It'll just... be messy atm.

Most aren't rated either (except for the few that I stuck in the "just bad" category lol) but at least the in-progress/complete/abandoned labels are up to date. There's nearly 600 fics.
