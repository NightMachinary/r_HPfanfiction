My first impressions are that this is a well-written and seemingly though-out story. The main issues that I see so far are the potential for Ron bashing, the usage of tropes and the OC. With the introduction of any OC, there's always the pitfall of it being unnecessary, wish fulfilment, poorly thought out. There is no evidence as of the first chapter to point at any of these issues, a promising sign for the fic.

​

Ron bashing is certainly something I have concerns about. You say the Ron goes through some "ups and downs" which is fair but is also the lie many people will give at the start of their fics when they do Ron bashing. Many authors often go down the route of obvious Ron bashing while pretending that it's about Ron's character development. My concern is that Ron seems to be OOC, and not for the better. It seems like you've started the beginnings of a bash to create reason for your OC and Hermione to get together.

​

My biggest concern is the Hogwarts Charter and sovereignty. This is certainly a concept that has been used many times before. It's an obvious change from canon where Hogwarts was not sovereign and the government held power over Wizarding Britain. It seems to be used as a convenient way for Dumbledore to defeat Aurors and frankly seems lazy and brings up more issues than resolves them. You can strip magic? Do purebloods have a right to be worried about their magic being stolen? Dumbledore can't even effortlessly handle 8 aurors? Then how on earth is Voldemort an issue? It also implies that other unoriginal tropes might have been used which is a concern (ex: Ron bashing)

It's a great fic and the fact that it's been written before release is a good sign. I hope this was slightly more constructive (even if you disagree completely) than another "Great fic, update soon" type of response. I look forward to further releases. 3.5/5 and I anticipate the rating will rise.
