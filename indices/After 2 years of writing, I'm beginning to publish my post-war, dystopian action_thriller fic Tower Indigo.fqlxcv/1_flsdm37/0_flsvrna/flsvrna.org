Thank you! I really appreciate your candid feedback.

(Spoilers for chapter 1 below, as one might imagine.)

I empathise with your concern for the Ron bashing. To be perfectly frank, you may be right -- it's entirely possible that I'm misgauging Ron's arc in this fic. I know in earlier drafts, /both/ of my betas expressed their overt concerns about Ron bashing, and in fact, Ron went through several re-writes to get to where he is now! If you are sensitive to this concern, then you probably aren't going to like the next several chapters. I will stand by the claim that he is treated appropriately by the end of the fic, but we really aren't going to see that until the last few chapters of the story. If it helps, Ron really isn't a major part of the story altogether. The other thing I will say that is that everything that happens will make a *lot* more sense as the story gets into its final chapters, but I recognise that

- at best, that's not immediately satisfying, and
- at worst, it sounds like a cop-out.

Regarding the Charter and sovereignty: my personal take on it is that within the confines of Hogwarts, Dumbledore has immense power (both magical and "political"), but on the other hand, he's also... human. I debated for awhile on what the scene with the 8 Aurors vs Dumbledore would look like, and my fear was that making it too /easy/ for him to rebuff the 8 Aurors would diminish the Ministry's apparent power and authority; this is a particularly important concern as the story unravels. In a similar vein to my previous paragraph -- a lot of this will start making more sense (I hope) in later chapters. Again, that's not necessarily a satisfying or even /good/ answer, but that's how it panned out in this fic.

At any rate, I genuinely am appreciative of this feedback, and it's really great to keep these things in mind as I'm writing my future fics (I've already started on the next fic!). Finally, I just thought I'd mention, I don't want to come off as "my writing is best and you just don't get it", nor as "I'm super defencive and here's all the reasons I'm right". That said, I recognise there are some flaws in this fic; some minor, others perhaps not-so-minor. (I can give more details when the full fic is released!)

I hope you continue reading to see how your impression of the fic changes -- whether for better or for worse. But if you say, "I don't think I can read this fic any longer based on X and Y and Z", I can respect that too!
