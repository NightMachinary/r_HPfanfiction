Ah, okay. Hmm. I think the closest things I know to what you're looking for are the 'people trying to find Harry' fics. They're definitely not what you're looking for, since they tend to focus on the people searching for Harry while he does those blundering-into-situation thing.

So, they're less:

"This is just getting silly!" he cries as he badly plays a guitar in a musical duel against a creature that looks like the devil.

-And more:

"Is that... Harry?" Hermione cries, as she looks at the front page Prophet picture of a dark haired man playing guitar against what looked like a bloody Devil.

Sorry. Those're the closest I've got. I don't think I've really seen anyone take a proper stab at the Make a Wish formula (and for anyone else reading the thread, Make a Wish link below). I can post them if you want, but they're not really what you're looking for.
