  "... Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!" ~Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter Six, Draco's Detour, page 119.
