Without any goddamn every-two-words twinspeak.

In all seriousness, I think it's best if they're subtle in their differences. Something that can only be noticed if you know the both of them a lot, you know? At least that's what I like.

I made my Fred just a bit more... thoughtless? Insensitive? I'm not really sure what word to use, because the former makes him appear dumber while the latter makes him look like a jerk. He just blurts things out in a blunt manner more so than George. They're still very alike, but George is a tiny bit more mature in dealing with his friends while Fred's thoughtlessness comes out in both his victims and those he cares about. He also has slightly more freckles.

I agree. For all of their inventions, they were incredibly smart. They just didn't put their intelligence into schoolwork, but rather other things such as the shop. Sure, the other Weasleys all got more O.W.L.S. but I honestly don't think any of them attributed to the war more than the twins, or perhaps /could have/ attributed. The books don't really go much into how Fred and George deal with helping out outside those protective hats. That's a canon thing, right? The protective hats? It's not just a fanfiction invention?
