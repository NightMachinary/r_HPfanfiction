Am I the only one that doesn't really like them too much? They're... well, dicks. They bully their siblings, especially Percy but also Ginny. And the fact that they don't listen to their parents isn't always a good thing. It is, however, what siblings do (play games, tease etc). I could be pretty nasty with my siblings but what makes me uncomfortable is all the readers approving of/glossing over what they do.

As an adult, someone with a lot of siblings and even a twin of my own, I don't know. Sure, they can be nice and independent but they are pretty nasty too. If I had those two as siblings I'd tear them to pieces.

Back to the question! I've never seen them as individuals myself. They're like Huey, Dewey and Louie, where even the authors think of them as the same person. It's easier to take initiative if there's more than one of you and you can spur each other on. Also, you have more hands, feet and brains which is another advantage. Imagine how the twins would be recieved in the books if everything happened like it did but instead of two characters, it was just one.
