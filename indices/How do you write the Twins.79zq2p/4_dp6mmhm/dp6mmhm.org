Yeah, they are individuals if you look at it.

Fred is more rash, and he has more of a temper on him, as well as some of the nastier ideas - it was him Ron was doing the Unbreakable Vow with, it was him that Transfigured Ron's teddy into that spider, and it was him that hit Ron's Puffskein with the Bludger bat.

George is softer. He's normally the first to ask if Harry's alright, and he's very sociable - think of his asking out Angelina for the Yule Ball.

This doesn't mean one is good and one is bad! Both work together in being savagely cruel at times, and both are really kind - as much as Free has a nasty streak, he's very gentle about daubing on cream for Hermione's eye after she picks up the Punching Telescope.

The two ARE very intelligent, and they're also used to being separate from the rest of the family. Think about Molly's prefect talk, "That's everyone in the family!" --- "What are me and Fred? Next-door neighbours?"

For various reasons, I think Percy and Ron often feel the most left-out of the family, but the twins seem to feel the most APART from the family, which is slightly different, and adds to the reason they spend so much time together.

Also, people can tell them apart. Harry always knows Fred and George apart when speaking to them, and they're identical twins, but there's differences between them. Fred and George likely do change clothes or catch people by surprise when people are busy or distracted, though, like they did in the PS King's Cross scene with Molly.
