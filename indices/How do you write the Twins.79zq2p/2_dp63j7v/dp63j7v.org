Well, one way is to go back to the books and look at their dialogue. See if there are any differences in the way each of them speaks. Or, as [[/u/AutumnSouls]] says, invent the differences. Give them specific traits that they can express differently whenever they're not playing off of each other.

One way to look at the twins is them being BFFs that grew up together. They are each other's best friend, sticking with each other through thick and thin. They went on adventures together, they play pranks together, and they probably talk about a lot of sensitive stuff together. These are two people that are often on the same wavelength when it comes to ideas. They can - sometimes - finish each other's sentences because they can follow the other twin's train of thought. They CANNOT finish each other's sentences five times in the same sentence. They are two very good friends with a similar (NOT identical) sense of humor that can play off of each other very well. They speak in complete sentences, but can ping pong back and forth if you don't get a word in.

So, different people, similar interests. Maybe George likes potions while Fred likes Transfiguration. Maybe they both hate charms but Fred is good at it so they use it anyway. Maybe George does most of the talking when they're alone. Etc, etc.
