On topic, I interchange names of Padma and Parvati in my fic series on a regular basis to my own chagrin, despite them having different personalities and niches. I imagine it's the same for the twins, though they get less exposure in my work so it'd be hard to tell. But I tend to write one twin as more hard working, less socially apt and more driven, and the other a bit more of a salesman/socialite with less drive to work, but maybe a bit more creative.
