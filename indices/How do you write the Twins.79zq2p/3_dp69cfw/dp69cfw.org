I have George as the more serious and quiet twin of the two. Fred is the one who thinks of what needs to be done and George is the one to figure out to do what Fred has ideas for.

And yeah I don't do the twin speak, I mean it was funny in the series but after seeing it done in fanfiction so many times I don't do it because after a while it gets annoying.

I also have them good at different subjects. George is good at potions, Charms and Herbology.

Fred is good at Transfiguration's, Defense, and Astronomy.

They are hard working on things that they like to do, but they also aren't afraid of getting down and dirty by doing things that aren't necessarily fun. As long as it helps them or others that they care about.

They are loyal to their family, but to them Percy betrayed them the moment he sided with the Ministry over his parents. It took George a while to really forgive Percy after Fred's death.

They can both hold grudges, although George is the more level headed one at times anyway.

Fred isn't afraid to speak his mind, landing himself in some serious trouble in the progress. They're bold, daring, dedicated to different things.

They aren't doing something to get rich or to live comfortably, they're doing it to enjoy themselves. I see them as being the kind of people who think you only live once so why waste it doing something you hate kind of thinking.
