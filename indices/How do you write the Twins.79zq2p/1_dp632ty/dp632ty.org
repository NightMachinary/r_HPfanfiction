Personally I have Fred be more rash and talkative and the one who is usually leading the charge, as well as the one who is typically keeping spirits up. George on the other hand has a drier wit, a much more volatile temper, and is a little more cautious and willing to listen to authority. Both, however, are very codependent. George needs Fred to come up with ideas and to lead the way because George ALWAYS does what Fred suggests. Fred needs George to rein him in and remind him that actions have consequences.

Alone, Fred would quickly go manic and drive everyone away. George on the other hand would wander aimlessly without real purpose or direction.
