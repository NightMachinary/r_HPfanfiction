I'd like to see a subversion of this: Harry /is/ some sort of deathly demigod, but he does his best to live a normal life doing regular normal stuff, including having a family with someone, having a regular job, et cetera.

Characters that are "in the know" about the more cosmic things from various settings (depending on the crossover), such as Diana of Themyscira or her mother, or Thor/Odin from Asgard, or John Constantine or Zatanna, recognize what he is and proverbially shit their pants on finding out he's involved or just in the nearby area (such as walking home from buying groceries, et cetera), and that sparks off things like an ever escalating ping-pong match in the setting.

Harry, meanwhile, just does his job, goes home to his wife/family, and does regular stuff while the world, unbeknownst to him, is going nuts at "Death walking the streets!".
