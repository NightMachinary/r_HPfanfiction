I've been noodling around with an MCU crossover similar to this. In one version, Harry is a Columbia University professor, has Teddy and SHIELD is loosing their minds trying to figure out wtf to do with him, while he just rolls his eyes and goes on with life. Also includes Loki pissing himself laughing at the idea of SHIELD actually "managing" Harry, a scene I'm rather proud of tbh.

The longer (and well, complete but unposted because I'm unhappy with it) version has him as a bartender giving advice to Coulson, while only Thor and Strange realize who he is.
