This one was good until the author felt the need to add this weird Felicity character. She's such a clich√©, completely one-dimensional and incredibly annoyingly written.

We get a speech about how his magical books are unique in this world, but he doesn't bat an eye to seeing a stranger root through the place those books are stored in. And of course, the character is the insanely boring "sexualized, teasing, cold-blooded killer" archetype that dudebros use when they want to write a powerful female character.
