  Harry Dresden has taken a lot of blows to the head over his career, and woken up in a lot of interesting places, but... aboard the Hogwarts Express in the body of an eleven-year-old boy with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead? Yeah, that's a new one. Most people, they'd just enjoy the ride, but Dresden has read the books, and he REALLY doesn't like dark wizards...
