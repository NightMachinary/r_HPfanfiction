Perhaps I was thinking about “My Nephew Harry” linkffn(5165369) with this story of Petunia's parents:

#+begin_quote
  The true story of the matter of her parentage was that her step-father had rescued her mother who had been raped and was in the process of being murdered. After being led by her parents to believe that if she got an abortion for any reason she would go to hell after enduring a horrible life as punishment for her sin, her mother had kept the pregnancy. Soon after the rescue, she married Mr. Evans who had fallen in love with her during his frequent visits to see if she was alright, and didn't want her to go through the shame of raising a child out of wedlock, especially considering the fact that it hadn't been her fault in the first place. Eventually, her mother had come to love her husband as well, and they had a child of their own which was Lily. She had heard this story only once, shortly after she had reached adulthood, and as it had never been brought up before, it was never mentioned since.

I am not sure I really like the rest of the story, but this background sub-story somehow got stuck in my head.
