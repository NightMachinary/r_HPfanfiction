I've definitely seen a few fics where they were actually half-sisters or one of them (usually Lily) was adopted. I think it's usually used to justify some extra Dumbledore bashing based on the blood protections being BS. Or to make Lily secretly a pureblood because...I don't know, there are probably some reasons that aren't racist, but I can't think of any.

I can't remember any specific fics that used the idea though.
