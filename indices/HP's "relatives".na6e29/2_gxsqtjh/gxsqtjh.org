One of the most interesting takes on Lily's heritage that I've seen is in linkao3(Lady of New Avalon). She and Petunia are actually cousins. Petunia's aunt was a muggleborn auror who was raped by Voldemort as part of a ritual before dying a year later. Lily was adopted by her aunt and remained oblivious to this fact until Sirius accidentally made her mom blab about it.
