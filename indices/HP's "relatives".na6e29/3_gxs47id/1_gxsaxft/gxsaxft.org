Funny Story: I'm currently re-reading "Strings of Fate" (by Knife Hand), which is a "Petunia takes Harry in and teaches him how to outwit the manipulative wizards"-story.

I've heard of some stories where Lily is the adopted one, but those seemed more focused on the idea of Harry being a Parselmouth by inheritance, not to explain Petunia's antagonism. I just always thought it would be fun to have a reason for Petunia to be the adopted one, instead.

Also, thanks for the heads-up on the source of that proverb; I don't think I ever even thought about where it came from before.
