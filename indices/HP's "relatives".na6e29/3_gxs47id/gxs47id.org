Yes, I've seen it quite a bit in bashing fics as a way for the blood wards not to be relevant reason to send Harry to ‘Durskaban'.

It's also often used as a reason petunia can be so cruel, both because of insecurity and also a weird blood is thicker than water thing which is about as relevant to life as using half a proverb and applying it to the opposite of the true meaning of it (blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb)

So on that point, I'd like to see a fic where petunia actually takes him in and adopts him despite her being adopted and Lily being the biological child. And you could even have a nice ‘magic can do anything' moment, where the wards work despite them not having the same genes because she swore she would honour Lily's sacrifice or something And the magic takes her at her word
