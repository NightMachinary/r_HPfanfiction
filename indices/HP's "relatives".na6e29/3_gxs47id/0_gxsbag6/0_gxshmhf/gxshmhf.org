Oh wow! I didn't know that! So interesting!

It might be interesting to think about how changes in beliefs and cultural understandings might change the way magic works if it was intent based as some people have it. If belief is so intrinsic to the way a six forms their intent does blood magic change? if the spell was formed while the saying was blood is thicker than water perhaps the change in cultural belief would mean that the intent in the magic changed or perhaps it doesn't change, and people just assume it will work a certain way because of cultural beliefs and be surprised when it doesn't work
