Actually "Blood is thicker than water" is the original version, dating back to the 12th century in Germany. The longer was created randomly and adopted by a lot of people centuries later. So the true meaning was the original that family is more important than friends. But people realized how stupid that was and now it is the newer one where choosen family is more important than the one you were given.
