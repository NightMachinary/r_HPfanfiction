I'm not saying it's a female experience, though. Saying "male experience" implies that it's something inherent in maleness, which isn't the case, as there are lots of men who aren't at all sexist.

I think you also misunderstood pretty much anything I said, though I don't know if it was on purpose yet.

Also, what the hell are you on about? I never "offended all women", I never even said anything about women. I never said or implied that your feelings aren't of consequence, so I have no fucking idea where you got that from.

Maybe you should calm the fuck down and investigate your thought processes, and maybe /read/ the comments I posted before going off on an insane rant about points that don't exist? //smug//
