"calling it male experience is decidedly sexist"

But implying that it's also female exprience, when women most clearly don't perceive it that way, is not sexist at all? The way you frame your thoughts, 50% of the world's population does not even exist. Is that not "decidedly sexist"?

I guess it'd kill you to refer to it as the experience of "most men" or "patriarchal thinking", because god forbid that any single man in the world is dumb enough to mistake that as you talking about him personally. But it's totally ok to offend ALL women in one go. Our feelings are of no consequence, after all, we took this shit for millenia so we can take a little more, right? //shrug//
