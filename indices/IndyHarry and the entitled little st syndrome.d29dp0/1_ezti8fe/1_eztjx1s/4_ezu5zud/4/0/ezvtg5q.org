I say "people" because I don't directly speak to them, and because I have no accurate picture of them beyond the fact that they exist and are a reasonable mediority. There's no collective designation I could use short of "Sexist", and that one is self-defeating - if I say something else, like Gamer, Republican, Conservative, Religious, etc, I'm insulting a lot of people who aren't guilty of anything but holding opinions I personally don't like but aren't synonymous with sexism.

And on the topic of male experience, calling it male experience is decidedly sexist as well.
