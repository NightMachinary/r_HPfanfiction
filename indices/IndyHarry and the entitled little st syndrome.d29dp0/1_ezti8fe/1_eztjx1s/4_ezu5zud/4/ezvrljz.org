Please stop presenting male experience as everyone's experience. For example, when you say "no-shit woman is at best seen as amusing", please specify who you're speaking about.

If you want to refer to a huge group of people that is sexist, I think you're brave enough to actually name it in your posts. It's already brave to talk about sexism on reddit, so it only makes sense to go all the way.

Nothing personal. I'm just annoyed seeing such posts about sexism all over Internet talking about "everyone", "people" while referring only to men, as if 50% of human race (women) aren't people or we don't exist.
