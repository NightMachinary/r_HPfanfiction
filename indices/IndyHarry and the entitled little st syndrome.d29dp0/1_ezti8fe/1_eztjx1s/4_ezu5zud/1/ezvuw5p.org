Star Wars VII and VIII have a lot of issues, and I don't think it's fair to lump all criticisms of Rey as sexism. The dialogue surrounding the movies gets so toxic on the main starwars subs that I try not to get involved. Honestly I think TLJ gets a lot of flack for fucking up the franchise, but TFA unfairly gets a pass for setting up most of the shit that gets called out in TLJ.

1. The teasing about Vader's lightsaber is resolved in TLJ. Rey isn't a Skywalker.
2. The Palpatine knock-off's backstory isn't really filled in. He's killed abruptly before the climax of the movie.
3. Kylo/Ben's origin story is covered. He's an emo who rebels against his mother for /reasons/ and joins the Dark Side because he has a mancrush on his grandpa. Not sure if they ever told him his grandpa joined the good guys in the end.
4. The Knights of Ren are never referred to again.
5. Carrie Fisher suddenly dies, and a good end to Leia's storyline is cast in doubt. *Not their fault but I just wanted to add on to the list of things that would upset/perturb a fan.
6. A rom-com level miscommunication makes two hero characters become assholes and get into conflict with a new hero character completely needlessly.
7. New hero character dies heroically in a way that puts every fleet battle in every previous movie and tv episode into question.
8. Rey levitates the rocks in a way not previously shown in the movies. Yoda looked like he was passing a gallstone when he levitated that chimney thing in AOTC. Rey looks like the rocks are her friends and they're just hanging around to see how she's doing.

The thing is every point on the list was bound to upset fans. I can see that the writers and directors on TLJ were trying to do something fresh while contending with the tired old plot threads left by TFA. I just think they went too far with trying new things and kind of left these things there unsatisfyingly. I would assign most of the blame for why TLJ was a bad Star Wars movie to TFA not being original enough and TLJ trying to be original but then kind of screwing up the continuity known so far.

So much of the expanded universe was kind of cringey, but like they do with comic book movies they could have mined the stories for the best ideas instead of just rehashing the ANH in TFA.
