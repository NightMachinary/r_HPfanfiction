Here's all you need to know: Luke trained for years, and even at the end of the OT wasn't as powerful with the force as Rey is at the start of the sequel trilogy. She didn't even know the force existed up until that point. She's shown to be not only stronger than Luke in the OT, but Yoda as well. And when she goes to Luke for training, she's so powerful and skilled that she not only beats him, but scares the shit out of him. They're in no way comparable, and even if Luke was a Gary Stu (which he isn't), it would still be to a significantly lesser degree than Rey bring a Mary Sue.
