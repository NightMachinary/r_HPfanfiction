Mate, is this a joke?

The first time Luke goes out alone on the speeder, he gets whipped and knocked unconscious by sand people. The only reason why he survives is Ben K jumping out from behind the rocks and scaring them off. Idk how you can call Tatooine a peaceful desert planet when it's the same damn planet where Luke's grandma was kidnapped and killed by sand people, and his (step)grandpa had his leg taken off at the knee.
