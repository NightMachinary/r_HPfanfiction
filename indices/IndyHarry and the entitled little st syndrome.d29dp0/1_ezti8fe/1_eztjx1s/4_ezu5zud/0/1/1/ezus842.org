As a self proclaimed Star Wars buff I would disagree.

Luke was very much a novice. It took him years to even summon his lightsaber (ESB), and when he got some personal training from the greatest Jedi Master ever, he was way below Vader level, who just toyed with him. He struggled all the time, from the time on his farm, the murder of his Aunt and Uncle, the rescue of the Princess, his fight with the Rebellion, his fight with Vader, etc.

Rey is what I call lazy writing. We all see how underprivileged she is and how she has to scrape to survive, and yet we don't see her mature. Remember how Luke said: "What's that?" when they fleeing were Tatooine to Han? Rey never does that, she already knows how to pilot a spaceship perfectly.

My issue with Rey is that she's literally a Mary Sue, she always does everything perfect, she never makes mistakes, she is way more powerful with no training than Luke was, which is just bullshit.

I just think it's a lost opportunity. If she was developed as a real character, with a proper story arc, I would be much happier, but from what I've seen so far, I've given Star Wars a cold shoulder and I'm no longer interested in the films. And this is coming from someone who played shoot down imaginary Tie Fighters when he was 5 years old. It's been a loooooooooooong time.
