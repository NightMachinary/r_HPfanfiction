Even if the character is well written, she'll still be accused of being an "SJW" mouthpiece if she's anything other than cis, white and heterosexual.

This scientist who had her brain scanned as a basis for AI is gay? SJW! STOP SHOVING GAY SHIT DOWN OUR THROATS!

This wizard takes a potion and does a ritual to transform their body into its true form? SJW! STOP SHOVING TRANS SHIT DOWN OUR THROATS!

This starfleet captain is black? SJW! STOP SHOVING BLACK SHIT DOWN OUR THROATS!

And if intersectionality happens, like a black wizard who does the firedance and becomes a witch but stays attracted to other witches, they die instantly.
