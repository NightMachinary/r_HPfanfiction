There is a multitude of people just accusing any female character with any semblance of competency of being a mary sue, while completely accepting and praising the same thing in a male character.

I mean, look at Rey and Luke from Star Wars for instance, or Michael and Spock from Star Trek.

Luke is a random farmboy living on a desert planet buying */powerconverters/* and maintaining passive water extractors. His life is peaceful and easy, but he can still /somehow/ swing a lightsaber like a jedi, use the force like a master and be an absolute ace pilot with little to no training. All this he does like a Jedi would, despite only spending a few weeks with an insane green goblin. Luke is lauded as a great character despite all this.

Rey is a random scrap-slaver living on a desert planet exploring the wrecks of starships belonging to the most dangerous empire in recent history. She carries a big stick and can use it well. When she gets a lightsaber, she's very unsure with it, angling it away from her body at first, and literally only blocking when attacked by an insane patricidal maniac. Seriously, she doesn't strike him once, check the forest scene. She eventually finds the aforementioned Luke to learn from him, but he brushes her off and she becomes a bit surer with the lightsaber on her own. Her style is still very basic however. She's clearly strong with the force, something not all too uncommon in star wars protagonists, and so lifts a couple of rocks out of the way, something every jedi padawan could do. Oh and also she fights a bunch of guards who literally go one by one, and one of them throws his weapon away to tackle her battle partner. truly competent. Despite all of this, people scream and shout that she's a mary sue, unrealistic, and overpowered. Personally, I think people complain because they wanted /another/ man character.

Star Trek has a similar situation.

Spock the older is a powerhouse. He can do telepathy over many lightyears, mind-meld with literally anything, including alien machines and space-whales, knows literally everything that's needed for the plot on the top of his head, is a scientist, an engineer, a fighter, can single-handedly fly and command a starship, can swiftly communicate with any kind of alien, is literally never panicked, has LITERALLY erased all negative emotions from his mind, and is basically a vulcan tricorder.

Michael Burnham from Discovery however is named the mary sue. Nevermind the fact that the most complex mind-thing she can do is accept a link from her adoptive father, completely fail at the vulcan emotion supressing thing, Mostly stands around being burdened by her past she can't let go and is generally a pretty average part of the crew. I mean she literally mutinied because her dad told her klingons greet eachother by shooting their weapons at the other ship, for fucks sake.

The whole "mary sue" thing comes down to sexism, plain and simple. A headstrong, competent and no-shit woman is at best seen as amusing and the butt of jokes/random sexist comments, while a headstrong, competent and no-shit man is seen as cool and someone to aspire to.
