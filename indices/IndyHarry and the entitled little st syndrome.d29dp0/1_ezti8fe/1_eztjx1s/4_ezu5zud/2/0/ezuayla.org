Honestly, this is true. I believe the idea has merit, a protagonist-focused story would work great with the Star Trek canon, but the character herself was poorly set up.

Honestly, I'm not even talking about her personality, but her position overall. She's what, a random crew member? a convicted criminal who won't ever hold a commission again? boring.

How about instead, we make her the captain of the discovery (while perhaps altering her character a little so she's less meek during dialogue and more badass during action scenes), tasked with investigating the plot of the first season. She does so, including the Vulcan Hello, which earns her some sharp reprimands and loses her the ship.

But instead of "oh noes now im a prisoner" she insists that shes right and goes rogue with the express intention to prevent an all-out war the federation are attempting to start by apologizing to the klingons. Maybe include a scene of diplomatic talks like this:

Fed Ambassador: "We're so sorry for the attack on your vessel, I hope we can maintain peaceful relations, perhaps a mere truce with you"

Klingon Ambassador: "What attack? As far as we know, you've proven yourself to be decisive and headstrong."

Fed ambassador: "Captain Burnham's unprovoked assault is being followed through by our military, don't worry"

Klingon Ambassador: "Assault? The good captain is the one who convinced our warriors that your people aren't cowardly windbags, you should ve thanking her!"

Fed Windbag: "Oh noes this goes against our weirdly agressive pacifism!"

And in the end, we get a rogue, chaotic good captain trekking these waters in a stolen ship for the good of all.
