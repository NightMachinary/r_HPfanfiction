I love Michael as a character, but I feel like one valid criticism of the show (I have to say upfront, I'm not sure if it comes as part of the criticism of the character that you've seen, mind) is that it is a protagonist-centered story that masquerades as being an ensemble. As a result, a /lot/ of the final weight and actions have to be taken by Michael, which for someone coming in expecting an ensemble teamwork show, might be a bit of an adjustment.

But tbh I would put that as a mistake in the marketing rather than anything to do with the scripting or character.
