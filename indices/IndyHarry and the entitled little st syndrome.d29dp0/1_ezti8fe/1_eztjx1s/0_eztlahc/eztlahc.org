Is it? I must say, not in my experience. I mostly read sci-fi and fantasy, apart from the classics of course, and most of the main characters are very much flawed. To the point that it's sometimes difficult to sympathise with them.

I understand what you mean, but the level to which fanfic authors go to is something I have never seen in good novels I've ever read. It's also very rare in some of the shitty novels I've read, mostly done for comedic purposes.

But I agree, it's rampant in fanfics, which is why I made this thread, and especially in indy!Harry. Also, I hate when in those fics Harry is suddenly an Adonis at 14... despite being a specky, overly thin, not that attractive teen.
