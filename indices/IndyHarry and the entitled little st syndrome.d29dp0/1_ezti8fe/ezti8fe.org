I absolutely hate those stories. Hermione often gets that treatment as well. Take a normal, flawed canon character (full of normal flawed character) and make them perfect and arrogant - terrible. It's of course totally realistic that everyone loves them, because, you know, the know it all nerd in school who told everyone how much better amd smarter they were were obviously the most popular students.
