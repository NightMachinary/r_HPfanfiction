Given what we know about the magical legal system, it would end in a summary execution like Fudge wanted for Sirius and got for Crouch Jr. Which I wouldn't mind, especially if Auror "Moody" is doing the investigation in a crackfic, but a magical trial would be railroading them hard under any circumstances.

I'm glad that you liked my fic.
