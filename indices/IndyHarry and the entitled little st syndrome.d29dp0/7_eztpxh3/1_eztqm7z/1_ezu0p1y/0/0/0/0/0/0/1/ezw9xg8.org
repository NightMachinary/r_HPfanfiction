It's not impossible though IANAL and have no knowledge of British law in the nineties. Harry always referred the cupboard under the stairs as /his cupboard/ not as his bedroom. Say the teachers notice this and call the cops about child abuse. What happens when they search the house and find a bed inside the cupboard when the house had two unoccupied rooms? When they ask Harry where he sleeps? When they look at both kids in the house and see one well dressed pudgy boy and the other one dressed in ill fitting hand-me-downs?

Oh sure, legal consequences /might/ be difficult in the muggle world but nothing is stopping them being persecuted in the wizarding world, in a fanfic at least. I hardly think anyone there would care about jurisdiction especially in the case of Harry Potter and the muggles can't stop wizards anyway.

I've read your story and that was a nice touch.
