Actually getting the Dursleys convicted for child abuse would be tricky since there is little evidence of them actually being abusive and not just neglecting (unless a Police Officer happens to come across the scene).

What I did in one of my fics was framing them for drug possession, counterfeiting money and possession of weapons of war since that would be easy to set up with magic (duplication charms).

Vernon&Petunia not being able to explain the ton of cocaine, bags full of identical pound notes and AKM rifles in their spare room would be seen as them being uncooperative (aka harder sentencing). Nor would it be possible to blame the boy who hasn't been there for 10 months (and good luck trying to blame a 13-year-old boy for industrial amounts of drugs).

  "Shocking discovery in Little Whinging, Surrey. So far, the Surrey Police confirmed that several thousand bags filled with suspicious substances were found as well as a considerable amount of cash and six AKM-type assault rifles produced in the former Soviet Union. While a detailed analysis is necessary to determine the extent of this findings, an NCIS officer said that at least four of the confiscated bags contained cocaine. Vernon Dursley, the director of Grunnings Drills, and his wife Petunia were arrested, with charges pending."

  The image changed to Mrs Johnson from Number 7, who seemed very eager to tell her story to the British Broadcasting Corporation. "At first it was only a single police car but nonetheless I was curious. Why would the police come here? We are a good neighbourhood after all. There was some shouting and then one constable came back out, looking worried and talked on the radio until two more police cars arrived. Then another three, followed by a van and several civilian cars. A crowd gathered around Number four so I went back inside and watched through the attic window. They were carrying white packages out of the house for two hours while at least a dozen constables searched the area. They found something that looked like guns in the garden shed and carried duffle bags out of there as well. I never expected that Mr Dursley would be part of such a thing but it seems obvious now - "

The abuse is canonical and I tried a realistic depiction of the effects the Dursleys would have had on Harry while maintaining his overall resiliance (singular breakdowns instead of moping around 24/7).
