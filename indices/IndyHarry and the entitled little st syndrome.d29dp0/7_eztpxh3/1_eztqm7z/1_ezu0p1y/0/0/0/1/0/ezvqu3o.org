People claim that canon wasn't so bad, so some writers feel like making them extra awful to justify their intended plot (Harry turning evil or becoming an mopey mess, Severitus and similar crap) because they think that they need to convince a part of their intended reader base, who do not consider canon abuse.

Or at least that's what I understood from that comment.
