You see, it's because a lot of people say that the Dursleys abuse of Harry was "/not that bad/", that we have fanfictions with a truly horrendously abused Harry. Because that's what it takes for many people to sit up and realize that yes, a child is being abused and that it's not okay.

Edit: Yes, I know that this isn't a valid justification for bad writing. It was only a showerthought I had about the probable cause.
