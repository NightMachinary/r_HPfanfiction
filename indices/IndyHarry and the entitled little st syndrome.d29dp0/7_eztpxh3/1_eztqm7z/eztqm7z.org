I'm not trying to be contrary on purpose, but does he?

I mean from the books his life sounds like that of a normal teenager (the Dursley's were not physically abusive of him, just psychologically, that doesn't make it right, of course, but i'm not trying to talk about Harry's abuse, just about Indy!Harry), apart from the magic and murder and stuff. He has friends, not many mind you, he has a rival, very common, and he's pretty much oblivious and stupid, very common among teenagers.

I get what you're saying. Canon!Harry is not the dream protagonist. He's very passive, not that good at magic, doesn't have anything going for him apart from his morals, which are kind of impressive.

But I wouldn't say he takes "so much shit in canon". I would rather propose, that fanfic authors would prefer a more action oriented protagonist and that the entitled shit Harry is their way of dealing with the realities of the world they put their character in.

Example: Umbridge detentions. In canon she gave those detentions to many other people. But in fanfiction it's usually only Harry that gets them and then deals with her in some absurd way. Of course, what she did was child abuse, but it doesn't make Harry special and how she is dealt with in fanfic is sometimes over the top.

EDIT: Fun fact. I was walking today and I tried to catalog all the PLOT relevant actions that Harry did by HIMSELF in the books. There weren't that many, let me tell you. In PS it was 2, in CoS it was 1 or 2 depending how you count, in PoA it was 1, in GoF it was 3-5. in OotP it was 5, in HBP it was 4, in DH it was a lot more (it was a very Harry heavy book). I also only counted those that were relevant to the plot of that book and couldn't be done by another character at that moment.
