The "magic and murder and stuff" is rather important, it's not something you can just brush off.

The room he had growing up was literally a spider infested closet, and the Dursleys had the space to give him his own room and he knew that. The Dursleys actively went about smearing his reputation with the neighbors. I'm pretty certain that after the Dobby incident he was locked in his room and deprived of full meals for weeks. You can treat it as a joke if you like, but the book does mention a time where Petunia took a swing at him with a frying pan, and if that has happened once, it's almost guaranteed that other physical things have happened. I wouldn't consider any of those things to be normal teenage life.

I definitely wouldn't call him the most unfortunate protagonist by any means, but he definitely experiences some shit.

Also IIRC we only see evidence that Umbridge used the quill on Harry and Lee Jordan.
