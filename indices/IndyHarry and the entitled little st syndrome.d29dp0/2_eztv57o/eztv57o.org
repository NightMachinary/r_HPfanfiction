I think it's a sort of passive rebellion. I believe that we can agree that a majority of these authors are teenagers, especially in their early teens. Perhaps they are unable to have as much control over their lives as they want and thus use this fanfiction to let some of their frustrations go. Pretend that they have some control, so to speak.

This is based on assumptions of course.
