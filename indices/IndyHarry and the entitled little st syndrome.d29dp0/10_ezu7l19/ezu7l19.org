Tbh my first thought based on this idea was 'how long until we get Harry Trump fanfiction?!'

I think some of it is probably cultural and some of it is taking the character [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven][up to 11]].

By that I mean... I think a lot of the sassy/snarky elements of Harry's character in canon didn't necessarily translate as directly as they could have to a US audience as there isn't really that archetype in (modern) US kids' fiction/YA like there is in British, or at least, there wasn't as much in the 90s. (and by extension, this leads to other characters like Fred and George being interpreted in a somewhat darker light to US audiences, etc.)

I don't live in the US, but from the Americans I know and the (masses of) US media I consume, I feel like there isn't really a direct equivalent for the 'cheeky' teenage character who is snarky to adults around him but good at heart and forgiven/respected by adults without being expected to change. (I can think of younger kid equivalents ofc, e.g. Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone...) So anyway as a result we have a lot of US authors interepreting Harry as kind of a bad kid who is constantly vindicated by the narrative, and are using that as a starting point to create their world where everything is similar to that setup, but /more/.

Of course, it could also be [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality][character-centered morality]], it could have started as an absurd parody of the fairly passive canon Harry and passed by osmosis into being a serious representation archetype, it could be authorial convenience to avoid having to explain moral ambiguities and/or Harry's guiding sanity, or it could be something else entirely that caused this rise. We can only speculate!
