Too true. One of the points you raised, about black/white, is actually very interesting. Since what is Evil or Good, in such works, is determined by the MC (whether they are objectively good or evil, if such a thing even exists). Many of the best novels out there do not have a good or evil dichotomy, rather they try to present life and people. As we know both of those things, for the most part, defy such simple classification.

Beauty, or perhaps truth, is in the eye of the beholder after all, even if there are some fundamental truths that most people agree on.
