If you've ever read chinese manga/webnovels, a LOT of it reads like really shitty fanfiction, so these types of terrible tropes don't just exist here.

There are certain authors and readers who truly don't want to read realistic fiction - and thats perfectly fine. I agree that a lot of indy!harry is wish fulfillment and et cetera. The issue is in a lot of these wish fulfillment universes, thinking too hard unravels any sort of wish fulfillment. Which is why in each and every scenario, there is a clear black/white. Actions are moral or immoral. Characters are only good or evil. Many scenarios just feel like the same, all powerful harry imposes his will without any real conflict. In so many morally grey!Harry stories, harry is not morally grey.

For me, these stories are unbearable because even if scenarios are original and exiting, resolutions are always the same. Even if they are OC characters, they read just like a tvtropes character trait list.

I love magic and unrealistic stories, but I want ambiguity, suspense, twists and turns, characters who are morally conflicted, characters who fall into evil/redeem themselves for good. I want the MC to struggle, romance to be slow burn, and the kind of excitement and passion that comes from a long buildup of events.

While the instant gratification of indy!harry moving through a long list of fixits is fun, for a while, i'd rather watch porn or something... enjoyment from fanfiction for me is being able to immerse myself for hours on end.
