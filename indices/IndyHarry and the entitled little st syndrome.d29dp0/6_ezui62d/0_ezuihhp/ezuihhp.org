I completely agree. Harry's forgiving nature and his compassion were always the hallmarks of his character. After all, in JKR's books, it was that nature that not only allowed him to survive, but also defined his very personality. Unfortunately most people see that only as a weakness and instead of rationalising it they go the opposite way and get rid of it entirely and make him a douche.
