For me, the biggest turn off of this trope is Harry's generally never forgiving anyone. In canon, I feel that forgiveness is one of the hallmarks of Harry's character. I mean he named one of his kids after Snape for goodness sake. He forgave Ron real quick after the first task, plus when Ron left during the horcrux hunt, and Hermione after the broom incident in third year. Often in those Indy Harry fics, if you betray Harry or make a mistake he will never forgive you and you are dead to him. I hate that because it's not a good way to live for one thing. But also because I don't see Harry holding that kind of grudge for small stuff. Makes it hard to read for me.
