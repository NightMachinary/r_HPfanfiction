I've always wanted this fandom to recognize just how famous Harry Potter is and how much power that name holds. Like in DH everything is lost, but whoever is still fighting is doing it in the name of Harry Potter.

Sadly, for the most part, the only people to recognize that are these authors.

It's not just Americans or teenagers. Sinyk /is/ Australian and reads like an adult with a fully developed brain. They're just all terrible at writing. I can't believe teenage me made it past the 1st chapter of Harry and the Angry 7.

I'd just like to point out though, that a 16/17 year old Harry who is what Dumbledore/TMR were at 16/17 shouldn't have too big of an issue with most aurors.

  Crucio someone? He/She definitely deserved it. Talk back during a trial? It's only normal

This is kinda canon if we're being honest. I can't remember if Harry ever managed to talk back during the trial, but I believe he tried. And Bella/Carrow did deserve it, but still.
