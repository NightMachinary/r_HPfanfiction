Hey, there are people that understand that. The scene in the Deathly Hallows, the one in Godric's Hollow, was written specifically for that. Many authors and readers remember that Harry was super important as a symbol to the Wizarding World, though, I must agree, not the majority.

I hate the Carrow-McGonnagall-Harry scene. Spitting in someone's face causes Harry to cast an unforgivable curse and everyone is okay with that? Luna, McGonagall are totally okay and nobody gives a shit. I think it's the low point of JKR's writing, to be honest. And also one justification people use to pass their entitled little shit stories.
