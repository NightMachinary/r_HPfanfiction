Let's not forget that when they were ambushed by death eaters in the cafe, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine all seriously considered killing them in cold blood to cover their trail- the only reason they didn't was because obliviating them worked better. I see the Carrow scene as an example of just how far our protagonists have been pushed, and that they've truly entered an "us or them" mindset.
