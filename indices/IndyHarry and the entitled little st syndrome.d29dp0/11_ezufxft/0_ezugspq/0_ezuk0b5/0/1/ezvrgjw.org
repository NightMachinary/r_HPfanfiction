  but his reaction to cursing Draco in the bathroom, or his unwillingness to fatally curse Death Eaters during the course of the Deathly Hallows, stands in contrast to him torturing a person for spitting in someone's face

Not wanting to kill someone doesn't mean you don't want to see them in pain. Harry doesn't want to do the former, but he's for the latter. He had no idea what Sectumsempra would do, but he did know it was for enemies. Torturing Carrow in anger isn't different from him trying to torture Bella in anger or kill Snape in anger.

The only time Harry didn't like seeing a bully/enemy in pain/humiliated was Snape's memory. Any other time he's laughing or cursing someone. Dudley's enlarged tongue, hitting Malfoy and co with the Prince's spells, laughing at ferret Draco, etc. He just graduated from Curses and Counter Curses to Secrets of the Darkest Art.

Edit: this is the 2nd time I've said something like this and was downvoted. Idc about the votes, but it's confusing as to why you guys think he was super straight laced kid afraid of all manners of violence, especially when he was angry.
