JKR has been known to prioritize making a scene feel emotional and visceral, like you're really in the scene and feeling what the characters are feeling... to the detriment of the wider universe's rules and logic, at points. You can handwave it as "they were emotional, they were teenagers, they were stressed", but I think it's due to the extra-textual inconsistency that JKR has a habit of falling into.

  "Well," said Slughorn uncomfortably, "you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature."

  "But how do you do it?"

  "By an act of evil---the supreme act of evil... Killing rips the soul apart."

  Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches' feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill.

  Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.

What never sat well with me was how Voldemort's lack of reaction of to killing people, the ease with which he did it, was meant to establish him as an evil person. And it showed that killing people took a moral toll on him, a consequence for his actions.

Then Molly kills someone, no hesitation, and although we know she is capable of feeling the remorse to put her soul back to rights after killing Bellatrix, there's no mention of any consequences at all. I find that happens a lot when it comes to the Weasleys - they do a lot of questionable things, but the narration pays barely any attention to it because Harry likes them and they're the designated good guys.

  "I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!"

  "What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?" said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.

You'd think Harry's internal dialogue would comment on that, because he values family as his heart's desire, and to see family members throw another family member aside just like that might remind him of how he was treated at the Dursley house... but he doesn't.
