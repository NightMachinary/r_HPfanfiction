You're assuming she'd escape again. With Voldemort dead, Bellatrix would be wandless and unconscious in the middle of hundreds of armed fighters. Grindelwald couldn't even escape from Numergard, Bellatrix wouldn't be able to escape without Voldemort again to break into Azkaban, anyway. In any realistic scenario, she's not just going to slip away in the middle of the great hall. If you can hit her with a deadly curse, you can hit her with a stunner. Therefore, she's removed as a threat. Yes, she killed without needing to.

It's not like the difference between a gun and a taser, where a taser's prongs can fail to both stick, or where even if they do people can power through it.

A stunner hitting a target is ALWAYS going to stun the target, unless you're Hagrid apparently. Therefore, you have the obligation to use the stunner to remove a threat instead of jumping to killing. You CHOSE to kill, when you could have as easily removed your threat by nonlethal means.

It takes the same amount of effort either way. You just chose to go for the kill. And I can't ever abide that.

At least in harry potter, with actual magic going for you.
