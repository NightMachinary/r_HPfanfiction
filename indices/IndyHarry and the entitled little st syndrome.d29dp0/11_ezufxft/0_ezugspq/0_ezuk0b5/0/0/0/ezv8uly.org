I know! Like shit, Molly, if you can throw a deadly curse that connects, you can throw a Stunner! I think you're morally OBLIGATED to throw the stunner in that scenario, in fact! So yeah, she did commit straight up murder when she could've captured and subdued with the SAME AMOUNT OF EFFORT! Like fuck. Soul should have been damaged there. She chose to kill when she had no need to.

Parallels Voldemort choosing to kill Lily when he could've thrown a Stunner with the same amount of effort, as well, and that would've secured Snape's loyalty to boot.
