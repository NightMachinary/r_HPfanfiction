Then every murder and atrocity Bella would go on to do after she escaped again would be on Molly's head for choosing to not put her down like the rapid dog she was.

Batman is also just as guilty for the rampant slaughter the Joker perpetrates over dozen issues, since he has had the opportunity several times to put him down but refuses to and allows him to spend a vacation in that revolving door known as Arkham Assylum.

Molly *did not* commit murder killing Bellatrix, she committed an act of highest heroism and justice.
