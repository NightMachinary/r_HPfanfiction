I understand your reasoning and I sympathise, to a degree. If it didn't go against everything else that was written in the books. I'm all for Harry being darker than in canon and actually wishing harm upon people, but his reaction to cursing Draco in the bathroom, or his unwillingness to fatally curse Death Eaters during the course of the Deathly Hallows, stands in contrast to him torturing a person for spitting in someone's face. I recognise the emotional aspect of that scene and it fits with the atmosphere of that time, but it doesn't fit with Harry's portrayal so far in the series. At all.
