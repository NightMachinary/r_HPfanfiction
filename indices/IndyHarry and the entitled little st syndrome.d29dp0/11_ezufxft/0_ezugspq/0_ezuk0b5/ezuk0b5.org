  I hate the Carrow-McGonnagall-Harry scene. Spitting in someone's face causes Harry to cast an unforgivable curse and everyone is okay with that? Luna, McGonagall are totally okay and nobody gives a shit. I think it's the low point of JKR's writing

Oh, I love this moment and it's a high point, imo. It's one of the few times she plays up to the "Harry is a lot like Voldemort" and it was very in character. He went from wanting to buy a book to curse Dudley, to righteously trying to Crucio Bella, to using a curse "for enemies", to successfully torturing Carrow.

I've always thought that if she wasn't trying to keep her plot and the PG rating she would've been less subtle with that. All three kinda teetered on an "ends justify the means" philosophy by the beginning of DH and most the of adults around them followed it.
