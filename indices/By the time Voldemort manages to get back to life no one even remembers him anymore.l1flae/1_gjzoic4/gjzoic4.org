I like the premise of Voldemort returning much later very appealing, as it avoids several pesky tropes or issues at once:

- No need to force ridiculous power progressions on teenager Harry and his friends
- No need to turn <16 years old into child soldiers
- No need to write good adult guys as criminally negligent and useless plot devices

--------------

Furthermore, without the looming existential threat from Voldemort, the kids could actually be kids, with all kinds of fun teenager drama and so forth. I've seen lots of requests for a "chill" Harry or him dating around. Well, not having a sadistic genocidal maniac breathing down his neck every day can give you such a Harry, credibly.

Unfortunately, I have seen only one reasonably well written fic with that premise: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], in which Voldemort returned in Year 2005, but remains on hiatus since 2017.
