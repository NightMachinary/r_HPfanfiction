Personally speaking, I like AU (alternate universe) fics way better than canon compliant ones. If you stay around here long enough, you will soon encounter many threads that criticize or deconstruct the canon plot and world. At least I see lots of problems with canon. Also, as you read more and more fanfics, you may soon ask those "what if" questions, and that's a good time to dive into AU fics.

Here are some of my favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): the most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin. This â€˜Harry' thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but he only wants to teach DADA forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They begin with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who got off again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This Harry never entered Wizarding Britain, and was raised by his own parents who got Voldemort with a nasty trap that night. But that doesn't mean he's a nice guy though. Dark war epic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry time travels to 1975 and has to team up with Bellatrix. This Harry is war hardened veteran, and Bellatrix, despite following Harry, is by no means a paragon of virtue. But it's fun watching her in action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Another dark war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group after Year 5 and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore takes the aftermath of CoS event more seriously. It's very refreshing to see how the canon plot disintegrates if the adult good guys are only slightly more competent and less negligent.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] happens in a sci-fi universe with superpowers. It's a long completed story with 600+k words, goes through all 7 years, and mirrors canon events loosely. The last year is significantly different though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): December 1999, badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a new world where things are very different. One of the most emotional HP fanfic I've ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]], linkffn(13133746): One of the best Harry/Daphne fics, no bashing, no power fantasies, great characterizations, and a very adorable Astoria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Petunia is a squib and a BAMF archeologist. She, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur did the heavy lifting against Voldemort in this fic.
