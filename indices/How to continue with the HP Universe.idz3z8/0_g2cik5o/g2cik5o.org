If you don't have any specific preferences for shipping, I recommend reading canon compliant fics that either fill those missing moments or continue after DH. Some good examples:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is a nice year 6 fic from Ginny's POV. Very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), is a great year 7 fic from Ginny's POV. Can be dark at times.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]], linkffn(13072492), is an interesting case. It's not completely canon compliant, but is a really good political fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is IMO the best canon compliant postwar fic. It features Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, narrated from their Muggle neighbor's POV. It's part of a 85+ postwar story series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628), is my own one shot set 20 years after the Battle. Harry explains many things here.
