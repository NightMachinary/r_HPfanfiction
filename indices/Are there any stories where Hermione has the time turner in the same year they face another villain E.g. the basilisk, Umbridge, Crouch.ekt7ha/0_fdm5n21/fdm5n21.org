I have some where she has a time turner in later years, but she goes back to the past, either to the Marauder Era or to her younger Hogwarts years. Is that what you're looking for?

I don't think I've seen any where she uses the time turner to defeat any villains in the same year.

Linkffn(12783124) - Draco and Hermione go back to before Voldemort rose to power

Linkao3(3993391) - Hermione goes to another dimension and tries to defeat Voldemort.

Linkffn(13306252) - goes back to 4th year. Read author's note (lots of bashing)

Linkffn(10807718) Harry and Hermione return to first year

Linkffn(11026550) Hermione uses time turner in 6th year, but goes back to the 70's

Linkao3(13849008) linkffn(13356655; 13251214) - Hermione voluntarily goes back in time
