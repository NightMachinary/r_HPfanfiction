It seems the only Death Eater he's explicitly interested in redeeming is Draco Malfoy, who is 16-years-old and a student in his charge, and Dumbledore senses (correctly) that his heart isn't into it. Although that does get a little absurd, since Malfoy deserves to die more than Katie Bell and Ron Weasley, whose lives are nearly lost as a result of Dumbledore not putting a tighter leash on Malfoy (since doing so would put him in danger of Voldemort's wrath.)
