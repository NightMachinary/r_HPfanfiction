Once you get used to the frequent use of Japanese terms and can look at from a non english based perspective the story really shows how awesome it is. You learn a fair bit of Japanese culture as well. Keep in mind it does revolve around Yakuza activities a lot so there is a fair bit of dark humor and violence. But it really is a story that stands out in its own way. Personally its one of my favorites.
