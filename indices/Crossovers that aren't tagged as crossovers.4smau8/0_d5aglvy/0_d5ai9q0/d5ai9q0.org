Ah the Denarian series. Too bad it hasn't updated the last installment. I've read that a couple of years ago. It was a fun read, but the way Shezza characterized Potter gets old really fast. I've read Surranin's Abjuration and I loved that. I've also read Linkffn(Magician by Wisetomato). I liked how Potter was characterized there, and I think his animagus transformation in Magician was unique for me ala I haven't seen that non-magical animal in any fic.
