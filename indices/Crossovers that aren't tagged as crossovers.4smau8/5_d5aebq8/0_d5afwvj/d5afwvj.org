It's actually literal. I'm just looking for anything to read that weren't properly tagged as crossovers. Off the top off your head, any crossover that you can think of, kindly mention it. I've read bewitched/hp crossovers and that crabbing one.

A perfect example is the fic yarglethatbargle mentioned. Notice that it isn't tagged as an Elder Scrolls crossover, but when you read it, it actually is.
