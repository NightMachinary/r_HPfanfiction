That's an excellent point! These sites wouldn't be anything without the writers. But I have a sneaking suspicion that this award is more about how ao3 serves as the final archive for a lot of older fansites. An increasing proportion of works on the site were imported from older sites that have now gone dark. They're doing great work preserving fandom history, tag soup complaints notwithstanding.
