It has to be on the area. Because if it was on the wand or the person then malfoy and other pureblood kids would be detected when they used magic when underaged. But if it's on the area the law primarily impacts muggleborn as there are no other magic users in the vicinity so "obviously" any magic had to be by the muggleborn. Whereas in a pureblood area they don't really know who did the magic and because there are adult magic users in the area any magic is associated with the adults.

Of course, that doesn't address the issue of why hermione wasn't warned about underage magic use. Remember in PS that Hermione stated "I tried a few spells and they all worked for me". If that was true she should have received a warning. And with her personality she would've mentioned it so others didn't break the rules.
