Quoting this YouTube comment which is the most satisfying answer I've read on this topic.

  From what I understand, the Trace is very weak and:

  1. Activities when the child first enters the school

  2. Can be suppressed or even deactivated by other witches and wizards around and their more developed magical presence (and they are expected to police the children if so)

  3. Is clearly visible only when there is no other wizard around, and all other triggers are dismissed as false positives.

  All this adds up:

  1. Hermione can do magic before joining Hogwarts because she didn't have the Trace on her yet.

  2. The Ministry did not know of Dobby's presence in Chamber of Secrets (second book)

  3. Tonks and the others could pack up Harry's luggage because their combined magical presence automatically suppressed the Trace.

  4. The presence of a powerful Wizarding family (the Gaunts) along with the complete lack of documentation of Tom Riddle ever living in that village either masked or suppressed the Trace, or any other trigger was dismissed as false positive.

  I imagine this has to be the case, because children lose control of their magic all the time and otherwise a much stronger Trace would overwhelm the Ministry (e.g. Harry cutting his hair and it immediately growing back between school years might lead to his auto expulsion.

I think this makes the most sense, especially the idea of being in the presence of an adult suppressing the Trace, because even Dumbledore confirmed that underage childrens can use Magic if they're in a Wizarding house. And there are multiple reasons as to how Tom Riddle managed to escape the Trace, such as doing it very quickly and leaving the place before Ministry officials arrived, or doing it during the Christmas break, when he would've turned 17 and Trace would be removed from him.
