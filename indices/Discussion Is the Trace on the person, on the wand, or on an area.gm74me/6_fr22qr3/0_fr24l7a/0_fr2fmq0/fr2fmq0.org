you do that. I personally hate the idea that it's about the area. even if it is canon. just another unfair thing for the muggleborns. in my head it's always on the wand, or on person. person would make much more sense tbh, since that would be the ultimate against underage magic use.

imo, it doesn't even make much sense. you can expect for wizards to live all around, so it must be just the house and the close area, and only for muggleborns, so you can potentially go like two streets over and do magic? doesn't make much sense to me.
