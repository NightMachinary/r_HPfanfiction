I'd say the area itself.

I don't imagine Pureblood families like the Black's or the Malfoy's caring, and tutoring their children at a young age, at how to hold a wand, and the certain wand movements, though casting I say would depend on the parent.

It's largely so Muggles don't see, so unfortunately a lot of Muggleborns and Half-Bloods that live in the Muggle World are out of luck.

Though I'm sure there are the Pureblood and some or most Half-Bloods (the Half-Bloods ones that live in the Wizarding World), probably don't use underage magic.

You don't need a trace on a whole country, just where there's Muggles and there's known magic people living there, a lot more manageable there.
