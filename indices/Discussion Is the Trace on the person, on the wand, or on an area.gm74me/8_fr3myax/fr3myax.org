I headcanon that it's a country-wide ward (or ward-like mechanic). It probably has a few things to detect large amounts of magic, and things to detect all magic from anyone under 17. This tracks underaged magic AND accidental magic. I'm guessing if you are born to magical parents, your signature is formalised into their system, so they have a name to go with the alerts if you do something.

This also ties into the Taboo from book 7. There's no way it's only some little spell that covers the whole realm of "magical britain". That's too ass-pully. What's keeping them from flying to America and chanting "Voldemort" two hundred times while on a taxi? That would ruin the Snatchers' day. That, and it instantly broke defensive magics AND cast anti-transportation magic? That's way too OP for a single spell to cover a small area, let alone a country.

This country-wide "ward" could also do other maintenance-type tasks too, like the Floo Network, or Portkeys. You know, in order to keep people from colliding with each other mid-travel? International flu probably doesn't exist, and international portkeys are all the more dependent on set schedules and trajectories.

There was a fic I can't remember that did this, and there were wardstones all over the country, a la Roman Milestones. I liken it to one big mesh network of wifi and wifi sniffers.

Edit: In that same fic, Harry dug up one of the wardstones and studied it. And then ended up escaping it temporarily with a ritual (and maybe permanently later with runes?).
