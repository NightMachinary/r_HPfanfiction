In response to your issue with Riddle's murders during his sixth year- TMR's birthday is Dec 31. Since year is determined by age at the beginning of the school year, in Riddle's sixth year he turns 17 towards the end of the winter holiday. Even if there wasn't time for him to murder anyone right then, he still could've done it during the Easter break. The only reason Harry has such a problem with the trace in the beginning of DH is because he's really young for his year.
