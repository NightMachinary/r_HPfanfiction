  Since none of the options work together, I think, area effect detection spell on the underage witch or wizard hits the most checks for canon and something must be changed about the story with Tom.

Nothing has to be changed about the story with Tom, it works perfectly fine.

- The Trace is on all wizards under 17 years old.

- The Trace detects magic cast in its vicinity and feeds that information to the Ministry.

- Trace tells the Ministry what spell was cast and where.

- The Trace does *not* tell the Ministry who cast the spell or even whose Trace it was that detected it.

That's how the Trace works from the magical standpoint. Separately, you also have the issue of how the Ministry chooses to act on the information they receive.

The Ministry have a set of presumptions which determine how they act:

- If the magic is cast in a magical area, they assume it was cast by an adult and do nothing.

- If the magic is cast in a non-magical area, they cross-reference the location data against the magical individuals known to live in the vicinity. If there is an under-aged wizard living in that area with no adult wizards known to be present (i.e. a Muggleborn, Dean or Harry) then it is assumed that the magic was cast by the under-aged wizard and enforcement proceedings are brought against them.

- If the magic occurs before the under-aged wizard begins Hogwarts, the Ministry appears to assume it is accidental magic and do nothing.

- It appears that magic cast by Ministry officials does not set off the Trace.

This is all perfectly fine in terms of it not contradicting itself or lacking clarity. It doesn't make sense in the systems design sense - no one would ever choose to design a system that operates in such a way - but that simply suggests that there are either magical or political limitations which prevent a simpler system from being implemented.
