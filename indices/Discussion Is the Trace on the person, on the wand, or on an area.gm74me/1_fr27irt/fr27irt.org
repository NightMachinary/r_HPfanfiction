It's impossible to generate a truely internally consistent explanation given the contradictions between Riddles murders in his sixth year, Dobby, the accidental magic reversal squad, and the explanations given in book 7.

A general location based spell cast on the underage wizard makes the most sense for catching accidental and intentional magic when it occurs outside of the home and in the muggle world and accounts for Harry getting caught for Dobbys hovering charm. It fails to address Riddles murder and relies on the ministry recognizing muggleborn somehow and casting the spell on them as children.

A spell over all of Britain that tracks all magic performed and the cooresponding presence of adult and child wizards accounts for accidental magic, underage magic, the hovering charm, and the fact that the trace doesn't work in wizarding areas. Implies tracking of every witch and wizard in order to know who to send underage magic warnings to, unlikely.

Same as above except it only checks for underage wizard presence vs of age. Accidental magic reversal and or obilviators and or magical law enforcement can be dispatched to reverse effects on muggles/deliver underage magic warnings if necessary. Doesn't work with Tom's murders. Underage magic can only be pinned on an individual if someone is dispatched to the location and can discover the culprit, or the magic takes place at or near the registered address of a known student. (Explaining Dobby)

Spell over homes/neighborhoods of muggleborn. Doesn't account for magic outside of home. Requires monitoring of muggleborn location in case of moves. Allows Tom's murders, allows Dobby and Marge, doesn't account for seventh book explanations.

Spell on wand. Works with Tom, doesn't work with Dobby, doesn't work with seventh book expanations, implies separate tracking for accidental magic squad given Marge.

Since none of the options work together, I think, area effect detection spell on the underage witch or wizard hits the most checks for canon and something must be changed about the story with Tom.

That being said, if negating the trace is a plot point of the fic I think this is the most boring option. Trace on wands or locations gives much more interesting options for evading the trace. If dealing with the trace is an important plot point though, this works the best, its canonically impossible to truely circumvent without coming of age and requires an adult to accomplish anything. Which imposes restrictions on characters that can drive plot if necessary.

Now I have an idea of Harry and Co dealing Mundungus with Draught of Living Death and shoving him in Hermiones bag to lug around with them and circumvent the trace until Harry comes of age if they didn't stay at the burrow until then.
