From how I understand it, it is on the person but tracks any magic use in their vicinity regardless of who is casting it and tells the ministry where it was cast. that's why they told harry he has the trace on him in DH but why he got blamed for dobby's hover charm in CS. this is why in wizarding homes they can't tell who is using the magic.
