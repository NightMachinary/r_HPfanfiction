I'd settle for one where he has actual obstacles. So many of these fics once he claims his inheritance or what ever he just pretty much wins. Dumbledore is a master manipulator, holds several high offices, and has been plotting and controlling Harry for 15 years but he has no contingency for Harry getting a letter from his bank.

His only real task is to pick which girl he is going to marry, or deal with a marriage contract (usually by giving in without much more than a half hearted complaint. You would think someone so determined to take control of their life would have more of an issue with being told who to marry.)
