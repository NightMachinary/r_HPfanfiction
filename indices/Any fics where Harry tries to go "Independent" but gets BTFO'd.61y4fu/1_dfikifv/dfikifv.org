I'd like to see a fic in which indy!Harry went off on his own and got quickly killed as a result. Dumbledore had no choice but to step up his own game. He finally dropped his pretense of being 'nice', staged a coup with Amelia Bones, knocked off Death Eaters and their sympathizers in the Ministry, and declared 'total war' on Voldemort.

Every captured Death Eater got supreme Veritaserum and Legilimency treatments, before being executed. Voldemort's horcruxes were quickly reduced to the Snake, after they seized most Death Eater vaults. The Ring claimed several curse breakers, but the Stone was now safely sitting on Dumbledore's desk.

A furious Voldemort lashed out by stepping up his terror attacks. Losses were high on both sides, but with numbers on Dumbledore's side, Voldmort was slowly losing. Fearing for his immortality, Voldemort made one more horcrux, resulting in more lost wits and decision making skills. Eventually, he fell for a trap and was captured. After pushing him through the most grueling interrogation, Dumbledore oblivated Voldemort to his infancy and put him under Draught of Living Death. When the final horcrux was destroyed, they executed him.

'The Power He Knows Not' turned out to be an angry and ruthless Dumbledore.
