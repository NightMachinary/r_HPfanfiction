There is something similar. In this fic, indy!Harry ran away with Sirius, Hermione, and the Grangers. They got lots of help from the Delacours and the French, who were more than happy to stick it up to the British Ministry. [[/spoiler][Fudge administration fell quickly, Amelia took over, she and Dumbledore finished off Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The losses in Britain were heavy, but kids were mostly unscathed. Harry got rid of his scars through some Australian tribal magic.]]

It's overall a credible, enjoyable, and light-hearted story:
