Blood Crest fits the bill. Harry is kidnapped then apprenticed to a necromancer. It has the best comprehensive overview of horcruxes in the fandom and the world-building is quite impressive. It's over 400,000 words long so there's plenty to catch up on, but the pacing is very, very slow considering Harry is still in his second year. linkao3(Blood Crest by Cauchy)
