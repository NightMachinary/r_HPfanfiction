Thanks for the response! I am most definitely a total amateur, so I do hope to improve in the future. Do you have any tips to improve the style?

The first chapter sets up the story much better because they go into Davin's mind and get some clues as to why he's there. Maybe I should combine them to give a better view. I may post an outline. I liked the idea of going future instead of AU because I still wanted it to be in the HP timeline. I want to stick as closely to the HP world people know as I can (without it being the exact same setting of course), and that just made more sense to me.
