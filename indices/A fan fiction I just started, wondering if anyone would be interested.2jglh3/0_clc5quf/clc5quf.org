I read your prologue, but didn't really get a sense of what the story was about, aside from different characters in Hogwarts and the Davin suddenly appearing without a memory. Maybe if you gave a rough outline of where you envision the story going it would be easier to tell if someone is interested.

Is there a particular reason you are having it set so far in the future? are you including futuristic elements or do you want the story to tie back to cannon in someway. Because otherwise I think just making it AU without the Trio existing and different characters would be much easier. Just in terms of referencing muggle things and explaining the world.

Personally I think you writing style could use some work, but I think that will just come with practice, and will get better as you progress.
