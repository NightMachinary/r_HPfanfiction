I haven't read this fic but I'm worried about what this will mean for her other WIPs like Misplaced Moony.

OP, I get that it's annoying to keep track of everything on both Ao3 and ffn, but Ao3 is a great platform! I use that and ffn in combination and it's easy to get email updates on Ao3 when something updates that you're subscribed to even if ffn is still your main site.

Also, why is she so worried about someone downloading her work without permission on Ao3 when it's easy to do on ffn with one of those plugins (I don't have one but other people use them all the time)?
