Might have to do with the fact that you have (or at least had to, once) to jump through some hoops to register on AO3 and some 15-year-olds do not have patience for that.

Of course, that's not to say there aren't any such people there, but yeah, that, plus what seems to be a lack of guest reviews, and it at least /seems/ a bit cleaner in that regard.
