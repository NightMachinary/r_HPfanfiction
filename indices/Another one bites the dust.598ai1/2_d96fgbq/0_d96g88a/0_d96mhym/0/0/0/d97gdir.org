The AO3 was basically founded (and conceptually framed) by LJ writers of all shades. Slash (and kink of all sorts) was always more represented on LJ than on the Pit. And as LJ was repatriated to Russia and attacked by various evangelical kooks, the need for a truly inclusive, non-commercial archive for /all/ fandoms gave birth to the AO3.
