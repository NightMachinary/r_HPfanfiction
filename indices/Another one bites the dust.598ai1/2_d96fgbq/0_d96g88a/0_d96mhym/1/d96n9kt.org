Didn't mean to imply anything else with my comment. It was /clearly/ harassment, but such things are sadly part of fandom. "Getting used to it" is pretty much the only option, other than reporting it.

(But reporting trolling on the internet is often like fighting a forest fire with a cupful of water.)
