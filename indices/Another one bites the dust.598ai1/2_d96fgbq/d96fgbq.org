It's a shame that s/he is stopping posting on FFN with this story. While I wouldn't call it a great/good fic, it was definitely entertaining me enough that I was reading it whenever I saw an update, but come on. If you're going to create something for the consumption of others and it's a 'creative' endeavor, gotta have some level of a thick skin.
