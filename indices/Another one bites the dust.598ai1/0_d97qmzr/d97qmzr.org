Everyone keeps commenting that the authors should just grow a thicker skin. Authors are providing content that we read for free. If they don't like getting harassed, which yes, this author has been, for quite a while now (read the reviews), then why shouldn't they find a platform that doesn't seem to breed the kind of maliciousness that FF.net does? I wouldn't want to hang around someone where people consistently send me vile comments or threaten to report my story.

Yeah, it's the internet and there are always trolls but why should anyone want to stay in the place where the trolls are the worst? Also, FF.net's ludicrous application of the no smut policy means that authors have good reason to go somewhere else if that's something they write.
