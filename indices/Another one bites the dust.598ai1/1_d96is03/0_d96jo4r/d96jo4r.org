I'm not sure why I'm still angry about this-I never even read the fic. But I guess it just seems so stupid to me. It probably didn't go from the characters eating breakfast in the hall to hardcore fucking instantly. There was probably some kissing or something that would have been warning of what's to follow for uninterested readers. There were probably even clues leading up to that chapter. Do we need to do an announcement?

PSA: duck out at the foreplay if you don't want to read about the sex

It must suck to have a bunch of people angry about what you've written, but I think the author needs to get a bit hardier. Don't quit, just spite write through it
