I don't understand why people complained. I mean, when I come across something I don't want to read, I just... stop reading it. It might be a little disappointing, but it's not like I paid anything for it. It even says in the summary and before the first chapter "Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes." What were they expecting?
