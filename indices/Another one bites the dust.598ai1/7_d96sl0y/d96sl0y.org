It was quite the disappointment: seeing an update on a story (Misplaced Moony) that's not been updated in a long time - straight after a cliffhanger, no less -, only for it to be an announcement, that they're moving onto that awful website that doesn't even let you register right away in order to follow the stories.

Also, the lack of formatting settings on Ao3 is off-putting for me who's visually impaired and suffer from albinism, but nobody ever consider that, do they? At least it's not Portkey or any other relic with fixed width that doesn't work with browser zoom.
