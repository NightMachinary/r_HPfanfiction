Alright, I'm catching up - I am now right before the big show-down, where Harry, Severus, Remus and Draco are visiting Hogwarts and [[/spoiler][Severus and Harry talks to Dubmbledore's portrait]].

There is just SO MUCH to love about this fic! The whole portrayal of Harry as this more or less ordinary bloke, who just has to rely on his contacts and to keep secrets - very Dumbledore-esque style.

The handling of the baby issue (although the more sappy stuff, like she just [[/spoiler][happens to look like a blend of him and Draco]] is not really my style - but in this fic it is handled beautifully.

Narcissa is a bit too MS for me actually - I miss her little passive-agressive, snidely commenting side, that other authors have shown in wonderous ways. She's a bit too nice for me in this.

The twins are wonderful (as always) and I am SOOOO looking forward to the big reveal and popcorn scenes!

Thanks for reminding me about this - I will come back with more, when I've finished reading :)
