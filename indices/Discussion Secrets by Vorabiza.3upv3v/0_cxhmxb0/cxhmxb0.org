Secrets is one of my all time faves too! And I have way too many fave scenes. Let's see... I do love when Harry [[/spoiler][reveals that Snape is on the light side to the Malfoys, and Snape removes Harry's silencing charm when Draco insists on discussing it with Harry]] actually, any of the times someone removes a silencing charm is fun lol. I also love the very beginning when Harry cares for Victoria and [[/spoiler][gets so overwhelmed and tired until he gets help from Winky.]] It seemed quite realistic to me having dealt with real life babies before. I also love the way vorabiza portrayed the twins. I thought their characterization was spot on. so much to love about this story.
