I'll start us off then, I really and truly enjoyed the reveal scene it is by far the funniest thing I've ever read in a fanfiction. I love the twins and their popcorn, I love the order of reveal, I love the reactions. It was simply fantastic.

There are a ton of other things I'd like to discuss but I thought I'd start off with one point before launching into a thousand.
