[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5724013/1/The-Magic-Word-Is-Sorry-Not-Please][The Magic Word is Sorry, Not Please]] is a really great story about the Weasleys and Potters in what is James' 7th year. It probably has the best family dynamics of any that I have read. The sequel ties up the loose ends and give a bit of insight into the character's respective futures.
