Yes, but the chapter with that line in it isn't yet published, since it's in a much later chapter in Like a Red Headed Stepchild. It is also preceded by the same person asking "Is anyone here NOT a Weasley?" I can't post a preview because sadly that scene contains a lot of spoilers because I maybe changed canon around to be more amusing by that point.
