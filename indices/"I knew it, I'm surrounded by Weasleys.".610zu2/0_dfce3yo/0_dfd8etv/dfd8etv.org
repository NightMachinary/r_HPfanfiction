Interesting, I was going to come at it from a Quidditch perspective

Recently promoted Gryffindor captain Oliver Wood sighed to himself as his red-haired chaser missed her shot by several feet.

"What the hell was that?" he demanded as she flew by a few moments later.

"Sorry, sir, I'm trying my best," the girl replied.

Wood questioned her further, "who let you on the team in the first place?"

"That would be me sir," came a voice from behind him, "she's my sister".

"And who are you?" Wood questioned the burly redheaded beater flying beside him.

"I'm a Weasley" the man replied.

"I know that" Wood said, "but what's your name?"

"Weasley, sir! George Weasley! And that's my sister, Ginny Weasley"

Wood looked around quickly before asking somewhat rhetorically, "How many Weasleys do we have on this team anyway?"

"Yo!" came the answering call from Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny.

Wood looked momentarily startled before mumbling to himself, "I knew it, I'm surrounded by Weasleys."

"Keep playing, Weasleys!"
