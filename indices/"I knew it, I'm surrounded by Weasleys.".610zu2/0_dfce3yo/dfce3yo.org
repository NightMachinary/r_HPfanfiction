*~The Wizengamot Chambers~*

Albus Dumbledore, reinstated Chief Warlock, looked around the packed chamber, "I now formally declare this meeting of the Wizengamot in session...as you know, though I shall recap regardless, a great number of our members were tragically slain or otherwise incapacitated during our.../recent/ civil war, necessitating a large scale by-election to restore our decision making capacity..."

The old bumblebee shuffled his papers before he peered around, "As, for many of you, this is your first session as a member of the Wizengamot, I am required to introduce each of you to the chamber in turn...a 'roll call' of our new members, so to speak. If you could make yourself visible when I call your name, please..."

Dumbledore looked at the first name on his list, "Arthur Weasley."

The red-haired seven-time father stood up and waved to the room before sitting down again.

"Ronald Weasley."

The considerably younger red-haired not-father-of-anything-yet stood up and beamed, his shiny Order of Merlin pinned to his robes.

"/Percy/ Weasley."

Percy looked up, blushing when he realized he was still in the secretary's chair rather than his assigned Wizengamot seat, quietly standing up and nodding before scuttling away to his new position.

"Fluer...Weasley."

The quarter-veela lit a small bluebell flame in the palm of her hand to make herself visible.

"Harry Potter."

Harry waved his hand, "Actually, seeing as I'm married to Ginny..." he trailed off.

Dumbledore sighed, "Harry Weasley then. And...don't tell me, Hermione Weasley?"

The Hermione Formerly-Known-As-Granger waved her wand and shone a little spotlight on her position, nodding.

"Kincaid...Weasley?"

A random red-haired man waved without getting up, "I'm one of Arthur's never-before-mentioned cousins."

"...Right. George Fabian Prewitt."

A red-haired man wearing a comically oversized moustache stood up to a round of phantasmal applause, "Also known as George Weasley."

"...Cho Chang?"

Cho shrugged, "I had a bloodline test, apparently my dad's a Weasley too. Don't ask me how."

"...I see. Then..." Dumbledore stopped and stared at the next name on the list, "Dolores Umbridge? Wasn't she given the Dementor's Kiss?"

The now-red-haired, irritating toad-esque witch in pink stood up and smiled sickeningly, "Why, yes I was, Chief Warlock. The whole experience was terribly traumatizing, it turned me into one of those soulless gingers...but with my sentence served, it was a simple task to exercise my rights under Bill #2312936 and claim this seat as due compensation. And yes, I'm a," she pursed her lips and looked like she had eaten something sour, "Weasley."

...

The list kept going and going, with every single name inexplicably turning out to be a Weasley in some obscure way.

Eventually, there was a break in the human seats, and Dumbledore moved on to the affirmative action seats.

"Jinny the house-elf? You work at Hogwarts, right?"

A little elf stood up and bounced up and down on her seat, shaking her head, "No Headmaster sir! Jinny is working for Wheezys at Burrow now!"

Dumbledore only blinked.

"Ronan the centaur?"

The chestnut centaur stood up, "I too, am a Weasley." he announced, the light catching his red hair.

Dumbledore's eye twitched, before he scanned the remainder of the list, "How many Weasleys have we got in this chamber anyhow?"

The entire Wizengamot stood to attention and raised their hands, along with a good three-quarters of the audience around the outside, /"Yo!"/

The Chief Warlock looked around, wide eyed, before he slowly sat down, "I knew it. I'm surrounded by Weasleys."
