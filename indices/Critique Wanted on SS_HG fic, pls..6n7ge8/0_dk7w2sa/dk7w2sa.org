The 'cliffhanger' is well done, it feels planned and piqued my interest without being cliched or annoying.

It reads very much like a romance novel, what with the extended descriptions of clothing and physical appearance. The mentions of magic are hit and miss; I liked the use of the cushioning charm but the mention of magical signatures didn't seem well thought-out.

My suggestion would be to proof read it for typos: "plains of his body", "PAndy" for Pansy.
