Hm, in the beginning it was kind of confusing and everyone was acting really out of character to the point where I felt like dropping the fic. I don't like fics where Draco, Snape and all the slytherin are all of a sudden good friends with the main trio for seemingly no reason. Snape, Pansy, Draco act nothing like their canon selves and even if they were friends with Hermione I feel like there would have been some tension present. If it's an AU which it seems like it is, maybe make it more clear that it's not canon world we are following. The descriptions are often overly flowery and the party conversations and descriptions are kind of boring. The sexual undertone of random paragraphs such as the one with the Danish and Snapes dialogue seems out of place and turns me off the fic.

This is my personal preference towards these kind of fics, but I don't like when Hermione starts all of a sudden noticing and describing how hot Snape is. It's out of character, it's ridiculous considering it's Snape we are talking about here. If they get together, I prefer relationships and friendships based on something other than how physical attractive the other person is and for things to develop gradually.

Loved the twist at the end though, definitely makes me want to read more to find out what happens.
