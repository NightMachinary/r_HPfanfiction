Does this interact in any way with ffnet's favoriting capability? In other words, does it know what fics I've favorited on ffnet?

Now that they have this stupid bug that means I can only see 500 of my favs I'm looking for a better way to interact with the stories I've fav'd. I know I can do this under my account or on mobile but that's a pita.
