The whole row before the mini break are quick taggers for easy categorization and using any of these buttons excludes fics from searches unless you are searching on this specific tag.

Search for "excluding fics from searches" here for an explanation: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEXQBQnDbFljBTAea_Ljbq731OGUDjHoew2s9jmj2tk/edit#heading=h.l0l1ojluzqiv]]

You can then go to the "Tags" tab, select corresponding tags and press "Search" to bring up just the fics with those tag(s). Personally I am using "stem" to mark unfinished fics I am highly interested in. Coupled with star ratings and "your score" sort order this is used to prioritize the fics you've queued for reading.

The only things that influence recommendations are your favourites/source urls and a bit of settings in the "Advanced Mode"
