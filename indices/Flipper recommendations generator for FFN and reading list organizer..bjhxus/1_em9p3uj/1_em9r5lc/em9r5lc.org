Regarding new fandoms: those fics are pulled from favourite lists of ppl that like the same stuff you do. It's either a suggestion you might like those fandoms or a signal that you should start using "Ignored Fandoms" feature.

Personally, I find this stream of new fandoms one of the best features of Flipper. It gives you new stuff to potentially be intersted in or fics from fandoms you are already interested in but wouldn't have visited specifically since they are too small. Also you can always suppress stuff you're 100% sure you won't read. My own ignored fandoms section for example has 564 records :)
