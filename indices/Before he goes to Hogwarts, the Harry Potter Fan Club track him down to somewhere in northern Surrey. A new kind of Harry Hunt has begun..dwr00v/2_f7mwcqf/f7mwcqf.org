Interesting idea, though i feel like the fan club is something that really got started after second year at the earliest since that is after he save one of his biggest fans. lol

Before Hogwarts Harry was just really a story that people told their kids (though I guess if you really tried you might able to do something with that), If anything i'd expect people finding out where he lives and spilling the beans, since it /is/ cannon that at least one wizard comes across him when he is out with his aunt, that wizard is also one of the people at greats Harry in the Leaky Cauldron as well.
