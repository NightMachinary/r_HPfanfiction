  The Heir

  Hermione, Ginny and Percy bashing story - just to see if you can handle pretty messed up and disturbing things. Not for the easily offended!! /Now Complete with Epilogue/

  The Wand Cores

  Hermione has promised to keep Severus out of Azkaban, but the Ministry seems determined to throw them together. My version of how Lily and James Potter was not having a good day when Longbottom did IT.Now,all they have to pay for her education. Desperation and a chance to have something that he's always wanted. To meet his parents. Re-vamp of previous 24 chapter story HPGW
