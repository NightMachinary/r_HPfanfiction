So, as a student, I really want to do some work in machine learning and AI. I absolutely /loved/ your explanation of Markov Chains and the supplementary post - you explained Markov Chains extremely well, approachable to someone who hasn't touched on probability for years.

Thank you for that! Two questions:

1. What is the time complexity for the algorithm? The thought makes me shudder. It feels like it would be between O(n^{2} ) and O(n!) (of course, there are multiple inputs, so that's not very specific)

2. Where can I go to learn more about stuff like this? Any recommendations for videos/websites/books/PDFs etc?
