Dumbledork is usually a sign of relentless Dumbledore bashing and I have no taste for it, and seldom finish reading those kind of fics. I remember an instance of reading a completely smashed Harry Potter sitting in Aberforth's bar saying "damn Dumbledore" while meaning Albus while Aberforth grumbles about it and that highlights my whole problem with it. It is about as juvenile as Malfoy's "Potty", something Harry doesn't even return like that in canon.

That said, Harry mocking Voldemort is something I can appreciate a while lot more. And of course special mention to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325/1/The-Original-Naked-Quidditch-Match]] the Voldemort mocking going on in this fic is nothing short of brilliance.
