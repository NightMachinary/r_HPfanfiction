Dumbledork, yeah. Because then I know it's going to be a "hahah the light are bad and stole Harry's money" kind of thing.

Voldemort nicknames? Nah they're good because it shows the "good" characters giving him sod all respect - in WW2 British people had all sorts of rude names for Hitler, for example. Agree "moldyshorts" is overdone, but I think the principle - that the people fighting against him want to make him seem like a laughable figure not a scary one - is quite realistic.
