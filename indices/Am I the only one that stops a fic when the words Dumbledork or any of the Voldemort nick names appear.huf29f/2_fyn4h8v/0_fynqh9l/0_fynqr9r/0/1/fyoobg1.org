For me, it depends on who they're saying it to. Harry calling Voldemort Moldyshorts while joking around with Ron? It's kind of annoying, yeah, but I get it cause they are teenagers. But Harry saying Dumblefuck to Snape, and Snape /also/ being amused by it? The second type will pull me right out of the story.
