Except that in most of these fics, Harry is not canon Harry but way more into politics, often even leading them due to author fiat and a lack of understanding how politics work. You can have canon Harry, you can have banter, but you can't have Dumbledork and LordHarry in the same fic because those two are basically polar opposites (realistic teenager vs political mastermind).
