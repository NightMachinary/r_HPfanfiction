I've read fics where he's forced and unwilling to be a Lord because he finds the idea stupid and medieval. I've read a few where he uses it to his advantage, but he's no good tier prodigy of politics. I have not read any where he is a full-fledged Lord who is somehow a genius politician and also a brat.
