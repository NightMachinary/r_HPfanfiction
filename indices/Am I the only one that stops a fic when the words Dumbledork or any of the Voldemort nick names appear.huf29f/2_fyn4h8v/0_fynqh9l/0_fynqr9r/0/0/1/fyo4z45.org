Honestly sounds more like a you problem at this point. Voldemort's name is feared by the adults, and that fear was passed down to the children. If Harry and co are using dumb joke names about their scariest opponent, it can be used as a way for their larger group to slowly lose that fear. Who could possibly fear a man named Moldyshorts, or worse, Tommy boy?

I'm sorry to say that you and the OP have a terrible lack of banter in your lives if you can't appreciate that most people will devolve to the humor levels of a fourteen year old in highly stressful situations, y'know, like the middle of a war.

There's similar banter thrown about in most if not all war movies, especially those based on real accounts. There's similar banter in Homer's stories, and Shakespeare's. Please do not act as if humor in the face of terror is somehow a bad thing---you'd likely die of shock once we began speaking of gallows humor.
