It depends on the tone of the story and scene, as well as who's saying it and how they've been characterized. A lot of stories take place in the 90s, and while my perspective may be skewed because I'm American, I don't think it's all that odd for teenagers in the 90s to be using lame insults.

Now, if it's excessive and detrimental to the story or immersion that's another issue.
