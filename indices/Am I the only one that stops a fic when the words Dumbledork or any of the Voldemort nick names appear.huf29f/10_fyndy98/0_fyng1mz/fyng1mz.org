Not at all skewed. Still a teenager now and figures of authority will always be mocked.\\
Out of earshot, of course, for fear of death, but especially when I was still in school. Some kids in my year renamed "running" to "Brooking it" after a teacher, mocking him for sprinting down the corridors.\\
It's reasonable that a crack-head headteacher who once cancelled all their exams would be mocked and spoke nonsense at their first feasts, if only with underlying, warm respect.
