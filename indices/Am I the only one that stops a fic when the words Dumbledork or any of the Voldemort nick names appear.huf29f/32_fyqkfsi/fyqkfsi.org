ITT some people are agreeing you with a comment starting with the word yes and others are agreeing with you starting with a comment with the word no.

In any case it's a major red flag for me, but it depends on the context. I'll usually let it slide if I otherwise like the fic and it's one of the only issues, but fics that do this often have many other things I don't like. However there's several FMA crossovers I like where Ed uses such nicknames for Voldemort, but that generally seems inline with his character and in these fics his grasp of English is often not 100% anyway, so it doesn't bother me as much.
