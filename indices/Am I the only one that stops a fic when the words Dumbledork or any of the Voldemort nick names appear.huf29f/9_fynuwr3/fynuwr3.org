The derogatory nicknames for Dumbledore, I will usually drop the fic before the nicknames come out. I've had my fill of bashing fics.

The derogatory nicknames for Voldemort I see more often in crackfics than in actually serious fics, and in said crackfics they don't break the tone of the fic.

I can also accept derogatory nicknames from a SmugSuper!Harry, Sirius Black when the author makes him a man-child, or from Peeves.
