They can show displeasure but if they want to be taken seriously their form of expressing it shouldn't be like that of a 5 year old. It's disrespectful not only to Dumbldore or Voldemort themselves but to their actions as well, like they didn't do anything serious and it's just a child's play. That's why I think it's okay in a parody, we don't expect anything to be serious there anyway. While in a normal story, I really can't imagine Harry calling names. Weasley twins, yeah, they did it in a canon too. But other characters not so much.
