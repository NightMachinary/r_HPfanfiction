I don't know the specifics but the Carrows call Dumbledore "Dumby" in HPB and Peeves says "Voldy's gone moldy" in DH. If it's satire I don't mind it, if someone says it to insult one of the two I also don't mind it, if a writer uses it constantly but it claims to be a serious fic, I probably won't even bother with it.
