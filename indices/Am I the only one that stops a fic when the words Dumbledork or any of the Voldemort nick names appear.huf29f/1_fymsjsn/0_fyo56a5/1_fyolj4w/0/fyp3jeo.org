Well it depends on what you mean by liberties. They can certainly reinvent a character from scratch or change key moments in their backstory so that the character is different from canon. But a lot of times they just go overboard with one particular aspect of the character. Like with the misunderstood Snape trope. They over-blow the good parts of him (which are really tiny) and act as if every moment of his life since he became a double agent for Dumbledore was a major sacrifice. It wasn't, he was a dick. One good deed doesn't erase a life time of being a dick. If the author went all the way to the beginning of Snape's life and highlighted how and why he got to a place where he was truly a good person who was misunderstood by those around him, causing him to turn to dark magic only for him to regret his choices and seek redemption, then that would be fine.
