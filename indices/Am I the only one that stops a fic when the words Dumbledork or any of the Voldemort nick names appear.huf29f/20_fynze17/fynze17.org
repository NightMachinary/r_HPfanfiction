Dumbledork is sorta funny the first time reading it, but repeated uses of it sorta comes off cringe to read and I can't take the character as seriously. Moldyshorts just sorta kills the vibe immediately. I can see how the childishness of it would come about in teens such as they are usually the ones using it, but it doesn't really negate the fact that it is rough to read as a viewer.
