I usually drop the fic when I see Dumbledork because half the time the bashing isn't done well, but I can live with the Voldemort nicknames since by the time Harry learns about him properly I more or less know the context of the fic and Harry's personality. If I stick around long enough for Voldemort to be given a nickname, it's usually a fic with a nonchalant and oblivious Harry, or that he's just being angry and spiteful.
