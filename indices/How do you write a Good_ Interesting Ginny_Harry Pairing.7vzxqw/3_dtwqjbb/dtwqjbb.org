This is my favorite pairing but I don't think writing it is much different from writing any other pairing.

Develop both characters, and make sure both of them can stand on their own. Wallflower or pushover Ginny ruins this pairing - she is actually a pretty fun and strong person from 4th year onwards in canon, just severely underutilized. She's also blunt and quick to anger. Harry is brave and selfless, but he has issues with guilt and anger himself. They're also likely the two sassiest characters in canon, so humor is a key element imo.

Give other characters some love too. I'm not a big fan of stories where Harry and Ginny (or any two paired characters) are amazing and overpowered and everyone else sucks. Harry loves Ginny's family, and she gets along well with Sirius (in my headcanon anyway, I can't remember the specifics from canon). In a lot of good H/G fics Ron is subtly awesome.

I think it's fine to make a pairing the focal point of your story, though if you can pair it with a great adventure story or mystery then even better. Fairy tales are boring, so you need a source of conflict - either put H/G in conflict with each other (misunderstandings are fun since they're both easily angered) or have an external conflict (the classics are dark lords, kidnapping, other love interests, forgotten memories, disapproving family, war, illness, death, etc).

Read some annerb, Deadwoodpecker, hgfan1111, Northumbrian.. it's a deep genre but their stories stand out.
