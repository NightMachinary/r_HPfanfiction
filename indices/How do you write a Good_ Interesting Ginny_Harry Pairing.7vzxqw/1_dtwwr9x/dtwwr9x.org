I think you need to show through your story why they work so well together and really show their traits.

Ginny is kind of the only one who really gets Harry to open up. She does this by being unflinchingly loyal to him when others attack him yet can put him in his place when necessary. Because of this, I think Harry trusts her more than almost anyone else and thus feels like he can be open with her in ways he cant be open with even Ron and Hermione.

Harry works with Ginny because I imagine he lets her be free and maintain independence. Or at least I hope. Obviously he had no qualms with her playing professional Quidditch. And with the glaring exception of the battle of Hogwarts, he doesn't coddle her. Ginny's big personality trait is her desire to be independent and treated like an adult. It's why her patronus is a horse.

So an interesting Harry/Ginny fic explores this dynamic, especially if the fic is set post-war. If there is going to be conflict between them, which is necessary for the story to be interesting, I think it should be along the lines of figuring out how to be together while staying true to themselves. How do they manage a year apart at school when they haven't been able to properly be together? How does Ginny, who has experience in a relationship, deal with Harry as a partner when not only has he never been in a relationship, but also had never known love until he came into her family's lives?

Also, Harry probably wants to fast-track their relationship since he just survived a death sentence and his greatest desire is family. Ginny probably wants some independence in life, maybe live on her own for a bit and not get tied down with marriage and kids just yet. A fic that explores that would be interesting to me.

Basically, these are two damaged, complex people who would be very difficult for anyone else to date, yet they work together. A goof fic explores exactly how they make it work so well.
