I love Harry and Ginny. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/jenorama/pseuds/jenorama][So far, I've done 20 H/G stories]] and I have so many ideas for more.

To me, Harry is someone who needs to be grounded and reminded that he's not the end-all-be-all that he occasionally thinks he is. Ginny is able to see right through him and call him on his bullshit when needed. Ginny is the release valve, someone he can rely on completely and his equal in attitude and ability. She's not waiting to be rescued or waiting for permission and Harry can like it or lump it.

They're both very strong personalities, both being Leos which brings fierce loyalty (and great hair. I might be a Leo myself), intense feelings and a flair for the dramatic, so those are things that I keep in mind when writing them. They both have a tendency to want what they want and woe to the one that thwarts either one of them. This can easily make them seem like jerks, but it's a good thing they're very charming. :D
