tl;dr: most wizards have the same magical /power/, but they need to discipline their mind to make use of it. Some wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort have either been born with /more/ magic, or they were born with easier /access/ to it (compared to others). I also think that the Dark Arts can be used to increase one's power, which would make Voldemort -- already stupendously talented -- even more powerful.

It depends. For the massive majority of wizards I think it's a case of time spent practising (and practising /well/).

Much like how you can train your brain; you don't think of your brain as a muscle, but your brain is responsible for the organisation of your thoughts and your attention. You need either an obsessive interest in something or self-discipline to take control over these two things.

- If you have disorganised thoughts and make no concerted effort to organise said thoughts, it will be more difficult to use your intellect meaningfully and recall information you learn later.

- If you have undisciplined concentration then your attention will waver and you will be more easily distracted. This will impede your ability to learn /anything/.

Your ability to organise your thoughts and the extent to which you have discipline over your focus is /everything/. It is the underlying ability atop of which all other knowledge is filtered through.

I view magical intent / willpower through the same light. If there are people who have the exact same magical baseline, the one who has better control at exercising that magic with their willpower and concentration will improve faster and see better results from their spells.

Then you get people like Harry, who is not noted as having spectacular concentration, but has a great "force of will" (which he used to resist Mad-Eye's /Imperio/). But I also think Harry is an outlier when it comes to rote magical power, and if he spent more time practising (like he did when learning the Summoning Charm for the First Task) then he would easily become an uncommonly powerful wizard. I mean, the guy could cast a Patronus Charm at 13 that shielded himself from hundreds of Dementors (to continue my analogy - Dementors are a pretty big distraction to overcome). I /refuse/ to believe that Harry is ordinary. He has some kind of special sauce baked into him, but it's up to him to make the most of it.

Edit: Just realised I didn't actually answer the question. I think that the above information applies at all ages. There are probably people who were good students in Hogwarts, then stopped using magic as much after graduating and kind of "lose the hang of" spells that they could once cast. I think all wizards start with the basics and build up from there, and they regress if they stop practising and they develop skill if they continue practising and exploring magic. You develop your skill for as long as you engage in the material and /desire/ to improve yourself.

Some like Tom Riddle had proficient control over their magic even before they were even trained. Hermione had an tremendous intellect and ability to focus, but she wasn't capable of what Riddle was. And unfortunately, Riddle seems to have been on-par with Hermione when it comes to academic accomplishment. He's a scary dood. I imagine both Hermione and Riddle both improve massively after graduation, where they will hyper-specialise into areas of magic that most interest them. Riddle liked more malevolent Dark Arts and would have immersed himself in that material, using his innate skill with magic to push the limit on what was possible.

Another example is Dumbledore. Below is a quote from canon about his time at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  "By the end of his first year, he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school."

And also:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore also became very well-connected during his Hogwarts years, making notable friends such as Nicolas Flamel, Bathilda Bagshot, and Griselda Marchbanks, who marked him in his N.E.W.T.s for Charms and Transfiguration and later recalled that he did things with a wand that she had never seen before.
#+end_quote

We can therefore guess that Dumbledore had more-or-less an intuitive grasp of magic, and had the intellect and mental discipline to make something of that ability.

Harry doesn't have that academic discipline, he also doesn't appear to have a specific obsessive interest in magic outside of Quidditch like Hermione, Riddle, or Dumbledore have. What he does have is buckets of willpower. And some special sauce.
