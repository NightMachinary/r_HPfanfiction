Personally I subscribe to the idea that they have unrestrained access to infinity amounts of magic or that magic is not actually an energy and the telltale signs of accidental magic that generate that idea are just a result of magic being attempted without a proper intent behind it.

Through all the books there was no instance of anyone suffering anything resembling the “magical exhaustion” common in the fandom, and the supposed scale of power was so over the place that trying to make sense of it is an exercise in futility like, the unforgivables were supposedly extremely power intensive but by the time the Battle of Hogwarts happened /everyone/ from both sides and /their goddam owls/ seemed to be casting them at the rate of a freaking machine gun, then there is the patronus which was supposedly hard even for adults but not only Harry managed at thirteen, but he also taught it to the entire DA in a few weeks which, if I am not mistaken, included /other/ 13 YO and potentially even /younger/ students.

And still on the topic of the patronus, that thing is almost as arbitrary as the fidelius, I mean common, even disregarding the fact that having animals represent specific character traits is a particularity of humans and varies a lot with the culture than what is the correlation between the intensity of the emotion and the amount of power needed? Like, can a memory generate so much happiness that the person don't have the power to cast the spell? Or the amount of power is the same but the happiest the memory the stronger the spell?

Personally I think either magic is more like a form of authority over the world and isn't spent because there is no energy-cost per spell at all; it is an energy but the amount available to everyone is infinity; or it is an energy but by the time cannon arrived they had perfected the energy-efficiency of spells to such a point that the amount anyone has became essentially a non-issue since even the weakest wizard around would need to cast high-power spells with no-rest for days before even approaching magical exhaustion.
