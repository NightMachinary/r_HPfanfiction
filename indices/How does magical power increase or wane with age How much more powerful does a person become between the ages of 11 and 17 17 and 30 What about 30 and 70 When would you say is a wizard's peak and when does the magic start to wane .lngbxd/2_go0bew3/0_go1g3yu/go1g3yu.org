I like that idea, but there is the idea that there's "talent", whatever that means. Whether it's more innate power, genetics, upbringing, etc., at least the wizards believe in it. The purebloods believe it's "in the blood", e.g. a family legacy. Hagrid said that Harry was "a thumpin' good" wizard upon first meeting him, after he'd been brought up among Muggles, so it's probably not based on upbringing. Voldemort was a half-blood from a near-squib inbred line, so it's probably not genetic. So what makes Voldemort and Harry "talented" wizards? Harry barely even studied, so it's not a question of skill learned by practice. Honestly, it seems that power is based entirely on authorial fiat and plot armor. The wizards that JKR wanted to portray as powerful were powerful because she said so, not based on any internal or external factors. If you want to write about a powerful wizard, do so. You don't have to explain why. The canon author certainly never did.
