At least they give a believable reason to why a caster might tire out though. In canon people.could just cast endlessly, with no sign of getting tired from the output of energy.

At least magical cores give a way to explain how someone using magic would tire out. I like this because canon version of casting violates a universal law of getting something for nothing. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only change states.
