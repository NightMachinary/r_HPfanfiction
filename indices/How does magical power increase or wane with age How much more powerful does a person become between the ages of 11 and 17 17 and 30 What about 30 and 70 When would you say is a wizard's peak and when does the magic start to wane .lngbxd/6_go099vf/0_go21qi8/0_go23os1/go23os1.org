Genderless term (portmanteau of wizard/witch + mix).

I first encountered it via [[https://thepostmodernpottercompendium.tumblr.com/][Postmodern Potter Compendium]], which is sort of an anthropologist's response-blog/fic to HPMOR.^{1}

I don't use the term in my fics, because it doesn't feel like something that'd organically arise in most situations, but I like it enough to use it in discussions.

^{1} I strongly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8208254/chapters/18807284][towards nuclear winter]], by the same author. It's a Cold War-era fic about the problems that result from the partitioning of muggle!Germany.
