I think that there is probably a fairly standard magical baseline (you either have magic, or you don't), but what differs is the users personality, intelligence, willpower, talents and interests.

I'm a teacher, and at any point, I will have a class of 25 students, and 25 different levels of abilities. Some pick things up easily, some are always going to struggle. Some may not be particularly intellectual, but will give 100% to any task, others are blessed with strong intellect, but are too unmotivated to achieve their full potential.

Someone like Krum is an exceptional flyer because that is the branch of magic that he is interested in the most, just like any elite sportsperson. He has the innate talent AND the willpower to channel that ability. We can presume he works hard to develop those skills, trains regularly and is focussed on his goal.

Snape is a strong wizard because he is exceptionally intelligent, and has the willpower to want to learn, but also a streak of ruthlessness that means he pushes the boundaries. We can presume Hermione is probably at least as intelligent, but she's a rule follower, and doesn't have that same level of ruthlessness.
