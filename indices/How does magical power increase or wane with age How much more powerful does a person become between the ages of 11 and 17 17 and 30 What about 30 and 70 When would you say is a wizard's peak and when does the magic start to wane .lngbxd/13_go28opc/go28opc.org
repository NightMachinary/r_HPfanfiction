In my mind magic works essentially like how Zenkai boosts worked in DBZ. The vast majority of people are never pushed to the point where they /have/ to increase their magic, so it just slowly grows as they get older and practice more and more magic in school.

Some people like Aurors and Cursebreakers start getting small Zenkai boosts as they're pushed past their limits in training, but imo the earlier you start Zenkai boosting, the more magic you can eventually wield.

But ofc if you don't continue working on your magic it won't grow.

Meanwhile people like Dumbledore and Grindelwald worked themselves to the bone continuously training over and over, repeatedly working themselves to exhaustion, giving them insane Zenkai boosts, which panned out later in life as they continued to push themselves to the point where they casually do things most wizards and witches balk at the thought of.

Like having multiple transfigurations ongoing while fighting a running battle with someone throwing Unforgiveables around like candy, while protecting a child and keeping the insane guy's best lieutenant from joining the fight.
