Magic is supposed to be a skill like any other - you practice and you get better, if you're smart/talented/have synergistic qualities then you have a leg-up, and understanding it usually helps.

So, I'd imagine that as long as you maintained yourself and kept practicing, you'd probably keep getting better at Magic. I wouldn't say that Magic 'wanes', technically, but if you get older and slower then it's harder to make wand motions as smoothly as you did in your youth and cognitive decline would make picking up new spells harder, etc. So, you get worse at the things that make you good at magic, rather than getting worse at magic itself.
