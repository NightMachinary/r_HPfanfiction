Wand movements also seem to be optional, since more skilled wizards do with a simple wave or point what the less skilled ones would require many gestures and/or words to do. Look at Dumbledore's fight with Riddle. They gesture and wave and point, but none of that is carefully calculated wand movements. It's more like a conductor than a painter.
