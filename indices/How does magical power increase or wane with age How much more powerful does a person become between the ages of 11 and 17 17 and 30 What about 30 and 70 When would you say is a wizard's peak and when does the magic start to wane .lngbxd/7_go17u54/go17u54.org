Canon doesn't really go into this - there's not a single point where anything even remotely resembling "magic power levels" are explored.

My theory is that magic "power" is essentially 100% about what you know and /maybe/ whether your body can still make the right wand-movements.

There's no real limit to when you can cast certain spells or when they're at their most powerful, as long as you know exactly how to do the spell - see also, a 13-year-old driving off hundreds of Dementors with a Patronus, an 11-year-old casting a Hovering Charm strong enough to rip a massive troll's club out of its hand.

The only moments your access to magic would wane, then, is if you either start forgetting spells due to waning memory, or if your body physically can't make the wand-movements anymore.
