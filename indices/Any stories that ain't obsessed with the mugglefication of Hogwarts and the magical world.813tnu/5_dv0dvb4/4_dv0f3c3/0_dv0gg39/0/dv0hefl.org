Then there's still disillusionment charms, portkeys, etc. There are so many possibilities.

You're also assuming that the wizards would allow the muggles time to gather their armies. Wizards can travel way faster and would already be at their enemy's doorstep before they have time to roll up their tanks.

They can use the fidelius charm and make the location of wizards unplottable so the muggles can't the place they're supposed to shoot at.

The wizards can use muggle repelling charms, so whever a muggle with a gun comes close, they turn away and leave. You really haven't thought this through.

The fact that you have to limit the kinds of spells wizards can use to make the muggles and wizards in your scenario even remotely equal is telling enough.

Also, as Rowling said:

  When you can summon any book, instrument or animal with a wave of your wand and the word 'Accio!'; when you can communicate with friends and acquaintances by means of owl, fire, Patronus, Howler, enchanted objects such as coins, or Apparate to visit them in person; when your newspaper has moving pictures and everyday objects sometimes talk to you, then the internet does not seem a particularly exciting place.

All these inventions which you consider so superior mean very little compared to what wizards can do.
