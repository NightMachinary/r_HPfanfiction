I am talking about Harry and the other defenders getting guns (easily done in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Warsaw Pact) and using said guns to make the grounds surrounding Hogwarts a killing field, not some muggle vs wizard war. Shooting an AK-47 is easy enough so it wouldn't be too difficult to train the defenders in a few hours (guns became popular for that very reason after the Renessaince).
