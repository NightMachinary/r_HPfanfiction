I was talking about a scenario where apparation and the Imperius curse are out of the picture (the defenders at the Battle of Hogwarts having weapons). Obviously magic can disrupt the entire chain of command. Disarming, however, is useless since by the time you cast a disarming spell, at least 5 bullets are coming your way far too quick to cast any shield (since you were just casting a disarming spell).
