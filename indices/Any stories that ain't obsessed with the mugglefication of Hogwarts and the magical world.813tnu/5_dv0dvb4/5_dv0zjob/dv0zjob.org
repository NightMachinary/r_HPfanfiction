I'm increasingly disappointed by the [[https://i.imgur.com/ZNjC1W5.gif][combative]] behaviour in this subreddit regarding downvotes. This is a useful comment relevant to the topic and doesn't deserve a -14 score.

Downvote is not the disagree button. By punishing people for voicing their opinion you are creating an echo chamber.
