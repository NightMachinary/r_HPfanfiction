  Honestly the voting system is broken. Whatever it was meant for from the beginning it is now a like/dislike button and Reddit should just disable/remove the downvote button.

That's exactly what it was meant for in the beginning. The purpose of upvoting and downvoting is to increase the visibility of popular content (i.e. things people like) and decrease the visibility of unpopular content (i.e. things people don't like). That's the whole point of a content aggregator with a voting system.
