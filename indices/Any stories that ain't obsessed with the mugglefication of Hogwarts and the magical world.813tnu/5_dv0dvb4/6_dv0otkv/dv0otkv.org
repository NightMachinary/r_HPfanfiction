On the subject of guns wouldn't a fire suppression spell neutralise them completely, By stopping the black power from igniting ?(and I know that they aren't mentioned in canon but it's a pretty easy idea to come up with so there no reason for wizards to be unable to do it)

Then again muggle repealing charms like the ones used on the stadium in fourth year for the World Cup would be enough neutralise muggles even if they did have guns.
