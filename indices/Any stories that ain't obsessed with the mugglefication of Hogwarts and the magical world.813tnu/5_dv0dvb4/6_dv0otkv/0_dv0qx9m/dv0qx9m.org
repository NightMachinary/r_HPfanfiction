Why are you making this about muggles? I am talking about wizards using guns because guns are a great skill neutraliser. As for the fire suppression spell, that might work IF you managed to hit the bullets with it. But considering that you are trying to hit bullets in a magazine/belt, there is a high chance that you'd either miss or whoever is wielding them will pull the trigger before you finish the spell.
