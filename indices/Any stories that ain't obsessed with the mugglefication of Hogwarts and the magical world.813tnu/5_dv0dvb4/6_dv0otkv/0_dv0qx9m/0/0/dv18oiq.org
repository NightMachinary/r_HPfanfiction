The question however is whether that would work with gunpowder since ot has its own Oxidizer (meaning it burns even in vacuum or pure nitrogen). Also fire suppression spells don't really seem to be a thing considering that most lights in Hogwarts are based on open fire (torches, candles, fireplaces). When a magical fire suppression system doesn't catch those, it won't work on bullets either.

And basically burning is just a reaction with Oxygen, and should you magically suppress that, it would most likely kill everything in its area of effect since oxidisation on a micro level is essential to life.
