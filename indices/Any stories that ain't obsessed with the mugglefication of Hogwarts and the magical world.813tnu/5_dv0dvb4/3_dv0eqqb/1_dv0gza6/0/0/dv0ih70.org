Physics.

Do you have any idea how much energy there is involved? If Dumbledore couldn't slow Harry's fall enough to stop him from passing out in PoA, and Harry's kinetic energy was below 100 KJ, how do you expect magic to shield you from explosives where a single gram of it has 4 KJ (and we are talking about at least 500 kg of explosives, meaing at least 2000 KJ on top of any kinetic energy of the projectile, which on its own can surpass 50000 KJ). Yes, magic can counteract physics to some degree, but you are expecting a simple shield hat to do more than Dumbeldore?
