You cannot hold up Dumbledore's inability to catch Harry as an example of magic being unable to overcome physics, when we have so many other instances of that capability being displayed. Further, you ignore all other possible reasons that Dumbledore did not catch Harry. If you have some proof is love to see it, but right now your conjecture is no better than anyone else's.
