Magic > Physics

Energy doesn't matter - physics doesn't matter in a world where 11 year olds learn how to make a mockery of it in their first year of schooling.

So all of these weapons - /all of them/, from the puny .22 LR rifle, to the nuke, can hit once, they may hit twice, but they won't hit a third time.

Introducing muggle weaponry as a suprise is probably worth it. Make it big enough, make it count and you got yourself a good hit on the enemy. But almost as an immediate reaction wizards and witches will adapt and introduce magical ways of dealing with the threat.
