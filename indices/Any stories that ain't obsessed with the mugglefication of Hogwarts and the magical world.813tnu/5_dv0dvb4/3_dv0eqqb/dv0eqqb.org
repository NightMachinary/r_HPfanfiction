I have this little neat theory. Let's start with my favourite quote from Pottermore - "I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature." (Pottermore: Illness and Disability).

Okay, so we have magical reality overwrite physical one. And we have that neat thing called Shield charm. Spells can break through it, as magic's ability to change magic is limited. But it also protects from physical damage, and we can assume that the Shield charm is not limited here as it is "mundane" kind of damage.

The Shield charm can be adjusted in terms of size, the Shield charm can be used to protectively enchant place, the Shield charm can be enchanted on clothes (as of HBP).

Assuming, my theory is true, wizards could just wear Shield hats and tank everything muggles throw at them or drink their tea in Shield charm protected houses as bombs fall around.
