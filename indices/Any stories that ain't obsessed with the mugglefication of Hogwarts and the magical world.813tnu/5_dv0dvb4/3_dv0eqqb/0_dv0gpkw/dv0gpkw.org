A wizard can just simply imperturb and/or cushion their clothing and they'd be wearing literal bulletproof. Modern firearms are really cool and all, but it's still ballistics. It's still just like flinging a thing, only really fast. Compared to all the things a wizard can do with a wand it still looks like a really primitive weapon.
