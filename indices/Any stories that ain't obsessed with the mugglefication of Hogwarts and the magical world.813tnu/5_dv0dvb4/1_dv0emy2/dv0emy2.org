So here you are defending muggle wank and I'll bite.

I'll start with the obvious, magical healthcare is the best. Period. They can regrow entire bones, that is something that science is barely even considering possible and wizards have had it long enough a school nurse can apply it.

I'll hit magical warfare now since you spent so much time on it. Sure muggles have guns and tanks and planes, but there's more to combat than raw numbers as many generals have proved over millennia. A weapon is only as useful as the person using it, what is there stopping a disillusioned/invisible wizard from imperiousing a machine gunner or just unleashing feindfyre on the entrenched position. Sure, wizards don't fight the same way as muggles but the Russians don't fight the same way as the German or French and we all know what that did to Napoleon.

TV is a technology not seen in the magical world but they have moving pictures, painting that retain the personalities of the dead and a functioning radio, one is more impressive than the other.

On a finishing note, I don't read Harry Potter to hear about his big gun and how he shot all his problems away. There are certain things that must be assumed for a fantasy story to work and poking holes in it may be easy but really doesn't contribute to many peoples enjoyment.

Also apologies in advance for the formatting, this was done on mobile.
