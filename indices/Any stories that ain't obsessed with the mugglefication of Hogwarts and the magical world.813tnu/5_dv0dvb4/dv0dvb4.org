In direct combat, magic sucks. Yes, apparation and the imperious curse exist, but if you take these factors out, like in the Battle of Hogwarts, it quickly turns into a turkey shoot if the defenders have muggle weapons (and knew how to use them). An uphill frontal assault against a fortified position bristling with machine guns, mortars, AT rockets and anti-material/tank rifles would have been a very short affair (and magic does not stop these from working since there's no electricity involved). And I'm not even taking artillery, chemical weapons or airstikes into account here.

And it's not just weapons and the internet. Television, game consoles, trains (the Hogwarts express is slow as hell), refrigerators, advanced medical DIAGNOSTIC devices like MRTs or ultrasound, there are plenty of areas where magic is behind. Just as there are plenty of areas where Muggles are behind. Sadly authors either go for total Muggle wank or make magic the solution for everything instead of trying to find a balance between both.

Edit: How do you come to the conclusion that I am defending muggle wank? I am saying that OP is not accurate when he says that magic is better in everything besides the internet. Magic has far superior travel methods and magical healing is at least decades ahead of mundane. And stop making this about wizards vs the military. I am talking about WIZARDS using guns to kill other WIZARDS (Death Eaters).

Edit2: You know what? I am done with this thread since everyone insists that I am talking about Muggles vs Wizards. I was talking about WIZARDS using guns to kill other WIZARDS because it is far easier to learn how to shoot with adequate accuracy than it would be for the average witch or wizard to learn combat magic to the point where they can match an Death Eater.
