  You know what? I am done with this thread since everyone insists that I am talking about Muggles vs Wizards. I was talking about WIZARDS using guns to kill other WIZARDS because it is far easier to learn how to shoot with adequate accuracy than it would be for the average witch or wizard to learn combat magic to the point where they can match an Death Eater.

The ability to protect oneself from a gun does not change depending on who is using it. "Shield charms would stop bullets" is just as valid if wizards are shooting the bullets.
