When I was thinking about muggleification I was more think about the how they try to turn Hogwarts into a muggle school. Hogwarts may have it flaws but trying to turn it into a muggle school is not going to make it better, after all the muggle school system was created to make factory works that would do as they are told.

I am perfectly fine with the wizarding world takeing ideas from the muggle world of which they have no equivalent like the Internet.

But why would they want tv when they could use something like the day dream charms that the weasly twins were selling at there shop to instead of watching a character have an adventure instead have a day dream of there own adventure were it's like they are actually there.
