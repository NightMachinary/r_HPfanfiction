Kindle, the regular cheap one. And yeah, pretty much, although I mostly read complete or abandoned fics so that's not an issue.

I love E-Ink, it's so much easier on the eyes. If only there was a laptop with this type of screen. I'd only need it for office / text work, so grayscale and slowness is not an issue.
