Kindle, in conjunction with Calibre. I have a calibre plugin that downloads stuff from FFN and AO3 etc, so i can just do that again when a fic updates. You can email stuff from calibre to a kindle easily, and if a fic is completed I can make it look pretty and keep it. I love my kindle, but my brother does the same using the kindle app on his phone.
