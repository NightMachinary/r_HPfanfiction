Usually I just use the MoonReader app on my phone. I have a Note II, so the screen's large enough to prop up on a table or on the treadmill.

When I'm on a plane, I upload several fics/books to my Kindle Paperwhite before the trip. I had an issue though where I tried to open a really large fic on my Paperwhite and it would cause the thing to crash, but opening the same file on my phone wasn't an issue.

If the story is in-progress, if I like it enough I usually add it to my follow list. When a new chapter comes in, I don't bother converting it since it's only one chapter.
