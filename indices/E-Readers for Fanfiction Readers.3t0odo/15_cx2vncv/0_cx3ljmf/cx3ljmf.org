The large fic that caused your paperwhite to crash--was that a single chapter fic or multi? If it was multi, where the chapters long in length? I'm just curious, because I pre-format all my fics before converting to epub and I find that after about 35,000 words/40 A4 pages it automatically splits the html parts that make up the epub, which can cause problems when I put it on my tablet to read. I just wondered if a similar issue might have caused your crash.
