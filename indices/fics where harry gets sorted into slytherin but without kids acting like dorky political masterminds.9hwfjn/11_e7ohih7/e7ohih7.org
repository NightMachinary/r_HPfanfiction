Magical Relations. On one hand it's been unfinished for like two years. On the other, there's 71 chapters. The writing actually improves as the story goes on and it has the added benefit of making the characters feel like they're actually going from childhood through adolescence. Dudley gets a hogwarts letter and gets sorted into gryffindor, which puts Harry off gryffindor, so the hat puts him in slytherin. Nobody is overpowered, there's real conflict, and the characters act like actual people.
