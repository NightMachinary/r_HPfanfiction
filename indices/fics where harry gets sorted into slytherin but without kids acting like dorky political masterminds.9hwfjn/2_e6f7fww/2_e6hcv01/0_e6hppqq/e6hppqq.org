Hey, author here...just wanted to give context here. The Dumbledore/Grindelwald letters that you're talking about took place in 1899. Correct me if I'm wrong, but being gay was not particularly acceptable then. It also represents Dumbledore's opinion of himself, not my opinion of the gay community. Please don't misrepresent my work with these accusations.
