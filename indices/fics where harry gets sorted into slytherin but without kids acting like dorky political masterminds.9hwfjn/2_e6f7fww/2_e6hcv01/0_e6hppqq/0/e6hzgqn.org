First, I'd like to say that I still enjoyed your writing.

However when I say that your fiction contains homophobia that does not necessarily mean the entire work or writer themselves is homophobic. It just means that your fiction contains people/events/situations/language that are homophobic.

Even the most LGBT+ positive movies and work often contain homophobic remarks/plotlines/characters. Encountering homophobia is not everyone's cup of tea, which is why I gave this warning (which is also why I tend to tag works like that with 'contains (implied) homophobia' or such. People deserve to know before being tenthousands of words into the story (which is also why I posted this on a recommendation thread).

The HP series by JKR does not contain homophobic language like this. Since that differs from the canon it is worth a warning.

> The Dumbledore/Grindelwald letters that you're talking about took place in 1899.

First, that does not matter. The fic still contains homophobic language, which people would like to be warned about in advance, whatever the reason for inclusion is, however reasonable or realistic the inclusion is.

Secondly. You as a writer as perfectly allowed to include a homophobic society in your works, you do not necessarily have to justify it. Likewise a writer is also perfectly allowed to skip homophobia or create a non-homophobic society.

The wizarding society is separate from the muggle one. It doesn't have to be either homophobic or non-homophobic. Especially a wizarding world which does not follow the Abrahamic religions. A great part of the world did not really have heavy homophobia before proselytization and the institution of colonial laws by W-European colonizers in the 19th century either.

Even in our own (muggle) history there have been periods where laws were more or less strict. Actual historical letters between same-sex lovers from this period were often positive and did not contain words like 'monster' when referring to themselves, only focussing on their own romance or just basic life.

It was your choice as a writer to let Dumbledore use these harsh homophobic terms to describe himself. That is not necessarily homophobic, or makes the entire work homophobic, but it still means that this work contains some some strong homophobia.

Thirdly. If the work as an entirety is homophobic is not possible to say, since it's not finished. There may come some cool plot and stories due to your inclusion of these homophobic remarks used by Dumbledore, or not, but it's not finished.

> Please don't misrepresent my work with these accusations.

I didn't, I merely gave a warning that your work contains casual homophobia and told them how it happened. I'm sorry you misunderstood my intentions. Don't feel to pressured by this to reply (i'm sure you've got better things to do), likewise I strongly suggest people to not attack the author. It's my opinion that giving unwanted negative criticism to fanfiction is bad form, however since this was a recommendation thread and not a comment on the fic itself I think people deserve to know that it does contain homophobic language.

*tldr; Your work contains homophobia. That does not make the work or you personally homophobic. People deserve to know that it will contain homophobia. Especially with the extreme words Dumbledore uses.*
