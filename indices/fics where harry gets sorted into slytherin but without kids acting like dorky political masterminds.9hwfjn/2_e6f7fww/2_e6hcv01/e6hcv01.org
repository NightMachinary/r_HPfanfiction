I was a bit disappointed by encountering casual homophobia while I was already at the third volume

Namely the author letting dumbledore calling himself "a monster" for being gay in letters and making a big thing about this, while in the canon it was only inspiring Grindelwald, and the death of his sister that gave bad PR, not the being gay part.
