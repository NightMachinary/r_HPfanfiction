Yeah, always makes me cringe when writers write the Slytherins as Bond villains. They're just teenagers! No teenager is /that/ interested in politics and social manoeuvring, doesn't matter how they were raised. Ambition and cunning doesn't have to mean political ambition, it could mean literally anything, a kid with a dream to open his own broom store would get sorted into Slytherin.
