Idea for a story, it's canon that Harry had dreamed of being on a flying motorcycle, but it's only mentioned once in book 1, instead Harry had dreamed of it more than once and thus flying is one of his dearest ambition, maybe even his normal dream of being a pilot maybe in the army is encouraged by the dursleys, Dumbledore convinces Harry to come to Hogwarts by telling him of flying brooms, and quidditch, his ambition to become a professional player lands him in slytherin, lol maybe even Harry finding common ground with others over flying and the love of flying is the "power he knows not"
