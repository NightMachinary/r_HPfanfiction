OK, I have to admit. I haven't made it over the first two chapters. Stories where Harry keeps completely without reason deep personal secrets from Ginny, who is presumed to be his girlfriend, just so that the tension between them rises until they split, while Hermione who is supposed to be so much better person than everybody else can never forgive Ron for his weakness when he was cursed by the incredibly dark artefact (did anybody blame Ginny for attempts to /kill/ couple of her classmates?), and so they, Harry and Hermione, can finally be together and gloat over all Weasleys how they are better than them. Grr.

If you really want to write Harmony, be my guest, but split Hinny and Ronnione in some reasonable way. Kill Weasleys in the war, or make Ginny fall in the Room of Requirement for Neville (that would actually make a lot of sense), or something, but don't do this psychological nonsense.
