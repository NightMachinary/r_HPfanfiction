Quite a number. You can search by character on fanfiction. net (and select them). You can also do so on AO3, or just search there under "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" (Movies). I don't read these stories, so I have no specific recs; if you're new to the fandom, I'd suggest searching by favorites on fanfiction and kudos on AO3.
