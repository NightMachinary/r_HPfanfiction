I'll soon be writing a fic where Grindelwald tries to manipulates Newt by showing him how destroying the Statute of Secrecy will mean that his Beasts would truly be free and no longer having to hide in secluded habitats, making the same argument he does for Wizards... If Magic blooms only in rare souls, why must they skulk in the shadows, and in the same way, why should these Fantastic Beasts not be allowed to roam freely?! Yes, they may be dangerous, Grindelwald may argue, but they deserve a chance too...whaddya guys think?!
