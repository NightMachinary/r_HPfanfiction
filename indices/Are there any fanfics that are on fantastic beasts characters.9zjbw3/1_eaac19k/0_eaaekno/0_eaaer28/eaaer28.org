Thank you...I'm going to stick to the roots of these characters and this fic will essentially be a what if scenario, as in, if Grindelwald also chose to manipulate Newt just like he did with Queenie and Credence. Would it work?! Would Newt's moral compass become murkier if his Beasts are concerned and not humans?! I'll send you a link when I get to it!!
