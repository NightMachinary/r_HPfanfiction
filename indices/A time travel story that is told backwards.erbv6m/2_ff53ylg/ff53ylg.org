Have you ever watched the film Memento?

Although it doesn't exactly involve time travel the film is presented in reverse order much like you describe above.

It's about a man whose tracking his wife's killer however he has no ability to form memories so after about 10 minutes he forgets what just happened. I found it a rather interesting film.
