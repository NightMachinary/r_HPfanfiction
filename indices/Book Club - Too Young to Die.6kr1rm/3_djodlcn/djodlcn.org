This book almost bought me to breaking my 2 year 110 book HP FanFiction streak and pick up something else. I got past half-way.

The protagonist is entirely unlikable. The back-story to him becoming that way is not well presented up front and what is known is unrealistic if we attribute any value to what we learnt of the characters from JKR. With no identification with any of the main characters it is hard to keep going and super bad Harry just makes it harder.
