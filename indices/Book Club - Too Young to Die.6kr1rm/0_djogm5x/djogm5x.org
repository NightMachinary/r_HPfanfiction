Too Young to Die is one of those fics that is full of glaring flaws and can't quite be considered well written, but I honestly have a soft spot for it. It's probably the only fic I've read where practicing Dark Magic actually has a negative effect on Harry, and its ending was pretty hype.

The first few chapters are definitely in need of some work, not so much in the form of grammar but in plot. We're not really given much chance to bond with Natasha before she's killed, so we don't really relate to Harry's goal to bring her back.

Harry also attempts to fuck any woman he sets his eyes on, which gets pretty annoying. Though I will admit it's sorta /refreshing/ to see a fic where the harem guy freely admits he's just using the girls for their bodies and what they can offer him. Much better than that whole "Oh yes I love all 16 members of my harem equally we're all soulmates".
