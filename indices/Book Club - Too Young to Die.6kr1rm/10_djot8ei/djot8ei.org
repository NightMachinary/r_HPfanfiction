This story is among the legions of "okay stories". Above average writing for fanfiction.net, but writing and plot that doesn't stand out among the better stories that FFN has to offer.

I finished it back in the day, maybe two or so months after I started reading fanfiction. I'm not confident I could read it to completion today. It just doesn't stand out when there are other WBWL fics that are better.
