Alright, I couldn't get past the first three chapters of this one. Less than halfway through the first one I wanted to drop it, but seeing that I was reading it for this book club I gave it another chance. 3 chapters, if it doesn't get better or gets worse I would drop it. It got worse.

To start with, this fic is every Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived clich√© with the addition that this Harry also had a sister. This sister died, this sister is now motivation. So instead of just vengeance and hate, we have those with the addition of a reason in the form of the sister. I like the concept, it's better than most WBWL fics out there but the execution was not done well.

Firstly, I did not like the writing. There were a few problems but the most glaring annoyance at the beginning was how stilted it was. That is a purely subjective problem, however, as not everyone likes the same writing styles. The real problem is how boring it is. It is boring, and the writing/characters being annoying just adds to the disinterest (the author even adds at the end of chapter 3 that this Harry will be unlikeable). Most characters are ridiculous, in fact i'd equate them with your standard charicature or trope embodiment. The plot is predictable, which again is highlighted with the lack of substance found in the fic as a whole.

I think I could have actually made it farther if the 3rd chapter wasn't so horrible. In the interest of avoiding spoilers (should you want to read it) i'll just say this; Harry's interaction both with Draco and the two women were a bit too much. The latter was forced in for some inane, unknown reason and the former was too over the top. To be clear, the fact that the writing suffers from tone, voice and structure problems made my issues with the fic that much more extenuated. This fic is not for me, I'm sure some people will enjoy it and good for them but i personally did not enjoy anything about it and would not recommend it.

Again, I haven't read the whole thing and I don't plan to.
