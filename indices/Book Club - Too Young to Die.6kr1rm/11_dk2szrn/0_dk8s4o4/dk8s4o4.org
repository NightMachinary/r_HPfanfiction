This is sort of a spoiler, but there is an explanation at the end for this that does an ok job of explaining their weird behavior imo. They aren't actually doing it on purpose or even realize what they are doing. Note I only read the the first couple chapters and then skimmed the final chapter as it was too dark/edgy for my taste so I have no idea if the fic was actually good or not.
