I remember when reading it thinking it seemed like something fishy was going on as they didn't seem realize their other children existed most of the time, so it seemed like they were under some sort of mind altering spell to me. When that was the actual explanation it made sense to me and I assumed it was always supposed to be like that. It's possible the auhor just retconned it later and I was giving them too much credit at the beginning. But for example the quidditch scene makes sense if there's like magical reason for James to forget Harry is there, and doesn't make sense if James is just a dick, so the author intending James to be under a spell seems reasonable to and not forced in later.
