I couldn't get behind the Potters pretending they only had one Child. I would like to read one where they act like humans, even if they are horrible humans. Abusive parents often flip between affection neglect and physical abuse, which leaves the child confused and feeling like it is their fault.

Aside from that I think my biggest complaint about this fic is that I had no emotional connection to Natasha. I actually had to double check that I had her name right, and I only read it a week ago. She was Harry's drive, I felt nothing for her, she was an entirely forgettable character.
