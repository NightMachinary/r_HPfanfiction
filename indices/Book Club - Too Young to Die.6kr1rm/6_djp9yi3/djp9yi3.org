I remember this fic quite well, it left an ... interesting impression to say the least.

Firstly, the Magic displayed in the Fic becomes incredibly boring for a Fic with the protagonist exploring the literal innards of Magic. Magic is supposed to present the whole

#+begin_quote
  "Turtles all the way down but the farther you go the bigger and scalier the turtles get, with sharper beaks. Until they eventually start looking less like turtles and more like dragons."
#+end_quote

In short, Magic is presented in a way that tries too hard to be overly realistic and overly rational to the Muggle mind. So this automatically makes the fic fall three points out of five.

Next, are the characters. It presents everything wrong with a WBWL fic and wraps it up in a neat little bow. It reminds me a lot of the fic Clash, where most of the characters generally act for no reason and have no real motivations, but the fic tells you they do, so you have to believe it. OverlymatureElvenYearOld!Harry makes his move here, and oh boy. I suppose the author wanted him to be a bit like Tom Riddle, but it just fell and continued falling until we met one of those Dragon Turtles.

Here's a bit what he does wrong.

- Harry isn't really a master of misdirection, the people around him just have no clue what they're doing.

- Lily and James are mean for no reason again. This time it's to two children, honestly, it would make more sense for Harry to be the only one left out instead as he would be somewhere within the middle of Lily and James' priorities, but their youngest child? Why? This is so OOC that you can't call them James or Lily anymore.

- Lily and James don't feel the least bit of apathy for their dead daughter, Nuff said.

- Harry defeats several Aurors just by reading and studying Black Magic in the woods!trope.

- Random Grammatical Errors, words that were misplaced/misspelt/went off into the abyss of Grammar. Not sure if the author ever edited that, but I'm doubtful.

- Dark!Harry achieves his goal but ends up dying/incarcerated/exiled/unknownandentirelyambigious!trope.

Now for what I liked.

- Combat was portrayed in an interesting way, it wasn't in anyway believable in who was fighting who, but it was still a nice breath of fresh air from the incredibly grimdark fic that comes about. However, there's a lot of Gorn, unnecessary Gorn.

- Stays relatively consistent within its boring Magic system.

- Tone stays consistent as well, no real radical tone changes to warrant a minus of any points. Though the lack of variety is a double-edged sword.

Overall going to have to give this a 1/5, wouldn't really read it again.
