Well, I read this actually fairly recently instead of working so.. I had a good reason to finish it.

First the plot is a little eh. The pacing is off in places, and while the character driven concepts are fresh, the fact is we don't get to connect with anyone before something happens to change their characters. (Prime material is Harry)

However this is one of the first works that show what true Dark Magic does to a person who dives into it trying to keep themselves sane. The only other one that does that in my mind is Art of Self Fashioning.

The action and suspense when first read was alright, and the ending while lackluster was the only real way it could have happened. Sure Harry could have gotten away with it, but not without repercussions that he wouldn't be able to take. So the ending worked.

All in all, I would give it a 3.2 out of 5 stars. Not a must read, but definitely something that is better than most of the garbage on the internet rn.
