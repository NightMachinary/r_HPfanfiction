This was one of the first wbwl fics I had read, and maybe one of the first ten Harry Potter fanfics I read. As such, I was able to finish it, but I don't think I could do it today. Too many characters act completely OOC, and the plot progression is badly paced, and the end is disappointing. It is like Princess of the Blacks, but worse in nearly every way.
