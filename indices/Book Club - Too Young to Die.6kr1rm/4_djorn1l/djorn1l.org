I'll be honest I could never get through the first 5-6 chapters of this. So what I sometimes do in this case, is pick a chapter near the end and read it. If it captures my interest I go back a few chaters and start from there. I ended up reading everything but the first 25% of this.

So yeah, if this story has one thing going for it, it's entertainment. Crazy weird shit happens all the time; Harry is an inconsistent, amoral, sociopathic douchebag, but you can't help (at least I couldn't help it) wanting to know if he's going to be succesful in his quest.

There's no identifying with this protagonist. Although his motives are supposedly pure, his actions are beyond reprehensible. But, like watching school shooting clips on TV, you can't help but stare in horrified fascination.

Also I loved the ending. It takes balls to end it in this way, and although I was mad at the time, I've realised now how it strengthens the rest of the story. Cause as you read, you start to believe that the world this guy has created is one way; but after you finish it you realise for a long while you were being duped - with your consent.
