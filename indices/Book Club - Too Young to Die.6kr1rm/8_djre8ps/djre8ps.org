I've tried to read this one repeatedly. Chapter 1 is where I usually stop before remembering why I haven't read this oft recommended fic. I've made it to the 2nd one this time, though not the end. Skimming other chapters has proved that it's not worth my time.

There is one good point: The premise has merit -- anything can if it's done well enough.

This is not done nearly well enough. Even if there was no author's note, it'd be painfully obvious that this was someone's first foray into fics. And I hate it. I hate that Lily and James actively dislike/ignore Harry and his sister (a common sin of this type of fic). I hate that he some how "Slytherins" his way into Hufflepuff and the plot screams along into Dark!Harry at a breakneck pace. I hate that Harry reads like he's five years older than his canon age. And I absolutely hate a semi-decent twist on a tired trope (WBWL) being wasted.

Mostly, though, the quality of writing was the dealbreaker. Interesting or excellent writing can help gloss over a lot of flaws like OOC or glaring plotholes.
