A fanfic that would be better served as original fiction. If you can separate the canon HP characters from their OOC counterparts then the world building may save the story for you. It paints a picture of a Harry Potter slowly descending into a rabbit hole of crime and immorality.

If I was going to make my own fan edit I would put in some sections seen through Dumbledore's eyes. Does he regret his actions that indirectly lead to the rise of yet another dark wizard?
