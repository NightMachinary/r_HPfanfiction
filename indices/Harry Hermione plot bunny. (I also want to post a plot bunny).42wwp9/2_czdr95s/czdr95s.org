I'm less critical than BigFatNo except for one thing: why doesn't Dumbledore explain the facts to McGonagall? It's not plausible that she'd be under oaths to report things to the Ministry, and it's not like she's Umbridge. I can see them agreeing on a token punishment, because they did break into a teacher's office and she had an addiction problem, but that's it.

Focus on your characters and make sure they have plausible reasons for their choices, even mistakes.
