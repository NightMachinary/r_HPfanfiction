Really good! An actual unique and interesting take on canon. Would only hope you would weave in some obvious signs to the reader that they are interested in each other while they remained oblivious. How does Hermione miss Harry as she is sucked into the time turner? Where does she feel most lonely. What smells make her feel happy or sad about her choices.
