I like the concept, but I find it as with most time travel paradox stories too convoluted. " I don't want to talk about time travel because if we start talking about it then we're going to be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws." Looper 2012

fascinating premise here but it will have to be written just right to keep your reader from throwing up their hands and dropping it.

Harry finding out about it before Hermione realizes it by watching the Map.. Hermione splitting off and into multiple Hermione(s) and Harry watching what is going on, figuring it out for himself..

Write it I'll read it.
