Too much hand waving is needed to create an arbitrary situation for the two to grow closer together. The time-turner addiction could be interesting I guess, but only for the fact that Hermione is already 10 months older than Harry. Bu the time the year is done, taking three extra classes and whatever "extra time" she wants to put herself far ahead, she could be over a year older than them, physically older than some of the fourth years even.

But, as others have said, I don't buy the situation with McGonagall and Dumbledore at all. You essentially have McGonagall undermining Dumbledore for no other reason than for Plot Reasons, despite all evidence in canon suggesting that she wouldn't act that way at all.

So, I'd say it's way too convoluted of a setup just to make a random Harry/Hermione story.
