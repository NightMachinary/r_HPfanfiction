I like the overall idea. However, since Harry has a thing about authority figures, I think he may attempt to covertly ask Lupin for advice regarding his concerns about a friend, rather than going to his head of house because he eventually builds up a sort of trust with Lupin.

Lupin has probably noticed something peculiar about Hermione as well (and it would be fun if they both suspected the other of something nefarious) and after some investigation, brings it to Professor McGonagall's attention. I think that McGonagall would definitely handle the detentions and disappointment the way you say she would. However, she'd definitely be in the know about Sirius since she's an Order member and all.

I like the H/Hr relationship and it sounds like the narrative will give the origin of it a very organic feel. Are you planning on making this a "shipping" fanfic or are you continuing the series but changing it based on H/Hr endgame? I'm just asking because this has the potential to be about more than just the relationship aspect and I love fics that change the world based on a just a few tweaks.

Oh and I think it would be adorable if Sirius makes a comment about how Harry shares the same good taste in women as his father üòç.
