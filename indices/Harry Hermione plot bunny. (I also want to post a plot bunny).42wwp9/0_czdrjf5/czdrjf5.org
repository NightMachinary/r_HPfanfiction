Indeed. Sirius's innocence should solve the issue easily. McGonagall obviously trusts Dumbledore a great deal - her "he said it, that should be enough" line in book 4 is telling.

I'd also - though that's just my personal preference - go against canon there, and save Sirius by going back much further than in the book, far enough to catch Pettigrew by ambushing him when he (and everyone else) thinks he has escaped.

Instead of getting detention, Hermione could need help - therapy, or treatments - to get over her addiction, like Sirius needs help after a decade spent among dementors, with Harry visiting both. She might have regular "sessions" even into the next school year.
