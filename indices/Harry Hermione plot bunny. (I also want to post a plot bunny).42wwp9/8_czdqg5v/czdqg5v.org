I liked it up until the point of rescuing Sirius.

I think the addiction part of the time turner is really good, and you could definitely make a lot of stories about that, like this one for example.

You can really make it a Stephen King-like story, where after a slow build-up of Hermione becoming confused about the rules and seeing her past self in the distance etc, her past self sees her future self do something, and she's so insane from the addiction, lack of sleep and too much time-travelling, she kills her future self. From then on, it becomes a bit like Groundhog Day, where she has to constantly try and alter the timeline, so that nothing bad happens.

Back to your plot: after the time-turner is confiscated, it's just a build-up towards Harry and Hermione getting together, so the plot becomes weird. Why doesn't Dumbledore just tell McGonagall that Sirius is innocent? That way Hermione escapes punishment. Also, Ron cheering about having a date while Harry hasn't and Hermione isn't allowed to attend? Doesn't sound very Ron-like.

I know it's fanfic, so you can be very liberal with the universe and its characters, but I don't really like the plot, apart from the time-turner addiction.

Sorry for not being more positive :/
