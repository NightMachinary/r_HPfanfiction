Holy moly, that's complicated! I think I like it, though. The whole idea of being addicted to time-travelling is great, and your plot is definitely going the right way. The part where Hermione plans her relationship with Harry and Ron is great, shows how much she's caving in.

I think you need more settings than Hogwarts and Grimmauld Place, though. Maybe incorporate more of London?

Also, if you really want to further complicate things, add a new enemy, like a time-travel police force that ruthlessly squashes down any holes in time and any people who are playing too much with the fabric of time.
