The last day of school, Hermione is still worried out of her mind, when she receives a huge package at breakfast. She doesn't have time to open it, so she takes it onto the train. In the compartment she finally opens them, within are dozens of letters, one addressed to herself, the others simply with continuous numbers on them.

She opens the letter and sees that it's another letter from her future self, instructing her to give the remaining letters to Harry, without reading them. Both her and Harry are confused, but they know better than to question the ideas of their future selves, so they just go with it.

At the first day home, Hermione finds an identical package on her bed, together with one additional letter. In this letter her future self instructs her to not only continue reaching the original letter and time turner back through the chain, but this time to also travel back in time together with her owl to before breakfast, and send the package to herself using her owl, so that her version at hogwarts can receive this package from home. She is further instructed to from now on establish a second chain back in time, which makes sure that this package with the instruction-letter ends up sitting on her bed on the day she arrives from Hogwarts.

The reason become apparent sooner than later - Dumbledore invites Hermione into the Order of the Phoenix and instructs her to refrain from sending letters to Harry, isolating him completely. Hermione realizes that this would've been one of those events that could've possibly broken her friendship to Harry, who would've waited for letters all summer, receiving none without any explanation to why.

From this day on, Hermione writes one letter every day about the situation in the order, marking the letter with continuous numbers, and adding them to the package arriving from further on in the time-chain. Knowing that Harry has already received his letters for the holiday in the train compartment eases her worries.

Meanwhile Harry experiences one of the worst summers of his life, and only the letters of Hermione, who somehow went through the immense headache that is meddling with time just to deliver him some mail, keep him from going insane.

He writes letters to Hermione as well but refrains from sending them, now knowing that they would all never reach their destination on the orders of Dumbledore.

With nothing better to do, he writes these letters, discards them and writes them again, as they won't reach their destination for quite a while, he has all the time in the world when it comes to refine his normally less-than-stellar writing.

This however doesn't take up nearly as much time as he had hoped, and so he tries to continue his research on the whole time-travel-issue that Hermione is still doing, but since he doesn't have any magical books at hand, it mostly ends with either him reading muggle science fiction, or him fantasizing about sitting across Hermione in the Hogwarts library and somehow contributing to her far too difficult to understand loop and chain theories.

Hermione meanwhile is slowly becoming insane. Not only has she to upkeep two seperate time-chains, she also has to help with some order business, has to try to upkeep her friendship with Ron (who already has forgotten about the time turners apart from the times he wants to use it to take revenge on the twins) and prevent the rest of the order from finding out that she owns (and possibly stole for all she knows) a time turner. It doesn't help that the third month is rapidly approaching, and she still doesn't have a clue on what will cause the friendship between her and the others to end.

With Ron already being dealt with (since she can simply keep the friendship alive from her everyday dealing with him in the order) she focuses all her efforts and thoughts on Harry, whom she expects to lose first ("what if the letters weren't enough", etc.).

The holidays end, Harry arrives at the order headquarters, and Hermione is happy to see that their friendship isn't destroyed (it seems even stronger than before, she isn't sure about the reason for that however). Harry is happy to help her get back into the research, and even goes as far as to sometimes brush some stupid suggestions of Ron aside, which he normally would only be too happy to go along with. She doesn't know how rough the past few weeks really felt for Harry, and how much her letters meant to him.

Not until he gives her his own letters. As she reads the letters, she starts to realize that Harry might feel more for her than just friendship, the incredible effort (for Harry's standards) that were put into the letter being a big clue (from Hermione's perspective, she doesn't know that Harry just literally didn't have anything better to do). And as she reads and overanalyzes the letters, the solution to her problem flashes in her brain. The way to end a friendship without it hurting. The way forward.

She would advance their relationship, to break it off.

Of course, the quick idea doesn't mean she jumps to implement it immediatelly, as it definitely means reconsidering Harry from a perspective she never chose before, but she also doesn't disregard it completely.

Days pass, which Hermione now spends both researching and being distracted from researching by Harry sitting across from her, and the third month comes to an end - no time turner in sight.

Hermione still doesn't have the slightest clue on where to get a time turner, and while she thinks her advancing-the-relationship-idea of being the one her future self meant when writing the letter, she isn't too sure, as the month is almost over, and it seems impossible to change their relationship that quickly.

That's when she (for the first time in a long while) uses her intention to ask her future self to establish yet another chain (the letter-package-chain being completed by her writing the last letter the day before Harry arrived) to give her a hint towards how to get the time turner.

And when a letter really arrives, she is incredibly happy. Until she reads it.

"Hello younger me.

I see you are caving in under the pressure. The debt established, so big, no end in sight, no idea how to pay it off. How could I have done anything but ask for another loan, to help me with my struggle?

Do you remember the first letter? When I wrote that you would learn about the debt, but only understand it later?

I think the time is now, to reveal what I meant.

You failed.

You failed to pay off the debt in three months and you caved in. You paid the debt with borrowed time from your future selves, you handed forward a time turner that you didn't find, and together with it, a letter in which you warned your younger self about these mistakes you made, so that you wouldn't repeat them.

The time to write this letter is now.

Write it, tell your younger self how she has three months of time, how she has such a huge debt before her, and how she doesn't yet understand how hard it'll be to pay off that debt, no matter how many hours she will spend on researching and keeping her friendships together.

Hah, the friendships ending! I was a fool, almost destroying my friendship with Ron and Harry by keeping them out of it, not telling them, not sharing my secrets, if not for those words written down, it would surely have ended that way.

I know what you feel. Betrayed? Given a task impossible to complete? But betrayed by whom? It was yourself after all who burdened you with this task, and it is you who now burdens me for a second time.

Your friendship with Harry and Ron, they will not end, far from it, not if you keep up the work and effort you learned to give out during the last months. You have seen what they are willing to do for you, if you only return the effort they put into this friendship of yours.

Now trust them. Trust them to help you with your task, your debt, don't make the mistake of not trusting them a second time, or your friendship will break under this pressure just like you will break under the task ahead if you insist on walking alone.

You will find that the time turner is still there, next to your bed, that the chain isn't broken yet.

And this time.

This time you don't have three months.

But a whole year.

Use the time wisely."
