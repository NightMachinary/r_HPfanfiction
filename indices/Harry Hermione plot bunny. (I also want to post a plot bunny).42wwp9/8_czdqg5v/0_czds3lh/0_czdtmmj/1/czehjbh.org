Sounds very, very promising.

I imagine it would be very, very hard to write, though: planning multiple overlapping stable time loops may be easier for you than it would be for Hermione, but still...

Also, there was this bit:

#+begin_quote
  The reason become apparent sooner than later - Dumbledore invites Hermione into the Order of the Phoenix and instructs her to refrain from sending letters to Harry, isolating him completely.
#+end_quote

I don't know if you are conscious of this when you planned it, but I feel compelled to point out that the notion that Dumbledore forbid Ron and Hermione from communicating with Harry in the summer before OotP is very common and very bashy (and downright destructive to the fandom, IMO) fanon, which is explicitly contradicted by canon. Harry's friends wrote to Harry, and Harry wrote back. What /did/ frustrate Harry to no end was that their letters told him little about current events and OotP activities. This, while deeply unpleasant to Harry, was probably the right thing to do given the circumstances: it is a very bad idea to send actionable intelligence over an easily intercepted medium to someone with a mental link of then-unknown nature to the greatest Legilimens alive. (And, that the good guys knew about the link was, in and of itself, an important secret.)

With that out of the way, why /would/ Dumbledore induct Hermione into the Order all of a sudden? Hermione is very smart and capable, but she is, fundamentally, a fifth-year who is only somewhat ahead of the curriculum, but can't even use a wand outside of Hogwarts. What could she do for the order that would be worth the risks it would bring? Now, if he did come to know about her continuing time-turning adventures, he might have had a use for her: after two years of using a time-turner in complex and unsafe ways, she would probably have more experience messing with time than anyone alive.

That would be my suggestion: suppose that Dumbledore knows about her time problems and does what he can to help, but there is only so much he can do, especially because Hermione is already balancing on the edge of paradox at all times, and the more she tells others about the future, the greater the risk of tipping over. At the same time, Dumbledore occasionally asks her to mess with time for Order business. So now, that's another set of secrets she has to keep from Harry, which is going to strain their friendship.
