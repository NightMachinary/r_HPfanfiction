Criticism read and understood. Here an alternative, deviating after they stole the time turner from McGonegall's office:

--------------

Stealing the time-turner took a bit longer than anticipated, and Hermione and Harry are running out of time. It appears as if they won't have enough time to first rescue buckbeak and then Sirius, and they are getting desperate.\\
At this point Hermione remembers something seemingly unimportant: she once borrowed a book from the library that was already taken by someone else by simply remembering the instruction for her future self to borrow the book in the future and place it near her bed, exactly at this time where she wants to borrow it. As long as she hasn't experienced it yet, she could potentially force something to happen by simply creating the intention, as long as she remembers to set up the requirements for it to happen at a later point in time and as long as she closes the loop.

She convinces Harry to give up on rescuing buckbeak, instead they'll run near the place sirius is being kept. There they find buckbeak, unharmed. They climb onto buckbeak, rescue sirius and let him escape with buckbeak - now they have to close the loop.\\
They use the time turner, travel back a bit (as long as the not completely refilled turner allows at this point), rescue buckbeak and place him at the position where hermione intended to find him the first time in the loop: near sirius' cell.

This experience of actively being able to shape the future through the means of intention hit Hermione deeply, and she thinks of setting up various experiments with it - but sadly she won't be able to actually do them, as she has to return the time turner before McGonegall finds out.

Walking back to McGonegall's office, she realizes that McGonegall is in her office, searching her desk for the time turner. Hermione panicks, fearing that McGonegall finding out about her stealing the time turner would result in her expulsion. Just before McGonegall can open the drawer in which the time turner is supposed to lay, Hermione creates the intention to soon travel back in time using the time turner, and store it there before McGonegall can realize that it was gone.

The drawer is opened, and the turner is within, McGonegall non-the-wiser. Sadly this doesn't make the situation any easier for Hermione, as McGonegall mentions that the time turner will be returned to the department of mysteries, now that noone is actively using it.

Hermione, still somewhat addicted to the turner and now filled with the determination to experiment with the idea of intention and shaping the future, wants to prevent that from happening.

After leaving McGonegall's office, she again travels back in time, takes Harry's cloak, enters McGonegall's office and places the turner in the drawer.

Just as she's finished with that, McGonegall enters the office, and Hermione only barely manages to hide herself in a corner below the cloak. She sees herself standing in the door, McGonegall telling the story of how the time turner will be brought back into the department of mysteries, and sees herself leave. But McGonegall doesn't simply put the time turner back into the drawer, instead she puts the time turner into a special box, which she seal with an incredibly advanced spell, one that no simply alohomora could hope to open, as if expecting Hermione to actually try to steal the thing. Afterwards she leaves the office.

Hermione now has a problem, she has no idea how to open this box, nor does she have a time-turner to create the time to learn about the spell before the time-turner is removed from the castle.

Desperate, she tries the trick with the intention one more time - she wishes to find a working time turner and a book detailing the spell in a different drawer in McGonegall's office.

To her surprise the trick works - but not completely. The time turner looks a bit different than the one she had before, and instead of a book there is only a letter, addressed to herself.

She opens the letter and recognizes her own handwriting.

"Dear younger me.

The experiments are amazing, we can achieve so much more with this idea, can shape the future so much further than we could ever have imagined. But the time will come where you realize the true cost of it. For you, the time where you will learn about the cost is now, but you will only understand the cost much later.

Every intention, every wish you create, is a burden for your future self. Like a loan at a bank, it creates a debt, that creates relief for your current situation. But unlike a loan, you won't know the interest until you've paid it.

Take this time turner as an example. It's not the one from McGonegall's desk. We didn't manage to find the spell in time, I had to get creative, find a different solution, so I could close this loop. And maybe it's my fault that you don't really apprecicate how dangerous this little of yours is yet. You only see the result, the clue that not only your idea is working, but you can't see who the person is who sent it back.

You expect this all to work so easy, since the time turner can't go back further than 24 hours anyway. But you underestimate your own ingenuity, and at the same time you overestimate it. You added more layers to this than you could manage, you took more loans of the future than you could pay, and now I'm paying the price.

Three months. In three months you will write this letter. And you will stumble over the debts of your past and go so much deeper than you ever asked for.

Be afraid, be very afraid, because this addiction of ours will not only give but also cost you precious time. But most important of all, it might cost you your friendships to both Harry and Ron. Try to salvage what there is to salvage, and try to prevent the mistakes that I made, even though it's futile.

Because I know I tried."

Hermione is shocked over the contents of the letter, and leaves the office without even taking another look at the original time turner, she just puts on the new one and leaves.

What could this letter mean, what could go so wrong that she would work several months on rectifying a mistake she apparently made?

The longer she thinks about it, the better she starts to understand the problem: she now has a time turner she doesn't even know the origin of, but with the limit of 24 hours travel, she can only assume that she has to create a chain of intentions that connect her to her future self - meaning she has to intent to collect the time turner from her next-day-self for three whole months, while using the time to find out where she could possibly get one from, until her three months into the future self can close the loop by handing the letter and turner back through the chain.

What worries her even more though is that even with trying she apparently almost destroyed her friendships.

In the next months she spends half her time trying to find out where the time turner came from (her intentions of receiving a letter from a future self for possible hints don't work for some reason, she soon decides that this is probably to prevent creating even more time-debt) and the other half trying to spend more time with Harry and Ron.

Ron and her continue to bicker about every stupid little thing, but Harry she tells about the time turner (but not about the letter detailing that she might destroy their friendship). She feels guilty for not allowing Ron in on the secret, but justifies it by saying that she also wouldn't have told Harry about it if he hadn't known about time turners already.

Together they try to lift the secret of the origin of the time turner, with many obstacles happening along the way. During their time researching together, Hermione notices that her friendship with Ron already started to deterriorate, because he senses that his other two friends are keeping secrets from him. Worried, she decreases the amount of time spent on research, so she can spent more time together with both of them, something Harry appreciates. But eventually even that is not enough, and Ron confronts her and Harry about their behaviour, and she confesses of owning a time turner. Ron is angry about being kept in the dark and being considered 'untrustworthy' (he assumes she didn't tell him because he would tell everyone about her secret), while she is afraid of him forcing her to overuse the turner even more (e.g. getting the test results before the test is written, so Ron can slack off, something that would theoretically be possible, but would make her chain of transporting the letter and time turner into the past even more complicated).

Harry defends her by saying that he also didn't know about it until he had to safe Sirius, and that he only kept the secret because he wanted to pay her back for helping him out.

Ron is angry, but ultimatively forgives them both in exchange for using the turner from time to time to turn a prank of Fred and George back on them.

The end of the year is getting close, and the chain into the future reaches way into the holidays, and Hermione is getting afraid, because her friendship with Ron and Harry is stronger than ever. The idea of losing them both is driving her insane, she has nightmares about driving them away almost every night.
