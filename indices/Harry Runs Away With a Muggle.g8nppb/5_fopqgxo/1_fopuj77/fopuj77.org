I mean, it pretty much turns into a complete au, with pretty much all hp characters other than harry himself being side characters at best, and harry going by a different name entirely, but Miranda Flairgold's Akren series starting with A Second Chance At Life is a pretty good read, even if the series is abandoned at this point. It goes into elaborate detail about blood magic and also goes into detail about necromancy, soul, thread, and stone magic, to name a few.
