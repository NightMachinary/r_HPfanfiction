I like a lot of that, although the fact that Dumbledore was able to kill a powerful dark lord with the elder wand terrorizing all of Europe on his own tells me that he was at the time probably one of the most powerful wizards in the entire world and probably hasn't slipped that much with the wand and wizard aging, so I wouldn't really buy many stronger wizards than him.
