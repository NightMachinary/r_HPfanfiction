In real life we find that by crossing relatively small distances like the borders of countries we could almost believe that we are in a completely different world. North Korea and south Korea are geographically very close but the people their would find it very hard to relate to each other due to the extreme difference in culture and exposure to the world and that's just a few generations worth of social blackout so imagine how much more different the wizarding world would be with the presence of magic? how easy production and manufacture of materials leads to lack of trade contact? how extreme longevity leads to very orthodox and conservative beliefs ? I believe that this would lead to very extreme forms of isolation with different the wizarding communities being very different form each other. In my head canon I consider the European wizarding world to be almost completely isolated from the other nations so they didn't feel the need to involve themselves. I haven't watched the fantastic beasts series so I have no idea how this ties up with the whole magical USA in it.
