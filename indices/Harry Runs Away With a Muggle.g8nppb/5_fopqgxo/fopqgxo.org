something that isn't explored in canon but I dearly wish to see in this story or stories in general is alternative magic. All over the world there exist different types of magic.

I always imagine the best place to put such a running away scene is just after the third book where the time turner thing does not happen and Sirius is killed escaping or by dementors but the ministry covers it up and Buckbeak is also killed. I feel that any later in the books and harry gets too invested in defeating Voldemort, protecting his friends, avenging his parent etc to truly cut himself away. In the first and second books harry is not specifically targeted by Voldemort, except for the broom thing in the first book, mostly its harry taking it upon himself to stop Voldemort or stumbling( or is it led in the case of bad Dumbledore) but its the fourth book onward that harry and Voldemort really have direct conflict with the death of Cedric and his torture at the graveyard. Also other that the muggle baiting at the quidditch world cup there is no evidence of the death eaters joining together for anything. without support of his friends, thinking the wizarding world is irredeemable and convinced by his muggle friend to see the world, they have their version of a world tour. the see the good parts of the world, the bad parts , they see opulence , poverty , they see different types of magic from druids to shaman to Hindu sages, harry learns a lot, his horcrux is removed by one of the characters he meets, or a ritual he takes part.

I would especially love if he finds out there exist a whole world outside the British magical world with more stronger wizards that just Dumbledore and Voldemort etc
