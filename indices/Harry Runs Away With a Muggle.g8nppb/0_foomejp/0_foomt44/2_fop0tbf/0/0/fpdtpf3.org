You have to be careful about that last part, then you fall in the Madara Situation that we had in Naruto. Madara Uchiha was soooo Powerful that even the Main Character with a debateably cheep power up and his Rival who had his OWN debateably cheep power ups were unable to match him. This lead to Madara being forced off stage left by a even bigger Villain and Naruto and Sasuke receiving even bigger Power ups and a dumb win Condition.

Your Villain even Riddle needs to seem possible, both to achieve his ability and combat it.
