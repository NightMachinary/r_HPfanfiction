True, but then again that was main problem with Naruto - Kishimoto took something that could have been beautiful and reduced it to a mindless slugfest with occasional fanservice. With TTGL it was at least fun...

Main approach to a godlike villain is to come at the problem sideways - in fact, I'd love a story where Voldemort won, but got buggered anyway because of some miscalculation rather than heroes doing anything. It can be luck, it can be alien logic, it can be simply leaving - and preventing the antagonist from following, it can be antagonist no longer including the protag's doom amongst their goals... And given that canon Riddle spent at least a decade traveling around the world to collect obscure pieces of magic, pretty much any power-up for him is plausible with sufficient build up.

Applying the same to a boy-hero who didn't have the chance to discover them... less so. Which is why it would not feature in my approach if I was writing the story in question.
