Well the question becomes does she know? And does he have too

Who's to say Harry has to stop, with the Motorcycle, Apparition and everything he can do hit and runs on death eaters, he can also be chased by Death Eaters.

As for Audrey it could be a "We always dreamed of it, you got to get us out of hear Harry" Harry through EVERYTHING he's been through and all the pain would be easily pulled away, all he's ever wanted was to escape the hell that is Little Whinging and then he did and it was only a little bit better because he still has to deal with the same shit from the Wizarding World.
