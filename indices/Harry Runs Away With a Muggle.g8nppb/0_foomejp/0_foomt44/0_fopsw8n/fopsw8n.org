Days passed and it appeared like the light at the end of the tunnel was taking its sweet time getting there. Even if its source was a speeding train, harry and Audrey would be more than happy to meet it - as it was, the little, flickering orb of illumination was what kept them fighting. It kept them waking up, day after day and somehow igniting that spark of enthusiasm "Today will be better!".

As children, it was easy to convince themselves. But now, in the middle of the summer and all alone in the world and at the same time surrounded by a jeering crowd... It was harder to keep the belief alive.

"Let's run away!" Harry didn't remember who said it first. It was supposed to be a joke, something to lighten the mood. It was something that made them laugh, provided a momentary distraction from the weight of the world bearing down on them.

"But how'd we do that?" is what followed, some time later. It was not a serious thought, not then. But still, they were children, they were curious. Following days and weeks and months would see them spend many hours in the library, researching every topic they thught would prove useful - be it wildernes survival, languages, camping or basket weaving. In the brightly lit room, with fellow readers acting respectfully neutral if not friendly, hidden from the glares by tall rows of bookshelves they could almost feel somewhat normal.

The library had become a Safe Place. Escape planning became their favorite game. Swapping ideas, learning new things neither of them would have imagined, seeing the world, if only by proxy... It was incredibly freeing, in a way nothing else was.

"Let's escape!" became less of a joke, and more their greetings. A shared secret, a reminder of good times when things got tough. It was not much, but it was theirs, and theirs alone. No one could take it away from them. No one even suspected. This little phrase, this three short words "Let us escape!", had reignited their hope. With their backs against the wall, they have dug their own tunnel out, and the light at the end had never looked so apealing.

"Let's escape!" for the first time it has failed to bring smiles to their faces. Hers was still red and stained with tears. His, thoughtful. He'd just returned after *insert painful/traumatic/dangerous event Audrey would fear for his life over*

They had actually considered following through with their escape many times, but dismissed the thought, eventually. Now they were truly thinking of it. Plans were reviewed, discarded and remade. Supplies were checked. Harry was still not sure about it - he'd be leaving some people behind. They were not like her, but they were friends still and precious to him and they couldn't leave too, could they? Audrey had an answer ready.

"Why couldn't they?" she asked.

"What?"

"Harry, they have their parents, they have other friends, associates... They started with more than we did. So if we, on our own, could plan our escape... Why couldn't they?" she said, almost asking "We're just kids and we managed. Why can't they?"

"..." Harry had no answer, because it made sense. It would be a different thing to fight for the lives of his friends, but to risk his life for the plentiful strangers who'd ignored him in his time of need? Fight not to protect lives, but their comfort of living? No, that was not something he wanted to do, he concluded. And it's not like moving a house was particularly difficult even without magic. With it, it was a work of hours, even if one wished to take the whole building. No, Harry decided. He'd saved others several times already. It was time to save himself. With a lighter heart he hugged his best friend and got to work. Plans wouldn't correct themselves, alter all.

*/AU suggestions:*(Diminished Golden Trio - Harry has BFF spot filled up, so they are still friends, but in a more normal fashion.; alternative resolutions to First and Third books. Second gets a pass due to friend invlovement; less receptive to Dumbledore - not bashing, but understandably a bit cooler, because Dumbledore is an adult in position of authority, somewhat involved in his life, and as such starts at 0 trust and has to earn some.)//Those are only suggestions. BTW, I'd love to read any drafts you have, if you're inclined to share.

*Note:* I didn't put in much dialogue, because I do not know much about how you imagine Audrey - so I'd be shoooting blind here.
