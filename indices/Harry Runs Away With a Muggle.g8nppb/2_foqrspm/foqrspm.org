Her nerves were lit up in excitement. She was giddy and nervous at the same time. She was suppressing the smile, a habit that had been ingrained in her being since a child. The smile struggled to stay off her face, a corner of her lip seemed to always twitch upwards.

"Am I finally meeting your friends? The ones from your magician school?" Olivia asked as she tipped forward on her toes. She tucked a wavy strain of dirty blond hair behind her ear as she watched Harry strap their luggage into the side compartment.

"Technically it's a wizard school, and be careful when you say that. You aren't supposed to know." Harry glanced at her through his bent frames.

"I'm not supposed to know about my father's affair with his dentist either but here we are," she mentioned nonchalantly. She looked over the motorcycle once again, "You said this thing can fly? How?"

"Uh, magic?"

"Well, I know that. Do you know the theory behind it? How can magic just defy physics?"

Harry stood up, "I think Hermione is the one you want to talk to about that." He then swung a leg over the seat and sat down. Olivia quickly hopped on after him and wrapped her arms around his waist.

"Ready?"

"More than ready."

Then they were gone. Down the street and along a maze of twists and turns. On and off interstates and one-way roads. The past dog walkers, crying babies in strollers, and a group of mother power walking with brightly colored headbands. They stopped to get gas in Wembley. Olivia had grabbed some snacks and drinks, and they enjoyed them in the parking lot before hopping back onto the road. They hopped on to the M1, following the traffic until they ended up at the meeting point in Sheffield.

Hermione was waiting for them on a bench at Endcliffe Park. She had a half-read book in her hand and her hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. Once she heard the rumbling of the motorcycle the book closed and a smile spread across her face.

"You must be Olivia," She greeted with an outstretched hand. Olivia shook it quickly while Harry checked over the luggage.

"Hermione?" She guessed.

"Yes and that's Ron," she pointed over the girl's shoulder to a tall lanky boy crossing the street with a wrapped sandwich.

"Do you have the documents?" Harry asked Hermione once Ron met up with them.

"Yes," with that she passed over two thick documents. One with the name Harry Gagnon and the other with Olivia Roy. Inside were documents that could pass any inspection with their new names. A gift from the twins and to them, one of their greatest pranks yet.

"Car?" Olivia asked.

Ron tilted his head towards a black Ford. "Right there, under Harry's new name. Had to use some polyjuice to get it."

When Harry grabbed the keys he passed Sirius's communication mirror over. "We'll call you when we land. Make sure no one knows you have this."

"We know," Ron grumbled at being reminded again. He had heard the plan several times. They switched vehicles at this spot so Sirius's motorcycle couldn't be used to track them down. Olivia and Harry would board a plane and leave for North America. Harry was going to complete his education at a small magical school he found and Olivia was going to finish her muggle studies. The fewer details they had the better.

They wouldn't be separated forever. Ron, Hermione, and Neville planned to move with them after they graduated Hogwarts. For now, they had to make sure to foil and attempt to find the couple.

"Be safe," Hermione sniffled as she drew Harry into a tight hug. Ron waited until she pulled back to encase Harry it a spine breaking embrace.

"Take care, mate," He spoke in a strained voice. "Remember, mirror call once a week." Ron frowned at his tone, it sounded a lot like his mother's. Harry laughed.

"Of course, we can teach each other the different spells we learn. Give Snape hell for me?"

"I would be honored." The two started to laugh, Hermione sighed but gave them a smile.

With that, Harry checked the motorbike over once again, making sure to grab the charm that Sirius had wrapped around the left handle before getting into the car and leaving with a wave.

"Ready for Canada?" Olivia asked while she inspected the plane tickets.

"Of course, anyone who hates your parents as much as we do is a winner in my book," Harry smiled referring to the estranged relatives that they were heading towards. No one would look there. Why would Harry move to Canada to live with strangers? If you asked Olivia's family, they would explain that there was no way she knew they existed. They had never spoken of that part of the family let alone communicated with them.

"I can't wait to see a moose in person. I heard they're bigger in real life."
