Dumbledore comes across as this forgiving type, with his chances for such people like Snape and Hagrid, so maybe that's why fans write him like that. To me it somehow seems exactly what I'd have expected. I mean, I'm not even surprised they write him this way. But then again, in OOTP he says Voldemort's death would not satisfy him or something along these lines. When Harry says in HBP he wants to be the one to kill Voldemort and take as many death eaters with him, Dumbledore is happy about this. Even if this is more about the fact that Harry realised he would fight Voldemort of his own free will, you'd think he would give a long speech about forgiveness if he was strictly against lethal force. Harry pretty much says,' I'm going to kill those bastards' and Dumbledore is all for it. So in reality I don't think he is as gentle as people want to make him. I mean, that sort of forgiveness comes across as being naive in Dumbledore's case. He's old enough to know that during war you don't get to be nice. And after all, forgiveness and not killing is Harry's signature so it would be rude to take it away from him.
