The closest we get to canon evidence for this is this passage during the DoM fight:

#+begin_quote
  “You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. “Above such brutality, are you?”

  “We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. “Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit ---” (OotP, Chapter 36)
#+end_quote

However, I think this is a very special case, given that Voldemort had several Horcruxes at the time (which Dumbledore knew) and was therefore functionally immortal no matter what Dumbledore did, and shouldn't be taken to indicate that Dumbledore was always against lethal force.
