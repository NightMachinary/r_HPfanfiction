I always got the impression the revival was sort of an educated guess. Like the information he had from his books and had gleaned from his investigation into Voldemort (after he found out about Horcruces in Harry's second year) made him think it was possible, and he couldn't find anything else so he just pinned his hopes on that because Harry had to die regardless of anything else.
