With regards to the Death Eaters captured during the fifth book, Dumbledore didn't know that he'd be cursed some months later, and had he killed them without a trial, there's a risk that he might set their own efforts back considerably.

Not to mention that we don't really know what the Wizengamot considers to be an appropriate punishment, at least for purebloods with considerable connections.
