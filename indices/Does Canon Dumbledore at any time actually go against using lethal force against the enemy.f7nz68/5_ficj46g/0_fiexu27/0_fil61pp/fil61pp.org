Three reasons I don't think this counts as a counter argument:

1. Dumbledore was dead at this point.
2. This was a mixture of Lupin going overprotective and captain hindsight. If Harry wasn't discovered, they wouldn't care if he spent the whole escape giving an Expelliarmus laser light show synchronized to ACDC's Back in Black.
3. Because you can be damn sure people would be looking at him funny if he raked up the most impressive kill count ever during the escape.

I'm not saying yes or no. I just think that using this counter-argument is spurious.
