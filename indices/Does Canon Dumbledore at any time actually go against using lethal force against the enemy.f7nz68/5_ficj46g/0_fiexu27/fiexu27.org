I think categorizing the Order as mostly using stunning spells isn't exactly fair. Remember how mad Lupin was DH for Harry just using expelliarmus? He says you have to at least stun if you're not ready for more. I think the adult members of the order were more than ready to kill if need be, though they obviously weren't just tossing around avada kedavra. Dumbledore does capture a bunch of death eaters in the ministry battle, as opposed to killing, but it's shown how absolutely easy it is for him to beat them, it's pretty reasonable he wouldn't just go for the slaughter. He's still dealing with a ministry that will lock up the death eaters like Lucius, now that Voldemort's return is acknowledge, plus he doesn't know a countdown clock is going to start on his life in a month or two.
