Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - It does have Harry, who is still a wizard, goes to camp. Though that isn't the main focus but this story is amazingly good.

A Potter in America - linkffn(11576439) - Has Harry becoming a teacher at camp half-blood.

Home is Where the Hearth is - linkffn(12791536) - Another good story about a wizard Harry going to camp half-blood.

These are the best ones that I remember and know.
