One story that strikes me off the top of my head that's close to what you're looking for is CanonShipper's /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2435105/1/Secrets][Secrets]]/ | linkffn(2435105) . In that story, Harry and Hermione have been a couple for two years, but Hermione's never really quite been into Harry. She's actually attracted to Ron and the story begins with Hermione going behind Harry's back to begin an affair with Ron.
