  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

      Warnings:  Super strong language, graphic sex scenes, a few scary situationsContent/Enticements:  8th year \+\. Side pairings: Hermione/Millicent; Ron/Lavender\. Questionable career choices, fantasy Quidditch, apprenticeships, bromance, Alchemy, Animagi, pining, a snarky portrait, boggarts, and Harry as a hot mess\. There is a surplus of cats in this story\. It wasn’t planned, but when are cats ever?Author's Notes:  Dear Isinuyasha: You said ‘chemistry’ and I ran with it\. I hope you like this take on what I’m sure was meant to be a throwaway comment\.
