Harry becomes a master in Transfiguration in this fic. The subject is expanded significantly, and he is mentored by Flitwick. I know it says it's fifth in the series, but don't pay attention to that, it's not really.

The series is quite readable and does some really interesting world building and expansion of the magic system, but I feel obligated to give a few warnings about it. First, it is a Harry/Ron fic, so if you are bothered by slash in general or Harry/Ron specifically, it is probably not for you. It also has Sirius/Remus, which I am not a fan of, but it's a background pairing, so whatever. It's not a romance story, but the romance is a significant subplot. This is also an AU. Harry is a Slytherin, Sirius lives, and a few other changes. There is also a fair amount of sexism in this. It is debatable whether this was intentional and meant to be Harry being an unreliable narrator, or whether it's the author's biases slipping in. She has other fics that don't seem to have the same sort of sexism. Personally I think it was intentional, but it could have been done much better and I don't really see the point in making Harry a misogynist anyway. And lastly, Christianity features in the later stories. It is not presented negatively or positively, in my opinion, but it is there and unavoidable.

I know that is a lot of disclaimers, but I didn't want to send anybody into the fic unprepared.
