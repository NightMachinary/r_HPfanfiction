Even though the main character is not Harry but Ron instead, it features intelligent Slytherin morally-grey (as in not caring about love and compassion to enemy) Ron who decides to pick up the slack after having a vision of the future of Fred dying.

Even though he is very powerful for his age, doesn't go too far as to make him as powerful as Dumbledore or adult Aurors. And most importantly, no bashing! (Atleast, no more in later chapters)
