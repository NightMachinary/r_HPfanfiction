I loved [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29310402][A horse with no name]]. No smut. It totally surprised me at every turn but the reread showed me the foreshadowing pieces. The author's Pandemic series overall is full of surprises and plot twists but written really, really well. If you are ok with slash I definitely rec the main story. Some amazing world building there.
