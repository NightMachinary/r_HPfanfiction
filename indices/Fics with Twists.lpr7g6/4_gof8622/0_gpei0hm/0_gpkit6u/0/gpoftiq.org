Indeed. Always nice to read a good semi-gen fic. :)

I took a flick through your first chapter and I'm definitely bumping it up the to-read list. Good characterisation, some interesting events, and some fun writing! A thoroughly excellent start :). Literally the only note I had is my personal dislike of onomatopoeic inserts like 'CRRRACCCCKKKKKK', but that really is just a personal nitpick. :)
