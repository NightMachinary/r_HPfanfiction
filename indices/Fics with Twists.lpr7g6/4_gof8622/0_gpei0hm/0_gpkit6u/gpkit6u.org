Awww well thank you! It is definitely a dark murder mystery story at heart :)

I totally get that! I am aro and one of my good friends (who has been reading my fic) is ace! I totally zone out for romance and don't get it. So I decided my fic wasn't going to dwell on it. I totally made Charlie aroace even. Anyhow, if you do end up checking it out I think the racey scenes are in Chapters 43, 60, the very end of 69, and the very end of 88.

A-spec unite lol
