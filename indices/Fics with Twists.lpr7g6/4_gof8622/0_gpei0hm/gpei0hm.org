Ooooh, interesting! For a fandom based entirely on kid-mystery stories, there certainly haven't been that many mystery fics that I've seen, so you're already a step-up there. :)

I don't mind seeing racy scenes, just reading them when I don't have to. I'm ace, so racy scenes are about as interesting to me as football (soccer) - and I fell asleep at the last match I went to. :D
