Voldemort was after Harry in particular and that wasn't a secret to anyone. The Weasleys and the Lupins were pretty much left alone when they did not find them harboring Harry. The Tonkses are tortured because they had seen Harry a few nights before flying to their house but they aren't killed when it's discovered they don't know about Harry's whereabouts. Just like no guest from Fleur and Bill's wedding is killed. But most of the significant deaths in the series occurred because people got in the way between Voldemort and Harry: his parents, Cedric, Sirius, Moody all those people who fought the Battle of Hogwarts only to give Harry time, despite being way fewer than Voldemort's forces. Dumbledore is the only other person that had a target on his back regardless of his relationship to Harry. So I think the fact that there were so many people who might not have had a great fate in Voldemort's, dystopia could have still survived, yet they were killed because they came in between him and Harry, gives Harry the right to think like that.
