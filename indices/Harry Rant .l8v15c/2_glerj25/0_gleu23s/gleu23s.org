I think there's a bit of arrogance in Harry's statement of "I don't want anyone else to fight and for *for me*". Like yeah, you're 'The Chosen One' and people have chosen you to be the figure head for this fight, but a lot of these people would be here even if there wasn't a prophecy, because Voldemort is a genocidal bigot who needs to be stopped.
