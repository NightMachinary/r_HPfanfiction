Of Course I Understand The Position Voldemort And The Prophecy Put Him In Specifically. What I Don't Understand Is Why It Seems That He Doesn't See That Others Have Been Affected Also. I Know That He's The Main Character So Of Course Everything About Him Will Be Put In The Spotlight By The Author And Also By The Wizarding Media. It Just Seems Odd To Me That He Places So Much Pressure Onto Himself Even Before Learning About The Prophecy.
