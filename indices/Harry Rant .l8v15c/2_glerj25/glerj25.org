To answer your question: Probably not, but it's pretty absurd to be annoyed when Voldemort himself made the whole thing about Harry.

"Don't these people realize what you've been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort movement?" - Hestia to Harry in DH

"Now that Dumbledore is dead you - the Boy Who Lived - were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting you had a hand in the old hero's death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you." - Remus to Harry in DH

"And the fact that you crouched and snivelled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!" - Voldemort to Harry in DH

There's more like Dumbledore telling Remus and Kingsley Harry was their best hope, "he's after a weapon to destroy you," and Voldemort spending two books looking for a wand to best Harry's, but I think you get the gist.
