People seem to really enjoy it. I myself have never read it and probably never will. But it keeps getting recommended to me. I've skimmed it and from what I can tell the author's technique gets better. That being said, the moment I saw Daphne as a character; I ran. So I can't comment on the plot or character arcs. But yeah, it's probably a solid 8/10. 🤷🏾‍♀️
