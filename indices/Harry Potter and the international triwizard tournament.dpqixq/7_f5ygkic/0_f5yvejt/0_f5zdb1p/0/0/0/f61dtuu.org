Heh, it was beta'd.... lol. First task was supposed to be anticlimatic, the focus wasn't on the task itself, more everything around it. I didn't wnat it to be like the Second Task, where the task is a major focus of the plot, showcasing Harry's development.\\
Not everyone is going to love every part of the fic, even if they like the fic. Thanks for reading.
