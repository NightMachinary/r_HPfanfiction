While I haven't specifically read what DLP has said I'd imagine given the first few chapters were a generally not that good, I'd imagine they didn't keep pace into the newer content. Many say after chapter 7 it picks up but that's rather subjective.

It's there, read it, or don't. It will be there either way.
