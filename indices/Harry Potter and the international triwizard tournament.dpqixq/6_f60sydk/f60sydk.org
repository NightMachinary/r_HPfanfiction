Definitely worth reading.\\
For me I especially like how close to my own head-canon the magic system is portrayed. Although Some things differ a lot.\\
Something I don't like is how Dumbledore is acting. Too much "My boy" and clumsy manipulation attempts. That might be an act though so i hold on to hope.
