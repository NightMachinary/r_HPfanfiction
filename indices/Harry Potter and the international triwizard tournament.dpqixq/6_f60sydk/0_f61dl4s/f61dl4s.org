There's only been two Dumbledore scenes. I enjoy writing it more where things are more subtle than overt. There has been quite a few reviews with different takes on the most recent one. Dumbledore is smart, scarily so. Smart doesn't mean he doesn't have blindspots. Keep that in mind, it's only two scenes and my comment. There will be some added context with the next Harry, Sirius and Remus scene too.

Either way, glad you've enjoyed the fic so far.
