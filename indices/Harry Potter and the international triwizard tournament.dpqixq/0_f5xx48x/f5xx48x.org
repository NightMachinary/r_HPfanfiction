It's absolutely amazing. I would recc it every time, 100%.

It's steadily updated. The author engages with his fanbase to a high degree. The last few chapters were fillers mostly and just world building, but it has a good pace for a fanfic of that scope. It's probably one of the best fanfics out there that is live.
