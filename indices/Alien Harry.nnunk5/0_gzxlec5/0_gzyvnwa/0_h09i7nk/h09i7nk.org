Kryptonian: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2030536][The Harry of El Series]] Four novels and a short story collection so far.

Asgardian: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17926664/chapters/42330374][On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads]] Harry finds out he's the son of Loki. See title for response.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1014440/chapters/2014467][Child of the Storm]]

Tamaranian: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12590405/1/Per-Volar-Su-Nata][Per Volar Su Nata]]

Vitrumite: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11779002/1/][Invincible]] Great, but probably abandoned.

Saiyan: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13571575/1/Super-Saiyan-Wizard][Super Saiyan Wizard]] Sort of. HP is the son of James and Amelia Potter (nee Bones). Gohan is the son of Lily and Goku.

Harry Potter The Saiyan Wizard by spartankiller117 on ffn. Writing is a bit rough, but the story is pretty entertaining. Son Harry is blood adopted by Goku after an injury and winds up half Saiyan and half something else. Borderline rule 8 if direct linked.
