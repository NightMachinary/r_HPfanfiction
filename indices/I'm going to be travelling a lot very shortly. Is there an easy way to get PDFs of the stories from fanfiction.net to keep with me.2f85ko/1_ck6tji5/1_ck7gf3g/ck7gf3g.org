Does that actually work in any reasonable amount of time for you? I tried it, but it took about a minute per chapter for me. If I want to update, say, /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/, it takes me so long it's not worth bothering with. In that time, I could pretty much download it manually and massage it into an epub by hand.
