For mobile devices (Android anyways, not sure about other platforms), I use an app called ReadUp. Lets you download the stories for offline reading and keeps track of your progress in each story. Also lets you check for updates for all your stories at the same time. I'm a little choked with the developers since they kind of screwed over anyone who bought their old app, but its still a wicked program.
