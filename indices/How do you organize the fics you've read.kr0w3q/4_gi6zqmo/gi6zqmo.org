I download all the fics I am interested in into a fic download folder. If they are complete the filename is just the fic name and once I've read them they get moved to a fic complete folder. If the fic is a WIP then the filename includes the number of chapters and the date the fic was last updated. Once read the fic goes to one of two folders. If it has been more than 2 years since the last update the fic gets moved to a Partial Abandoned folder. If the Fic has been updated within the last two years it gets moved to the Partial Updateable folder.

Abandoned fics get checked for an update once a year (during the height of Covid-19 I did an additional check and had 5 fics that got updated). The Updateable fics get checked for updates roughly every 2 months (sometimes more frequently).

I use the app Docsearch+ to index and search all the fics. It works pretty well if you have some good search terms based on a scene that stands out. E.g "time travel" returns 374 fics. "Time travel harry teddy"~20 (those 4 words within 20 words of each other) returns 4 fics with one of them being a recommendation for a fic (for a search i did for a harry/teddy time travel post)).
