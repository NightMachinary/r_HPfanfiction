I have four top-level folders: 'Currently Reading', 'Awaiting New Chapters', 'Read', and 'Archived'.

Currently Reading has two subfolders - new, and rereading.

Awaiting New Chapters is just one folder with a long list of fics bookmarked to the last chapter I've read. Things stay in there until they're complete, then I delete 'em.

Read has five subfolders - To-Calibre (when I've decided I like a fic enough to bother bookmarking it, a bookmark of the first chapter goes in here and I fanficfare it, even if I'm not done reading it yet), Non-Calibre (anything from a site that Fanficfare doesn't recognise or in a format that doesn't download), Lists for Later (any time I find a good thread, search parameter, or post on something with a list of fics I might wanna revisit, I bookmark it here), Non-working Links to find other copies of (does what it says on the tin), and Finished (where I put the bookmarks once I've calibre'ed 'em).

When they're in Finished, they get put into a folder with a short code to represent the fandom (Harry Potter is HP, Life is Strange is LiS, Pitch Perfect is PP, etc) and a tiny snippet definition to sort them by. That snippet is what I regard as the primary 'thing' for that collection of fics - eg. I have 'cowboy Harry', 'Harry/Fleur with Sap', 'Harry/Fleur with Drama', 'Specialist Misanthropic Harry with a Cause', 'Harry is an angsty crankypants', etc. I have a hundred or so of those. Some have two fics in, others have more.

Archived is just a big list of bookmarks from my old collection that I haven't gotten around to resorting yet. They're all calibre'ed, I just can't remember what the hell any of them are, so I'm slowly working my way through 'til I can get 'em all sorted.
