Well I thought I'd only had three reviews this year, but on looking I've actually had about seven of which one was possibly the worst, most crushing review I've had. But this one was the best of the year and made my day.

  Hey, I just finished reading your story. I liked Sirius ever since I read the third Harry-Potter-book for the very first time, but I guess I was just too young to realise his strong and interesting character the way I do today. When I saw Gary Oldman on screen as Sirius Black, I was somehow disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I really like Oldman as an actor, but ... well ... not in this particular role. I always thought that Sirius' appearance would somehow match Jack Sparrow and Oldman was just not mysterious enough ;-) Anyway, I was pleased to find a story that deals with the older and much darker Sirius that suffered those years in Azcaban and tries to find his way back to life. Julia is a lovely person and I liked the development of their relationship. I was also impressed by the complexity of the story you built around them. But I have to admit, that I silently begged for you not to follow the destiny which hunts Sirius in the books. Therefore, it was quite hard to read through the last chapters and I felt like crying when Dumbledore was forced to take Julia's memories of Sirius from her. But, never the less, I liked your story, your characters and your way of writing a lot! Thanks for sharing this and have a nice day!
