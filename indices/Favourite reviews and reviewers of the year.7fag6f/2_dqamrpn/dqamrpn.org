I wrote two one-shots so far, both marked as complete. And yet I got a ton of "a great start"/"waiting for the next chapter" reviews. I guess it is due to the fact that both are snippets and with an open ending but still, it is marked complete for a reason. One is 9k words long and a complete arc for fuck's sake. I started writing the second chapter for one of them but things are going slowly because I fail to capture the same "spirit" of lightheartedness since I never expected to continue that particular plot and had to scrap a couple drafts.
