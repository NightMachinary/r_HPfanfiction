This has actually been a year for some really wonderful reviews from generous readers, all for the same many-years-old story. It's the only fic I've ever written that's even moderately popular, and people seemed to stumble across it for some reason this year.

One reviewer said she'd read the story three times since I first posted it. She'd just spent several weeks watching a relative die and had come home from the memorial service and read it again, and it helped provide a degree of catharsis for her. There's something special about touching a reader in a way that genuinely affects their lives, and it was very kind of her to open a comment box and share that with me.
