I will give you a story that I think is just a beautiful story about the marauders and co and I just love James character in it. But it is not just focused on him, but all those characters

linkffn(Dirty Blood)

​

The next one is a story about James in Hufflepuff and how that would have suited him well.

linkffn(The Vegan Cupcake)

​

And a last one you can happily ignore because this is shameless self-promotion. It is a story I wrote about James and how he slowly fell in love with Lily. linkffn(The Best by Schak)
