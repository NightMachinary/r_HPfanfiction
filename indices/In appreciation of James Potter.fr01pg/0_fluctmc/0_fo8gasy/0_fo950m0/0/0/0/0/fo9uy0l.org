According to Snape-stans, Snape does all the shit he does because :

- he's poor,
- "abused" by his father (even though all we see is his father yelling at him),
- "groomed" into it by Malfoy (one pat on the back after Snape is sorted into Slytherin means being groomed according to these people),
- "bullied" by James, (even though Lupin clearly says Snape missed no chances to curse James back, not to mention Sectumsempra),
- calls muggleborns mudbloods because it was apparently acceptable to call them that (because Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black used to call them that, about a hundred years before Snape was born).

They go to any lengths to excuse Snape's behaviour. Everything he does is someone else's fault, never his own.

They are some of the most delusional people I've ever seen. They also claim that Snape is a fantastic teacher (lol), and that his punishments are "very kind". In their madness, they think the Cruciatus Curse is painless.

But being a "bully", hooo, that's worse than Voldemort, yessir. /s
