Yes. Pretend I'm saying the stuff down below in a babyish voice.

"Snape picked on Hermione in 4th year because his Dark Mark was darkening, therefore Snape knew that Voldemort would be returning, and so picking on teenage muggleborn girls in front of the Death Eaters' children was vital in letting Voldemort know he was loyal to Voldemort!"

"Snape didn't commit any crime between 1978 and 1980 as a Death Eater. Snape just sat on his ass and twiddled his thumbs, and Voldemort and the other Death Eaters were 9000% okay with that!"

"But Snape asking for more leniency and clemency for school students when they were tortured with the Cruciatus Curse - ooh nooo, Voldemort and the other Death Eaters would NOT have been okay with that!"

Those three users are disgusting.
