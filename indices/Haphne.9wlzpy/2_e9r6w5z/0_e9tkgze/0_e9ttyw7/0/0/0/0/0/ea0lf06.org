Do you have any recommendations for a smart talented Harry? I don't mean an overpowered one, I mean one that is confident and is talented with magic. After reading a couple of fanfics I really came to hate what Rowling did with Harry in canon. Ron was a huge bad influence on him, taking divination as elective and not taking his studies seriously when he knew a Dark Lord was after him.
