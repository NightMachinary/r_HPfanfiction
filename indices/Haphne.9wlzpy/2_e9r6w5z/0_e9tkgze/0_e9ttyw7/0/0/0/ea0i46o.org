I have to thank you. The legacy was amazing. A shame the story is dropped and the author acts like a jerk. But he is right, he/she owes us nothing. I wish the best for the author.

Harry and Daphne were injured, but nothing lasting and irreparable. I hope that when the story is finished, perhaps by 2020 (being really optimist here), it keeps that way. A happy ending is needed there. They do have a beautiful romance and the author wrote chapter 80 beautifully.

I don't really want to start the mind arts, I want it to be more complete, 23 chapters is too little for my liking. But seeing how good the legacy as your recommendation was I might give in.
