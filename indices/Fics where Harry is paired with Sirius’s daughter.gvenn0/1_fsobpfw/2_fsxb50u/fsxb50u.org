Did't Have the patience to read Black Bond, the fics focuses too much on the girl, and most of the time Harry seemed to be useless, also her liking for Draco was very annoying, and led me to believe that the romance would be slow because of the incoming love triangle.\\
But i love the idea of the fic and it's very well written, so could you talk a little about it ? So i can decide if continue or not.
