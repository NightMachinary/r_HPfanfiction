the internet seems to just perpetuate this view in people that all the messed up shit they think and say is common and normal, like everyone else is just secretly thinking and saying the same things, but guess what? that isn't true. it's just you who has those messed up views, thoughts, and desires. if you didn't spend so much time with it you'd realize that it isn't normal or common. like how totally fucked up that watchpeopledie subreddit was to even exist. that's why it's fucking gone now.
