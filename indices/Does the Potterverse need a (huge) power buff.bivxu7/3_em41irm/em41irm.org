No, definitely no. Wizards in HP are insanely powerful to the point that most crossovers have to give them massive nerfs to be in any way compelling. MCU is definitely among them. Harry, who is a talented wizard but not near the level of Dumledore/Voldemort, would be able to wipe the floor with nearly any threat.

The whole bit about dodging beams of light is mostly cinematic in nature, and mostly isn't true to canon. Much of the magic cast in the books doesn't have a visual effect, nor do we have any reason to think they have travel times.

Wizards in HP have local omnipotence varying by their talent. Even at Harry's level he'd likely face no threat from any non magical source. Magic in HP is genuine magic, not unexplained physics etc, but genuine supernatural phenomena that trumps the natural. A bullet, a fist, a bomb, none of these things can touch magic.

This is all before even considering instant transportation and mind magic, which only further broaden the power gap.
