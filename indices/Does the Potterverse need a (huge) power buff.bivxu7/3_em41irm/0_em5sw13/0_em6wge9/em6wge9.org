I honestly don't know enough about the Avengers to speak broadly. However Ironman is an easy example of Harry winning without difficulty. The worlds smartest muggle is still just a muggle and can't do anything to a wizard. Also the Hulk, doesn't matter how strong you are you're not overcoming a spell without magic. Which as I understand the Hulk doesn't have.
