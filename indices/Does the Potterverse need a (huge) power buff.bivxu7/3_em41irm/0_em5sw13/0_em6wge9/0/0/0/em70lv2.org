Nothing i said made it a muggle vs wizard argument. You say HP magic trumps anything muggle in origin but provide no basis for that. Hell Thor is supernatural so where is your argument for that?

Everything I said dealt with speed and the fact is HP universe is too slow to hit a majority of the people in MCU. None of that is magic vs. nonmagic, it's just straight combat ability which this entire post is about. If HP verse gets a speed boost than yea its easy, HP wipes the floor with MCU, but without that speed boost, it isn't going to happen.

I absolutely love the HP verse, but the fact is, without a speed boost, HP verse fails against a majority of the other verses. It isn't lacking in power, just speed.

Honestly I'm curious how you think Harry would "wipe the floor" with Ironman or Hulk when the speed differential is so great.
