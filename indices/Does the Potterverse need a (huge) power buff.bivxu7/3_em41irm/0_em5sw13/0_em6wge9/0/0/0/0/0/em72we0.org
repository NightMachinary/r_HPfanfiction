  'Protego', then nothing they do matters.

Sure then he does nothing else. Noone is attacking and defending at the same time in canon.

  The intersection of fantasy and sci-fi is messy and never makes sense. Which causes me to have problems suspending disbelief.

Yet you had no problem blatantly saying Harry would "wipe the floor" with any Avengers. Choose another fantasy and it's really the same arguments. If you can't hit it, you aren't winning a fight.

  Anything that operates within those bounds, for instance anything made by Ironman, doesn't pose a threat.

Welp. If that is your stance, there's no arguing with you because you have blinders on. Nothing, absolutely nothing points to the contrary in canon. Are you seriously saying if Harry gets hit by a car, because it's made by man it doesn't pose a threat? That's insane and I cannot argue against that because you that's just choosing to have your blinders on for HP verse > all.

Look I'm pretty sure we agree HP verse is a very powerful verse, but again, if you cannot hit something, you aren't winning a fight. That's the main argument that you seem to be avoiding. It doesn't avoid the point you're trying to make at all, that HP verse is powerful, and it is absolutely not a pitfall of "who would win." IF you decide to nullify speed and make that a condition on "who would win" I would agree, but that is different than a "full powered up, who would win" which is the apparent premises for this post.

I never brought up ambush. In an ambush fight, Harry would win, magic is too versatile for the most part. Only a handful would probably be able to get out of the ambush.
