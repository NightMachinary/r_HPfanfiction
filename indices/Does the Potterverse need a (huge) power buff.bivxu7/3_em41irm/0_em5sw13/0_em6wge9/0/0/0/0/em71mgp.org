'Protego', then nothing they do matters. You say I provide no basis for that, but my basis is canon. I can't speak to Thor or any of the others in Avengers, I don't like superhero movies/comics for basically the reason we're touching on here. The intersection of fantasy and sci-fi is messy and never makes sense. Which causes me to have problems suspending disbelief.

Harry Potter is a wizard when he flies he isn't reversing gravity, or ignoring it, or anything else. He's simply operating outside the realm of physics and natural law. Anything that operates within those bounds, for instance anything made by Ironman, doesn't pose a threat. You bring up the topic of speed or ambush, which is just a pitfall of who would win discussions that doesn't nothing except avoid the point. Harry Potter > Anything non magical.
