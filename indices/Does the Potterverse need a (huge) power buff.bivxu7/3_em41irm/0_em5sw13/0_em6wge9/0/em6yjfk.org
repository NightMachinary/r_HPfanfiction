Having not seen Endgame yet, so no spoilers.

Ironman beats Harry handily. Like not even close. He has the power to take out Harry no sweat. And his speed makes Harry completely useless. Ironman is moving at and combating at supersonic speeds if not faster depending on the armor he is using. Harry is not hitting that. Harry would have to rely on AOE spells and there is no destructive AOE spell that isn't avoidable by Ironman in the suit.

Hulk, again moving at supersonic speeds and is ridiculously powerful. His durability is absolutely insane, at least Mountain class. I have not seen anything in HP that is Mountain class destruction in one hit. If we are talking about Harry deciding to straight AK Hulk, Harry would definitely need to get that first hit in otherwise he will be wrecked in seconds. Second, we don't even know if it would work because it's not like much is known about AKs and how it works against that level of power.

Harry would get like 1 spell off before Hulk closes the distance and gets smashed. Same with Ironman, Harry gets one shot against these guys before he will be absolutely destroyed. Ironman can even destroy Harry from a distance and is Harry skilled enough to stop Ironman's ranged attacks, doubtful.
