  Harry, who is a talented wizard but not near the level of Dumledore/Voldemort, would be able to wipe the floor with nearly any threat. . . . Even at Harry's level he'd likely face no threat from any non magical source.

In MCU? Doubtful in a straight up fight. I just don't see how he wipes the floor in any fight against any Avengers or their villains bar a few. He definitely has the power, and he might win, but it won't be a clean sweep against any of them.
