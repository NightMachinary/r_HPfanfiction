Probably doesn't need a power buff, but most likely a speed buff depending on what universe you want to compare it to.

Assuming it's a straight fight, the power is definitely there, being able to hit your target though is going to be a problem.

In a non-straight fight, it probably doesn't matter because of how versatile magic is which makes fighting from the shadows much easier.
