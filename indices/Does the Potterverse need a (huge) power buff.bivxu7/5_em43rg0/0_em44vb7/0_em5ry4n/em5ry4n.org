  but are you able to dodge a giant torrent of fire? Water?
#+end_quote

Yes . . . how is that even a question. Do you not expect people in other verses to dodge fire or water?? HP-verse is one of the slower fantasy verses and appears to be limited to real life reaction time if slightly above. Nothing shows that they are going superhuman reaction time.

#+begin_quote
  We don't see it but I'd imagine they can turn air into a weapon with magic.
#+end_quote

There are clearly limitations otherwise people would be ridiculously easy to kill. e.g. Turn the air Voldemort is breathing into toxic gas, yet doesn't happen.

#+begin_quote
  Apparition constantly so they have to react to different sides
#+end_quote

Again, other verses have beyond super human reaction time. They can deal, especially because it wouldn't be anything different than fighting multiple opponents, which isn't a huge thing to do in a variety of other verses.

#+begin_quote
  transfigure yourself an army
#+end_quote

There is definitely a limitation to that otherwise you would have seen much more of it in canon.

#+begin_quote
  There are a ton of ways to deal with people trying to dodge.
#+end_quote

Sure, but it requires reacting to them to counter. There is no way to stop all methods of dodging, you just have to be able to react in a straight fight. If you can even see someone move/dodge, how do you beat that if they definitely have the power to put you down.

It's not about power in a HP-verse vs. any other universe. HP has power in spades, and to spare. It's all about speed and HP-verse is sorely lacking.
