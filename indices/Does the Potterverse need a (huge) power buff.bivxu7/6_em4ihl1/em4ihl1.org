No, the fights and action arent weak because of the source material. HP Magic is actually one of the most OP, visually appealing, and unbalanced magical systems in all of fiction. The action is dull because the writers of both the movies and the books dont know how to properly use their own sources. Fanfiction, regardless of the level of quality, is most often above the source material in terms of how it portrays combat.

If anything, canon magic should be increasingly debuffed to a more manageable level.
