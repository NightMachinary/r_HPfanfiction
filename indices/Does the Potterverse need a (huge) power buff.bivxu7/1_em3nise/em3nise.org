Magic in the Harry Potter universe is exactly as strong as you want it to be. Magic itself was not really expanded on enough in the books, much of what it does is debatable and how it can be stopped is also debatable. Is there a reason that Dumbledore couldn't just point his wand at Voldemort and turn him into a duck? Barty Crouch Jr did not have a problem turning Draco into a ferret. You can assume there is some kind of defense, but what kind and why didn't Draco have it? This is how it goes with a lot of magic in the Potterverse. This is actually what makes it one of my favorite universes for crossovers, as the magic can be scaled to be useful and dangerous but not overpowered in practically any setting by just changing how you view it. If Harry showed up in the Marvel setting and got in a fight, is there something that would stop him from turning Iron Man's suit into dirt? Turning Thanos into a duck? Would a killing curse one shot Thanos? Would the people in this universe have any defense against an Imperious? While there are a lot of point and shoot spells that look easy to dodge in the movies, there are spells in the Potterverse that seem to be impossible to dodge, can you dodge an Imperious, transfiguration, summoning charm or legilimens? If you teleported directly next to someone and point blank Avada Kedavra'd them, would there be any possible response? Are Harry Potter wizards actually always squishy? It seems as there are potions and enchanted armor and such that might be able to fix that, but in fights where a Killing Curse can go straight through any defense and kill you in one shot what would be the point of super strength or skin that could tank bullets? There are charms that make things indestructible, but aren't really useful when the Killing Curse will ignore that spell as well. Would an indestructible shield block anything from the Marvel Universe? If you down Liquid Luck where does that luck really end? If you drank Liquid Luck and got into a fight would it make you able to hit fast targets with your Killing Curse due to luck? Would it make you able to Dodge people like the Hulk or Captain America through sheer luck? If you Polyjuice as a Super Human like Captain America, would you have his physical abilities? Would a basilisk one shot anyone in the setting on eye contact? If your in a universe without a phoenix is basilisk venom 100% fatal all the time?

I always explained much of the odd spell choices and moves in fights in the Harry Potter series as the result of both sides being technically just trained civilians with a few police officers that are out of their depth and the fact that their is no magical soldier equivalent, so no one really had the best idea of what they were doing. It was really a talented Professor with some armed students and civilians vs a talented serial killer with some home made terrorists rather than any real trained combatants.
