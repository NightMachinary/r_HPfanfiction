There are a lot of arguments in here regarding the power level of wizards and witches, all of them pointing out how high it is. And i agree, using the little we know about the limitations of HP magic, wizards can have a major impact in everything.

​

The problem, however, is that they don't. If a teenager, in his last school years, can command enough power to cause destruction then why is it that we don't see that kind of effect? Take the death eaters for example; if someone like Crabbe can learn Fiendfyre then why is it that death eaters aren't using it? They proclaim themselves muggle haters and blindly attack London ( *Millennium Bridge* ) and show willingness to kill wizards and witches (blood traitors) then why don't they just unleash Fiendfyre upon a village.

​

It would surely spread chaos and kill thousands of muggles.

​

If the Hogwarts bunch was able to defend it self during the battle for hogwarts then why is it that a whole nation cannot organise itself against a single foe?

​

It would only take one respected veteran from the Grindelwald era (that's willing to fight no matter what the cost) to organise everything, why isn't that a thing?

​

TL;DR : If wizards and witches have the great potential that cannon gives them then why do we not see it (in cannon)?
