And why wouldn't Harry be that gifted? In a fanfiction you can have Harry basically be DR. STRANGE (who mastered the mythical arts in what? 18 months? 2 years? And beat a damn god (by using an infinity stone of course, but still!) by setting up a freaking time-loop that would resurrect him!) who can destroy a city if he wants to!

Not to mention that if you make the magic more powerful, then Harry and all other wizards would become more powerful, too so city destruction? Why not?

Also:

I don't think HP-Magic is really that weak! I mean they can use Fiend-Fire and they can teleport (apparate) without a wand and rappidly, so dodging a lot of incoming fire? Easy!
