If it were traveling at the speed of light, it wouldn't look like " a jet of silver light". The photons on the jet of silver light are moving at the speed of light and the viewer just sees it. It would seem more like things just happening as the words are said. Like maybe in the Snape example, if the red flash and Lockhart starting moving are simultaneous. Wizards might have different spell speeds and Snape's expelliarmus is something like light speed?
