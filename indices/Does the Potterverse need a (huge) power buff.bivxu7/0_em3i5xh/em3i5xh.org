I think that Magic is already powerfull enough. I mean, Fiendfyre can burn cities if uncontrolled, and considering Crabbe did it at 18, any semi serious Dark Wizard should be able to do it.

At the same time, I remember a fic pointing how "dangerous" magic could be, and that after 3rd year, any student inventive enough could easily cause mass destruction in the muggle world (like, transfigure a bearing wall into wood, and watch the building collapse).

Wizards in Harry Potter (at least powerfull ones) could already kill millions if they wanted to. But I believe that a important aspect of Harry Potter Magic is the control of it. For example (even if it's only in movies), you have an idiot like Crabbe completely destroy a magic room with a dark spell, killing himself in the process, while Voldemort uses the same but control it so it only attack his target with minimal collateral damages.

PS: And I don't think any reasonably fit teenager can dodge an AK easily. I really want to compare spells to gun for how fast they move. Most wizards seem to use spell (useless against his one), but I don't think you can dodge a spell "after" he is sent. Jump out of the way while the opponent cast it maybe (Avadra Kedavra is a pretty long incantation after all) but that's like you can "potentially" dodge bullet by watching the canon. And it's not like wizards are really fit (with the exception of the 4 Quidditchs team, so 28 students, maybe 35-40 with the replacements, what physical activities do student do?)
