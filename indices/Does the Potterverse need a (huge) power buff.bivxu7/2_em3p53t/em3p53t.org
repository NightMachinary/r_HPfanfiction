Just because we only see Dumbledore and Voldemort using 'powerful' magic in Potterverse doesn't mean that they are the only one that could do it. Remember that McGonagall also transfigure desks and statues to attack DE in the final battle.

Even without all the flashy magic involved, the most powerful magic in Potterverse is the mind control. Imperius curse is total mind control without any visible effect; it's really powerful if used correctly. A wizard could've imperio-ed a few important people and they can literally rule the world. Sure, you could argue that imperius curse wouldn't work on alien/orcs/demigods/etc on other fandom but since there's no proof and since that goblins are also vulnerable to the imperius curse we can assume that the curse works on all beings.

Honestly, I'm not surprised if Nicholas Flamel already control the Potterverse, at least the muggle world.

I'm always annoyed when a crossover or a mugglewank shows how 'weak' Potterverse magic and conveniently forget about the Imperius Curse.
