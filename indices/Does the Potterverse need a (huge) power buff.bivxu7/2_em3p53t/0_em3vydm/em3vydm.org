I also have big problems with Mugglewank, especially the one saying Muggle would win in a war because, seriously :

No Muggle equipment can stop magic, so yeah soldier can be turned into animal, tanks become wood, hell even stupefix would knock soldier down, not mentionning Dark Art. Avada Kedavra kill, et if the wizard is lazy, fiendfyre the whole battlefield. (Also, it's discutable but in DH we see that Protego can block physical objects as bodies, and I see nothing in canon even hinting it can't black bullet.\\
Wizards also have Invisibility Cloack and silencing spells (even Muffiato would suffise to pass behind enemy lines). And wizards can teleport, So any adult wizards can beat even the deadliest muggle commandos with one item et 3 spells usually learnt during school year.

And all of this is in the case there is even a war because wizard can hide easily. Muggles pass in front of their settlement everyday without knowing, and they can litterally bend space with one wallet able to turn into a full base easily. I remember some people (mugglewanker) saying Muggles only had to bomb every "blank" zone on the map but :

1: We don't even know if there is any blank zone of the map. Muggles probably just can't see the zone and ignore it without realizing. And hidden islands like Azkaban would still be hidden.\\
2: Even if there was "blank zone", what will they do bomb everywhere? Blank zone can exist for several reasons and it would be fun for them to bomb absolutely everywhere just in case. Hell if I was a wizard I would just put some enchantments (wards in fanon) over some zone just to seem they destroy their own country over time. (And again, wizard can teleport so not really usefull).

So yeah I don't understand why people could even think Muggle had a chance against motivated wizards.

​

On another points (still in muggle wank), I hate it when people ask to "reform Hogwarts" because it's not safe or their curriculum is lacking or other things like that because :

- They are wizards. They don't know about Muggle science, they don't care about muggle science, they don't even need to care about muggle sciences. They don't use Victorian era stuff because they are retarded, they use it because thanks to magic Victorian Era stuff still works perfectly well efficiently enough for them. Also magic is about visualisation, they have no use about the table of elements because either it's something they can touch (like iron) et they can transfigure it (except gold), or it's some of the news elements we can barely synthetize and they can't so don't care.
- Hogwarts is not understaffed. Books made absolutely no mention of teacher having no time to deal with students, depending of size of Hogwarts it may seem strange but Magic. McGonagall did not ignore the Trio is PS because she was too busy, she ignored them because when 3 11years old kids come to you and say "We know the super secret item is a Philosopher stone, it's hidden in the forbidden corridor behind the cerberus and we think a teacher wants to steal it", you don't just obey to them (especially because I remind people, THEY WERE WRONG and snape was innocent). Also because in children book adult must be useless for children to save the day.
- It is a MAGICAL School. It may not be safe but we can't judge them with the standards of muggles. Considering that Harry losing all the bones in his arm only waranted one night in the infirmary, I guess they don't really care about physical injuries since they can't heal them so easily. In fact, I am convinced that student messing with magic and failling (like Hermione with the cat polynectar, or some gilr (Eloise Midgens?) trying to char her acne away, need more attention that Harry usual broken bones.

​

So yeah in conclusion, in Harry Potter universe, wizard are just superior to Muggles.
