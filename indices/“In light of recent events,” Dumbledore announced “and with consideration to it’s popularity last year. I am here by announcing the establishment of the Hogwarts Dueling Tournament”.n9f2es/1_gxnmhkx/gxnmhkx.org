"... Though, do be warned. This is not a conventional wizarding duel. It would require cleverness, resourcefulness and quick thinking to brave it through. You will be set in either 1vs1 or team modalities," Dumbledore said. "In team modalities you will be placed with two of your partners in an obstacle arena, closed and empty except for your team and the opposing team... sans, mayhaps, a wayward magical beast or two. These arenas will be enchanted to look like all sort of places, to prove you can adapt to the battle field. You could encounter from anything from an old indian cementery or an abandoned muggle wax museum to an enlarged version of the potions classroom, which is to say, rather frightening."

"Albus..."

"Oh bugger off Severus. If you don't want to be bullied clean your shit. Throw away the expired rubbish and get a file cabinet or something."

There were some laughs in the back.

"As I was saying. The professors will be in charge of making these arenas... challenging. As for weapons, each team mate will be provided with a different kind of useful artefact. One will get a wand which will be specially crafted to allow the use of only one spell, which spell? Well, it will vary with each duel, and I should say, there's some fun in finding out which one it is." Dumbledore said, rather amused, "The second participant will be provided with a protection device, either a shield sort of item or something to make a good shelter."

"What about the third one?" A student in the back asked.

"Oh the third one will get a flashlight."

"A flashlight?!" Ron yelled.

"Yes, Mr Weasley, some of the arenas will be rather dark." Dumbledore said adjusting his glasses. "First team to defeat all members from opposing team wins."

There was an uproar filled with excited whispers and thrilled chatter, though it eventually subsided.

"What about the 1-1 duels?"

"Oh those will be more straightforward. Arenas will be smaller and each participant will have to chose his or her weapon before starting. The options are either a wand with only 2 spells, one of them chosen by the participant. The other option is whatever is in this box." The headmaster said dramatically pointing at a big crate with an interrogation mark on it.

"The box! The box!" The twins shouted at once.
