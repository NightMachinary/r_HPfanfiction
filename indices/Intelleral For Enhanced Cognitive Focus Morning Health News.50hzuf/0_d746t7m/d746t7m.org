This appears to be spam or advertising. At best, you might have accidentally submitted to the wrong subreddit, but since this is a new account I doubt it.

'Morning Health News' already sounds really suspicious, and whatever Snake Oil^{^{TM}} is being talked up there is /maybe/ not going to do any harm except to someone's wallet, or maybe cause serious health issues.
