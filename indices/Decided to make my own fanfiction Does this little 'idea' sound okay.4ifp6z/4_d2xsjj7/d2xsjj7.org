Sounds interesting but it's pretty ambitious! I do have some questions and thoughts. All three names sound very Muggleborn to me and Sophie Kara is a bit strange as that isn't really a last name. If they/some of them are meant to be wizard raised, you might need to tinker with the names. What kind of evil are the Silvers? Why is the wizarding world relying on children to save them? If two kids are able to take them down, are they a bunch of idiots holding the idiot ball? Must not be too cunning then.
