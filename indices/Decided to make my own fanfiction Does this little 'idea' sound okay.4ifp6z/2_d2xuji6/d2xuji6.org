You're told us basically nothing about the story except that there are two protagonists who are opposed by a mysterious evil organisation lead by some antagonist.

I'd be much more interested in hearing about what the themes would be. Are the Muggles coming ever closer to discovering the Statue of Secrecy, and if so, how does this affect the magical world? What was the impact of the Second Wizarding War? Did the Ministry clean up, or is it still hilariously incompetent and riddles with corruption?

To be honest, the only thing that seems remotely interesting at a first glance is the date. If this wasn't specifically posted in this subreddit, I wouldn't have any idea that this would be set in the HP-verse. I rarely care much for OCs, a feeling I believe that many here share, so my recommendation in terms of what's reasonably realistic would be to either develop an original setting, or look at this idea of yours, pick out the parts you like the most, and see if you can somehow apply them to some time within the books.

If you decide to go forward with this, however, you should probably make it more nuanced. Calling the Silvers evil makes them much less interesting in my eyes. The early Harry Potter books were rather black and white in their mentality, but the latter ones had more shades in them. Furthermore, the Harry Potter fanfiction community is rather old, at this point. Most people have likely come far in their literary tastes from when they first read the books, and will, I believe, look for more interesting antagonists than some nefarious organisation. Have the Silvers have some good points, rather than just being reskinned Death Eaters.

Oh, and a final thing. The names seem rather... bland to me, somehow. Not just the Silvers (why Silvers? Is it meant to read Slivers?), but especially Elizabeth and Edward seems just to make me shake my head. Can't put my fingers on why, exactly, but thought I'd mention it.
