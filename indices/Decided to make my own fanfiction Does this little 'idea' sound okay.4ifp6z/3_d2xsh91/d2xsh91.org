Given the degree of originality you have here i would try to deatach myself from the HP-verse alltoghether.

People (mainly , not only) read fanfiction because of the characters represented in it , I know that there are notable exceptions but even those have heavy connections with the source material.

So , if i were you i would outright go original story or connect it more with HP canon , otherwise i don't think you will get many readers.

I obviously hope to be wrong if you go ahead with this :D
