I hate to say it, but if I saw this description I would scroll right past the story. I think Twilight permanently ruined the name Edward for me, Other than that personal quirk, i'm just not interested. Make me curious, I want to know why I should care about these characters, especially ones so far in the Future with no tie to the HP characters I love. "Muggles have discovered some very useful things" In what way? Are they discovering magic? This has been done before, in what way is your version unique? What makes the silvers "evil"?
