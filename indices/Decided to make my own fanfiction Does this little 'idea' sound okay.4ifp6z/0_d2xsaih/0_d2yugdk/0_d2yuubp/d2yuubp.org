As it stands now I'd agree with you. Of course, there might be legitimate reasons for making it a HP fanfic, foremost among them to play with the "deep setting" of the Potterverse. But nothing of that shows in this story proposal, and the proposal is all we have to judge it by unless we project our own assumptions onto it.

And if we were to do that we stop talking about the proposed story and wholly enter something playing /only/ inside our own heads.
