Original characters oppose an original foe in what might as well be an original world.

A very generic story proposal.

What ties it to the world of HP and makes it a fanfic instead of it being a wholly original story?

You drop names but those names mean absolutely nothing to us. Character 1 and character 2 oppose opponent X leading organisation FOO. That's all we learn about your story. Everything else is window dressing.
