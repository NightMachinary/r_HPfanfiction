Have you though about detaching yourself completely from HP world and create a completely different wizarding universe? You probably would have to change/ create different spells and world rules, but your story setting seem so different already, that it might not be too difficult.

Honestly, sometimes I really wish there were more books/ films around about witchcraft mingling with our world (the muggle society). I would definitely be willing to buy a book which had these elements on it...
