Yeah I was pretty tired when I replied.

I feel that way because - two wizard children set to thwart an evil organization for... reasons? gee, where have I seen that before?

I grew out of my "kids save the world" phase when I was, like, 11. If there's an evil organization, leave the Ministry or the Order of the Phoenix to fight it, not two dumb children with no experience and no reason or duty to fight. It /somewhat/ worked with Harry because he was marked and everything, but it's generally a very implausible plot. And OP only described /plot/, there are no motives or themes or characterizations or visible /point/ to this story that I could find interesting.
