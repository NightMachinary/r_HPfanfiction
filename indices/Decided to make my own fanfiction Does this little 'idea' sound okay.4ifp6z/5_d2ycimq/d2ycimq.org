You've been too vague, but from what little you've given us, here's what I can say.

Might as well make it original fiction. You're not using HP characters, you've implied a change in dynamic by muggles discovering "useful things" (probably making this a muggle wank technology fuck yeah fic) and you don't seem to be using even the themes of HP. This idea is HP in name only.

If I'm judging this as a non-HP story, it sounds like every other generic trash YA story out there (this might just be a problem with your summary than your actual concept). Points for not being dystopia though.
