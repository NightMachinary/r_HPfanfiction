It sounds like it could have a lot of potential for exciting world building, but without more detail I can't say much more than that. Make sure you have a detailed plan so you don't run out of steam or write yourself into a corner!

One thing I would caution is that it's very ambitious for a first fanfic. It might be worth practicing with a couple of one-shots or shorter stories first to get the feel for writing and work out where your strengths and weaknesses lie.
