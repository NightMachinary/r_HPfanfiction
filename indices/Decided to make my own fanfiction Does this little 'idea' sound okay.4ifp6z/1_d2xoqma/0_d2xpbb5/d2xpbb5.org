Starting with a couple of one-shots is a piece of good advice. I started writing about half a year ago, and compared to my first one-shots, I think my writing has improved a lot, even though it's still far from perfect. If I had started with a multichapter, I'd most probably either abandon or rewrite it.

About your idea, it has potential, but to be honest, your description here is a bit too vague to give a lot of feedback. What are the new Muggle discoveries, and how are they affecting the magical world? What are the motivations of the villains and the heroes?
