Something I find helps is filling out character forms. [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/forums/showthread.php?885-Character-Forms-and-Guidelines-for-Use][This one]] is pretty good.

To practice writing characters that don't become self-inserts, steer away from original characters until you're sure you understand how to write people different from yourself. Try writing a canon character that is different to you. Work from the books to understand how they act, the patterns of their speech, their motivations, their physical tics. It's a bit like acting. Start with familiar characters first so you can empathise, then move on to more unusual characters and finally OCs. As well as producing better fanfic, it helps you become a better writer when it comes to consistent character development.
