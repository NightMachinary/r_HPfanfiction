I think this is fantastic advice. When we create a character, we fall in love, which is why I think dear JKR created Pottermore, and why we sometimes erase any flaws from our favorite characters. We don't want to see them disappoint or suffer.

Besides, my advice would be to write what you wanted to read. I did that with my longest story, and I fully admit it was self-indulgent. Good hobbies are. There are people, if you ask, that will tell you no---always there will be, but if the exercise brings you real joy, there will be someone out there who enjoys it, even if it's you alone. That is enough.

But it sounds like your ambition is organized such that you are going back and reflecting on your writing, and that is wonderful. So yes, I would agree with those that say that plotting it out and having a written outline is good advice---plus, it will make conjuring the details all the more fun, since you won't be leaving breadcrumbs and asking for directions.

I'm also nodding at the commenters who suggest perhaps you leave HP for this story. Unless you have a real character tie, you don't need it. There are plenty of magic stories out there and plenty of dystopian ones. Work out a whole world, and you could bring something refreshing to it. :)
