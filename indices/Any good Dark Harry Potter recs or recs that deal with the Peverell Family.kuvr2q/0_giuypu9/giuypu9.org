#+begin_quote
  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

Harry's a necromancer and has two favorite uncles/friends - Ignotus and Cadmus. It's a brilliant work.
