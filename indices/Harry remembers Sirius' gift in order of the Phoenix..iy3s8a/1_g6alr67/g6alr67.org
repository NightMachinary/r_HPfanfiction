Well, it could have also gone the same exact way as the book. As in, maybe poor Sirius gave up on the idea of Harry calling, so he set it on his bedside table and couldn't hear it when he was tending to Buckbeak. The only difference with the book is that Harry has all this extra guilt now.

It would have been nice to have them speak to each other, though. That would have changed the entire last half of the book if Harry had someone to vent to about Snape and Umbridge. I'd like to see that story.
