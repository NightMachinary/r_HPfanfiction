Sirius lives.

Voldemort continues to operate in the shadows longer, but the war probably follows much the same time table, as he'll be able to topple the Ministry as soon as Dumbledore's gone. Unless he hesitates because he still doesn't know the prophecy.

Lucius isn't disgraced. Malfoy redemption might be less likely.

Sirius will feel very vindicated by the revelation that Snape is a traitor. Then shocked when he turns out not to be (if Sirius lives that long).

I can see Sirius not living through the war- he probably joins the Horcrux hunt, and dies at the Battle of Hogwarts, maybe fighting alongside Remus. In fact if I was writing it I'd maybe have him die taking a curse for Remus, which means Tonks doesn't die searching for him during the battle, so Teddy gets to have his parents.
