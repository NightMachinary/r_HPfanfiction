  Lee was only described as having dreadlocks

Even if there aren't any other references in the books to his race, I'm pretty sure that like 99% of people with dreadlocks are black, so this is still a very strong indicator. If nothing else, Rowling would know that most people would assume the person with dreadlocks is probably black, so she would be more likely to specifically say if that wasn't the case.

Are you also going to argue that Cho Chang wasn't Asian because the books never explicitly said that she was?

  Dean was described as black only in the original draft of PS and the American version of the books

I'm usually pretty resistant to accepting anything as canon that wasn't actually in the books, but even I think that's a bit of a stretch. Rowling still very clearly intended for him to be black, and he even shows up in some of her early art as a black kid.

  My point still stands though.

It really doesn't. Even if we only accept the three characters who were explicitly said to be black in the British versions of the books, they're not underrepresented. There may be more than 200 characters, but only if you count every single minor character who was nothing more than a name or look into canon outside of the books. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters][Wikipedia's list of Harry Potter characters]] is not exhaustive, but it at least seems to have every character who got more than a passing mention. It barely hits 200 characters, and at least two dozen of them aren't even human.

Three out of about two hundred characters is pretty much exactly how much representation you would expect. And even if there are a few hundred more characters that are technically mentioned in the books, they're all such minor characters that you can't conclusively say anything about them except maybe their names, so there's no reason to expect that a few of them wouldn't be black too.

Honestly, I'm not even sure what your point really is. You're arguing that blacks are underrepresented, while also trying to argue that as few characters are black as possible.
