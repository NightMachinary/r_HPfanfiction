Well, Lee, Dean, and Blaise are never actually described as black in the books. Lee was only described as having dreadlocks, Dean was described as black only in the original draft of PS and the American version of the books, and Blaise was just described as dark skinned.

That leaves only two black people in the books, and given that there are much more than 200 characters, they're underrepresented.

Edit: Oops. Zabini was actually described as black. My point still stands though.
