When talking about stereotypes, how common is it for dentists in UK to be Jewish? For us (Czechia) before the Holocaust, a girl with bushy hair, bookworm, and with two parents dentists (or lawyers), had to be Jewish. Thus may head-canon that Hermione's grandparents were German-speaking refugees from Reichenberg (what's now Liberec) in then Czechoslovakia.
