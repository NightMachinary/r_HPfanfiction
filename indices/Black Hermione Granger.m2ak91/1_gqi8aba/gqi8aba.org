There's a [[https://dentistry.co.uk/2020/06/16/black-lives-matter-experiences/][collection of interview from British black dental professionals]] and they all mentioned the rarity of fellow Blacks in school and career. [[https://acda-uk.org/][ACDA UK]] were only founded in 2012, hinting it took that long for enough of them to start the organization.

Even if we go with the idea that Wizarding Britain is far more color blind than their Muggle counterpart, when Hermione mentioned her parents are dentists the Muggleborn and half-bloods would likely notice how rare they are.
