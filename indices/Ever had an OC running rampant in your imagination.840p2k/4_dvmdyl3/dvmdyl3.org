If the oath is strictly not to hurt Harry, you could have a villian who did a lot of terrible stuff, but who flees from Harry to not risk the vow. Since something like by blowing up a wall causing bricks to fall on him would probably break the vow. Depending on the vow's wording, he could still have his henchmen go after and try and kill Harry.
