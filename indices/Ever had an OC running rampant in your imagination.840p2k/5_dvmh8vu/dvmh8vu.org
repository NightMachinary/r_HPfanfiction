That's a very interesting story. And to be honest I feel it would be more straightforward to make this a Delphini-is-born-early AU rather than make him an OC boy with still more or less the same role... but hey, your story. I'm interested either way.

As for me, I don't exactly have anything like that in the sense that I /have/ put my various OCs in my story already, or have a good idea of how and when I will do so. For instance, I have an alternate Defence Professor called Alexander Max (who is sort of a scarier Professor Moody who's /not/ a villain in disguise; his thing is that he likes Dark lore a lot, finds Dementors fascinating, etc.), a Boggart-turned-human called Maximilian Candy, etc.
