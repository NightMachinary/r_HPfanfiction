Delphini turned out the way she did from never having /known/ either of her parents, and being raised in their late shadow by a harsh, borderline-Dursley-like guardian. My reasoning was that it's quite imaginable she'd turn out how you describe your character if she had been born earlier, and thus, /raised/ by Bellatrix and Voldemort.

And yes, I have published the story with all those characters; linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor).
