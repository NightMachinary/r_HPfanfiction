Funnily enough, i didn't even know of Delphini's existance :p

Still, after reading the wiki, she does have a few key aspects that go hand in hand with the caharcter i have in my head. But also some pretty big differences. One being, for example, that my char is more alike Tom Riddle from the flashbakcs rather than Bellatrix or no-nose Voldemort. Another that he's loyal towards his genitor simply because he was made to be. Remove that enforcement and you have someone groomed to be like a megalomaniac/sociopath realizing they'd abused their whole life

It's basically a story about a mind-fucked person who was never given the chance to be his own person, and resents that. Actually, since you mentioned boggarts, the shortest way to explain all of this is saying that his (boggart) would look like Tom Riddle, with the implication that his biggest fear is not Voldemort himself but turning into him

Have you published your stories? If so, could you give me the names? I'm reading a lot of OC fics these days, and i especially found myself liking the ones with OCs as Professors. Must be quite a pain to do, tho, since Professors are kind of incompetent in canon
