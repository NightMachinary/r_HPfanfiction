I have a OC for a Hogwarts future story knocking about in my head.

In my previous (now completely lost ðŸ˜£) draft, she was a gray Slytherin. I have a tragic outline formed in my head, I just need the backstory for her now.

I'm kind of nervous about putting it down on paper, so I'm focusing on my Auror Gregory House character. (Not a cross over, just based on that cerebral +snarky+ asshole character)
