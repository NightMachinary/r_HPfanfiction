I have a couple OCs kicking around. Haven't found much time to write about them though.

The first is a muggleborn Ravenclaw whom, due to tragic deepest lore, ended up developing an obsession with perfection. Everything she does is revolved around the goal of perfecting herself. However, she eventually wants to extend that goal to the rest of wizarding society.

The second is a replacement History of Magic professor. She's immortal and was present throughout history to be able to witness events personally. She uses a pensieve projector to show battles and other events that occurred, given to her by old friends and students that were present.
