Mine is a "negotiator" of hiding society built on ideas of meritocracy, symbiosis, honesty, personal and collective development. Notice that human-ness and the like are not mentioned though...

But hes not really negotiator, he was sent away because of some acts that, being not forbidden yet, put him in category of "counter-productive for both sides to keep him here". So he takes his associate and goes on a looong recruiting mission on big continent.

He is locked between inner morales(which are still encouraged, just optional), rules of prev society and rules of new society. That is a first line of story, how they clash and which one of three wins where.

Second is him actually doing stuff: whom he recruits, what researches are made, and how all of it interacts with books eventline.
