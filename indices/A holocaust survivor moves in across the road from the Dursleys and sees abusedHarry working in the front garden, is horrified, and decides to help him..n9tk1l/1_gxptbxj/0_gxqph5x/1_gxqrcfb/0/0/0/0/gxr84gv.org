  "I can't do the work for you" is a legitimate argument.

No its not, its a complete failure of an argument. Its the worst thing to have come out of the social justice movement, the idea that you can claim to be an activist whilst denying any responsibility for convincing anyone of anything.

No one will ever change their mind if you refuse to try and convince them. If you want people to believe what you are saying, the responsibility sits on you to provide them with the information necessary to change their mind. You cannot deny that responsibility and then be angry when their views stay the same as they ever were.

  I literally cannot force someone to read or watch anything. If they have a genuine interest they will be willing to look it up.

The definition of lazy activism - refusing to put any work into convincing people and then blaming them for not changing their views.

  Both tiktok accounts self-identify as Romani in their bio.

And? If you want to convince people of something you need to provide sources that are actually convincing. Tiktok videos, opinion pieces, and blog articles all carry the exact same evidentiary weight - precisely zero.
