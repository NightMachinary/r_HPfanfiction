Both tiktok accounts self-identify as Romani in their bio.

They both talk about this word usage. They explain far better than I, an outsider, can.

  When you're the person making claims that you want other's to believe and act on, the responsibility does sit with you to do the work of convincing them.

I literally cannot force someone to read or watch anything. If they have a genuine interest they will be willing to look it up.

Tbf, when someone tells me that something is offensive, I'll stop, whatever it was and definitely look it up.

"I can't do the work for you" is a legitimate argument. If you want to be more conscientious you will be willing to do the work. I shouldn't have to be the one to explain why racism is bad.
