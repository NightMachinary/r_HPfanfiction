Tbf, the times I've heard Gypsy being used were not for good things.

  Usage notesEdit

  Gypsy is an exonym (a name given by outsiders, based on the mistaken belief that Romanis came from Egypt) and many Romani people find it offensive, as it has negative connotations,[1][2] such as that the people are dishonest or thieving (compare gypsy, gyp), and it is associated with discrimination and persecution of Romani. Many dictionaries recommend avoiding the term, or give it a negative or warning label.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Gypsy is still more common overall than Romani.[9]

  Roma (Rroma) or Rom (Rrom) are sometimes found as synonyms, although narrowly speaking, they refer to a subgroup.
