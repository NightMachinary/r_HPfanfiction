There's more voices out there and I can't do all the work for you.

Gypsy is an actual nazi propaganda word. As in, Nazi's used it when they were searching for the people to snuff out.

That being said, there's some travelers who claim the title and are cool with it. And some who have learned the history and are not cool with it.

The word comes from "gyp" as in steal, because you know, "they're all thieves". So yeah, rooted right into prejudices and propaganda.

  I don't want to call them Romani because i know several Romanian people that would take offense if i called the traveler people Romani and i would rather avoid that problem

Sounds like prejudices are coloring their ownership. But you shouldn't call someone a slur just to keep friends happy.
