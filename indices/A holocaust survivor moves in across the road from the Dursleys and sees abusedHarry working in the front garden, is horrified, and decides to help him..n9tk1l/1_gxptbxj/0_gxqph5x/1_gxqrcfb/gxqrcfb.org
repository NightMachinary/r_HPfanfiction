What do i call them then? I don't want to call them Romani because i know several Romanian people that would take offense if i called the traveler people Romani and i would rather avoid that problem. Also weren't there some cases when someone tried to sue a scientific publication over the use of word gypsy and the court ruled that the word wasn't offensive? at least in that case.
