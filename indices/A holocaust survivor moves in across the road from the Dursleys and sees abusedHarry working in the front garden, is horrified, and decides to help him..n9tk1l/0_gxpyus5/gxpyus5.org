Very distantly related: anything about magical Roma.

I dimly remember post-Battle scene where Roma family of Romilda Vane (who turned out to be a courageous fifth-year member of DA under the Carrows) came with their trailer collecting her body. I would love to read the story, but I cannot recall what it was. The feeling was kind of similar to Mr Creevy in “A True Gryffindor” by backinyourbox, linkao3(10852959): we send our only son to this fairy-tale land of magic, and the only thing we've got from it was his body in a body bag.
