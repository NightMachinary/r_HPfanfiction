The only fic I've seen with gypsy/romani in it is 'The Godmother', a crossover with NCIS LA. And I'm pretty sure that the character in question being romani was made up out of whole cloth, though as I've never watch it I can't be sure.

However, I /am/ fairly sure that bits of it would be rather offensive. But it has Romani magic?
