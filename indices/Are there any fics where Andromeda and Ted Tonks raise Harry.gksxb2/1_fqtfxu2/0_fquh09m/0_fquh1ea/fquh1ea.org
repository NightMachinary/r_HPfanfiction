#+begin_quote
  Kreacher has a special bond with the Black heir. What happens when he's abused? Who will Kreacher turn to? Is the damage too great?orBefore the abuse can get too bad Harry is adopted by the Tonks family. He gains a new big sister, a snarky house elf, two parents, and much more. What happens over the course of him growing up? How will he continue to relate to his much older sister? And how will his unique "disability" affect his magic? Not to mention his interactions with a squib, a horse, and a herd of thestrals...Currently on a long hiatus, I will get back to it someday soon.
