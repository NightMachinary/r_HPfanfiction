  Harriet Tonks wasn't completely ignorant of her past. She knew that she used to be a Potter, that her Lily-mum and her James-dad loved her very much, that her mums had been good friends, and that her ‘Dromeda-mum and Ted-dad had taken her after her parents had died.She knew how they had died, and why, and what people were calling her, even though she didn't like to think about it very much.And she also knew that she was supposed to be living with her aunt and uncle, but they hadn't wanted her. And that technically (“The technical sense being the most important, when you're trying to get out of trouble, pet,” Ted-dad always told her) her mum had stolen her.
