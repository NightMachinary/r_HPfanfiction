I quite enjoy the relationship in Ingenio ab Artifex (formerly flowers for your grave). It's so grandfatherly and supportive and Harry really trusts him as a family figure and there's a genuine sense of connection in every interaction.

I can't link it; the fic has 'suggestive content' regarding Harry 'interacting' with a female character whom he doesn't inform of his age and though it is completely non-graphic, I think it might violate rule 8. It's worth searching though, IMO. Fun, Lie I've Lived type fic. :)
