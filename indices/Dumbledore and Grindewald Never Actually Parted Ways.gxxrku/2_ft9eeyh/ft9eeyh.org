Post Deathly Hallows - Whilst Harry is a trainee auror, he accidentally gets trapped in an alternative universe where Dumbledore never fell out with Grindelwald and accepted the position of Minister for Magic. Action takes place in 1945. Harry befriends troubled shop assistant and aspiring Dark Lord, Tom Riddle, and they end up falling for each other as they try to stop Dumbledore and Grindelwald from uniting the Deathly Hallows. Hilarity ensues.
