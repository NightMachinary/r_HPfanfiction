Would you feel particularly united by "storm wizards"? There's nothing that evokes feelings of inspiration and unity in the phrase. Acolytes and Alliance have themes of uniting for a charismatic leader, uniting for a common goal, and is respectable by one's enemies. I would straight up refuse to become a "storm wizard". What am I? An idiot who likes to chase storms on my broom?
