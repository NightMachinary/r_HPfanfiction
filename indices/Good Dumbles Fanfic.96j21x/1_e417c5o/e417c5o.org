My collection of good and competent Dumbledore fics (except for those already recommended):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): He utilized Hermione's information very effectively.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]], linkffn(4101650): Another time travel, and despite my strong misgiving about some earlier plot elements, Dumbledore did very well here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), Faced with a Ministry that was openly colluding with Voldemort and Hermione lashing out on her own, Dumbledore managed to bring this difficult situation under control.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867): Dumbledore didn't appear much, but offered several good piece of advice to Ginny.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This Dumbledore was totally manipulative Greater Good, and the kids even figured that out. However, his Order was a brutally effective organization, and his plan worked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][His Mother's Love]], linkffn(10132530): It took some prodding from Harry, but he came clean with Harry and gave him a viable plan to win the war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446118/1/Intersecting-Realities][Intersecting Realities]], linkffn(12446118): A somewhat older, dimensional traveling Harry met the local GWL. After some discussions, the local Dumbledore began working well with the GWL.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore took the Basilisk more seriously, and together with Amelia Bones, mostly solved the canon plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]], linkffn(12331839): Dumbledore saved Tom Riddle from a time traveling Harry Potter, and together they also defeated Grindelwald.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): He was generally good in this one, but since the author still decided to rehash canon stations in Years 1-2, he sucked during those two years. But Dumbledore would kick serious asses in Year 3.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515): After a slow start, this Dumbledore first neutralized Umbridge, then crashed Death Eaters's party in DoM.
