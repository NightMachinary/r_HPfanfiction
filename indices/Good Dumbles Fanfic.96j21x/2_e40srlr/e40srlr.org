linkffn(9824342) - Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure, a good Dumbledore gets sent back to the past and a dimension over in a bumbling Dubledore's place. A little slow paced and first of a series.

Hope ya don't mind too much, but while he's only had a small bit piece so far, my Dumbledore will become, if not /good/ since I'm going to try to go with a lot of greys- he'll actually be one of the antagonists I believe, scarily competent most of the time in the future, he's had a wake up call. linkffn(13025986)
