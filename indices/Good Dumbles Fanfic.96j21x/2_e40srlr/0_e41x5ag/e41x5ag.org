So I'm reading your story now.

Honestly it's a LOT of cliches. The ‘all of a sudden I distrust Ron and Hermione' and ‘Harry is Lord of multiple houses including Griffyndor'

But this line frustrated me.

‘He was upset that they no longer seemed to trust him to know what was best, he was Albus Dumbledore after all. '

No one thinks like that. No one. It's pretyy much number 1 or the cliche for this type of story. (And I read most of them as they're my guilty pleasure)

Your writing style is good but you're hitting all the cliches right now

ALOS a particular bugbear. ‘He had made every move for the greater good' Dumbledore thought that way as a child. He watched his friend who believe that kill his sister and then take the wizarding world and the muggle world to war with that phrasing. It's not something that it's realistic to have him believe. It would be like someone nowadays talking about work in German society stating ‘Abeich macht frei' The phrase is too loaded.
