  Honestly it's a LOT of cliches. The ‘all of a sudden I distrust Ron and Hermione' and ‘Harry is Lord of multiple houses including Griffyndor'

Er, I appreciate the criticism, just wish it was for my story, Ron Chee here, and I just started writing The Sub Rosa... and Ron and Herms haven't yet made an appearance, I doubt I'll have him be a lord either. Also my Harry will have suffered less at the hands of the Dursley's, probably be more trusting, then again, it is a somewhat criminal organization of the downtrodden. In any case I doubt him and Ron will be best friends I'll try not to bash him.

  He was upset that they no longer seemed to trust him to know what was best, he was Albus Dumbledore after all. '

  No one thinks like that. No one. It's pretyy much number 1 or the cliche for this type of story. (And I read most of them as they're my guilty pleasure)

I didn't quite write that, but your advice is good for me, may have to edit my Dumbledore a touch. Not sure if /no one/ thinks like that- but in any case my Dumbles is getting another wakeup call in the next chapter and /won't/ think like that in the future for sure.

Aside from that... well, I see my Dumbledore as an old man past his prime that just wishes to be Albus or Al- sort of like Harry wanting to be just Harry, but no one else stepped up to the plate so he was forced into all these positions of power, forced to be a general when all he wanted was to teach kids, but becomes too busy to do any position justice.

  ALOS a particular bugbear. ‘He had made every move for the greater good' Dumbledore thought that way as a child. He watched his friend who believe that kill his sister and then take the wizarding world and the muggle world to war with that phrasing. It's not something that it's realistic to have him believe. It would be like someone nowadays talking about work in German society stating ‘Abeich macht frei' The phrase is too loaded.

I'm not entirely sure he only thought that way only as a child- actions speak louder than words- miserable childhood for Harry, but he's protected, leading him by his nose by a convoluted suicide plot that I doubt he was a hundred percent sure he'd survive- maybe mostly sure, not to mention storing dark lord bait at a school without even an age line to keep kids out and other little things like that.

One thing I will say is that Dumbledore's use of the phrase always struck me as /wrong/ though, he distanced himself from Gellert when he realized the costs involved- after his sister... And he defeated the dark lord Gellert became, I imagine the phrase would bring up a lot of painful memories, and that he would do his best not to be like that... then he goes and does things for the greater good, though his greater good is superior to Gellerts since he does seem to have good intentions.

Then again, we all know what the road to hell is paved with.
