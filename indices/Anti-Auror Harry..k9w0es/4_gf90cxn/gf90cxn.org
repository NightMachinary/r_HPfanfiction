This isn't what you're asking for, but it's close. In /Turn/ linkao3(879852) epilogue Harry is shown an AU where he didn't marry Ginny and he didn't become an Auror. And slowly Harry realizes that his alternate self is happy while his actual self is just drifting along with expectations. No Ginny bashing.
