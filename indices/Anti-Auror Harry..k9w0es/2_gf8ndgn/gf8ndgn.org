How in the hell Would Making it illegal to film the police be in anyone's Best interest let alone the general population?

... Are you going to have to disconnect your security cameras in your store or your home if you have to call the police because someone broke in?

If you are in public and it's perfectly legal to film in public random by passers and other things if a cop suddenly pops up?

And you know camera keep people as honest as possible in those situations... that's how you document police abuse of power as well as any possible issues if the person being arrest assaults and officer. For both parties involved cameras keep people p el as to as possible... You can't really dispute the fact someone got hit in the face if you have it on video from 3 different angles because the security camera and someone's iPhone recorded it.....

The police are public officials at least while there on the streets on duty so at least when it comes to their job their right of privacy should be about the same as the president of France or the mayor of Paris if someone wants to record them in public at least from what I think I know of French law correct me if I'm wrong it's perfectly legal to record a public figure in public
