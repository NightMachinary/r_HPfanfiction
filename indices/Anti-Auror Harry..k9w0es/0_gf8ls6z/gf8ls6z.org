I always felt that the whole Auror thing was no different than the whole relationship with Ginny. He did both of those things because people expected it of him. By the End of the series I feel that harry is a broken individual with really no sense of self. Willing to do whatever others ask about him. I mean with the name of Albus Severus? Two of the people who are really responsible for messing with his life the most? I feel that by Book four's end harry is for all intents and purposes a slave who has no idea of what it means to be free. Infact he would probably break if he was free to choose his own life.
