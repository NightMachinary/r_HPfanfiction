I agree that many of the characters in HP and Naruto are rather awful when looked from the lenses of an adult eye. Naruto is way too idealistic for me to enjoy as a character. Plus the whole Talk-No-Justu makes the whole plot too 2D for me. I, Naruto am always right there fore your argument is invalid. But with HP its a different problem. I find the actions of almost every adult horrible. They are either evil, abusive, neglectful, Incompetent, lacking in morals, guilty of turning a blind eye to something wrong or in some cases more than one of these. Snape and Dumbledore were awful individuals yet we are supposed to treat them as if they were grey and complicated heroes.
