I read HP as a child and loved it. If I read it now for the first time, I would have hated it. Harry is basically a lucky dumb jock. That is why I Iove fanfiction. I can choose to read a fic with a smarter and more interesting Harry. The universe is cool, charachters are mostly ok.

Same as Naruto and Twillight. I like the universe, but charachters are ok or really badly written.
