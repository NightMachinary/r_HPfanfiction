Actually, I have a theory Ginny had given him the love potion in the canon, but a small dose only to catch his interest so he would finally look at her not as the Ron's sister, but as a potentional girlfriend. Once the potion wore off he did the rest voluntarily. I came to this conclusion because it had always seem to me Harry's infatuation appeared out of nowhere. And the potion played quite a role in Half-Blood Prince, so I took it as a subtle storyline behind. No need to agree. Like I said, it's just a theory. :)
