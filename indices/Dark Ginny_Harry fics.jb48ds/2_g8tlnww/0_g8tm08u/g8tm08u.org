Oooohh dammm I love that honestly! I think we need more dark Ginny in the fandom there is so much potential! Jk really could have done something great with them knowing that they could bond over the trauma Tom Riddle/Lv brought. Her stalkerish behavior there is so much to write! I love your theory great job never thought about it that way
