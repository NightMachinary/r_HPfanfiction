Some interesting fics I've read that relate to this:

This details the creation of the diary Horcrux from the POV of a teenage Tom Riddle. Mesmerizing prose (imho)

#+end_quote

This fic revolves around the premise that Tom is a good boy raised wrong. Time travel back to when he was first born, and the time-traveler raises Tom (now Thomas) in a way that celebrates his better characteristics.

A world where Tom Riddle couldn't kill his parents to create his first Horcrux. Instead he became a professor, a celebrated scholar with a specialty in immortality. Only 5k words.

Just finished reading this. It's absolutely fantastic, however it's abysmally short and unfinished.
