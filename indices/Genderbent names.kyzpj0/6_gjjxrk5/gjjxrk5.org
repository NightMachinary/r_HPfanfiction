Weasleys name their children after English/Germanic royalties. In this gender bent world, they keep having children until their first son, William, is born. The names of their daughters could be: Anne, Aethelflaed, Emma, Elizabeth, Guinevere/Ginevra, and Victoria, with Guinevere/Ginevra being the elder one (Chronologically speaking, she was the first of these famous British queens).

[[https://www.behindthename.com/name/ginevra][Ginevra]] is the Italian form of Guinevere, and is etymologically the same as Jennifer and Geneva (that Swiss city). But anyway, after Ginny's full name was revealed in HBP in 2005, [[https://www.behindthename.com/name/ginevra/top/italy][the popularity of Ginevra]] really takes off in Italy. Coincidence?
