Is Harry short for Henry? He is never called Henry in the books and while Harry is a common nickname for Harry, it isn't that uncommon for people to have short forms as their genuine names, there are a lot of people called Jack who have Jack as their legal name when Jack was originally a nickname of John. Tom Riddle is another one, while Tom is short for Thomas, he is never addressed as Thomas and I know real life Toms whose name on their birth certificate is "Tom" not "Thomas".'

Also in chapter one of the first book Petunia dismisses Harry as "a nasty common name", it seems less likely she would do that if he was called Henry which is a name given to Kings and Princes among others.
