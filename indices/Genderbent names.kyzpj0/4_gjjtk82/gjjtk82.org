I've seen a loooooot of names for Fem!Harry but my favorites are stuff that make sense. Holly. Jasmine. Rose. Rosalynn in one case. Y'know. Sensible girls names, or at the very least, names you can read and associate with a girl. Unlike Harriet, or Harrietta, Etc.

I think people try too hard to keep “Harry” as a nick name.

I read a Boy!Luna fic where he was still Luna, but his first name was Sol, with Luna being the middle name.

You ever see Fem!ron get called Ronalda? I have. It's as painful as it sounds.
