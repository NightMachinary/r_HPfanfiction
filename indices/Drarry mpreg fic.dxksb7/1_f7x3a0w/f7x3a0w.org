You might have better luck on [[/r/HPslashfic][r/HPslashfic]]

(Just want to say that I think everyone has a right to post anything related to HP fan fic in this sub, but slash tends to get downvoted and ignored on this sub. The slash sub was created specifically so slash readers could share slash recs and discuss slash without being downvoted.)
