I think I almost like Alexandra Quick better than Harry Potter. Although some adults do try to protect her, she doesn't get a free pass from consequences of her actions. Granted, Alex and Harry have very different roles, but she somehow seems a bit more real for being a brat. Harry Potter is a bit more fairy-tale-ish, AQ a bit more real-world-ish. Or as someone pointed out to me the other day, it's more gray-and-gray morality, than black-and-white. Voldemort is clearly wrong, and must be stopped, end of. AQ has multiple sides to it, and they all have a genuine case.

Plus, Harry had almost a Mary-Sue feel about him. Disobeys orders and takes off on a broom? Becomes youngest Quidditch player. Sneaks around after curfew? Scot free. Sneaks into Hogsmead? Scot free. Steals a car, smashing a valuable tree? Scot free. Fraternising with wanted criminals easily, friends who almost always back him up or agree with him, running away - usually when he does get into trouble, it's because the adults are wrong, not him (dementor at Privet Drive, everything concerning the Dursleys, everything concerning Umbridge, and pretty much all Snape). Alex has also done all of those things, and got into trouble. She cannot meet her father easily or often, because wanted criminal. Her friends often disapprove of what she does, and she has frequent fights with her best friend. Whenever she's in trouble, we know it's because she deserved it. Mostly. Harry Potter gets a free pass through everything, Alex Quick gets things made deliberately harder for her by the adults.
