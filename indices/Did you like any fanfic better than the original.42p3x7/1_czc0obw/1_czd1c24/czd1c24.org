I really liked AQ, but I thought she was the one who was a but Mary-Sue-ish, and the author made up for it by making her a brat. I kind of got irritated with how she kept getting in trouble. With everything she'd been through, it got to a point where it almost became nonsensical to punish her. I agree that Harry got away with things a bit too much, but AQ often left me with a bad feeling. You'd think she'd learn her lesson after the first three times she screws up. It was a great story though. Can't wait for the next one.
