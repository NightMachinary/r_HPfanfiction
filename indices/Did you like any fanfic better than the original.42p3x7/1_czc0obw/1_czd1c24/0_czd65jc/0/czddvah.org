I was pretty irritated with her expulsion. Like, of all things she'd done that deserved expulsion, protecting herself for nearly being murdered wasn't on the list. But you just reminded me about her pilgrimage thing. I was really interested when the story went into Chinese-American Wizardry, so it will be cool to see what he has to do with the Ozarkers. Honestly, that's what I love most about the story. How much world building there is, and how it sort of goes into different cultures' wizarding worlds. It JK ever does write more, I'd be very interested in a new series that talks about a wizarding student in some other continent. It would never happen, but would be really cool.
