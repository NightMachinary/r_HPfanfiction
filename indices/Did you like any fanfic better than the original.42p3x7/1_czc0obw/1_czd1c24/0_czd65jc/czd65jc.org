Yeah, I have to say, her compulsion to flaunt rules does get irritating. But I have a sibling on the spectrum, and they had almost the same compulsion despite repeatedly knowing the consequences. I think that's part of what I like about it - it's not necessarily a story where you sympathize with the main character.
