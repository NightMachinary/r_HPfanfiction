Methods of Rationality: Yudkowsky makes the story actually believable while at the same time leaving obviously weird stuff around that are not errors but rather clues for the reader. The story essentially reads like a mystery novel where you are given all the clues and expected to make the connections yourself.

A Black Comedy: This is sort of way out there and thus not really comparable but I definitely do like it more than the original. The writer has an excellent form and grasp of comedy, utilising both pauses, foreshadowing and Chekov's Guns in a very professional and skilful manner. It is hard to come up with anything to improve in this one.

Maybe that's about it.
