From a literary point of view, whether it's about world building or character developments, no fanfictions I've read so far come even close to the originals.

However, I've found a few fanfictions that are more fun and satisfying to read. I generally prefer intelligent and ruthless protagonists in a story. Book trio was intelligent enough in my opinion, but they lacked ruthlessness to deal with their enemies effectively. Even in the final battle, they still mostly fire stunners while death eaters basically threw the kitchen sink at them.

All my favorite fanfics feature ruthless main characters, here are my top 5:

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), is about Harrymort vs Voldemort. Obviously, that guy had no problem dishing out damage on a massive scale.

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), has Harry building a kick-ass team with Bellatrix Black, especially in the 2nd half, these two had Voldemort's balls in a vice (if he still had any).

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), is about politics, strategy, intrigue, and mayhem.

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), has Harry, Ginny, and Ron traveling back in time to fix things up, and they were pulling no punches. The Azkaban execution scene was probably the highlight of the story.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), is generally a light-hearted romance with little violence. But when his girls were threatened or harmed, Harry was merciless. Before even reaching an age of 13, he pulled a brutal revenge on Lucius Malfoy for slipping the diary to Ginny; and he ruthless sent Draco to his death after another of his girls was harmed.
