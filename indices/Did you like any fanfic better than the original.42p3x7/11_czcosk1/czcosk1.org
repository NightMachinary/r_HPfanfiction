The only fanfic that has the readability of canon is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic]] (edit: for me). Sadly, the author has some rl issues and can't seem to update it at all lately :(

Other than that, fanfiction has kind of become its own world, not completely loose from canon but not the same either. The fact that there are so many fanfic stories to read is amazing and a big plus over canon too.
