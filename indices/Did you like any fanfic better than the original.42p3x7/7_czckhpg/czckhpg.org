I find myself shocked that no one has mentioned the amazing linkffn(Vox Coporis) yet! Far better than Canon to me.

In all honesty, Canon was not even that well-written. I have run across many fanfics (leaving aside the blatant wish fulfillment ones) which are far better. Most of them have already been referenced in this thread
