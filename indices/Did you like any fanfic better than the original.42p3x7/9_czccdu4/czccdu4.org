I find that I can't compare them, even with the obvious similarities. Because even though the world and characters are the same, in name at least, each author brings their own feel to it. Fanfiction, to me, is reactionary and emotional. People finished this amazing series, and many were left with either a desperate desire to experience more of this world, or correct what some believed to be unforgivable errors (excuse the pun).

I don't have any specific stories to bring, but I really enjoy stories where characters that weren't explored in depth in canon are now thrust into center stage. I love seeing the growth people bring to these characters, one of the best parts of Rowling's world but sadly one that for obvious reasons, can't be done with everyone. So in that way, Fanfic as a whole is almost equal to the great Rowling. I know this is a little off the topic of discussion, but I needed to think this through, and this is where my brain led me :)
