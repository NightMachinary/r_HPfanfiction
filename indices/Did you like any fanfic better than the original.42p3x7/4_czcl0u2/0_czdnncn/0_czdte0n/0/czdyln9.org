Inverarity's a guy. Don't worry, I made that mistake at first too; his username is rather ambiguous.

/I've/ already written AQ fanfiction (recursive fanfiction?), so why others don't I have no clue. But Inverarity recently posted on his Livejournal that he took a hiatus from working on AQATWA (book 5) and he's back to writing, albeit very slowly. So I guess we can keep the flame for now!
