I know, I saw that his really been pretty slow to get discussion going. I think people are honestly just a little bit nervous about the series actually continuing, and so it's hard to invest in something like that for fear of the disappointment that will occur. Committing to one novel-length fanfiction is difficult, but to commit to an entire series like Inverarity has done is difficult. Life keeps happening, and to undertake something like that, for free, is very difficult.

I honestly think people would attempt to pick it up and finish if she abandons the series. A rash of fanfiction about a fanfiction. I'm sure it's been done before, but that story could spin off in so many different directions, I definitely see that becoming a thing, particularly if the series does not continue.
