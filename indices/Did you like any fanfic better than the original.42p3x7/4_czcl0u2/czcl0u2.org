I have three stories that at least measure up to the original. The first, as someone has already stated in here, is the Alexandra Quick story. A story completely separate from Harry, it's nice to have a new set of characters set in a completely different country and honestly dealing with much different magic than Harry did. Alexandra as a character is much less endearing but at the same time much tougher and has truly dealt with a lot of awfulness that Harry did not experience at a younger age.

The second is the canon world of Northumbrian. Some of his stories have absolutely captivated me. linkffn(The Mind of Author Weasley) is one of my absolute favorite one-shots. Much of Northumbrian's world I honestly treat as canon.

The third is really the only Harry Potter AU that I have fallen head over heels for, and that is linkffn(Innocent) by MarauderLover7. Basically changes a few elements in Harry's world (the big ones: Sirius Black escapes earlier, 2 years before Harry starts school, and "kidnaps" Harry; and the Malfoys have 2 sons, Hydrus and Draco). Those two changes set off a chain-reaction of differences in Harry. It has 3 stories and the 4th is just in its infancy.

Honestly, the hardest part has been these authors slowing their pace of writing. I find myself checking daily for updates, hoping that one of the three has provided me with new material. I know Alexandra Quick has been years, but I understand Verarity is still working on the next installment. MarauderLover7 is an every-other week author nowadays but that's just enough to keep me happy. Northumbrian is a bit all over the place but has recently been writing again and the newest installments are a joy (I'm just dying for him/her to pick back up on linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh). Probably the best non-one shot Northumbrian work).
