I like quite a few fics more than canon. Many more. Canon suffers from plot holes and dei ex machina. But what harms canon the most is JKR changing the roles of the novels from children's literature/fairy tale genre to teen literature. She also tried to go kinda towards epic fantasy but...it did not work. At all.

That said, canon has very few technical errors (e.g. grammar, spelling, etc.) and did create a whole world, even if much of it seems to not be covered. Fanfiction is by default at best matching the second good aspect, and I've yet to read a fic that had technical precision on the level of a published novel.

That aside, I'm also not a kid anymore. I was when I read canon, but my tastes have changed and matured (I hope). Fanfiction can fill that genre, whereas canon is forever stuck.

There are few fics which I think are actually semi-objectively better, however.

*The Firebird Trilogy* linkffn(Firebird's Son). This nails realism, has fairly extensive world-building, large scale, and has very good technicals to boot. This is the best HP fanfiction written in my mind, and it sits at the top of my favorites.

*A Black Comedy* Already linked in this topic. It kinda requires you have some knowledge of canon to work to its fullest, but it's wonderful. Enough said by everyone else here, too.

Those might be the only two that I think are better than canon, and A Black Comedy is kinda iffy since it relies on it a bit for backstory.

As for ones I like more and consider at least canon's equal...Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, Delenda Est, Denarian Trilogy, Reign of Power (technical aspects need a lot of work, but otherwise it's wonderful), An Old and New World, Narcotic Effects, Coping Methods, and Intoxication. I might've missed some...but yeah.

In general, I like these fics better because of a sense of realism that canon just fails to find. They also generally avoid writing pitfalls, and I can ignore the technical errors enough (and they are few enough) for them not to overly bother me.

Not sure if you wanted a ffnbot dump so I'll avoid linking the others in my list.
