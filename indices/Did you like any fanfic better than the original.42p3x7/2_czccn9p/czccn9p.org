The fanfiction that comes closest to canon for me is linkffn(Weasley girl) I'm actually wondering why that person is writing fanfiction and not publishing her own books. Although I suppose borrowing someone else's world is a lot easier than creating your own.

Still it's not as good as canon though, not even close.
