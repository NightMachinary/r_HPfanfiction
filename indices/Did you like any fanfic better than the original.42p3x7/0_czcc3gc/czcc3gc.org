I prefer fanfiction in general over canon now. There is just so much more to the world in fanfics. But fanfic authors have an advantage in that the world and characters are already built, they just then get to take that landscape and run with it. Forever Knight, Bungle in the Jungle, sword of the hero trilogy, denarian trilogy, summer of change, etc. many of those stories are just as dear to my heart as canon.
