That sounds like a time-travel fic I read where Harry stands up to Malfoy for the Weasley family on the train like just right after meeting Ron, and Ron is very confused how Harry knows so much about his family. He goes on a rant about how great each member of the Weasley family is. I don't remember the title, though.
