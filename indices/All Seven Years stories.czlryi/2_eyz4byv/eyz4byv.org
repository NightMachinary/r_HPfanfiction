I like ones that deal with the trauma/ptsd of kids going back to school after either being at war or getting traumatized at the Death Eater's Hogwarts. It's great when it's acknowledged that the kids aren't going to be as trusting of adults or even their peers when you know some of your classmates have done some pretty horrible stuff to stay alive.

I hate when 7th year fics do Draco in leather pants. Like, Draco isn't a monster, but he isn't cool or charismatic and his minor redemption should not be an excuse to make Hermione/Harry/other love interest forgive his racism and bullying and date him.
