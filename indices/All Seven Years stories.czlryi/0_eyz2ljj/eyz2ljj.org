I've only read a handful myself, being relatively new to the fandom, but I personally love it when they go all the way off the rails and blaze their own trail. I like alternate sorting, when it's given the weight that kind of life-defining choice deserves. I don't like it when changes are introduced, but don't seem to affect anything. I like seeing things from other perspectives, even OC inserts.

I haven't found nearly enough Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw-centric stories, though I'm sure they're out there. I'm tired of Gryffindor-centric stories, and am working my way through the Slytherin ones. (I really liked Changeling.)

I think following canon too closely is my biggest problem with the longer stories. If you only want to diverge at year 4, you don't need to rewrite the first three to do it. Just start at the divergence point. Maybe write a brief summary for the first three years that your OC was tagging along with Harry or whatever, but at a certain point I just don't care to read someone's rewrite of Philosopher's Stone unless it's going to be different.
