The one thing that peeves me the most in full-saga fics is the excessive reliance on stations of the canon. Seriously, don't be afraid to change things up. Let someone else get the diary and then make that be the major mystery in second year. If some canon events still happen, then they don't /need/ to happen to Harry and friends. Maybe someone else gets detention in Harry's first year and meets Quirrell in the forest.

Something I really like is fics that put Harry in different friend groups. You mentioned alternate sorting fics, and I like those mostly because they put the characters in situations where they are more likely to become friends with different people than the ones that formed in canon.
