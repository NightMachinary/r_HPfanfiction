Stations of the canon should be a loose structure around which to build a story, not a hard and definite structure. Seriously, it's fine if you take the general premise of each year (year one is the third floor corridor, year 2 is the diary opening the chamber, year three is an Azkaban break-out, and so on), but making every event happen the same way each time even when there's no reason to? Is Colin /always/ going to get petrified? At least change it up a bit! Not everything needs to play out the same way each time!
