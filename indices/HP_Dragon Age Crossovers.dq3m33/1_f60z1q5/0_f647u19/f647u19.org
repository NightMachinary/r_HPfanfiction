Considering that difficulty, I would suggest not to start in Origins as that part of the game can be a real pain considering the choose-your-hero type start. It'll all go to hell there.

I've always thought about starting a fic in Kirkwall/during the Inquisition where the plot is more defined. A MoD!Harry dropping in during the prologue or the midst of the Mage/Templar war will have more potential IMO. There are so many paths that story could take considering Hawke and the Inquisitor's actions. Place a Harry (after-blood-war!Harry not pre) that's considered an Apostate who can learn from comparing notes from an Alive!Bethany in the Mage's Circle or a Mage!Hawke and the story line would write itself.

Inquisition on the other hand would be interesting because Harry can be dropped in the middle of it all trying to learn new stuff and helping out other Mages.

Yes it is obvious I sided with the mages in Inquisition and DA2. Lol
