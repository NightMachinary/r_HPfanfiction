Sinyk is pretty similar to Robst in the sorts of plots he has, but he doesn't the writing skill that carries Robst's fics to readable levels. His fic "Harry Potter and the Daft Morons", in particular, feels like an angrier, less literate Robst wrote it. It's coincidentally one of the few fics I couldn't get myself to finish reading, along with Harry Crow and a few select others.

I get that you're looking for this sort of fics, but I'd feel bad if I didn't point out that there's a lot of better authors out there.
