I didn't mean it that bad ... all three of them have some good stories (“Harry Potter and the Lady Thief” and “Democracy” are unquestionably good ones), all of them are hard-core Harmony fans (which, just to be clear on this, is not a bad thing /per se/), all three of them had unfortunate tendency to fall for bashing and schematic stereotypes. For robst and old-crow it is difficult to be too hard on them for falling into stereotypes, when they invented most of them.
