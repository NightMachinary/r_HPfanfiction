There is "Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool", which is a fem!Harry x Tonks fic I remember to be enjoyable (despite my usual dislike of first-person POV) linkffn(8175132)

Also has Harry as a teacher, which is interesting. The whole thing is... out there, but entertaining.

I think there isn't much good around in regards to this premise (after what Taure already posted), so if you're interested, here are some links to Google Docs of my own /mediocre/ attempts at the genre to blunt the edge. They're all unedited, first sketch, so be prepared for that, if you decide to click.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kbSh1Y2n_3g_xIIG32VkWvNgKssKGLfIDWgQNhR8qsE/edit?usp=sharing][Virgo Potter]] (Harry is trans, changes voluntarily), [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9RJLmXcPJx7iJc4hbmFBJgTY_aOum0rjJgIOiwEFwg/edit?usp=sharing][A Witch's Problem]] (involuntary, but Harry copes quickly), [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBAaNj5RWAp0-85l1c6VzyjAUDrU8rLbjE7GcvFhfGU/edit?usp=sharing][Old Worlds, Modern Souls]] (Harry is reborn in medieval times in the body of a many-times great-aunt, Alrun. Has the sex-swap element in there, but isn't really focused on - so much so that I had considered to eliminate it completely.)
