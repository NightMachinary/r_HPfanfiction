EDIT: Oh shit, I didn't see "no metamorphamagus". Well, in SoP-DoB, Harry's a meta, but isn't like Tonks with free range, its only always a full transition, and the fic is divided by his transformation, "first" book is Harry, "second" book is Melania. Its quite good though, if you can stomach the idea of a meta Harry.
