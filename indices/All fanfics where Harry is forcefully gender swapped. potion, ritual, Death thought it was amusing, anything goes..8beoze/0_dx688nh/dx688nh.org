To Reach Without is the best written and most serious of these. Unfortunately its main focus is angst/armchair psychology and the gender change is largely ignored in favour of working through overblown Dursley-related emotional issues, something which could have been done equally in a male Harry fic. It also introduces concepts which rob the genre of some of its most interesting elements: for example, the author introduces the idea that the wizarding world does not have any nudity taboo, removing the dilemma over whether it's okay for newly fem!Harry to occupy women-only spaces (e.g. dorms, changing rooms), and how the women (and Harry) will feel about that.

Effects and After Effects is an angst-filled slog filled with loads of indy!Harry tropes besides (plus Muggle wank). But you can skim through 95% of the fic to just read the genderbender parts.

Chosen One Has Knockers is crackish smut but is enjoyable for its lack of angst.
