  He's been broken by the war, by the deaths he's seen and by the things he's done. But when he wakes up in the Marvel Universe, Harry Potter wonders if it's life's way of giving him a second chance. This will be about a man, tested by the sands of time becoming who he was meant to be. Some say it's luck, some don't know and even if he refuses to admit it, he knows it's his destiny.
