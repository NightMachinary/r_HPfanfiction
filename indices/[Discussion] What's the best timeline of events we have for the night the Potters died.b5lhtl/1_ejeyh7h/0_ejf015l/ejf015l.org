Most of this is fine, though the conversation between McGonagall and Dumbledore in the series prologue indicates that they hadn't spoken. In fact I expect she went there to see him more than anything else which indicates that Dumbledore was exceptionally busy during and following the events of that night.

If we're creating a story around it instead of just laying out the timeline I think a planned distraction of some sort coinciding with Voldemorts attack makes sense.
