Yeah, I'll have to revise that. Albus would have dug up the address for Lily's sister under her married name, then told Hagrid that he would need to bring Harry there (without telling him why) well after nightfall, assuring him that the street with all the lights burnt out would be his destination. During a Floo call gossip, Hagrid would have mentioned to the irate McGonagall that he 'was meeting' wi' Professor Dumbledore later' if she hadn't caught up to him yet.

Motivated by her preference to get the facts straight from the source and curious as to why some address in the middle of muggle suburbs would be worth the attention, she went there and spied on them. We can only assume that it was a weekend or that her classes had been cancelled, since Hogwarts would have been in session around Hallowe'en.
