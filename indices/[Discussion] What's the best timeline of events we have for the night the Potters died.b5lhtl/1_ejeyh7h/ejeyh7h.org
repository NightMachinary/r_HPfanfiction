As far as canon cues go, [[/u/EpicBeardMan]] has the accurate information.

In my head-canon, I put together what was known and what seemed reasonable and came up with this:

Wormtail led Voldemort to Godric's Hollow and pointed out the house to him- there's no way Voldemort would accept him just telling him and no doubt suspected a possible trap. Wormtail watched as the Dark Lord entered the house; heard the shouts and saw the spellfire. When the sacrifice reflected the Killing curse onto the Dark Lord, but couldn't actually kill him, it resulted in a physical effect that blew up Voldemort's body and the top of the Potter's house along with it.

Wormtail saw this, ran up to see what had happened, noted the wreckage and probably apparated to Harry's room to see that the Dark Lord's robes were empty except for ashes, and grabbed the wand (no doubt sticking out of the wall nearby). He then fled.

Dumbledore detected the situation at the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow mere minutes after Voldemort killed Lily. Albus sent Hagrid to the Dumbledore family house in the village via the Floo with orders to sneak over and see what's what.

Hagrid did so, found Harry and then encountered Sirius, who had come when his own tricks revealed that his friends were exposed and/or dead. Sirius gave over his bike to Hagrid and then changed into Padfoot so that he could track down Wormtail by the scent he had left at the scene.

Hagrid returned to Dumbledore's house and Floo-called to tell him who survived, and he was directed to fly Harry to Madame Pomfrey's house in Swansea. Dumbledore then sent Pomfrey home from Hogwarts to check Harry over (as they couldn't trust St. Mungos to be safe and bringing Harry to Hogwarts would take hours since sending him through the Floo or Apparating might harm him), while Dumbledore headed to the scene to investigate. Barely an hour had passed since the Potters died.

Hagrid, bored at Pomfreys but ordered to stay at hand with the cycle, started chatting with other Order members via the Floo. Dumbledore called Pomfrey from his house, because he had detected an unusual protection from around the remains of Harry's crib. He ordered Pomfrey to keep Harry safe for the day while Dumbledore figured out how to leverage this.

Hagrid, still bored and listening in, called back his gossip friends to update them about Dumbledore's findings- 'Harry killed Voldemort, uh huh!'

Albus came up with a possible solution, but found that there weren't many Evans' left alive for some reason. He ordered McGonagall to Surrey to check out his best prospect.

About here was when Albus started getting inundated with Floo calls from various and sundry, asking for info on Harry vs. Voldemort. He spent what time he wasn't researching blood-based protections doing spin control over everything that Hagrid was heard to say (and given Hagrid's accent, much misinterpretation was at play).

That evening Albus arranged for Hagrid to deliver Harry to the Dursleys, meeting McGonagall there even though she'd already confirmed that they are Lily's family, and not cannibal serial-killers. The letter was the keystone of sustaining Harry's protection, and it relied on Petunia accepting the role of substitute parent and host. She did, and the rest is history.
