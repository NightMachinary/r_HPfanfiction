--------------

There is some lost time. Hagrid didn't spend 24 hours traveling. There is a passing of information from Hagrid to McGonagall, but not directly since she's only heard rumor.

Someone talked and information about Harry's part in Voldemort's death. Though this rumor alone isn't what spurred wizards into celebration. When Voldemort was defeated his power broke, those who had been cursed by him came back to themselves. The death eaters noticed his spells breaking and their dark marks faded. Only the most fanatic kept activity the others went defensive, protecting themselves.

Another consideration is Voldemort's wand. Which was at Godric's Hallow, then comes into his possess in GoF. The line between those runs most directly through Wormtail. So he might've been present that night.
