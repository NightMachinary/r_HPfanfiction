Rough timeline in my headcanon:

- Voldemort kills James and Lily and gets himself "killed"
- Immediately, Death Eaters feels a surge of magic in their Dark Marks, which then proceeds to almost vanish, catching their attention, and the Fidelius fails
- Peter realizes something is wrong and goes to Godric's Hollow. He notices James' and Lily's deaths, finds Voldemort's wand and (tries to) go underground (he is a coward and doesn't really care for either side of the war, so leaves Harry alone)
- Dumbledore, probably using one of his many devices, gets a heads up on James and Lily's deaths and Harry's survival and goes to Hagrid, instructing him what to do, and explains his plan to McGonagall. He then proceeds to deal with the fallout in the Ministry
- McGonagall decides to investigate the living situation of the Dursleys
- Severus, noticing his Dark Mark acting oddly, after talking to other Death Eaters over what is going on, eventually approaches Godric's Hollow out of worry for Lily. He's devastated over her death, but Apparates away as someone (Sirius) approaches
- Sirius finds Godric's Hollow in ruins and is devastated over James and Lily's deaths and vows to keep Harry safe.
- Hagrid shows up, confronts Sirius about Harry by instructions from Dumbledore, overruling him, and, using Sirius' motorcycle, drives to the Dursleys. Sirius, realizing Peter sold them out, goes to hunt him down
- (Other) Death Eaters (via Ministry moles) realize that Voldemort is somehow "dead". The Lestranges and Barty Crouch Jr. talk to each other over what to do and in the end (after several days) decides to confront the Longbottoms
- The rest of the Wizarding World is made aware of Voldemort's "death" and celebrates, to the point where Muggles notices odd things
- Sirius finds Peter and confronts him. Peter blows up a street and escapes. Sirius gets hysterical that Peter got an one-over on him, misleading Ministry officials into believing him to have been the traitor
- Dumbledore, being done with the Ministry for the time, confronts Snape about the fallout, to make sure he doesn't do something stupid after Dumbledore's own end of their bargain wasn't upheld (The /"I thought you were going to keep her safe" .../ scene)
- Hagrid and Dumbledore reaches the Dursleys. McGonagall has concluded that the Dursley living situation is very dubious and confronts Dumbledore about it, but is overruled. Dumbledore delivers Harry on the doorstep with a letter
- The Dursleys take Harry in
