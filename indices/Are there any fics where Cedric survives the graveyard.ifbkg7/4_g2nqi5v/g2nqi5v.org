I read one a long time ago where Tom (I think it was the Diary Horcrux) and Harry are working together or friends can't really remember. What I do remember is that Harry begs Tom to save Cedric ( I think they knew what Voldemort was going to do and planned ahead) and Tom ends up making Cedric a Horcrux ( I think). And Cedric joins them or becomes and ally. I honestly cant' remember much but I'm going to see if I can find it and post a link.
