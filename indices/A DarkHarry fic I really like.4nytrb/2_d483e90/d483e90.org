  After Dumbledore's death, Harry is left powerless; and alone. Or so he thinks. A squib turns around his life and he suddenly finds himself behind the mask of a guardian. Fate had other plans, however. Harry becomes the very thing he despises and begins a cruel game which blurs the line between good and evil. Post HBP, no Hocruxes, Dark!Harry, Anti-Hero!Harry, AU [85% Complete]
