linkffn(Black Family Business by Nargled) is a nice one. linkffn(It Could Only Happen At Hogwarts by Inusitatus) doesn't have much direct humiliation of Draco, but there is some. And there's some in linkffn(The Easy Way by Kolarthecool).

In This Means War ([[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/]]), it is publicly insinuated that Draco is gay, which you may or may not consider to be humiliating. When I was the age of the characters (about 50 years ago), that kind of public declaration would have been devastating to anyone.

I'm aware of two stories in which a 'finite' shot at Draco (by McGonagall in one story to "un-ferret" him, and by Harry in the other) undoes the effect of a potion Draco didn't know about that was administered by his father. The potion, in both cases, turned a female child male so that Lucius could have a male heir. That's at least embarrassing and awkward, and could easily lead to humiliation. The first one is The Wizard That Never Was, by deathdevil ([[http://s3.zetaboards.com/FanFictionFederation/topic/9004704/1/]]). Note: the link gets redirected, and a lot of the formatting/punctuation doesn't appear to be present. I don't have a link for the second one; I suspect it's actually one chapter out of someone's "odds and ends" file.
