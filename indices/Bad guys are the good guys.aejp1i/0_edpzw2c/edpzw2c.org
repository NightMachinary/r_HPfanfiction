linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) fits this criteria. It's an AU where Voldemort won and is ruling wizarding Britain. He is still not a good person, but he is a good leader and builds a society that works well even if some things in it are somewhat unethical. The fic is from the perspective of the death eaters so they are the "good guys" even if they are not particularly good or light.

Dumbledore's order had flee to Europe after they lost the first war. The are the antagonists of the fic and sometimes end up in the role of "terrorists" who attack Hogwarts and surrounding area in opposition to Voldemort.

Harry's parents run away to Europe after the prophecy was made so Neville was targeted and killed instead. Harry ends up in Britain after his parents are killed in a burglary and becomes Voldemorts protege at Hogwarts. He doesn't fully support Voldemort and is still a good and righteous person at heart but he is on Voldemorts side throughout the fic.
