A Black comedy is one I've always meant to read but kind of managed to fall to the bottom of my virtual pole of books. I'll dig it back up and give it a read.

Limpieza de sangre is probably one of my favorite fics. I remember having trouble getting into the sequel, but I'll give it another look and see if its improved in the past months.

Seventh Horcrux: I see this one recommended a lot and I read a good portion of it, but I usually prefer my fics to have a more serious tone to them.

I'll check out thunderstorm, never heard of it before.
