Here are some where Voldemort is saner and has goals to overthrow/revamp the corrupt regime in wizarding Britain.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - Voldemort successfully steals the Philosopher's Stone and kidnaps Harry at the end of year 1. He returns to his original goal of revolution to improve the wizarding world. (Dumbledore antagonist) linkffn(11358664)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] - In year 4 Harry discovers that Dumbledore has been using legilimency to control him. He begins to research the previous war and realizes that most of what he thought he knew was propaganda. (Heavy Dumbledore and Ron bashing, but some interesting world building.) linkffn(8163784)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - A WBWL Slytherin!Harry fic that is currently midway through book 5. Harry starts out being against Voldemort and the Deatheaters, but he slowly realizes that their goals are more sensible than he has been lead to believe, and by the end of book four he knows that Voldemort is not the psychotic sadist the light portrays him as. First book in the series is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]. (Dumbledore and James Potter antagonists) linkao3(12608820)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] - Hermione is transported to an alternate universe in which Riddle and his pureblood allies are literally revolutionaries working against the cruel tyrannical regime lead by Dumbledore. (Almost everyone on the 'light' side in the original series is an antagonist in the alternate universe) linkffn(4025300)

And here are some in which Voldemort wins his revolution to reshape the world to his idealized vision:
