My favourite is:

#+begin_quote
  Harry froze. Hagrid never called him Potter, and, come to think of it, when did Hagrid get red eyes? Suddenly, it all clicked. *"Hagrimort?*"
#+end_quote

from Harry Potter and teh Sparkly Hufflepuff.

Another one is:

#+begin_quote
  Melissa glanced between Harry and Ginny. "Is Ginny short for anything?" "Vaginny!" Harry answered immediately hoping his voice wouldn't crack. "*It's short for Vaginny*."
#+end_quote

I know it could be an old joke. But I had never heard it before.
