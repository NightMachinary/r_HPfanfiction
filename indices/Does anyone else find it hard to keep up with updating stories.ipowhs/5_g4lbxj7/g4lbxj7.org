17 years ago when the fanfic community was at the beginning I found it quite easy because there were not all that many fics that peaked my interest (a lot was just crappy smut and few overall well written stories). During the lockdown earlier this year my interest returned and what I've found is that there are so many good fics that are complete that I don't even bother with WIPs.
