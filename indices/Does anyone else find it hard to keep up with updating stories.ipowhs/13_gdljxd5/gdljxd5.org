I just cannot read updating stories, realistically even if they take a week to upload, ive already jumped over a few dozens of fics or so and i barely remember the plot of the one which was being updated. And i have a very active imagination so my mind jumps over so many possible situations over the week or more, that i stay distracted most of the time. While i understand that authors stagger the chapters to gain a following or are uploading as they write, in my opinion it would be easier for me as a reader to read the complete fic at once. Also when the author is updating as they write and then for some reason or the other the fic gets abandoned or months go by before updating, the excitement for the story goes down and i end up not bothering to finish it.
