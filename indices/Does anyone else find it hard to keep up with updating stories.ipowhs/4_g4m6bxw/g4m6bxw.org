There's generally two kinds of I'm subscribed to: the kind that has good writing, solid characterization, and a new take on ideas, or the kind that's a decent read and mildly interesting. If it's the first kind, I'll reread the last 20k or even start from the beginning. For the second kind, I reread the previous chapter.
