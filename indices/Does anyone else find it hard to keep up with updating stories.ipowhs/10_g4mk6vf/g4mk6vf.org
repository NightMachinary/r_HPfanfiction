It's not personally an issue for me because I almost /exclusively/ read completed fics. If the fic in question has not been updated in the last three months, I will usually give it a pass and I absolutely refuse to read anything that is abandoned, simply because I despise the disappointment of investing myself in a story only for it to never resolve. As such, it takes a special fanfiction to draw me in as it updates. I am currently only following three (/Harry Potter, Squatter/, /the Prince of Slytherin/ and /Blue/ which is an Avatar fanfiction).
