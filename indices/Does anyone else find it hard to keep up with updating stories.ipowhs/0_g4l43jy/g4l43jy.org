If the fic updates quickly enough - usually up to about every fortnight or so - I'll usually remember most everything myself and be prompted to remember everything I don't by the new chapter. I have a good memory for other people's stories.

If it updates less regularly than that, that's when I usually need to go back and start rereading (assuming it's not a 2-million word epic, anyway) and I usually go between one and five chapters back, so it works pretty well on keeping me up to date.
