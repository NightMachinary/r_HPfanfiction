I am currently following 103 fics that are activly updating. (And an additional 256 that haven't updated in 6+months) of the 103 wip's i only read 10 of them when they update, while i wait for the rest to finish. I just simply cannot keep having to refresh my memory every 1-3 months of what happened in all of them.

If someone doesnt update for 3 months, ill stop reading until they finish the story, because i will have forgotten too much :(
