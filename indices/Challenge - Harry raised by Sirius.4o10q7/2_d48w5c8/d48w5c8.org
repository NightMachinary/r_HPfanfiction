This sounds like a dime-a-dozen, seen it a thousand times before, tedious drudgery of a fic.

You know what really annoys me about this idea? It isn't even that it's clich√© - I can deal with that. It's that it takes Harry Potter as a character and ruins him for me. What makes Harry great is that he comes from a shitty environment, and ends up great anyway. It ties into the whole theme of one's choices defining them.

It's meant to highlight how much of a better person Harry is in comparison to Voldemort - who was raised in a similar way.

So yeah, this idea is stupid, I've seen it before, and I hate it. Also, tumblr is the cancer of the internet. That's not really relevant, just felt like saying it.
