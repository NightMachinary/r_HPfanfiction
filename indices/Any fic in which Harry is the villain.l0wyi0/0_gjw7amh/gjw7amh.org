I am working on a story where Harry ends up adopting Snidely Whiplash, the villain of the Dudley DoRight cartoons. So Harry is raised with an understanding of the Whiplash version of Evil, that being, "Just because you're evil, you don't have to be an asshole."

Harry arrives at Hogwarts (because, of course, he did) and is promptly sorted into the House of Evil Overlords (Hufflepuff) and immediately spots the Hero of the Story: Draco Malfoy.

Draco is the hero, because of his impeccable grooming, something he and Dudley DoRight share, though if he were honest, Harry expected his story's hero to have more of a chin.

Poor Pansy Parkinson finds herself frequently kidnapped and tied to Railroad tracks, and occasionally to the feeder track of the never before mentioned Hogwarts Saw Mill. Oddly Draco never shows up to rescue her, and Draco doesn't have a horse like Dudley, but Greg and Vinnie happen along occasionally and Harry figures that between the two of them they are almost as smart as a horse, so they count.

Pansy is a bit torn as to her reaction to these kidnappings, as they aren't just kidnapping. Harry always has a catered lunch laid out for the two of them (because he paid attention to how his dad treated Nell Fenwick) and Pansy is confused why this odd boy in the opera cape, top hat, and drawn on mustache is treating her better than Draco ever has.

She starts to look forward to her weekly kidnapping because other than the whole 'tied to a railroad track' thing it's quite fun. Ultimately, sometime in their 6th year, Pansy derails (Ha! Derails, I kill me) Harry's plans and takes him to bed, where Harry finally figures out what the whole fuss was about.

Over the years, Harry's plots against Draco, all of them failing miserably, end up ruining all of Voldemort's plots, and makes him long for death.
