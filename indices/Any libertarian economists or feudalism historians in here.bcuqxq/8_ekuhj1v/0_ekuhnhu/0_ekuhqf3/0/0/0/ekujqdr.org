I'm going AU though and trying to make it make sense. ;) Afaik in canon it's never stated, but JKR said it's roughly 5 pounds to a Galleon. Calculating from the prices we see in canon, though, 25 pounds makes more sense as far as purchasing power. But JKR is notoriously atrocious at math, so I'm basically ignoring all numbers she mentions anywhere. :P

The problem with a currency market is that there's only one place exchanges are made: Gringotts. That's a powerful monopoly.
