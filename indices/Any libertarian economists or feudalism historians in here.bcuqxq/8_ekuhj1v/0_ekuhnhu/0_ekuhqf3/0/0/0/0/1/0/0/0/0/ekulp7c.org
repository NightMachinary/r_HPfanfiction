Actually, that's one thing that absolutely wouldn't work. Wizards /can't/ use muggle currency. It's worthless for them because it's impossible to know if it's counterfeit or not. You can duplicate non-goblin money endlessly and perfectly with magic and so it's impossible to trust. Goblins provide indestructible, untransfigurable, verified, precious currency charmed to be endlessly storable and weightless (among other features, in my AU anyway). No other currency can compete with it.
