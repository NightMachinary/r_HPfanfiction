Yet you are discriminating against Muggle born. By not allowing the use of muggle currency you have made muggle currency illegal therefore no need for an exchange in the first place. Goblin currency may have more security but by elminating competition you aren't achieving a Libertarian economy. A free market economy has multiple currencies being accepted. In a free market I could trade eggs for a wand. Use pounds to buy a butter beer. A Libertarian economy is a free market.
