Yes. * sigh * I know. You don't need to convince me of that, you know. :D In a free wizarding economy you'd have multiple banks with different currencies protected from magical counterfeiting. Eventually that'll happen in my story, but for most of it the wizards couldn't care less about a free market.

The interesting bit is that their main motivation for regulation and government ownership of the means of production (socialism) isn't redistribution but security because of the Statute. Any brainstorms on how that changes the way they constrict trade?
