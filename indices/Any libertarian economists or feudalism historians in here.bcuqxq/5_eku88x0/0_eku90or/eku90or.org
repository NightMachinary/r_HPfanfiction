Nice! I'm not a pure ancap, but pretty close. I'm wanting to try and hammer out the interplay of how I have the goblins work, plus the pseudo-post-scarcity of wizarding society with magic, plus the regulations and restrictions of a near-fascist Ministry, etc. I need to figure out exchange rates, income levels, and the general market scale, etc. Interested in chatting sometime?
