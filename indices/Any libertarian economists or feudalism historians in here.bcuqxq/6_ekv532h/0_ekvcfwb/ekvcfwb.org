Haha! Yeah, so, lemme 'splain. Basically, the wizarding world is socialist, nearly fascist, and heavily feudal (in their own way). But it's different from normal socialism because the motivation is the Statute rather than redistribution. I'm hoping to brainstorm with people the ramifications of that, and libertarians understand better than most the failings of socialism. If I was brainstorming with a socialist I'd be spending most of my time arguing economics instead of world building. :D Make more sense?
