Wizarding feudalism is a system of hierarchical land ownership and access to magical power, creating clear class distinctions, presided over by the Wizengamot. This exists in parallel to the Ministry, which uses bureaucracy to regulate every aspect of life in an authoritarian, ultranationalist, isolationist regimentation. This is a unique blend of all of the above and doesn't particularly match any historical precedent. The more I explore it the more unique it appears.
