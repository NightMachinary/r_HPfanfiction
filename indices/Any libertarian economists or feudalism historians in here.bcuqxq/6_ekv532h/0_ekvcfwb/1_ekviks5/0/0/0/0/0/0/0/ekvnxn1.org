There are semi-feudal examples with bureaucracies like the Byzantium empire and some Chinese history (Zhou Dynasty pops up), though, as o it's not unheard of.

The issue is ripe for contention, as we saw in the parliamentary wars in England. But there's a way for it to work if you give the nobles the power of delegation. So the Wizengamot enacts laws (like American Congress) that then are turned into regulations by the Ministry (like the Departments). The Ministry is subordinate to the nobles who retain their feudal power, but don't have to be bothered by the detail work.
