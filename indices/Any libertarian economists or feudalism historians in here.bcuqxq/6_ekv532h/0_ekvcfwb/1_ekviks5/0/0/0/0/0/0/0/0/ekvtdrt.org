The thing is that the byzantium empire is not feudal. Zhou i dont know but that is not a country with a strong bureaucracy there is a different emperor every side of the mountain... Engeland did not have a strong bureaucracy.

The subordination is not the problem the transfer of power is. Do you understand?
