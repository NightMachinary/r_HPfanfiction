Well there isnt a feudal society with a powerfull bureaucracy in history.

The conflict is there in any feudal society to be honest. Imagine being a powerfull landowner who basically governs himself and all beneath him. Are you going to tolerate it that the goverment is hoarding power? Attracting more and more means to actually tell you what to do and back that order up with force? The awnser is no.

Only when feudalism basically stopped functioning and the masses gained ecnomic power goverment was able to build a strong beaurocracy and that meant the end of the land owning class. Not immediately but that was the start of the end. So those things simply do not go hand in hand.
