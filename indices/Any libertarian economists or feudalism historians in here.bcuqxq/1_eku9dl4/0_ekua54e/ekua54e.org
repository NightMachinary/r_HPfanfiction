Oh that stuff is like crack for me, haha.

... well literally everything I can think of, tbh. But at the moment I'm hashing out the daily life details since I've gotten most of the big world-dev stuff rough hewn enough to know where I'm going with it and have something to go on. And I'm mulling over a sort of feudal structure but with a very bureaucratic Ministry that's more modern, but with the Statute and the goblins and magic screwing everything up so I can't just cut and paste a particular historical practice. I'm a bit OCD about thinking through consequences of world building choices, lol.

But your comment about food and fashion is very pertinent to some of the other bits I'm tackling atm, too. I'm still stuck on male wizarding robes, for example. And food plays a big part in my feudal structure, too.
