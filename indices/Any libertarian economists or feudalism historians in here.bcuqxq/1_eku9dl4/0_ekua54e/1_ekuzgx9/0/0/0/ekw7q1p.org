Indeed. In my AU I'm going for if you survive 2 years you'll likely live to your thirties, which is when most occupational hazards and disease vulnerabilities peak. If you survive that, you'll most likely live past 100. After that it's mostly dependent on your magical power and gender (males outlive females, due to magical menopause): average witches will live to around 100, wizards to 150; exceptional mages will live another 50 or so; and world class sorcerers like Dumbledore would live a natural life up to 300 years or so. Flamel lived over twice that, and in my AU he's going strong and looks like [[https://imgur.com/gallery/iIivc][Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter]] -- age just doesn't affect him.

So definitely a huge societal lag. :)
