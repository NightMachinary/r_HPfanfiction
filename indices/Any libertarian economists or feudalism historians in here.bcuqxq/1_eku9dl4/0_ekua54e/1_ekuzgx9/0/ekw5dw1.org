Aha, there it is! Haha.

I'm thinking that wizarding society evolves glacially compared even to medieval times, because of the long generations. And magical bonds and wards aren't easily updated or modified, so revolutionary changes in real estate management would be few and far between. So when they did their hard fork at the end of the 17th century they were already advocating preservation of the older ways, and wouldn't have changed much since then. Viable?
