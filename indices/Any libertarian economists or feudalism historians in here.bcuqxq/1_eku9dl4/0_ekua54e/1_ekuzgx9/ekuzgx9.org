Feudalism, strictly speaking stopped being a thing for 90% of Europe after the black death. A good short while before the Early Modern Period started. *

Now for Feudalism it's self that is a bigger issue as most people love [[https://westerneuropefeudalism.weebly.com/uploads/4/6/0/8/46087777/3554982_orig.png?335][this]], and indeed it might be considered the archetype of Feudalism and how it should work. We do know that in reality it might be rather lopsided. Take England and France up trough the 100 years war. Where England was a king of England and a duke of France at the same time. Allowing the English king to alternatively use England as a source to secure his power in France and his french lands as a source to secure his powers in England.And then the always lovely HRE: Where power was always consolidating and dividing itself. At least until the Hapsburg got into power. And then there's the Golden Bull of 1356 that constitutionalised (Or at least as good as) which princes was eligible for electing the next Emperor. And here again we see a lot of the same power dynamics of larger princes getting territory that is outside the HRE and not bringing it in as it'd allow them to have an external source with which to challenge others within the empire and usually being capable of drawing in other empire states to defend their territories from outside threats.

I'm home from Uni right now so I only brought the actual medieval book with me, but if I can I'll try to give a more in depth aid to less broad questions.
