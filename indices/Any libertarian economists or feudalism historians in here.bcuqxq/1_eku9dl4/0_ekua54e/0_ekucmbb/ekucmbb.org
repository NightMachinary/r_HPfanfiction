That sounds like an interesting fic! Is is a long fic? Since you said it spans from feudalism up through the Early Modern Period. The consequences of world building are the best but super hard to do. I've been rattling my brain on what would happen if you had people actively trying to break the Statute of Secrecy.

Since everything was so classed based back then you'd have to break down what info you needed by class and era.

I'd look to cultures where robes where the norm to get some ideas. For male wizarding robes I'd look at ancient Chinese robes and see how the male and female clothing differ. Not exactly copy the style but make bullet points at how the two are separate like clothing cuts or accessories. Here's a tumblr post where someone wrote how they think Hogwarts robes should have been like based on book evidence: [[http://thereisareaper.tumblr.com/post/132276464879/hogwarts-school-uniform]] Also I have no evidence for this but I get the feeling that the image we have a wizarding robes (like from DnD) has some bases in western monk clothes.

Don't even get me started on food! I wouldn't know where to stop.
