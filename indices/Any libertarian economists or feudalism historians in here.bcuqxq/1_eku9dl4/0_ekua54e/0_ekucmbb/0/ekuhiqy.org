Thanks a million for that link! I love that kind of analysis. Though I'm still wondering how in the world they ride broomsticks with robes like that.

It's planned to be 8 books (possibly becoming 9...) rewriting the Hogwarts years, but I'm emphasizing the fact that the wizarding world forked off from the muggle world in the 17th century, and that when a population isolates itself it tends to stagnate and regress rather than progress forward. And with longer lifespans, wizarding culture would be more influenced by generations further back, reducing change and reinforcing tradition. So their mindsets and culture would be still back in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period. Huge culture shock for muggleborns!

Food is a big deal!!! :D I'm having fun developing culinary charms and such, and now I've decided on my interpretation of the transfiguration rules, I have a better idea of what they can and can't do with food.

Btw, the latter portions of my series will revolve heavily around the Statute and its fall. ;) If you're interested in seeing more of what I'm going for, [[https://brilliantshard.wordpress.com/what-you-can-expect/][here's a page on my blog about it.]]
