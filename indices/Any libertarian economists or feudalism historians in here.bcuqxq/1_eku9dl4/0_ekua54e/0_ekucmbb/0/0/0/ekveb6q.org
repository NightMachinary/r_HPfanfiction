Haha, I did think of side saddle quidditch actually. I mean, it's how broomstick riding was depicted historically I believe. But I was just thinking, what about a bifurcated and pleated robe kind of like the [[https://www.google.com/search?q=hakama&tbm=isch&oq=hakama][Japanese Hakama?]] It has a very wizarding robe-like feel to it that I love, and would be practical for quidditch, dueling, riding, whatever.

I was really impressed with linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) and how she incorporated broomstick riding into daily life. Family-size broomsticks with a 'trunk' and a sort of road system above the clouds, etc.

I'll look into those, videos, thanks! :D

Yeah, I think there are a lot of inhibitory regulations making muggle imports very expensive and difficult, so only wizarding nobles would get the benefit of muggle culinary globalization, and there's also a lot of barriers to concourse between wizarding covens (i.e. between the Britannic Coven and the French Coven etc.), so foreign magical ingredients would also be at a premium, so there would be a sharp divide between classes and their diets.

I'd love to read that! I started a thread on here a while back talking about where I'm going with it in my story, I'll have to dig it up and link you.

Glad to hear you're interested! :)
