I guess cause the Catholic church made Italy a power house for a long time. When I think politically powerful country during European history I think of Italy. Any plans for the British East Indian Company? The company did play a huge role in strengthening the Britain naval force which in turn made Britain a force to be reckoned with even though it's just a small island. I'd imagine your AU would have intense British national pride since the Britannia Empire wouldn't be that too far back in their own family history.
