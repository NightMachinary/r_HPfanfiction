Do you know the history on why brooms became associated with woman and later on witches? It's cause of beer. The image we have of witches (pointy hats, broomsticks, cat familiars) are tied to the history of women making beer. [[https://brewhoppin.com/2015/10/the-truth-of-women-and-beer-witches/]] It leads me to wonder how big a role alcohol plays in the wizarding world. Alcohol plays a huge role in any society especially what kind you drink and where it came from (for example when Britain and France were at war the rich would drink Port from Portugal instead of wine from France). Beer was consumed as the main drink cause water wasn't safe. For a long time babies went straight from breast milk to weak beer. But wizards can create water with magic. So would proper pure bloods reject alcohol and other vices? Would they be hypocrites and denounce them while secretly enjoying them? Or is it not a big deal like it is in modern Britain?

Witchcraft has a fascinating history with feudalism/early capitalism and how basically it was a threat to those in power. Might be something worth looking into.

While it would look neat to have pants like that and my mind did go to them at first I don't know if they'd be practical at least for quidditch. I honestly don't mind the movie version of the quidditch outfits, but my main issue is the robe because that should cause serious drag on the player shouldn't it? At least the seeker's uniform shouldn't have it. Cultures like the wizarding world that have a difficult time changing rapidly would be more conservative with their clothing. Also the more fabric and layers you have equals to being more rich. Taking up more space with your clothing shows how important you are. A Japanese Hakama pants style would work for dueling, riding, everyday wear.

Haven't read Victoria Potter yet but it's on my list to read.

This is what I was gonna post about the Statute. It's just some questions and ideas I had if there was a group that didn't like the Statute and was trying to break it: "I'm not talking about Voldemort and his Death Eaters in wanting to take over the world and prove that wizards are supreme to everyone else. I'm talking about people who believe the separation of the two societies was a mistake to begin with and want to fix the situation because the longer it goes on, the worst it'll be when the two finally clash.

Are they considered a terrorist group? Or maybe an extremist group?

Is it being done by wizards? If yes, are they doing it because they don't want to hide anymore (not because they think they're better, but more in line with being proud of who they are much like the LGBT+ movement) or because they believe it's for the greater good to finally join the two societies?

Is it being done by muggles in the know? By muggles who have a magical family member? Or by those who somehow because of aware of magical society and are trying to expose the truth like conspiracy theories?

Are there philosophical discussions on hypothetical situations on what would happen if muggles knew of the magical world suddenly, vs gradually? What's the end point in which the two societies can stay separate?

I feel like there's so much potential for discussion, but that it'd be a monstrous task to work it into a plot."

I read the thread you posted. You came up with some really interesting ideas. Really grounded and not just the simple "oh we just erase the memories of muggles to keep the secret safe". I like how you brought it back to Arthur Weasley and his job.

I'm sorry if I'm bombarding you with all this info. I literally have no one to talk to about Harry Potter and history like this.
