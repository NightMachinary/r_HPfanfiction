Now I'm curious why you would have thought Italy, Haha. Spain mostly because it was a major world power which then had a strong inquisition, and its thriving wizarding population fled (which led to its school collapsing), so I have a nice event to precipitate a move of the locus of power of the Sorcerers Guild (which is the predecessor to the ICW). In ancient times it was in Egypt. The Dutch Republic and the Dutch East India Trading Company first came on my radar when plotting the wizarding history of Japan, and they featured there strongly. And they popped up again when I was developing the political sequence of the adoption of the Statute of Secrecy and it fit really nicely.

I completely agree about compelling characters. :)

Haha, true. I'll message you about the plot. :D
