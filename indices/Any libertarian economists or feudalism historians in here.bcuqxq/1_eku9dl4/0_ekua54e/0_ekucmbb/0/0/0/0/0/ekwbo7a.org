Fascinating link! I'll add it to my list of articles on the witch hunts. It's an incredibly complicated and murky thread of history. I've also found evidence that demographically witch hunts were targeted at landed, female singles of 45-60 years of age (mostly widows, basically) and it was basically a method for land grabs. Which that demographic doesn't fit real witches in-universe (particularly in my AU, in which this type of witch hunt wouldn't have touched a single real witch). I'm actually planning a motivation for the Statute that's not related to the actual witch hunts at all, and is mostly political in nature, with the witch hunts only used as a scapegoat to sway the populace.

I'm still deciding on the properties of transfigured alcohol. My current hypothesis is that it's just like normal just there isn't any nutritive content. Duplicating the brew while it's brewing would sterilize the yeasts and halt the maturation, but duplicating it after it's done would just spread out the nutrition like with food. There's also time-acceleration charms in my AU which would be awesome for brewing. Just some of where I've gone so far on that vein, lol.

More fabric = more status makes a ton of sense in my AU. Wizarding clothing is all charmed in various ways, which requires that it be woven from magical materials for the charms to last. That gets expensive fast. One of the common charms is to keep the hem down and also keep it from under your feet, for example. Quidditch robes would be charmed frictionless, which solves that puzzle, methinks.

There's actually a political party in my AU which advocates exactly what you're describing, called the Strong Modernists. The normal Modernists aren't anti-statute, but are pro-muggle and advocate ideals derived from muggle culture. I'm not going with the cliche and blah Dark and Light sides obviously.... :eye-roll: There's a religious party called the Merlinists who represent the "pagans" in counterpoint to the wizarding Catholic (of which there are at least two main factions), Independent Protestant, and a wizarding pseudo-Anglican faction of sorts, plus the Rationalists (remnants of the Renaissance, very sidelined and mostly in the Department of Mysteries), Traditionalists (center-line, conservative), Separatists (the moderate purebloods), and the Dominatists (radical Separatists who believe the magic should be stripped from muggleborns as soon as it's discovered, etc.). Very complicated and fun, hehe.

No worries! I love info-dumps. :D We should chat sometime and I can brain-dump my development so far and see what you think. I'm looking for more sounding boards to take some of the burden off my poor wife, lol!
