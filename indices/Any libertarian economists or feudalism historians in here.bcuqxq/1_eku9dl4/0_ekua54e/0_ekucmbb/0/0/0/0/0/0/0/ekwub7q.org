:wow: I love those ideas! And they fit so well!! I knew about the wallpaper (and murals, too, in the old castles) and I already planned to incorporate that. Imagine halls that look like paths through primeval forests because the walls are animated murals....

Yeah, it's venturing into hot button topics that might turn away readers, and make the writer's head hurt, lol. But art is so much More when it brings in those deeper elements well. Les Miserables is one of my favorite works mostly because of how well Victor Hugo brought the human soul in all its depth to the surface to be explored. Theme is as important as setting or plot or character! :rant over:

I'm restructuring the entire global wizarding community. Because wizards descended from Atlantis, and I'm tying those into the mysteriously historical Sea Peoples who appeared in the Mediterranean around the Bronze Age (if I'm remembering my notes correctly), among other reasons, the genetic trait of magic is highly concentrated around Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic coastlines. There are a few exceptions, such as Japan and some other east Asian cultures, but they aren't as significant on the international scale. The international wizarding power center was centralized in Spain (I think) before it moved to the Dutch Republic (and then the Netherlands when it changed names), but Wizarding Britannia was always a wizarding superpower alongside the ancient centers of magic like Egypt and Greece because of Merlin (who I've moved to his proper time before the Founding of Hogwarts; he actually taught the Four Founders). Wizarding communities in the Americas are still divided based on the old colonial empires, and there is no MACUSA (:shudders at anachronistic naming:).

That actually didn't answer your question, I just realized, lol. The answer is that British wizards do maintain contact, and have a great deal of political influence in the wider community. They were the first to enact the Statute, for example, though it took a bit for the others to follow suit (the ICW didn't exist as a governing body back then, and even when it formed it didn't have that name until after Grindelwald's War).

I'd love brainstorm with you! Fair warning, I'm not left by any means (I rather eschew political handedness... lol), but I still get along well with most of y'all, Haha. I want to include people who disagree with my own beliefs to participate in my development so I can present the different sides honestly. Does that make sense?
