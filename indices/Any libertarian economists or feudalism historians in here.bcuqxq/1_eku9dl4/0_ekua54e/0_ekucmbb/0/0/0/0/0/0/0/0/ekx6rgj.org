That's an interesting idea to have wizards be descended from Atlantis. It would keep the story more focused in Europe instead of hopping around the world. Why Spain and the Dutch Republic for the power center? I'd of thought it'd be Italy. And yes, let's just forget the Newt movies altogether. There are no mafia wizards which is what I was really hoping for so the prequel movies are dead to me.

It's fine if you're not left. Most of the people I know in my life aren't as left as me (yay for living in the south) and I think that's it's really good idea to bounce ideas off of others that have different view points as you when you're writing for a bunch of characters. It'd be boring if everyone's view points were either exactly the same or cartoonistly extreme. Compelling characters are those where you dislike their ideology, but not their personality.

You know, I don't even know what you're AU is about lol. Like I get the elements that are gonna be in it, but what's the summary of the plot? Is Harry even the main character?
