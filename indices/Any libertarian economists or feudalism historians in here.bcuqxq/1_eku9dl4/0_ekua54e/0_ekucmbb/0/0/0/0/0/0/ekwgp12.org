I have a lot of ideas on how wizarding clothing should be more magical. Like fabric that matches the movement of the stars, that change color based on your mood, or the color changes with the day, animal prints that are active and like to move around the fabric (like simple portraits that don't talk), or fabrics that give off a certain scent all the time. Maybe some like having lighting flash on their robes. So many possibilities. In the Edwardian age ladies wore a bunch of dead birds on their hats. You could do the same for witches and have a fake animated animals on their clothing. In the books the wizards were so drab and muted, when historically those with money were very colorful and used lush colors to decorate their homes. Wall paper was /very/ important for the well-to-do.

aw man all these political and religious parties you came up with is really getting my brain rolling. I get why people don't like bring these topics up in their stories cause you have to deal with a lot of difficult questions, but that's exactly why they should be brought up in the first place. It really helps with the world building. (the best example of the worst way to mix fantasy and real history is on the Netflix movie Bright.) How connected to other magical communities are Britain wizards in your AU?

If you ever have questions on history, economics, aesthetics, I would love to help. I'm personally really left so politics is also in my wheelhouse.
