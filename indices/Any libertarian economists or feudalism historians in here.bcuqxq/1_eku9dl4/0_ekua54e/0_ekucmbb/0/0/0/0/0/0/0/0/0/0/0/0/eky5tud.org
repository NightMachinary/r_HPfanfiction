oooh the Seamus part sounds interesting!

Yeah I was wondering how wizards viewed the crown. I wonder if there would be like sovereign citizens wizards that don't even acknowledge the authority of the crown? That the muggle government is illegitimate. Depending on when in the 17th century the wizarding world broke off from the muggles would maybe color their view of the monarchy. If it was during the Puritans when Britain didn't have a monarchy that mindset might of stuck. And the Puritans banned all things fun so the wizards could have been like "nope! We're bouncing!" But the window that the Puritans ruled was very small. After that is was King Charles II who was very popular but had maaaany illegitimate children so maybe that'll play a role? James II only ruled for a couple of years and William and Mary were basically invited to be rulers. Just spit balling here.

I'm only barely knowledgeable on SCP lore. I'll have to start doing my own research to catch up.
