True, but the Catholic church wasn't particularly friendly always towards the wizards. There were a few popes which accepted them, and there are wizards who reverence the muggle pope, but mostly since 1738 when Pope Clement XII published the Bull /In Eminenti/ there wasn't much love lost between the communities. The whole religious side of wizarding history and culture is something I'll be exploring mostly through Seamus's character arc ("Mum's a witch, Dad's a muggle -- she's a Protestant, he's a Catholic -- bit of a mixed-up family I have.") as he struggles with his Catholic beliefs and tries to reconcile them with the wizarding world.

Yeah, there's a lot of British pride even if it's not tied to an allegiance to the Queen. Wizarding Britannia is a completely separate country after all. That's actually one bit I need to research more. Since the wizarding world broke off in the late 17th century, which view of succession did they predominately hold, and how many of them actually recognize the legitimacy of the current reigning lineage at all? But since they still see themselves as part of ancient Britannia there is still a ton of nationalist pride regardless.

I think there's actually a stronger tie between the Gringotts goblins and the British East India Trading Company than there was with British wizards and the company. Though I need to look into how Marshall, Carter, & Dark from the SCP universe related to the company to see if they might actually be market rivals instead. So much fun weaving three universes together... haha!
