I know right?! I'm surprised not that many people have the wizards righting saddle side in their fics. I get having specialized clothing for quidditch, but broomstick riding seems like such a hassle. I beat it's only taught in Hogwarts because of traditions because otherwise it makes no sense. It's why it's only taught in first year. Outside of their one main sport, brooms really aren't that useful. Unless they're rebranded for casual use. Why aren't people riding their broom around Diagon Alley? Why aren't they treated like a bike for carrying their purchases? If they're like a jet pack, why would you walk around a shopping center? I have a lot of thought about a lot of things concerning HP.

That sounds like an absolutely amazing story. Culture shock is so much fun to read. I don't know if it'll help but there's video explaining how Harry Potter is clearly a produce of the 90s and it's mindset especially economically: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mxgSq1wiPk&list=FLm30gcMDG5TkNS_JYbQlisw&index=45&t=881s]] it's long but worth it. Looking at your website, Harry Potter mixed with H.P.Lovecraft?! Yes, give me more, I need this in my life.

On the topic of food, since for a long time food was the subject of it's time and what ingredients people had access to, it influenced what kind of recipes were created. So for the rich, since they had access to a lot of sugar and foreign spices, they came up with some really strange dishes while the poor had more hardy simple food. I'm curious how that'll effect wizarding cooking styles. Here's a simple video on why food plays a huge role in literature in case you were wondering: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qoJgTwDCQM&list=PL1mtdjDVOoOor6Ihzmr1m6C0SpfMB-0tH&index=11&t=2s]]

ah the Statute. I have a draft post I was working on with some of my thoughts around the Stature being broken in case you're interested.

You sound like you're taking this story very seriously and that's so exciting for what you're aiming for.
