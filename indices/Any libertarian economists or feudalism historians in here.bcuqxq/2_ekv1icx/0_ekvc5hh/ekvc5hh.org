I was wondering what happened to your post; I saw the notification for a brief bit but when I went to go read it, it'd vanished. :P

Anyway, yeah, that's the kind of stuff I'm trying to study (mostly via wikipedia and YouTube). My idea is that there's a wizarding feudalism that's unique to them that developed since before the founding of Hogwarts. They were already segregated though not secret and had their own society long before the Statute, and the Statute just cemented the isolationism. I have broad-brush concepts for how their society functions but I'm wanting to hammer out details. Interested?
