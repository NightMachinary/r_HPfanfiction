So by class based I'd imagine either Feudalistic or Age of Revolutions based. At the end of the day the difference is just a larger and actual middle class. Lawyers, doctors etc that would be part of the third Estate under feudalism, but under the new class system they ended up at least in the middle class. The Estates was the first: Priests, bishops, archbishops and other clergy positions of note. Second Estate: The Nobles and Royalty. And Finally third: The rest. Or: The prayers. The warriors. The Workers.

By dividing into classes you got a more actual division because you could have merchants who were part of the third estate that was richer than noblemen. And Noblemen that was poorer than most merchants. Though I'd say they are usable at the same time, though for different purposes.

Isolationism, the USA up-to WW2 * 1 Billion. To showcase the extremity here: After WW1 they borrowed money to Germany so they could rebuild their industry and help them pay down their debts to Britain who in turn needed to pay their debt to the USA. So America has a vested interested in Germany managing to have an industry to pay their debts. But then they also decided to hike their tariffs, which generally was already quite high. To a point that selling German wares in the US to raise the money needed was dropped because they'd effectively lose more money than they'd earn in doing it. The increase of tariffs was seen as a good way to lower taxes as they'd have guaranteed trade goods coming in.

Socialistic Bureaucracy is not a term I know but a google search gave me [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic_collectivism][this]], if correct it'd be stereotypical communism in reality without the welfare.

I'd say it'd be like we see in Europe before vs after the black death. *A surplus of workers lead to decreased wages while a sudden and rapid decrease of workers will lead to a higher wages because of higher demand. But because all major industries are government owned those industries are likely to be secure in workforce, if not work quality.*
