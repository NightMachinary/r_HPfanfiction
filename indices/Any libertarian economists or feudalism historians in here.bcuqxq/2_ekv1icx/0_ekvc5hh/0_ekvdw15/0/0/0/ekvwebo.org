Oh, thanks for bringing up the Three Estates! One of the things I have been thinking about that connects them to the current discussion is that the peasants made up 80% of the population, and were occupied with farming. Now, I won't get into the complexities of wizarding digestion and nutrition and transfiguration of edibles in my AU in this post, but the pertinent conclusion is that magically farming food is easy and efficient enough for a single person to grow enough in their spare time off a smallish plat to feed a small village. A single magical plantation tended by house elves can feed several cities of wizards. Food is abundant, cheap, and accessible by all. This means that's 80% of the labor market gone, basically. The lowest class would be squibs and those who failed their OWLs and lost their wands (making them functionally squibs), and they'd basically be servants, and they wouldn't make up a huge proportion of the population. The largest class would be the bourgeoisie. Does that track?

Also, wondering if Masters of magic might be considered First Estate along with clergy. Just something I'm pondering.
