Yeah, House Elves do remove the farmers. But even so from an Estates perspective there'd be a lot of other's that would fill in the group of the Third Estates. Canonically I'd have no issue believing that muggleborns would be automatically in the Third Estate when the Wizarding world was at it's strictest. And probably a good part of the non-ministerial jobs as well would be considered as: "Much too unimportant to allow them any political power/ allow them any say in how the country should be governed"

But the Burgiouse would probably end up being a lot larger than the other's since they are more or less 80-ish% of the population.

Meanwhile your question about the First estate and Master of Magic will require your definition of what that is. Right now I'll assume it'd be akin to the fanon term of Master of "Insert magical subject here" which again seems like an odd cross of an Ma/MS and a PhD. In which case I'd say no, while not the most normal thing to come across within the magical world I'd say it'd be too normal for such a position
