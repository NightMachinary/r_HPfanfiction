I have an idea for a lovecraft crossover where harry and friends must battle the denizens of the sunken city when it is raised when some idiots in the ministry thought it was Atlantis due to. Cultists influencing them. The raising awakens the sleepers, leading to the destruction of the statute as eldritch abominations destroy new york, la, london, and so on.
