Depends on if you want an always fem!Harry or gender-bent fem!Harry. If it's the first: go nuts. I've written the most clich√© ever evil fem!Harry in which Vernon is a child molester and I paired her with Riddle of all the possible pairings...first ever fanfic, lmao. Then I have another in which she never went to Hogwarts and is eighteen, smokes cigarettes and weed and has tattoos and just wants nothing to do with the magic world. In my newest fem!Harry fic the Irish Goddess Morrigan picks her out as her successor and she has to learn to handle becoming a deity in a magic world where the old gods are forgotten. I mean, you can go completely crazy there. Treat her as if you write a male Harry, just remember that this one has breasts and a vagina.

You can, of course, write a standard retelling of the original story and weave in the theme of classic female roles in the magic world and whatnot, different expectations and everything. I'd read that for as long as it wouldn't be a word-for-word retelling of the books.

It's your playground and you can do with it what you want.

Now, genderbender fics are a bit different. I also am writing one of those. There you have to find the balance between too little and too much angst. Obviously, having your gender changed from one moment to another is a life-altering experience and you have to remember that. *But* reading about a Harry breaking down in every chapter because he suddenly has breasts would get old real quick. On the other hand, a Harry who just shrugs his new equipment off and accepts liking boys like it's nothing new would also be questionable at best. I tried to be positive about the changes over the course of first to third year, with the second year almost wrapped up. Obviously, the sexuality there is up to you, the other, angsty themes regarding the gender change are not. It has to be balanced. Too much angst is just as bad as too little.
