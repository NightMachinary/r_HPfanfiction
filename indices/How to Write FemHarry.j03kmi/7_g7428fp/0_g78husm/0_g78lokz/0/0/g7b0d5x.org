Because boys and girls react differently is simple. You know, Harry comes from the Muggle world which is surrounded by sexual, moral and physical dangers and threats against girls all the time. even if the fic follows the canon, Peter rips her shirt off and cuts her, Voldemort stands alarmingly close and puts his hand on her face. that alone is enough for a temporary mental crisis. Depending on what experiences she had before Hogwarts or how Petunia raised her, she may react better or worse. there is no way in the earth the girl will have the same personality as canon Harry honestly... imo
