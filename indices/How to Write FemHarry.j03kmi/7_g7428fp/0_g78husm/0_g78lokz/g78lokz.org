Love it and I understand where you are coming from but as I said I think that this territory of the concerned protagonist who wants to find a way out is little explored because of the fear of moving away from the canon. we must also take into account the girl's personality, if she is not a Harry in a female body then she will act differently. now something that really makes me sleepless is about the experience of the girl Harry in the graveyard. It is this moment that will make her act or run. The other teenagers are still acting normal because they didn't see Vold, but she saw him, she was alone in a cemetery with two men, a giant snake and the body of a dead friend, I see little care for the authors of Fem!Harry when that crucial moment comes. it's not the same experience as the boy and it's not the same reaction. I am a girl and honestly i would have had an outbreak I would go irreparably crazy
