  There is a psychopath wanting to kill her, a girl in this situation tends to be scared, isolated, sulky and wanting to protect herself, looking for a way out, the last thing she will do is think about sex, dating or sports, for God's sake.

As opposed to boys who only care about sportsball and getting laid in the midst of mortal danger. That's some yikes-y gender essentialism ya got there. The thing is.. for much of the original timeline Voldemort is a nebulous and/or distant threat. Regardless of gender, they shouldn't be focused on Quidditch or fretting over crushes while dodging curses, but there is plenty of down time for the character to become preoccupied with normal teenage concerns. There's also the possibility of a character using those things as a distraction from the reality of their situation.
