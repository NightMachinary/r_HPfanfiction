linkffn(*Hermione Granger's Guide To Gender Flip Fanfiction*) gives some good advice about how to write a Gender Fic story, and even if you don't find anything to help you it's still an entertaining read.

Now if I had to say one thing, just like with an OC, don't make your Fem! Harry perfect. Just because she had a vagina doesn't mean that she has to be better than everyone in class, still a Quidditch star, and be so beautiful that every boy (plus some girls) in the school are ine love with her. Give her some believable strenght and weakness (whenever they are the same in canon or not).

Also, if Harry's gender is the only change from canon, try to think about how it would change his uprising. Would the Dursley still give her Dudley's cast off (it may seem "strange" for neighbourhoods)? Would Dudley still bully her (with Harry you can cay "boys will be boys, but she is a girl there)? Would she still be sorted in Gryffindor? Would she still hit off with Ron or would she prefer to hand out with some girls like the Patil twins? And so on . . .
