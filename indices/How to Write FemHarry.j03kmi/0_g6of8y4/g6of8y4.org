Dudley would not be able to get away with harassing a girl as much, and FemHarry would end up in a different social circle at Hogwarts, but other than that, not much changes. Of course, different friends means no one to save Ginny for example, and the PoA plot might go differently (FemHarry might never hear of Ron's or Hermione's pet for example). And if she sits with someone else on the train, she might end up in a different house. But her personality should be similar to regular Harry.
