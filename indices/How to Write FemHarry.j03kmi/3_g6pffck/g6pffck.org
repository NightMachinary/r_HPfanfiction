So I enjoy a gender switched Harry, but I typically prefer ones where Harry was always a girl and where that's only one of many changes (like Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus). Best gender bend Harry I've ever read is probably [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290/chapters/45976822][The Archeologist]].

One thing that has bugged me in some fics is the obsession with menstruation. One fic I read (Harry was originally a boy) had Harry continually thinking about how her body was now able to make babies and was "becoming a woman." And it was just weird and awkward. That certainly wasn't what I was thinking when I had my first period. I also never looked in a mirror to consider my womanly shape (bigger hips etc). Admittedly I'm not the most self aware person in the world, but Harry isn't known for that either.

Using muggle hygiene products for periods also seems a little odd to me. Like magic doesn't need to fix everything, but I can't help but feel they should at least have magical equivalents. I'm okay with the issue being ignored entirely, but if you choose to mention it please don't make it weird.
