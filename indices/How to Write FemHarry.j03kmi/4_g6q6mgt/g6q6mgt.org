I would avoid a name like Harriet, it can easily give the impression that James and Lily were being lazy when picking a name for their kid. Generally most Fem!Harry fics use one of three naming conventions for Fem!Harry 1. British Royality names 2. Just any relatively common girl's name for the time period in Britain. 3. Flower/Plant names. All of those conventions are fine with the flower names you've just got to make sure it sounds like a name for a human.

Also, as with any AU one change is going to naturally lead to several other changes here and there and those changes should be explored in the fic.

Finally, in regards to pairings, IMO you should ask yourself if the pairing still works if Harry were still male (and was of the appropriate sexualality), and if it wouldn't then that's probably not a good pairing for Fem!Harry either.
