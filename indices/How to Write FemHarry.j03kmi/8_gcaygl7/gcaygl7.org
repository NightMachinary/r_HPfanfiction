I think someone mention it all ready but I need to stress the importance of not making her perfect.

Most FemHarry fics biggest mistake is that they are all self-inserts of the author, self fulfilling fantasies and while that is part of the reason people write fanfic is important to keep a level of realism. A good character doesn't need to always have the answer or solve the problem or be the smartest and strongest. I recommend you look for the characteristics of a Mary Sue and try to avoid them as you write.

Do not go heavy on the compliments to her appearance, is okay to make her beautiful but is just boring if every single male character falls for her or compliment her looks.

About the name I personally love Harriet as a name and find it easier to think of the character as Harry if she can keep the name but that's personal taste. One of the best femaHarry I ever read is Jasmine from A Long Journey Home of Rakeesh and the name never bothered me.

Apart from that one I think the Harry from The Never-ending Road from Laventadorn is the one I like the most speaking exclusively about characterization. She has a consistent personality and there is so much character development and her friendship with Hermione is just too sweet, but most of all she has flaws.

Good Luck and have fun
