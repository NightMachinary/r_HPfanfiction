For me drastic name changes really put me off from reading it. Because then it feels like I'm just reading an oc. Keeping the brave, headstrong, humble, and adventurous Harry in fem form is the most important thing in my opinion. A lot of authors who suddenly write fem Harry either make her this ultra feminine sex bomb fem fatale or a very meek shadow of themselves. So keeping the core characteristics of what makes Harry who he is, is important when writing fem Harry in my opinion. A Harry who is not Mary Sue but just as outspoken and athletic as his counterpart. These are some of my favorite fem Harry's
