I like how Voldemort is ended in linkffn(10687059). It's a time-travel fic where Harry is going back to his 11-yo self to save Hermione. How Voldemort is ended in the new future is not so interesting but the description of Voldemort's defeat in the old future (in chapter 8) is truly great in a gut-wrenching way. Not epic though, so I don't know if you'll find it satisfying.
