That's one of the really great things about this series, IMO. Harry and Ron are both totally fine, and are actually likeable and still friends with Hermione. Hermione definitely considers Harry and Ron to be her primary friends, like canon, she just happens to also have a good friendship with the twins.

Fics that pair Hermione with someone other than Ron often have Ron-bashing, but it is non-existent in this series. Ron is reasonable, likeable, capable. He still has flaws like in canon, but actual Ron-bashing is absent.

Same thing with Harry. Great guy all around who still has flaws like he did in canon, but he isn't a dick or anything.
