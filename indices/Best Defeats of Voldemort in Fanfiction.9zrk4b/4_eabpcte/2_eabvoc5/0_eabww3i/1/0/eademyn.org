It's pretty good, IMO, but it doesn't really work if you don't read the first fic in the series beforehand, The Arithmancer. Hermione becomes friends with Fred and George much earlier than canon (first year), and the romance with George doesn't start until partway through year 4.

If you just start reading Lady Archimedes, the Hermione/George dynamic doesn't work if you don't have the backstory from The Arithmancer.

The nice thing about it is that the romance is fairly fleshed out (enough that it works for the story and feels like a natural relationship), but it's not a romance fic so it isn't the crux of story, which is a nice balance IMO.
