Linkffn(11463030) has a really good defeat, IMO.

  In this fic and its predecessor, Hermione is a mathematical prodigy, rather than a heavy bookworm. It comes down to her to figure out how to defeat Voldemort, despite Harry being the Chosen One. Basically, she realizes that Voldemort is just too powerful to fight conventionally, especially after Dumbledore dies. Hermione has some really kickass spells that she created, but she still can't match Voldemort; the power discrepancy is just too big. So, she decides that she will design a ritual that will kill him for them. She finds Voldemort's birthday via the book at Hogwarts that writes down wizards names; she then devises a ritual that will kill everything magical born in the British Isles that day; centaurs, merpeople, witches and wizards, they're all fair game. Luckily for them, Hermione realizes that the chance of anyone else being born on that day, on that year is very low, due to the small population of wizarding Britain. They manage to kill Voldemort without killing anyone else, and just in the nick of time; this ritual takes place at the Battle of Hogwarts, and Voldemort dies right before he was about to kill the ritual casters.

The actual defeat itself isn't super exciting if you just read the chapter on its own; the buildup of Hermione's mathematical skills and her slow planning of how to defeat Voldemort, combined with the large threat he is in this fic, makes it all very satisfying in my opinion.
