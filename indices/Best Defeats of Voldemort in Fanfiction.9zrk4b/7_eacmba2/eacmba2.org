So, this one isn't finished yet (about 2 or 3 chapters to go I believe) but it does have some very well written battles and I doubt the last battle which just started will dissapoint. It is a four part series and not to everyone's taste, also has a female!Harry but does not read like one (does this make sense to you? It makes perfect sense to me but my brains weird). I will link to the first one as you will probably have to read all the parts. linkffn(8233291)
