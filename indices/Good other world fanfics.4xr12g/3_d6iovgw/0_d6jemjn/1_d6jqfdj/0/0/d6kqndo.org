  "We'll take it together." The Triwizard cup pulled them away from Hogwarts, and they fell through a hole in time and space. In which Harry and Cedric are lost in Pentos, pretending to be siblings. Harry pokes a sleeping dragon, and Cedric despairs over his 'little sister' playing with fire. Fem!Harry/Viserys. [Because I made the mistake of reading Tsume Yuki's wishlist.]

  Escaping from the graveyard with Cedric's body proved more difficult than Harry would have thought. Because of mysterious circumstances, Harry and an ALIVE Cedric Diggory are now trapped in Middle-Earth until they can find magics strong enough to send them back. The true question though: When they return, will things still be the same between them and the Wizarding World at large?
