No. I haven't found a single one. I think I've wanted one in the past, but found none of the concepts satisfying. I also wanted Worm/SW and Worm/HP, but pretty much everything in that regard is terrible.

There are some one-shots for Worm/SW and Worm/HP that are fun to read though. The first chapter of one story by PencilMonkey is wonderful.
