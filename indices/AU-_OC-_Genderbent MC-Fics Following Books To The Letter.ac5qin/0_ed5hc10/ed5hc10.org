[[/u/More_Cortisol]] is partially right, but I think another reason is that when first thinking up the OC/genderbent-character/whatever, the author really wants to see how that character would do in certain canon situations. They want to see their reaction at Voldemort's Resurrection, or in the Triwizard, or to discovering Pettigrew. And so they have to keep the canon events the same most of the time so that the timeline will still lead to those events they've been looking forward to.
