The best gender bending fic i've read is Weasley Girl by Hyaroo. Not only is it brilliantly characterised, it also uses the small(ish) change of Ron being born a girl (Veronica), to twist and distort canon like a butterfly effect. It starts with relatively small changes, which compound, leading to really great twists and surprises throughout the story, and its sequel.
