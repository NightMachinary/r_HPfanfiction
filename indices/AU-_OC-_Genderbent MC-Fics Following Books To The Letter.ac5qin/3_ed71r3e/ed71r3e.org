Because the pple who write those kind of stories aren't the most creatives? Sure, I'm pretty biased towards gender bending in general but if you do it at least make something original.

From the few I've read and hated, the most common thing about them was how they bended the world so it stayed the same no matter what the gender bended MC did. Or just gender bending the MC so the author can pair it with some dude, to me that's just slash with extra steps :B

There's also authors that in a way, want to explore writing a diferent gender and I get that, gotta learn some way or another but most of the time it's just annoying to read, specially if the MC remembers being whatever original gender it was and somehow turning gay because they changed gender. Like, I'm a dude, if somehow I woke up as a girl I wouldn't start liking dudes. Quote GB!Harry suddenly notices Draco and/or snape has a nice butt, no dude, just no.
