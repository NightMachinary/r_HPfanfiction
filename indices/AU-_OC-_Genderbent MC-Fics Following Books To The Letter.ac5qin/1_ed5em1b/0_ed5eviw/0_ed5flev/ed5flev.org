I understand. I think practice is part of it, as I said. It's daunting to formulate your own ideas and post them for anyone to see and pick apart. This way, they change just a little, put a bit of themselves into it, while also rewriting canon in their own developing style. There are plenty of people who are happy for these stories, obviously. Any new writer is almost guaranteed positive and constructive feedback going this route, I think.
