I read this one too, but can't remember the name. I know he traumatized the dragon due to the fact he covered himself in armor and looked exactly like what killed the dragons mother.

At the start of the fic the paranoid trio decide to check the CoS and kill another basilisk. McGonagall starts to get twitchy watching the trio plotting and starts to come up with harebrained plots to figure out what they are up to, with Sinistra amused on the side about it. The was an old secret war vet in a shop down in hogsmede that sold the trio + luna(?) + other champions of TWT items (like specially treated robes for first task, spearguns for second task) and taught them to fight.

Lol hope the extra info helps you find it ðŸ˜‚
