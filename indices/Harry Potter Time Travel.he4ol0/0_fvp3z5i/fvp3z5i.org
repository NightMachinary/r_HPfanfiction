Well i think it is better if you use discussion tag instead of request

For pairing, it really depends on your harry age. If harry is in 20s, tonks will be good. For older maybe amelia. I love bellatrix, but i don't think she is viable partner in your fic timeline. You have to write very good redemption arc as she already tortured Neville parents and do other evil. Up until now, i only think bellatrix is good for time travel to marauder's era.

For your younger harry, it really depends on when do you want the fic start. In fourth year fleur will be good. Below that, i prefer witch that have same house as harry so they can have a lot of scene together.
