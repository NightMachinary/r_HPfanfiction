I can't think of the story right now (though I think it's one of the "Harry claiming the Headship of the Black family" ones) where an insane Bellatrix is in hiding at the Malfoys. Somehow the Magic breaks her free from the Dark mark and removes her insanity. She is completely upset about what she did to herself and her looks and completely regretful about the things she did as a deatheater.

The Story is not The Head Of The Family Black by Red Jacobson.

The reason I mention it was because I thought it was a good way to start a redemption arc for a "present time" Bellatrix. Eg that the insanity was forced onto Bellatrix (by lestranges and her parents) and with her insanity and the lestranges' pressure she accepted the Dark Mark. Meaning if she hadn't been pushed into insanity she would have never become a deatheater.

The problem with the older pairings of Amelia or Bellatrix and bringing Harry back to first or fourth year really sets up a May - December relationship unless you decide somehow to de-age the women as well.

If I recall correctly Tonks is 6 years older than Harry and Fleur is 3 so you can quite easily bring Harry back (say from his early 20's etc) and have one or both of the girls in a relationship with him. That could actually be a very fun trio. A veela who is "sex personified" and a metamorphmagus who could change herself to whatever she wants.

It all really depends on what you want to do and how/where you want any relationships to go.
