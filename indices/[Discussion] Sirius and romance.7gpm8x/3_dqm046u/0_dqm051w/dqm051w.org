  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

  Sirius Black never expected to fall in love. That was James's thing. It wasn't that he wasn't interested in finding the right girl, he just didn't think she existed. The problem is that she does exist, just in the wrong time. Time Travel. M for language and eventual smut.
