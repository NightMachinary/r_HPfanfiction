As a teenager, a good match for him would be anyone who would debate him (think he got a kick out of it) and also could keep up with him. This is why I think the Remus Lupin/Sirius Black pairing is so hot, because Remus is able to sort of 'control' Sirius, he listens to him, etc. Remus is also super perceptive of other peoples' needs and emotions, so for someone so repressed (we can see this via drinking post-azkaban, and also the fact that he didn't have any interest in forming a close bond with anyone during school - that we know of) this would only help. I don't read slash, I also don't think Remus/Sirius ever actually got together (we know that Remus Lupin never fell in love before Tonks), but I do believe that someone like Remus (without the crippling self-esteem, which would cause a problem for Sirius since he did lack that emotional feel) would have been excellent for Sirius.

I have heard people say that he's demisexual, this could be true for after post-azkaban, but I'm almost certain he had his fair share of broom closet excursions during school. He may have been bisexual, but I don't think he would have done anything about it during his school years.

Definitely no one that reminded him of his mother. no one from Slytherin (not because they are evil, but because it would be a constant reminder), and most likely no one of the Sacred 28, unless it's like a Weasley or something (and even then). He totally cut out that part of his life when he ran away; didn't want anything to do with that lifestyle/society. Like I could totally see him deliberately getting with a muggle or a muggleborn just because he wanted out.

I haven't actually read a good Sirius fic that had him characterized well, or in a way that would be telling of how he grew up/what he grew up as. A lot of them depict him as this stupid half-wit that makes lewd jokes, but I think he was highly witty with a good head on his shoulders, but also had tellings of abuse that would be V important to his storyline.

Anyway, this is just my opinion. I've actually spent a lot of time studying each Marauder. I've got entire profile analysis of each one and it's actually kind of insane (was a project I did for my senior HS final). Anyway, that's not nearly all of it, but it's a quick enough summary. Didn't want to leave a wall of text.
