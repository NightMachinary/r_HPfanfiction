I really like "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8592676][pretend you don't have one]]", a non-linear, Severus-centric AU that depicts his life and relationships at Hogwarts and how they shaped him and lead him to make the choices he did and live the life he does.

"[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/431269][Saturdays are for Football (The Rest of the Week is for Everything Else)]]" is something I've read recently and enjoyed too. It's set after the second war and is about Blaise Zabini and Dean Thomas. They're distantly related and bond over football and Blaise is confronted by what the inaction of people (purebloods who weren't death-eaters but also didn't object to what was happening) like him led to during the war.

Then my last suggestion is "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7681432][blood will tell but it often tells too much]]". It's a story about Percy Weasley that's set right after the war. It's about him struggling to help the Ministry get back in order, with what he did during the war, the ways he failed and succeeded, and reconnecting with his family.
