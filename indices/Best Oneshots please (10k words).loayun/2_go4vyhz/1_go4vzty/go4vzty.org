  New legislation mandates all individuals campaigning for the post of Minister of Magic, must be a Pureblood of at least three (3) generations. Tom Riddle is a genius, and originally he was planning on just murdering his way into this, but now?Well.Tom Riddle was a very very petty man,and nobody discriminates against him.OrTom Riddle decides to fuck with the Ministry of Magic, becomes Lawful Evil, and somehow, accidentally, gets a literal goat in office.

  Made terribly wise after the Mistake, Dumbledore had life all planned out: Marry a Sentient Castle. His plans are clobbered by Tom's follies and Harry's yearning.
