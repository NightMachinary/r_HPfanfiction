I've got three award winners from the DLP competitions, there's more that I'd recommend but I can't think of them off the top of my head, where they'd be on fanfiction.

Fitz has two, one about ted and adromeda in the first war. Then I have one about Dumbledore when he was in the summer after he got his fatal curse.
