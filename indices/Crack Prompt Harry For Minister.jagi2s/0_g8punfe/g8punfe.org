I like this idea a whole lot. I could easily see Harry deciding to become Minister to fix all the problems. I'd also love to see people worshipping the ground Harry walks after a picture of the basilisk he killed ends up in the daily prophet. I could just imagine all the Chuck Norris type jokes the Wizarding world would be making about Harry: “Harry Potter looked a Basilisk in the eyes and IT died” or “Harry Potter once let a Basilisk bite him just so he could establish dominance over it”

You ended up losing me at the end though, I was on board all the way until Harry started acting less like a kid and more like an evil Bond villain. I imagine the idea of enslaving a bunch of people with the imperious would draw bad parallels to his own childhood that would put him off the idea.

I'm also just gonna assume you were joking with the nuke as that would instantly out the Wizarding world, potentially kill millions of people as the radioactive winds travel the British isles, and would definitely make Harry one of if not the most destructive dark lord in all of history, potentially combined. Assuming no other government got trigger happy with a nuke going off on the British isles and decided to start world war 3 with a nuclear holocaust, the entire point of the endeavor would likely fail with Voldemort sticking around due to his horcruxes.
