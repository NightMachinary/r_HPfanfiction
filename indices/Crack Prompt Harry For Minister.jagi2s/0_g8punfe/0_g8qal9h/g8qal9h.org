Thanks, glad you liked it (or at least the beginning), about Harry acting like a villain... I honestly think of it more like a little kid with zero knowledge about politics or governance being handed the most powerful political office in a government. Harry /has/ good intentions, he won't steal and isn't in it for the power-trip, but he also has no idea of what he is doing and his solutions to problems is what you would expect of an actual child.

“Time Turners are cool! I will just give people a bunch of them.”

“The law of underage sorcery is dumb! I think I will repel it! ok kiddos, go crazy! ;)”

“Wow, the Dursley's were really major assholes through my life, I still remember they locking me up for days with little food in a cupboard last summer... Ok, payback time! I will just stuff them in this prison I never went to with half the food given to the other prisoners! This will teach them a lesson”

“Wow, Merlin's balls, the Wizengamont is staffed with old mummies who insist on talking nonstop about caldron bottom thickness in some indecipherable dialect... I know! I will put the Weasley twins there! Yup, this will live things up in no time”

“What do you mean the (insert random country here) minister insulted me on their newspaper! Ok, answer it by taxing everything they send us to hell and back! Let's see how they like it”

“Oh no, Voldemort is back! I need to deal with it quickly... right, I know! I will just blow him up! Muggles have big bombs right? I think I can kind of remember listening about it when I was eight... nucles or something, I will just ask them to fire it at Voldemort! (...) What do you mean they don't want to! Just like my relatives, they don't care who dies if it isn't one of them, well, I won't stand for that! /Make/ them fire the bombs at a Voldemort, don't wanna know nor care how, but get it done now! (...) Huh, they can't fire at a specific person and need a place? Eh, tell them to target Malfoy manor, Malfoy was a Death Eater, so Voldemort must be there, if he isn't then we try another place, maybe London...”

... Truth be told, even /this/ was kind of above what I would expect from an average 13 YO in terms of maturity, to say nothing about one with almost no knowledge about the muggle world and even less about the magical one, and the less said about his possible response and repercussions to the abuse the better.

EDIT: Oh, and yeah, the nuke thing would totally fail, but Harry can't know that because he has no idea what Horcruxes even are, let alone that Voldemort may have made them... but on the slightly less terrible side the Armageddon would probably both disincorporate Voldemort and kill all followers who could do the ritual, rendering him a powerless wraith floating around in a hellish lifeless desert for all eternity, so... half of the goal accomplished I guess? Plus my HC is that nukes actually wouldn't be that useful against magicals (they certainly do things more impossible than protecting against an explosion) with the problems actually coming from the fallout and nuclear winter, so Voldemort and Harry may both just survive it outright even without Horcruxes.
