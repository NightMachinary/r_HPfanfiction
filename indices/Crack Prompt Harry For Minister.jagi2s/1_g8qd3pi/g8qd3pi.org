Well, I'd like to believe that he would not use Unfirgivables or grab at nukes even when power tripping, but being barely competent sounds just about right.

That said, since the premise includes some serious PR training, by Wizarding Houdini, and a big charisma boost... Harry would have a lot of people helping him where they would hinder a normal politician. So my preferred end result would be adults resolving most issues while reacting to his bumbling. And at the end, they are disillusioned, and say he was a bad Minister, and he just twinkles at them and lists all the problems solved, issues led to an agreeable conclusion, alliances secured... Jawdrops all around.
