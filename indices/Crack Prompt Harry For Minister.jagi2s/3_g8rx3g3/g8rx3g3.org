First prerequisite could come about due to simple oversight (real legal codes tend to have a lot of stuff that is just assumed/dependent on people respecting political norms).

Two and three come about as part of Harry's change in mindset- Harry himself would publicize what happened as widely as possible as a reason for running for Minister, and a way to discredit his opponents.

The big question is what would motivate Harry to do that in the first place. Its very much not his character to even think of running for Minister. Someone else, I think, would need to suggest it to him. Say:

​

"I can't believe Lucius gave our sister a diary full of You Know Who's memories", Ron growled.

"Well, at least Harry was there to save the day", said George.

"Yeah, its not like the Minister was going to do anything", Fred muttered.

"If only Harry would run for Minister", George said.

"Don't be silly, Hermione replied. "A 12 year old can't be Minister for Magic!"

"Actually there's no law against it", Fred said.

"We looked it up a couple years ago", George supplied to her incredulous look. "We thought it would be a great prank if we both ran, but Dad stopped us."

"This would be even better though", said Fred. "Why, Harry, you might actually win."

George grinned.

"That would be /wicked/."

​

Or maybe...

​

"Dobby is free!" The little elf practically danced for joy. "Harry Potter is being an even greater wizard than Dobby believed."

Harry shrugged uncomfortably.

"It was the least I could do, Dobby."

"Harry Potter is too modest! Harry Potter is a much better wizard than Master Lucius-" he seemed to twitch, and Harry readied himself to grab the elf and stop him from punishing himself, but Dobby recovered a moment later. "or Mister Fudge." Dobby's eyes grew huge as something seemed to occur to him. "Harry Potter would not let dark wizards leave dangerous diaries in young witches' school books! He would treat us elves with respect! Harry Potter would be a great Minister!"

​

Anyway, I'd read it, as long as it strayed clear of Dumbledore bashing and other such offensive things, and didn't have Harry completely lose his moral compass.

Inexperienced over his head Harry can be mined for comedy, tragedy, or both. Evil Harry doesn't really engage my interest. His biggest mistakes would probably be stuff like hiring friends/people he trusts for top posts regardless of qualifications, stepping on the toes of career politicos already pissed that they're taking orders from a thirteen year old boy, or trying to solve everybody's problems at once without taking into account the Ministry's budget or the hundreds of regulations he's trampling on because he isn't aware of them.

I don't think he'd send the Dursleys to Azkaban either- canon Harry just isn't vindictive enough a person for that, especially since in this position they have no power over him any more whatsoever, and he has no need to even be in the same county as them unless he wants to.

Heh, the scene where Dumbledore tries to explain to Minister Harry why he needs to keep living with the Dursleys could be funny. As long as its not bashy. Hmm...

​

Dumbledore gazed at Harry solemnly through his half-moon glasses.

"I'm afraid, Harry, that it is imperative that you return to the Dursleys this summer, at least for a few weeks. Certain steps can be taken, such as connecting the house to the flu network, to allow you to continue the business of government."

Harry snorted. /I Bet the Dursleys would love that./ It would almost be worth it to see Vernon's coronary... but he still couldn't really see the point.

"But why? You've never told me. I get that I needed to stay somewhere when I was just a kid, but I'm the Minister now. I have my own office and everything." He gestured at the room around them.

Dumbledore sighed.

"I am afraid it has to do with the reasons you survived Lord Voldemort's attack as an infant. Specifically, the protection given you by your mother's sacrifice. You see, as long as you live with your mother's blood kin, that protection remains, and neither Voldemort nor his followers can touch or harm you. Now, more than ever, it is paramount that we protect your safety, especially given your new... position."

Harry blinked. Whatever he'd been expecting, it hadn't been that.

"But... I have bodyguards now."

"And would they avail you, if Voldemort came for you himself, restored to his body and his full power? Perhaps they could buy you a few moments with their lives, moments for you to run. Could you do that, Harry? Could you run and leave them to die so that you could live?"

Harry swallowed. No, he didn't think he could do that.

"But there must be defensive enchantments that could be used... Hermione told me that the Ministry is covered in protective enchantments. Madam Bones too."

"Of course. But no enchantment is infallible. Especially if one's enemies have inside information. I am afraid, Harry, that not every Auror can be trusted. Many of them were appointed by Cornelius Fudge, and while some may be good men and women, many share Lucius Malfoy's views. It is even possible that some might be servants of Voldemort."

Harry glanced around his office, suddenly uneasy.

"So I'll fire them. I'm not going back to the Dursleys. Its already hard enough to get anyone to take me seriously as Minister. I can't run the government from my Uncle's spare bedroom."

Dumbledore sighed, realizing that Harry would not be swayed.

"Very well. I will see what I can do to strengthen the Ministry's protective enchantments. I only hope that you will not come to regret this decision."

Harry would have cause to remember this conversation when Auror Dawlish took down the protective enchantments around his office, allowing a dozen Death Eaters to apparate into his office.
