Just write your scenes and come back later to edit with fresh eyes. It may seem like the shittiest piece in the world when you read it at first glance, but WRITE. Get your main ideas out. And then Ediiiitttttttttt your heart out.

Feel free to PM me if you'd like a beta editor when you've got your first draft down. :)
