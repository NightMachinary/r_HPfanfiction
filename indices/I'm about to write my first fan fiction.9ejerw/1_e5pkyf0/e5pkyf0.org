Before even putting pen to paper, read something on writing. "On Writing" by Stephen King is a good start.

Don't leap straight into writing a massive novel with complicated plots and numerous characters. Start small. Write, say, a drabble centered around one event in the lives of one or two characters. Then a mini-fic. Then, as you increase your skill, increase the length and complexity of your writing. Basically, don't try to run a marathon if the farthest you've walked so far is to the nearest McDonalds.

Get feedback on every possible occasion. If people say your fics are shit, don't get discouraged. Write more so that your fics become less shit.
