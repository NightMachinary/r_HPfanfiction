Mention to the readers that you're looking for feedback in order to improve.

Ignore "feedback" that essentially is just the reader telling you what to do with the plot in the future, unless it's a really cool idea in your eyes. I've had people give me really shitty "feedback" like this that demanded the story go a certain direction.
