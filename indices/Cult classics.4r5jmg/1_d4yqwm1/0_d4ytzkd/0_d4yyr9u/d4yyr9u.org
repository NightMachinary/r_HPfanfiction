The Shoebox Project was a fanfic with text, fanart, handwritten notes, and photos. Check out [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/2012/03/part-nineteen-january-1977-lessons-in-cartography/][this chapter]] for an example. [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Shoebox_Project][This Fanlore page]] explains a bit about it. There were (and still are) fans who basically consider it canon.
