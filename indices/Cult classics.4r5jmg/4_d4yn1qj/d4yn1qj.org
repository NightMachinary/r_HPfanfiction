Here are few that I consider cult classics.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]]) A unique idea done very well.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2773368/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hot-Boy-Who-Jumps-From-Trees]]) My favourite crackfic/parody, I wish it had more reviews.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695781/1/Gabriel]]) A very interesting look at ethnicities and classes in the Wizarding world.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/Broken-Mind-Fractured-Soul]]) A unique take on abuse and mental illness.
