Long story short, anything a society/group of people has a sect(s) that enjoy something in particular has cult classics. Harry Potter fanfiction meets this. So yes, there are cult classic Harry Potter fics.

The Oxford Dictionary defines a cult classic as

#+begin_quote
  Something, typically a movie or book, that is popular or fashionable among a particular group or section of society
#+end_quote

So under that definition, you are correct about all popular fics. But that's only if you take society as the absolute, big thing. If we view Harry Potter fanfiction fans as a society, it becomes a far more useful thing to think about. Under this new definition, HPMoR and Robst's entire library of work are cult classics, because they are popular among a certain group of HP fanfiction readers. A Long Journey Home is simply too popular. Another addendum is that 'classic' implies that at least some time has passed by.

And don't give me any of that "but yargle, if you sort on FFN by Favorites, all those ones you talk about being cult classics are at the top, and A Long Journey Home isn't anywhere in the first 20 pages of results!^{1} " Most of those things at the top of the most favorites list are there because new people will sort by favorites, read the stuff there, think it's amazing, and then when they learn better don't unfavorite it. The only thing on that first page that belongs there is A Black Comedy (and some argument can be made for The Lie I've Lived, but I don't feel like arguing with [[/u/Lord_Anarchy]] over it [though I do agree it isn't as good as people say it is]).

You want some stuff that makes me think of cult classic movies? I can do that. Check out anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1228238/DisobedienceWriter][DisobedienceWriter]]. Although I think all of his works are shit (excepting some of his Odd Ideas oneshots and linkffn(Vietnam by Rorschach's Blot)), there are the works of Make A Wish's author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]]. Although I generally don't like the style of humor he goes with, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon]] is definitely a cult classic author, plus linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon; Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon) are both damn good IMO. linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero), although terrible, definitely reminds me of a bunch of enjoyable, yet not good sci-fi movies I've seen/own. I hate it, but the ironically named linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) is definitely a fanfiction cult classic.^{2} linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) is definitely a cult classic, and worth reading just for the fact that it is a 103 chapter, 520k word monstrosity that took 187 days to post (and I'm pretty damn sure that it only took a day or two longer than that to write). And because this comment is getting long, and I don't particularly feel like investing any more time into it, I'll stop there.

1. Yes, I did check this.
2. Her other 'popular' fic is a Harry Potter/Star Wars crossover that I despise due to it's absolutely infantile (a la people who think shittyfanfictionmanipulative!Dumbledore levels of infantile) understanding of the Star Wars universe and its major actors could probably be considered a cult classic. If you want to read it, go to her profile. I refuse to name or link it here.
