I think it's important to sometimes recommend fics that you personally don't like, or aren't /good/ because they match the requests. Of course, just because a fic isn't /good/ doesn't mean it is terrible. So bad it's good is a real thing.

Some fics that I come back to, even if they aren't good, but contain ideas I find interesting, applications I enjoy or just remind me of the B-movies that I like are:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Origin War). Sadly, this is a most likely abandoned fic. It does have some lordship stuff, but it isn't completely nauseating like many are. I definitely like some of the ideas in it (particularly the Resonance/freeform casting stuff).

linkffn(Basilisk-Born). An in-progress fic. I can't really say much about it without spoiling the story, but it is essentially the B-movie A Long Journey Home.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar). Goblet of Fire AU. First few chapters are rough, and while I'm an American who is proud of it, there is a bit too much pro-America/boo-magicalBritain thing going on. What it really has going for it is the focus on alternative magical traditions.

And I don't mind at all. I really enjoy these kinds of fics, even though they're not great.
