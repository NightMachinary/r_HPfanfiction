I agree you do sometimes half to recommend fics even if you don't necessarily like them. That's what I find frustrating about this community at times and I know I'll get down votes for it. A lot of people just say a story is terrible without stating why. Personally I can overlook a lot of things including a fair bit of grammatical errors of a story is good. I chalk that up to growing up around people who spoke English as a second language. I can muddle through a lot of things and still find them enjoyable to a point. I would rather know if a possible read and at least try it before I discard it myself. There are a lot of fics that I have come across digging through the sites that are good, but didn't have a lot of attention because so many had down voted it that trying to find it in the search was difficult. Like you said just because it might not be the best written thing around a lot of stories like this can have nuggets of ideas which a fascinating.
