I am curious about stories that people relate to as cult classic and must reads. It seems like more often than not many people just post their favorites. Personally I want to know which fics people go to over and over again. Which are quotable? Which are indeed as you said older stories that have a following like some old movies.

I hope you don't mind I pointed people to your response because it makes the argument about what I mean better than I could myself. It was long post, but a good one. I need to go through all of your suggestions to see what I've not read yet, but thank you for your long thought out response.
