I may be a little early in calling Cadmean Victory a cult classic, but I definitely have the feeling it is going to be considered one in the future.

Cult classics don't have to be /good/. Let's look at movies for examples of this. Starship Troopers. The +Star Wars Holiday Special+ source of my nightmares. The double feature of Jesse James meets Frankenstein's Daughter/Billy the Kidd vs Dracula (actually Frankenstein's granddaughter but whatever). Plan 9 from Outer Space. Sssssss (yes, that's [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070622/][a real movie]]). Dune (1984). All cult classics. None good (though most are so bad they are enjoyable).

Good is nice, not required.
