Wellll..... regardless of its quality, MoR does have a very dedicated following, so one could very well consider it a cult classic.

And I also must admit I am part of the "cult" around Alexandra Quick. Those who like it enough to read through all four books generally end up proselytising people (myself, [[/u/tusing]], some others I can't think of right now).
