Instead of going into a long post about what a cult classic is I suggest you read the response by yarglethebargle. It makes a fair argument about what I mean.

I posted those because love our hate them that do have a cult like following. For every person who says they don't like them I know of any last one more week does. If you don't think these are then what would you suggest?
