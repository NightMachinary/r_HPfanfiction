Go for it! Like I said, there's never enough Beta Readers, we could always use more. Just don't be afraid to be picky and only take on projects you're interested in/have time for because there's a good chance you'll get flooded. Oh, and be realistic about what you can and cannot do. Clear communication is the basis of a good relationship, after all.
