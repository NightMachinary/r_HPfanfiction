I just read a fic that I REALLY enjoyed, but it is borderline Engrish. I was sorely tempted to reach out to the author and offer to beta the thing. Then I thought that might be a bit arrogant considering my resume is "reading everything that I can get my hands on for ~40 years" and not much else. Not like my degree is in English or anything. Though I AM a "grammar nazi" by all accounts. Maybe some day.
