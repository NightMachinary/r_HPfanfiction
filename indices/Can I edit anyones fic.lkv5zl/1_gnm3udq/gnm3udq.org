There are various words; proofread, beta, SPAG checking (SPelling And Grammar).

I don't have my own story for you, but I'm actually doing a proofread of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series at the moment, if you want to cooperate. It's about 1.5 million words in four books (book five will likely begin in a few months), so it's on the larger end of beta projects I've done; I expect I'll be working on it for a while.
