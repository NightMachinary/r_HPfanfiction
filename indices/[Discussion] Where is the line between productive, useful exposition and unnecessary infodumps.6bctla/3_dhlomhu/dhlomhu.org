If it is the author speaking as the author, then the story ought to be closed immediately, and burned with fire. An author should never speak except through the medium of the characters, or songs/books in the story itself. Author's notes are right out.

Tolkien's method of doing it is, of course, the ideal to which authors should hold themselves. I'm more forgiving if it is presented as an internal monologue, or a well-written dialogue. I'll read about several pages of that, especially if it is important information. If an author breaks it up and disguises it well, I may even read what is essentially a whole chapter of exposition.
