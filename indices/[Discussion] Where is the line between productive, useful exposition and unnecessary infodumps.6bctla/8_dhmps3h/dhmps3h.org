If exposition goes on to the point that it bores me (And it will if the topic doesn't interest me immensely), I'll just start skimming until I see dialogue and start reading again.

If I can do that, and keep up with the story I don't care. That's definitely not a good trait for a fic to have. If I can skip all that and still understand what's happening it clearly wasn't crucial enough for you to risk boring the shit out of your reader, but it isn't a deal breaker.

I have issues with long winded authors in general. Too much exposition, or just description in general, will result in me putting down the fic/novel. I don't read a lot of popular authors just because the /way they write/ bores me to tears. I tend to have better luck with YA authors who seem to have adjusted to having less focused readers.
