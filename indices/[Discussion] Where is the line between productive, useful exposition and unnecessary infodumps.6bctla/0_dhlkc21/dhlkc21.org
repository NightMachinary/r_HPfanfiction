Exposition has killed a lot of stories for me. I never made it past the first chapter of Emperor because I was bombarded with six-odd paragraphs of exposition about the backstory /in the author's notes/. I also recall quitting out of Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle in the second chapter for similar reasons.

I do understand the infodump, from a writer's perspective. It is a very easy and clean way to convey information, and a writer who has invested many hours planning, imagining, daydreaming about his or her fic may believe that the several unbroken paragraphs of exposition they are writing are going to be interesting to the readers.

From a reader's perspective I find them utterly obnoxious. I won't criticize an author too heavily for typing up the odd paragraph just to get that little bit of information across that they might need, but I usually like to see it handled in such a way that it never feels like the author is providing information to me.

  This is the way I've seen exposition effectively used: intermittent, brief exposition sections which feature impersonal descriptions of events over a long period of time (hours, days, or weeks versus seconds or minutes) interwoven with an ongoing thread of live action dialogue or intimate scenes between important characters.

I almost entirely agree with this, though with the addition of masking as much as possible the author's need to provide information, as I said.

The exposition could be done through dialogue, as long there's not too much of it and the author takes care to not lose track of character voice and the action surrounding the dialogue, so that it's not just exposition masquerading as dialogue. You could have a character that seeks out and finds information that is both A. pertinent to the character's goals and motivations and B. somewhat expositional in nature, and I would be happy with that even though you may have only included the scene because you needed me to know a certain piece of information.

Basically what I'm trying to say is, if it's ever noticeable that the exposition is coming from the /author/ rather than the characters or the narrative, I am not going to be a happy reader.
