  an info dump was fairly necessary

I'm of the opinion that infodumps aren't ever necessary. They are only necessary to the extent that the author doesn't know how else to give the information. That or the author either hasn't or won't take the time to blend the relevant information into the narrative and dialogue.

There's nothing that says the audience needs to know everything (or anything) about the world before they begin reading. Consider the first time you read the Philosopher's Stone you knew nothing about the Harry Potter universe and you still enjoyed the book well enough.

There are ways to distribute information about the world without dropping it all at once. It gives the reader a chance to learn about the world slowly and over time instead of all at once.

That said, the strategy you're describing with newspaper articles etc. isn't a bad approach as long as these articles aren't more than a few paragraphs long and the reader doesn't have to read all of them at once before the story really starts.

Adding a /short/ excerpt at the beginning of each chapter with glimpses into this AU seems like a decent approach.
