I have one fic (not published yet) I've been working on with a friend in which we've had to walk that line. The fic is very AU, to the extent that an info dump was fairly necessary. We decided to write it, however, not as a bunch of paragraphs or as Hermione spewing information, but as a series of newspaper articles, book excepts, and interviews. I feel that something like that, where you get all the information you need but have a way to break it up to keep the reader engaged, is the best way to go about it. Thoughts?
