Stuff that the characters interact with and comment on doesn't count a a classic infodump, and if done correctly is one of the decent ways to do it.

Now, if those excerpts and such are added onto each chapter's beginning instead, well ... for as long as they are not too long, that too is a decent way of dealing with it, as they enhance the immersion instead of breaking it and the fluff it would have to be dressed in will be enough to keep it interesting.

That is, of course, assuming that it is done correctly, and working under the assumption that this info really is necessary to the readers and cannot be given in the story proper by any of the characters.
