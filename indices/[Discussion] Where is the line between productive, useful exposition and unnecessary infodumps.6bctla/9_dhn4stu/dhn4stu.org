Hmm ... I can deal with those things if they give out information that you don't actually need and the chapter with the exposition is marked as such so that those who cannot get through it can safely do so. Likewise, I can deal with them if they are packed into an interesting dialogue or some character's musings that are both in-character and appropriate for the situation they are in. Otherwise, no, please take a lesson about the flow of writing.

A lot of stuff given in expositions of that kind (i.e. walls of text) is not really necessary for anything in the story and is only there so that the readers would have a better idea on the writer's perspective on a given thing or on things. While that in itself is not inherently a bad thing because /a little bit/ of extra info won't hurt anyone and it can be used as one more tool for creating the atmosphere of the work, there is a tendency for people doing that to go overboard with the amount (and uselessness or redundancy) of the information required, break the immersion while doing so as it is revealed neither in a dialogue nor in narrated thoughts of any of the characters but instead in an out-of-place infodump, and make the infodump dry as a desert which makes it even more jarring.
