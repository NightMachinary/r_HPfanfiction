  Where is the line between productive, useful exposition and unnecessary infodumps?
#+end_quote

As a published author who started out as a fan writer (and makes the very rare, very not edited fanfic for fun):

I dunno, but be sure to tell me when you find out because I would love to do all that smoothly in one go without needing more than five drafts to figure out how to rite uh gud storree.

  How do you feel about large sections (10+ paragraphs to a full chapter) of exposition and backstory?
#+end_quote

Depends. Is the writer one of those rare souls who is any good at dumping out those things and making it entertaining?

(Okay, now that I've got the impishness out of the way, I'll answer seriously.)

*Ahem*.

The balance between story and exposition is like determining if something is obscene: /you know it when you see it./ What I mean by that is that the more you read and the more you write (doing more of both is necessary if you want to do the second one), then the more you start to get a hang of what is info is "useful" and what is not, and often, what is useful is one of several things, including 1) being informative, 2) contributing to worldbuilding, 3) fitting the style of the story being told, and, finally, it is always, /always/, *always* 4) entertaining to the reader in some way.

It's difficult to explain it any better than that.

*tl;dr version* - If it's not entertaining in some way, your exposition has crossed over into infodump territory.
