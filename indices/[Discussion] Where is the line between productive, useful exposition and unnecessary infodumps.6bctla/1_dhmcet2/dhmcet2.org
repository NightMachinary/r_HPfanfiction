I don't want to ramble, but some of my favorite stories (be it fanfics or novels) are those where there's zero noticeable infodumps. Of course certain scenes are constructed just to give me information, but they never feel that way.

Fanfic authors severly underestimate the ability of readers to piece together a picture... as long as you have a clear vision of the world you are describing you can just let characters act naturally in that world and it will convey exactly what you had in mind. Like, if in your AU Voldemort never heard the prophecy... don't say it! Just don't. Don't mention any prophecy. Just write your story. James and Lily are alive. Everyone goes "Huh?! I wonder why those are alive!" and the more you write the more information will trickle down about it. You don't need the infodump. The reader doesn't need to know every little detail at all times.
