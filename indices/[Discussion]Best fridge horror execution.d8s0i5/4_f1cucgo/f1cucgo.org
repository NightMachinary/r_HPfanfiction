Enter the Dragon (on Questionable Questing) has a lighthearted romp through Harry being ridiculously overpowered, set against a dark backdrop of "mind magic enables widespread human trafficking, breeding programs, etc". It's funny to see Harry eating the troll, the Basilisk, and even Quirrelmort but not so funny when a man's fiancee was kidnapped and sold to a "fantasy" brothel where she's magically programmed to act out whatever the client wants, and in order to keep tabs on her until such time as he can free her, he has to /hire her services and leave his own magically altered fluids in her as a tracker/, because no other tracker will stick.

Methods of Rationality addresses the horror of Azkaban, and the danger inherent in transfiguration; how long could a skilled wizard maintain a transfiguration of mere micrograms of botulinum toxin? What if someone transfigured a large strangelet?
