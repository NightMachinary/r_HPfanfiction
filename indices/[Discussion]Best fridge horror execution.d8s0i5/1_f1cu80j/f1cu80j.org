Something that's been on my mind for a little while is that the Dementor's Kiss is far worse than creating a Horcrux.\\
Making a Horcrux requires extinguishing an innocent life, but leaves the victim's soul untouched, protects its owner's life as long as it's intact, and it's theoretically possible to heal the creator's soul if they feel remorse.\\
The Dementor's Kiss, on the other hand, destroys or perpetually imprisons someone's entire soul, provides no positive benefit to the Dementor or others (that we know of in canon, anyway), and has no known cure.

It's something that irks me a little in fanfiction, because you have characters going "Egads, this guy is a murderer who's cut slivers off his own soul to extend his life! Let's gruesomely murder all his followers we can find and /destroy/ the souls of the ones we take prisoner!"\\
Sometimes, anyway. Usually in those 'Super!Harry with political power' fics.
