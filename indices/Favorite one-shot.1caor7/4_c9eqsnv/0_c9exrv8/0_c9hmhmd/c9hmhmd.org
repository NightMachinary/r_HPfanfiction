I think it is because Sirius is one of the most beloved characters in the series and people (myself included) are drawn to him because he was such an affable, impulsive, interesting and tormented character. How much he suffers and in turn Harry, Remus and Wormtail suffer is really intriguing to me and it is one of the main parts of the series that I find myself pondering often.
