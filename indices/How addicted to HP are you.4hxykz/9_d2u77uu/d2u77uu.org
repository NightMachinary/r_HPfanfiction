Well I've been reading fanfiction for like twelve years, had midnight book releases for 5-7, midnight movie releases for 5-7, day of viewings for 2-3, and saw 4 a week before it was out because I won a trivia contest. (I saw DH part 2 midnight in Texas, then later that afternoon in Michigan. Hell of a day!)

Plus activity in forums like hexrpg, a world building project that I started like two years ago about the DoM and history of magic development, debates, and most of my supplies for my job at the school being Potter themed...

Oh and having a few hundred fics saved on my Kindle.

I'd say twelve.
