10 or 0, there's no in between for me. I either binge it almost every free moment, or don't read it at all. Most of my interests go in cycles like that. For the first time in 6 months, I read fanfiction. I read [[/u/floreatcastellum]] 's "The Aurors" last night and I really enjoyed it. I'm excited to see what comes out of that melon of theirs as I really liked how they wrote the characters.

I've several hundred bookmarked fics I need to see to, but I'm not sure when it will catch my interest again.
