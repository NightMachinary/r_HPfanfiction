I've been reading HP fanfiction pretty much constantly from fall of last year to now.

- I have 230 fics bookmarked that I haven't read or attempted to read yet, because sometimes I just have to close out the tab because they're just awful.

- I have 97 fics favorited on fanfiction, 31 on AO3, 2 on LJ that I've already read and enjoyed. And I'm sure there's just as many that I've read and didn't like enough to favorite.

- And if I'm not reading, I'm writing my own.

Does that make addicted?
