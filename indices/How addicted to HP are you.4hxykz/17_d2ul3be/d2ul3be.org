Right now I've got 7 FF.net tabs open. Each one of course being H/G.

As for my HP obsession more generally... it only really became an obsession back in September of 2013 (I still liked the series before, but I wasn't really doing anything apart from re-reading a bit the canon). I think there's a fine line between being a hardcore fan and actually being addicted. So I'd say... 9.75
