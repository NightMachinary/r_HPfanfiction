Not very. 2? I normally have some fanfic opened, but I'm not addicted.

I read fanfiction because there are amazing writers, and I enjoy the community and characters. But there's not really any connection to HP for the sake of HP. I enjoy Sudden Contact linkffn(11034056) no less for the fact I've never played either setting. The same for Worm.

I enjoy them because they have good writing and tell good stories, not because of the HP element or lack thereof.
