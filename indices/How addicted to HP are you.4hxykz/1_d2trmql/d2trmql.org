You people are all amateurs.

I have devised and thrown out entire fic cataloging systems because Google and ff.net aren't good enough and my own attempts at sorting have collapsed from sheer volume.

Just in H/Hr finished fics alone I have 500 bookmarks and that is a safe estimate. Adding on the pairing and non-pairing categories I easily have more fics finished than most small fanfic sites have available.

My main computer has 64GB of RAM available. I don't render videos or host 50 VM's, I leave fanfic links open.
