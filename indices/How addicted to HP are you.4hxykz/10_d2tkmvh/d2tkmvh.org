I would say a 7. I've definitely read more HP fanfiction back when I found fanfiction a decade ago, and I've gone back and forth through the years. I've recently picked up a handful of HP fanfics to read because writing my own has rekindled my interest.

I see myself spiraling more into HP in the coming future, especially since I want to re-read the books (in Spanish this time).
