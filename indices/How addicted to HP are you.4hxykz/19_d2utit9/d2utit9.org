I don't know if my measly six tabs out of nine being fanfic (and only half of those HP) count me as addicted--Tumblr, Reddit, and Pandora are the other three. However, I've been in fandom continuously since '99, saw most of the tropes being created, and watched some of the 'Old Classics' as they were first being posted.

After so long in fandom, I know quite well where my tastes and interests lie--and I can usually tell within a chapter or two whether any given fic is headed even sorta in that direction. 99% of stuff posted on FF.N doesn't qualify, and even in my Tracked Tags on AO3, I still only get about a 20% return rate on stuff I'm interested in enough to keep reading after the first chapter.

Plus I'm working on a few fics, so there's that as well.

So, 8/10?
