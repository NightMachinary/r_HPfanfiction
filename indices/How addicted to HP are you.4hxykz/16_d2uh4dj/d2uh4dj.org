Definitely an all-out Harry Potter fan, here. But I wouldn't say I'm any more or any less than any other fans. Currently I have about ten fanfiction a updating daily that I'm following, 15 fanfictions open in Chrome on my phone, and about 25 open on my computer.

I love to read, and I try to read other things, but I always go back to Harry Potter fanfiction which makes me really sad in some points, because I feel like I've already read all the good ones, when in reality I'm too lazy to look for new ones so I re-read ones I've already read and stay up to date on ones I'm all caught up on.
