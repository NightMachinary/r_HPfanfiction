I've read only one de-aging fic in this fandom and it was rather good. It was some random witch “cursing” Harry who forgot everything with his new age. And after being adopted and raised in a much better family than the Dursleys, Hermione and Ron (and the Weasleys) finally found him and tried to change him back. And it ended with Ginny being “fuck no, leave him be happy”. And it was really, really well made. It may have been a cliche trope. But it was surprising, interesting and well thought out. It really touched about Harry's PTSD and life in the wizarding world etc.

But in other fandoms it's usually just a fun type of fic. Just some good comedy. Which is nice too.
