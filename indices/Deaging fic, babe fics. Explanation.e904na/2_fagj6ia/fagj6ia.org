Well, there was one I liked. Hermione discovered some method of time travel, but it could only be in her own lifetime. So she goes back as a baby and has a hard time convincing her parents to believe her. It was a fun read.

Another one I remember reading (somewhat guiltily, as I usually don't go for Hermione/ Draco) was pretty crazy. Hogwarts had a parenting class and students were split into groups of three and one would take a de-aging potion and the other two would act as parents. Harry and Hermione got paired with Draco. My point is that teenagers are better at hiding their emotions and feelings. Children are usually more open and vocal and the author used that to show the abuse Harry and Draco had been through. Hermione was a nightmare. A hilarious one, but still a nightmare.

I know it's not a request or looking for thread, but if someone is interested here are the two fics I'm talking about:
