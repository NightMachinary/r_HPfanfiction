Ok, two things: Why it might be interesting, and why it might be popular.

​

It doesn't take much to give an idea enough legs to make an interesting exploration, it doesn't have to have intrinsic appeal. A lot of sci-fi/fantasy is escapism, but not everything. Sometimes it is social commentary, a story device, or just an interesting idea to play with. (I mean, I certainly don't dream about what life would be like if my brain was removed as a child and put into a ship. But still, great books).

​

From that perspective, de-aging is a fine idea to play with related to magic. Just like anything else you can do with magic (Time Travel, Transfiguration, Merging, magical bindings, etc). There is certainly enough potential problems in a world where magic can deage someone you could have a good story.

​

As for why something is popular/a trope, usually that is because it ends up enabling some of the more engaged desires of the reader/author base. Love Potions and Soul Bonds could be an interesting idea to explore, but they are popular because it allows people to force unconventional pairings/situations. Self Inserts are popular because escapism and everyone (i mean **everyone**) wants to be a dragon rider. Go ahead, deny it.

From the sound of it you have read mostly things that are more... shallow. Not a "Lets explore what this is and what it would mean" but "I'm gonna use this to do what I want". I really don't know why deaging would appeal for that. Maybe just another way to force unconventional pairings? I'll admit I usually see it mostly in time travel fics, as a way to avoid the ick factor involved in certain pairings. (And that is really strange. The lines on what people consider acceptable and unacceptable are... don't make much sense?).

But then, I haven't read many baby deaging fics, except the good ol' Hermione goes back and time and fixes everything as a baby, which I don't think is the type of fic you are talking about.
