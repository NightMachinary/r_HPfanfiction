Saw a use for deaging that I thought was clever once - can't remember the fic, but basically Sirius de-aged him so they could sneak out of the country. Harry somewhat reverted mentally (I think it made him 4ish?) and everyone thought he was super adorable - Sirius found it hilarious, and afterwards Harry was mortified.
