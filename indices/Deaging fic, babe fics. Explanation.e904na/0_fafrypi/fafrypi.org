I personally never saw a deaging fic that I liked, never got the appeal of the trope. But why do you say they don't have a plot? They have any plot that the author writes, right? Like going through the school year, finding a cure, coming to terms if it proves to be permanent, experiencing the war while being a helpless child having to watch your friends fight and die, and so on (just some ideas off the top of my head).

I mean, I can replace the "deaging" in your post with any other trope, like Lord Harry or OP!Harry, and then claim any fics that use that trope don't have a plot. I will be equally wrong of course.

Maybe you just read a fic that was actually limited to the deaging being the whole plot? And from that one fic came to the conclusion every fic with that trope is like this?
