Also, just because something doesn't have a plot (or has very little of it) doesn't mean it shouldn't exist. Sometimes the interactions between the characters in that particular situation is the point of the story and that's more than ok, they can be entertaining by themselves. Although normally even those have some plot like you said, it just isn't the kind of plot the OP likes.
