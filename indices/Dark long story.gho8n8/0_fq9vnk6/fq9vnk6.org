Seems like you might enjoy the fanfic I'm currently co-writing. Our story features a lot of the dark themes you're looking for, and is going to remain largely Gen with a sprinkle of romance here and there (kind of like canon).

If you're interested, it's on AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15425364][A Lamb Before the Slaughter]]
