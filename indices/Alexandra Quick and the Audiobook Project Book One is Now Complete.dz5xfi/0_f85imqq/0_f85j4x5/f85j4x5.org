I gotta talk to you. Your comments on the first thread I posted helped me immensely. Many people had brought the tone problem to me, but it wasn't until I read your post that something clicked on my head. Its around chapter 3 or 4 of Book Two that a new attitude begins to set in, I think. Not that it all changes immediately and is great forever, but that's when it begins to get good I think. Thanks again.
