Sure, but thematic to a point. If you go through a story knowing Harry is literally able to solve any problem with any resources with little bother or effort or thought, then it's not going to be a terrible engaging story for most people in this fandom.

There has to be set limits to a magic system or you end up with shit like this fandom where you get people going "Ah, but why didn't he use this spell in this way, because if you look at page whatever, he clearly had this use in mind and then forgot about it later" or open contradictions like everything to do with the Fidelius. Consistency, no matter the system qualities, is usually the best way to go.
