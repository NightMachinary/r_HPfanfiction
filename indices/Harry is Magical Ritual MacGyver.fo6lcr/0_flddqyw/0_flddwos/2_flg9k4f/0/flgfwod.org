Hmm. It'd be interesting to see him having to dance about and really work to keep the 'Ritual Script' throughout the fight, too. Sort of a Captain-Jack-Sparrow-esque drunken stumble as he dances around spellfire and keeps chanting while the wand-wielders deal with the trouble. I do like the idea of him being useless without a little time to prepare/peace and quiet to work and having to rely on the wand-wielders though. That's a really good obstacle to put in place.
