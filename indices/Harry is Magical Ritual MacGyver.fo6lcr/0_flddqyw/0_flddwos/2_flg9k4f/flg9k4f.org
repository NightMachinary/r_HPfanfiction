A really simple limit on rituals is making them take time and require an interruption free environment. In other words, when the spells start flying Macguy-Harry can't chalk out a circle or face due North and chant. He has to stay out of the way and rely on wand wizards like Ron and Hermione.

But if things are even a little bit quieter he can start to perform Workings. Disarm Macguy-Harry and bind him with chains or magic and he's probably slipped free before you could even start monologuing. Give him supplies, time and a clear goal and he is more dangerous than a whole squad of aurors.

What emerges, rather organically, is a Harry with inverse strengths to cannon Harry. Struggling in a tense fight but readily holding his own if given a chance to prepare.

If he is told he has to get to the bottom of the school lake and back within an hour or Umbridge gives him a blood quill and tells him to start writing he probably has a hundred ways to resolve things.

Big fight with wands? He's stuck hiding behind his friends because they are much better at that sort of thing.
