Personally, I think that the story drags in the beginning, but picks up when barty stars teaching ginny. As for the ginnytrix relationship it's disturbing, but I like the idea of ginny and bellatrix being reflections of each other. And that this is a ginny that's embraced the side of herself that's like bella.
