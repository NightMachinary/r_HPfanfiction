Epistolary Drarry fics: The only one I could still find online is [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=4661][Lettered]] by pir8fancier. I know of several others where correspondence is an important part of the plot, but this one is pretty much all letters.

Non-Drarry epistolary fics, all a bit (or a lot) on the crack-y side:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325][Naked Quidditch Match]] (a classic!) by Anya (het overtones but really no pairing)

[[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=3006][The Owl Chronicles]] by mouse (gen)

[[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/snarry_holidays/53315.html][Thirty-One Letters]] by The Moste Potent (Harry/Snape)
