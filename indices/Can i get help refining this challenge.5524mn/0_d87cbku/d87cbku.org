It's not a challange - it's some crazy wish fulfilment power fantasy. A nonsense one at that.

There is not even a hint what a story would be about. It's just "Voldemort is OP beyond any acceptable degree, destroys muggles in one ritual, makes wizards greater than even (in a way that doesn't even fit with the setting), and allows them to have sex with muggle women all day, all night.
