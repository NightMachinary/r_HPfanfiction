You keep saying challenge and I'm not sure what you mean. Is this something that you want to write, or are you opening it up as a challenge to other writers? If it's the second, you've outlined exactly how you want it written and I don't think anyone is interested in just connecting the dots. It also sounds like some sort of weird fantasy.
