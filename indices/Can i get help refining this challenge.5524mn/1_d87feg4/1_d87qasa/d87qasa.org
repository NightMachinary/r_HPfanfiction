To simplify it it can real be broken down into a two part challenge

The first is if you how you the writer would go about causing extinction of muggles as a subspecies .

The second is what would the write do once they have done done part one

As you can tell from the blotted first challenge the first this I would do is make sure that there is enough genetic diversity for the magicals to survive
