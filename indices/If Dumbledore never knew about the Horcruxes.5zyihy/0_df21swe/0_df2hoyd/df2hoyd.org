I'm personally surprised how everyone didn't know about them XD

The names of the books themselves stand out. If I was a Hogwarts student with a pass or access to the Restricted section, I'd certainly want to read books named 'Magick Moste Evile" or "Secrets of the Darkest Art", the very names beget curiosity.
