'The Secrets of Darkest Art' was in Hogwarts library, so this knowledge shouldn't be that exotic.

If Slughorn knew, then Unspeakables, highly experienced Ministry officials, many accomplished wizards from dark families should also know.

Since the Dark Lord showed himself to be immortal, others should have guessed horcruxes even by the process of elimination.

Of course, JKR would have none of that due to her plot reasons.
