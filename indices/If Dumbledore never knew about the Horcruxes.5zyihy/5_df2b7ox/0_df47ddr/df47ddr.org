I think the 'terrible act' Rowling describes is the ripping of the soul itself. Most wizards didn't do it because your soul is where most of your emotions come from (Rowling envisions having your soul taken out, as being in a state of eternal depression). It's likely that the terrible act is then splitting your soul because you would be risking your after-life, and your ability to call upon more powerful magics that require great amounts of certain emotions. Voldemort was only focused on the darker aspects of magic, which only required two emotions to fuel them, fear and anger, so he left those emotions inside of himself.
