jk never really explained what makes one piece of magic difficult, or even what being powerfully magic meant. perhaps there are things which make the possibility incredibly unlikely, otherwise every death eater would have one. sometimes it seemed like you kill someone and rip your soul out. sometimes it seems like even a great evil dark lord like voldemort shouldn't have been able to achieve a single horcrux easily.
