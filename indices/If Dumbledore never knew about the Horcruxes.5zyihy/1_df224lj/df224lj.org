Slughorn also knew of them, though not the specifics of how they were made. Whether he might have shared this knowledge with others following Voldemort's rise to power is a bit iffy. The Flamels, having been around nearly a millennia and having interest in methods for immortality may also have provided information.

I think the key difference in a 'Dumbledore dies before realizing the truth' scenario is that it would take a great deal longer for the good guys to figure out that Voldemort had more than one backup life preserver.

Actually, their best path to finding out about this without Dumbledore's involvement would be Harry's link to Voldemort's brain. That could provide the essential clue to an Unspeakable or experienced Healer that soul-shenanigans are in play.
