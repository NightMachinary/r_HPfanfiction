Given the propensity of wizards to suffer from accidental and sometimes intentional human transfiguration, I doubt that it would be a direct correlation. For one thing, Riddle is the only one we're aware of that ever made more than one. Herpo the Foul was known to have made one, but his appearance was never described as inhuman so much as ugly. Salazar Slytherin was described as monkey-faced, but we have no indication that he had made a horcrux, nor why someone so focused on snakes would trend toward a primate-like transformation.
