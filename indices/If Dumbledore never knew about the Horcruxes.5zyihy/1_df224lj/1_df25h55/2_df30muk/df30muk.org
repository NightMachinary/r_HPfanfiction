My headcanon regarding that is that some rituals made him a bit different, but he was never a snake thing before he fell for the first time. What I think happened was that he drank Unicorn Blood. Unicorn Blood saves your life from just about everything, but is also eternally curses you. We never hear about the curse, but it make a huge amount of sense that the curse is to change the body to reflect the state of the soul. That's why Voldemort pops through Quirrels head, because he is a parasite attached to his soul, and the unicorn blood makes this physically visible. It also explains why a chunk of Voldemort's soul looks like a scaley baby, and why before graveyard scene, we was a scaley baby. The graveyard ritual strengthened his soul, by adding components like his father's bone, the flesh and strength of his followers, and blood of enemy, which came with a magical blood protection for free. The base material was unicorns blood and snake venom, because once Voldemort had a body, he could strengthen it'sâ€‹ existence with unicorn blood, while binding himself to reality with his familiars venom.
