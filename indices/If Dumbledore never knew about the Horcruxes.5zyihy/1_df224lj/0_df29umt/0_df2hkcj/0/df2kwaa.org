Well, to be fair, Slughorn does fish for people of fame and influence to bathe in it, so he might have actually had a pupil who was into history of dark arts or something like that and learned from that pupil during one of their meetings. If that were the case then it would be nothing more than a piece of trivia to him, a dark and potentially dangerous piece of trivia admittedly but still trivia, which means he didn't know the actual dangers of this stuff and what made him try to change his own memory was the realisation that Tom actually wanted to use this information rather than learn it just to know it.

Admittedly, one cannot be a high-grade potioneer without actually reading stuff, but we don't really have anything to suggest that he reads stuff to gather knowledge rather than just because he needs it for something and just the stuff he needs, so it could go either way.
