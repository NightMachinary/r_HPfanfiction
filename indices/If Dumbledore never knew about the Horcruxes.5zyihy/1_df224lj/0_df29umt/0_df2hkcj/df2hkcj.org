If Slughorn wasn't intellectually inclined and yet knew about Horcruxes, than that would make him most suspicious. I personally think he knew, at least enough that it revolted him, but he knew. He may have considered it for himself till he found out what it entailed. that would make more sense for a self interested person. Also, he was hiding from Death Eaters, that means he had connected at least the fact that Voldemort had particular reason to want him dead.
