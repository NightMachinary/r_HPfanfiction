Since Slughorn's primary interest was himself, I don't think there's any evidence to suggest that he would come forth with his knowledge, particularly as it was based on one conversation among the hundreds that he may have had with students over the years. Dumbledore's experience in trying to get Slughorn to reveal his memory suggests that Slughorn tried to repress the truth, even from himself. Also, since Slughorn doesn't seem to be that intellectually inclined (and horcruxes were an obscure kind of magic), he may never have connected the horcrux conversation with Voldemort's vulnerabilities, thereby further exonerating himself from stepping forward. It was a contrived plot device that Dumbledore even knew that the conversation between Slughorn and Tom ever took place.

I agree that Harry's horcrux link with V would probably have been the best way of even stumbling on the split-soul scenario. However, given Harry's weakness with occlumency, I image that V's influence would corrupt Harry before the necessary could be extracted.
