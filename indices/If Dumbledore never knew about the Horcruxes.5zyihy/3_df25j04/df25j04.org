The Department of Mysteries seems to deal in prophecies and arcane artefacts. If you brought a horcrux to them, they'd probably be able to identify it. They didn't receive a horcrux (active or not) in canon, as far as I know.

Slughorn would have known, or at least suspected, once Voldemort returned.
