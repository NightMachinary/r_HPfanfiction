Not exactly what I was looking for. But I'm definitely going to read it!

What I remember is:

1. Harry had been fascinated with Nordic magic from the start.
2. Dumbledore, while concerned, guides and supports him.
3. It opens just a month before Beauxbatons and Durmstrang arrive.
4. Hermione is a student at Beauxbatons (if memory serves me right)

Any help would be appreciated.
