It is important in many Hinny stories:

- I like “Reign O'er Me by cts” linksiye(3555), where it is quoted (the Valentine was actually written and sent by Fred & George as a prank)

- In “If You Can Help Her by witowsmp” linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2788096/]]) both Harry and Ginny actively create new verses on the same theme (most of them rather silly)

- It is mentioned in “Harry Potter And Fate's Debt by intromit” linksiye(11253) (the real authors were again Fred & George, it is a sould-bond story, so of course, Ginny wouldn't write anything so clearly idiotic), but I don't think it is further elaborated upon.
