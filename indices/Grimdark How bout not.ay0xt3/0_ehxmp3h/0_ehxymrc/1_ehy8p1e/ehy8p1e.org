  hopepunk is the opposite of grimdark (...) but more that good can win and things can get better: it just requires someone to step up and do the right thing.

How is "things are shite, but they might get better if we do the right thing" the opposite of "conveying the sense that our own world is a "cynical, disillusioned, ultraviolent place""? (first definition Wikipedia gives).

I'd say that on a scale from "everything is shite" to "everything is sunshine and roses", both are towards the shitty end. A modern fairytale would be the opposite. A Romcom maybe. Or copious amounts of fluff.
