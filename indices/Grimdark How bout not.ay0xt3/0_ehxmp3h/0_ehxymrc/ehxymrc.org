hopepunk is the opposite of grimdark, and its not meant to be a sickly sweet, but more that good can win and things can get better: it just requires someone to step up and do the right thing. I've seen it as more the idea of superman, a character whom embodies what it means to be good, even when things get hard. It's focus is on hope will overcome the darkness that exists.
