because I was fed up with what you are describing. I mean, grimdark has its place in dystopias, but not everything has to be one. The result is a lot of sickly sweet fluff concentrated in a oneshot, but that's what's on the other end of the spectrum of grimdark.

Also, how do you feel about characters who try to be evil but end up doing a lot of good by accident? Reluctant Sidekick has a pair of stories which go down that route, and both are hilarious.
