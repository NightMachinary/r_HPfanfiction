Ahem.

Let's look at the general romcom pairing: usually bickers a lot, tension, opposite personalities, etc. IE Harry/Draco.

Other reasons: possible redemption arcs, snarky humour, pretty men fucking, comfort and understanding arcs, troubled history arcs, each has had periods of times where they were obsessed with each other (Draco overall, Harry in their sixth year, yeah, it might not have been romantic but shipping don't care), fun pair to explore heavier themes with, fun characters to explore deeper aspects of their personalities that may not have come out during canon, hilarious reactions from friends, families, and enemies at their relationship, aaaaaand lots of other things yet.

They're a surprisingly versatile couple.
