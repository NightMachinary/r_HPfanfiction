This. For comparison, why are there so many Daphne/Other Female Slytherin fics? It's a similar reasoning. I'd also say, how many other male characters are there Harry's age that are featured frequently in the series? Ron? Neville? Hah! Draco seems like an obvious choice barring the fact that he's a little shit.

Think about it this way, if Draco was a female, she would be just as popular a pairing choice as Draco is now.
