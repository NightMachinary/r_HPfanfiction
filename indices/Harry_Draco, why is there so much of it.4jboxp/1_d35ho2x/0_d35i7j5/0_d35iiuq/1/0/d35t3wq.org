  There is a very small number of Harry/Pansy fics.

Which is a shame. I've only come across a few and none were very high in quality so I couldn't enjoy them.

Anyway, I think Harry/Pansy would be a fascinating pairing to play with if done right. She doesn't have much background but that's the great thing about fanfiction--authors can /create/ that.

I really like the idea of Harry ending up with a Slytherin, be it a girl or a boy. Unfortunately, the majority of the het ones I've come across turned the girls (usually Daphne, sometimes Pansy) into huge Mary-Sues, removing the very thing that makes the idea so appealing.

I don't want to read about this perfect Slytherin princess who's oh-so smart and oh-so "cunning" and is secretly really kind but is forced to hide it because of her house/family. What's the point? The kind of girl who'd give up a fellow student to save her own skin--now that's an interesting character!
