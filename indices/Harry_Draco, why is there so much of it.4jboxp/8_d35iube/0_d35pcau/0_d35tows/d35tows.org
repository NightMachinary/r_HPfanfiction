  even if men often can't fathom that, as they don't see other men as attractive (unless they are gay or bisexual!))

This is something I find seriously ridiculous, and it's something that I think more heterosexual men should /really/ think about.

Why is it common for gay men to ship heterosexual pairings but it's uncommon for straight men to ship gay pairings? I find that that the idea of them "not being able to relate" is weird as hell considering how many /heterosexual women/ are open to the idea of /gay men being romantically/sexually involved/. In fact, I even know several /lesbians/ who write/read/draw slash fic/art, so clearly it's not entirely a matter of relating to the characters/situation.

I find it strange as hell, tbh.
