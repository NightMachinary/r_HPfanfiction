Well, probably for the same reason(s) that straight women (mostly, there's exceptions, just like there are probably straight men who read slash) normally don't ship fem-slash ;)

ps: I am open to the idea and I have no problem reading about it if it's a secondary character (don't like it if it's really important for the story and worse if it's graphical, it's just a preference)...just like I am ok with gays in RL (why wouldn't I? As long as I can tell them that I am not gay if they try to flirt with me it's ok and I am even in favor of gay marriage etc. (as much as I am in favor of marriage at all - hate marriage, but if straight couples are allowed to (probably - statistics tell you that marriage is a gamble these days...like going parachuting with 2/3rds of all chutes not opening (stole that from a comedian...don't remember the name!)) ruin their lives, why shouldn't gays and lesbians?)

pps: I am also in a way against it though, because while changing a character is ok IMHO, I am not quite comfortable messing up their sexual identity (much less pair them with someone they despise -.-)...don't know why exactly though :(
