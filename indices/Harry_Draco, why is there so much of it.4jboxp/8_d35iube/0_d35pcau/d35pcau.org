Women might, most straight men don't (ok: Many straight men love lesbians on the other hand, so it's probably no wounder that women like gay men (well: the idea of gay men, as I am sure they'd hate to have a crush on somebody and learn later on that that guy is exclusively gay and doesn't have relationships with women!)...even if men often can't fathom that, as they don't see other men as attractive (unless they are gay or bisexual!))
