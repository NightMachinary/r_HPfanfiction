What's wrong with liking that sort of dynamic? It's interesting!

  /they often play it up as "sexual tension" (utter BS if you ask me.../
#+end_quote

Lmfao. Because /you/ can't see the potential for U/ST between the pairing it couldn't possibly exist, amirite?

  /I don't like it if a characters sexual orientation is changed in most cases (sometimes I make an exception for fem-slash, but only if it's really well done!))/

I'm guessing you're a dude. Clearly you don't mind femmeslash, so what's the issue with slash? As someone who enjoys het, slash, and femmeslash, I honestly do not get this. Like, as far as I'm concerned romance is romance regardless the gender or sex of the people involved. I find it weird as hell that gay guys can enjoy het romances but straight guys can't enjoy gay romances.

  /Despite the fact that (as in the case of Harry and Draco) they really dislike/hate each other, not only because they just don't like each other (I would have not much of a problem if it were just that) because they are so fundamentally different/

Hermione and Ron are polar opposites. As are Molly and Arthur, James and Lily, Dumbledore and Grindelwald, Remus and Tonks, etc.

Also, it's BS that "people can't change" and "couples who don't initially like each other can't fall in love." Look at James and Lily! Lily /hated/ James because James was utterly cruel, but James changed and they fell in love.

  /I think Harry would be aghast at being paired with Draco (ok: He'd be aghast at being paired with a Slytherin in general probably, but then again: If it's a girl and if she's beautiful and has similar interests etc. he'd be less shocked and less against it than being paired with Draco/

  /I mean let's face it: He ain't gay and he hates Draco!/
#+end_quote

Once again, Lily hated James and they still ended up getting married. People grow up and change.

As for him being gay...well, it's fan fiction. Why isn't it okay to make a canonically straight character gay but it's okay to do literally everything else to him? Writers can make him godlike, make him dark, make him an intellectual genius and that's totally okay, but make him fall in love with another guy and /gasp!/ Now it's too OOC, too uncanonical, too uncharacteristic, too different. BS if you ask me, esp. if Harry's personality remains true to canon and literally the only thing that changes is his sexuality.

I hate it when slash haters try to justify their dislike of slash pairings/slash in general by coming up with ridiculous, often hypocritical reasons and excuses. Just be honest and admit that you don't like the idea of a guy with another guy, ffs.
