Interesting? They'd kill each other if someone forced this (or one of them would run away, flee the country or live inside a property under the fidelius or something)...they might become friends or learn to respect each other if you put them through something they can (and did) only survive because they worked together, but love?

Don't know...it's just my view of course, but I could never forgive 6 years of name calling, abuse, threats and harrassment etc. (at least not enough to love somebody who put me through something like that!)

It's ok (in a way), I just prefer not to read that :) (I have nothing against gays, hell I am in favor of gay marriage (if straight people are allowed to gamble with their lives this way (statistics say that most marriages fail these days!), why shouldn't gays and lesbians be allowed the same "privilege"?) and rights to adopt children etc.)

It's not hypocritical if you don't want Harry paired with someone who basically thinks he and his friends are less than the dirt beneath his boots (even if you make him grow out of it he still did call them names, threaten and harrass them for several years - I can't forgive that, at least not enough to love somebody...I migh let bygones be bygones, but I'd never forget it (I'd not turn bitter like Snape did, but I'd probably hold it against Draco forever, just like his becoming a DE and then getting away without punishment...fucking rich prick!))

Ron and Hermione is crap, too (Even Rowling isn't convinced anymore after all!), that relationship would either not last or it would turn very very sour because he's holding her back (IMHO) and she's constantly nagging him (and questioning his culture and heritage etc.)

James and Lilly...yeah, don't like those two together either (I don't like Snape much, but he'd probably turn out better if he got together with Lilly)...it's kind of Ron and Hermione of the last generation (with the exception that James had talent (which he didn't use all that wisely IMHO) and money)

Yeah I am a man (yeah, check - man-bits confirmed!)...I am just not comfortable reading about gays (I try to be as open minded as possible and I don't hate/discriminate against gays in RL, but I don't have to or want to read about them, it's just a preference!), it's outside of my comfort zone (and I don't think that's weird, as many straight men are "wired" this way it seems)...I mean I've tried (not only once, but several times) over the last 10 years...hell, I looked through slash-fanfiction recommended for "beginners" (and people not into slash)...but I couldn't finish one -.- kind of sad, I know, but it just is uncomfortable to read that for me :(

ps: Not a "hater" - I just don't like it (just like you probably don't like certain food!)
