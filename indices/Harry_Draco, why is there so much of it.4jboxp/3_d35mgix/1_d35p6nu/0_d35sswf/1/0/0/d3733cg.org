I disagreed with most of Laxian's opinions, but I can understand just not being that into slash and being a guy. I am a straight girl and love slash and het, but femslash just isn't that interesting for me to read. Maybe it is just hard for me to relate to, but I am not that into it. I will still read it though if a good fic is recommended to me, but I never seek it out. So I would say I am "wired" not to like femslash...
