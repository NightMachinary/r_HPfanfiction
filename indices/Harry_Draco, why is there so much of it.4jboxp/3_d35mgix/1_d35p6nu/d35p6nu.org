Sadly right - they often play it up as "sexual tension" (utter BS if you ask me, but that's what I've seen in (undeclared/un-tagged!) slash fan-fictions (I don't read slash normally, I don't like it if a characters sexual orientation is changed in most cases (sometimes I make an exception for fem-slash, but only if it's really well done!))) despite the fact that (as in the case of Harry and Draco) they really dislike/hate each other, not only because they just don't like each other (I would have not much of a problem if it were just that) because they are so fundamentally different (and I don't see Draco changing, even in the end...he just throws his lot in with the winning side and instead of an open bigot, he becomes a closet bigot!).

I mean: Draco is a pureblood (born and raised that way) and Harry is a half-blood (so in Draco's eyes he's worth less than most purebloods and it's only his fame that compensates for that - oh: and his old family name!) raised by fucking bigotted muggles (hell: Sometimes I wounder why Harry doesn't hate muggles, I mean no one saw the - OBVIOUS! - signs of neglect (if not outright abuse!) and nobody helped him etc....I mean Tom Riddle hates them and I'd wager that his orphanage was a better place to grow up at than the Dursleys!)...hell, Draco insults Harry's mother (indirectly at least - don't remember if he ever did it directly - by calling one of Harry's best friends a mudblood!) on a regular basis (and he insults Harry's other good friend regularly, too (note: It's one of the few things I actually agree with Draco...well, I just don't like Ron and think his parents are so poor because they are either too proud or too stupid to use contraception (they have too many kids IMHO and they should have known better...hell, I'd say that this upbringing is what drives their children (except for Ron and Ginny) to leave their home ASAP and even seek employment in other countries!))) so is it ANY WOUNDER that Harry doesn't want anything to do with Draco (I know that he wouldn't want to see him hurt, at least not really - I mean that Sectum Sempra spell was an accident (and Draco was trying to hurt him, too so it's actually self-defense IMHO))...

I think Harry would be aghast at being paired with Draco (ok: He'd be aghast at being paired with a Slytherin in general probably, but then again: If it's a girl and if she's beautiful and has similar interests etc. he'd be less shocked and less against it than being paired with Draco - I mean let's face it: He ain't gay and he hates Draco!) and he would probably rather leave the country if someone tried to force it!
