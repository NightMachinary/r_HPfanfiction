I am not a fan, but I get why there is a following (likely more-so among female readers).

Not that I agree with the reasons often used to justify it. Opposites attracts is a useful excuse, but in this case I feel they are just TOO opposite for that to be realistic. Both attractive young males? Yea i guess, but thats a fairly shallow reason to pair them. On and on, I guess I just dont see any real excuse to pair them personally other then just wanting to force it.

Now that said, if you adjust their personalities some, or the world around them, that can change the ball game. And since FF is all about exploring ideas, both within and outside of canon, and the traditional storyline... people can and will make this pairing happen in a more realistic way.

I dont personally enjoy Harry/Draco one bit, but I do enjoy most Harry/Slytherin pairings (although I prefer F/M)... although that may be because in the back of my mind I always kinda wanted Harry in Slytherin.
