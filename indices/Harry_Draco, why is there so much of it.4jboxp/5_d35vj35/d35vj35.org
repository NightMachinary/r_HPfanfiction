I think it's partially because canon Draco really does seem to have a mild obsession with Harry (though Harry doesn't reciprocate). The idea that it was romantic obsession is a leap, but not a massive one. He seems to be fairly appearance-conscious, has an obsession with a boy in his year, and seems to have only a passing interest in a girl who is very obviously into him. So if you believe that Draco is gay and you like Draco as a character, you naturally want to give him a happily ever after. So you pair him up with the object of his interests, regardless of Harry's canon sexuality.

I've never had a big problem with believing that Draco might be interested in Harry (or Hermione), but I do have a problem with the idea of either of them reciprocating.
