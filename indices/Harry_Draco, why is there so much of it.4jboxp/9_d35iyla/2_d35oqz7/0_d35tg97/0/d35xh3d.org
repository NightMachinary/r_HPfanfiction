Agreed re:Underwater Light. And I've read better has time has marched on*, but it was the first I read that I remember. I did very much like her Ron/Pansy story (the title escapes me) and I do recall liking Drop Dead Gorgeous. Draco, in my head canon, will always have a coffee dependency thanks to her, heh.
