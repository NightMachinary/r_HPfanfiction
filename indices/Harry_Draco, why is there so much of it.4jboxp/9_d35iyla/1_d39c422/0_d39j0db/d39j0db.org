Indeed, but the Draco in Leather Pants trope, which I have described in my original post, inspired many/most H/D fics where Draco is portrayed as a misunderstood, attractive character, not the cowardly bigot he is in the canon. Also, while the Draco trilogy features H/Hr, there are enough slash undertones between Harry and Draco, which further inspired more H/D fics.
