I will never understand why people think a single three fics can have that much impact on FF as a whole. It is not in the least bit surprising that Harry/Draco is a popular pairing, because literally every single popular piece of fiction that has a main character with a rival will have fans that ship them together. Do people really think that if it wasn't for the Draco trilogy, there wouldn't be a horde of fangirls who want Harry and Draco to vigorously fuck?

The only reason I know the existence of the Draco trilogy is cos people just love to go on about the impact it supposedly had. It may have been the most popular fic on Fanfiction.net (at least I think it was), but this was in around 2002 I think, where being the most popular fic was significantly less of a big deal. It would be like a 10th of Harry Crow's popularity.
