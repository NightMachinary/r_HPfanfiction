I think you underestimate the amount of influence CC had during her prime years. She wasn't just any popular author like Robst; she was a major Big Name Fan during a time where much of the fandom's mainstream interpretation was being established. During the early years, the fandom was much more centralized, where most major authors knew each other. She, along with several of her friends, was a part of what was called the Inner Circle, which was a group that literally everyone wanted to be close to. One of the main reasons why FictionAlley began was to host The Draco Trilogy, which was banned from FFN.

Her influence comes mainly in her characterization of Draco as a misunderstood, sarcastic, and attractive antihero. You said being the most popular fic was "significantly less of a big deal" back then. It's the exact opposite. You see how tropes like manipulative!Dumbledore being recycled over and over as readers read the old fics and get inspired to write their own. It's like that, except the majority of the fandom was doing it at the time. In fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that most, if not all fics out there that portray Draco in a positive manner are directly or indirectly influenced by CC's trilogy. Sure, H/D would have still been a popular pairing even without CC's influence. But it would not have been to the point where there are more H/D stories than H/Hr or H/G.
