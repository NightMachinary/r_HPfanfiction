For the same reasons that Draco/Hermione is quite popular: because swarms of fangirls think that they can somehow "change" a "bad boy".

Also because of historical reasons: one of the yuge fics back in the day was Cassandra Claire's Draco Trilogy: which was very much influential in giving popularity to the Harry/Draco ship. As I've commented before on this sub: one must also not forget that Cassie and her Draco-loving clique were the "Big Name Fans" back in 2001/2003 or so and thus they had the monopoly on which interpretation of his character was favoured, since fandom at that time was very insular and centralized. Everyone wanted to be one of the BNFs, so what did you have to? Write the ships that they preferred, those being of course Harry/Draco, Draco/Hermione and to a certain extent Harry/Hermione too.
