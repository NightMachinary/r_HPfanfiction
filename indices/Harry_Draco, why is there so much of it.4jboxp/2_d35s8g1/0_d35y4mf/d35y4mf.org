There is such a deep hatred there and such different ideals, that in all honesty I have never bought the "opposite attracts" argument. Just my opinion. I also am a fan of rivals turned lovers and opposites attract at times, but in this case I completely disagree, not that I dont get the idea behind the pairing though.

If you are talking Slytherin house (bearing in mind I am not interested in M/M) I am partial to Harry/Daphne or Tracey, or even occasionally Pansy pairings though.
