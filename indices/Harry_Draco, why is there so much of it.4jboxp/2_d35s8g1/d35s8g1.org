Because they have a fascinating dynamic and are polar opposites, that's why. I've always been a fan of the "rivals-turned-lovers" and "opposites attract" tropes, and Harry/Draco epitomizes that.

Both characters have different personalities, backgrounds, motivations, values, goals, etc., and it's fascinating to think about two such vastly different characters falling in love. Their Romeo-and-Juliet-esque circumtances only adds to the intrigue.

The fact that Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton are incredibly attractive and look really good together doesn't hurt, either.
