It's honestly a criminally underused moment for Harmony divergence. If they're waiting for DH, most authors will have it happen in the tent around the time Ron leaves, which makes perfect sense, but I see your point that this scene is so tender that it would work perfectly as well.\\
Unfortunately, only two stories come to mind off the top of my head, and I can't remember the title or author to either of them. The first involves Harry and Hermione meeting a literal angel in the graveyard scene who basically drops a lot of plot and kind of forces their romantic awakening, also giving an easy out for Voldemort's defeat. It ends with him instructing them to go get married at the nearby church because, as an angel, there's no way he's letting them go do what he *knows* they will do now that they're aware of each other's feelings and are confined to a small tent by themselves without being married, first.

The second is less romantic and involves Harry and Hermione getting married in the church when they go inside only to discover it's a service for older people who wanted to get married officially but never had the money or something. They're sort of peer-pressured into it all but they take their vows as an affirmation of how important they are to one another, though they don't think of it as necessarily romantic at the time. It causes some issues later at Ron and Hermione's wedding.

Hope someone else can think of some good fics with this idea or even take it as a prompt and write it themselves. It's a beautiful concept.
