I honestly think that for a lot of authors the scenes in the last book are simply too mature.

The medical tent, the ball, even HBP.... thats all something a teen can relate to.

The Horcrux hunt is a lot more subtle in its emotion regarding love and relationships, with the one exception of Ron's Horcrux-intensified bout of jealousy. Suddenly there is a bit of grey-zone to it and I don't think a lot of authors who want to write a H/Hr story for the relationship only would know how to deal with that, let alone identify the scenes as the scenes with the most emotional depth.
