Harry was so very tired. Tired of Ginny dragging the Man-Who-Won around like a prize dog at westminister.

Tired of seeing nothing getting better despite supposedly winning the war.

Tired of being looked at with respectful fear and awe everywhere he went.

Tired of seeing reminders of those who were lost constantly. He was so very tired, so tired of it all.

A few fun facts Harry had never thought of until it had hit him like a train.

Transfiguration was permanent, human Transfiguration allowed you to change your body to look however you wanted, and Transfiguration was permanent.

Seems redundant to say Transfiguration was permanent twice but it was not.

After the final battle he was scarred to hell and back. Allowing himself a bit of vanity he had used human Transfiguration to hide the scars and make himself look healthier.

Now five years later he looked the exact same as he had that day. Not a single sign of aging had hit him. He didn't even need to shave after that.

Realizing it was his potential ticket out of here he had started looking into why everyone wasn't Transfigurating themselves immortality young.

Turns out the ministry and the goblins had thought of the problem decades ago. The ministry had enchantments in the atrium that forced a transfigured person to age despite the transfiguration. The goblins had a similar enchantment on the lintel of their doors.

Harry had avoided both places like the plague since before the final battle already. Afterwards he had done so with even greater vigor saving himself from the extra enchantments.

He had an idea and had found a way to accomplish it. Magical tracking followed the impression someone made in the worlds schema. There were hundreds of known factors that built an impression and Harry had learned the biggest ones.

His magical resonance, how his magic felt for lack of a better term, was the biggest. His mental echo was the next largest. A mental echo was built from a person's memories, thoughts and feelings. The last largest factor was the Physcial Connection, what his body was essentially.

He had thought about ways to change his mind and had not been a fan of any of them. It was his research into the Oblivate spell that had gotten him the break he needed.

The Oblivate had been compared to the french word obliutte which was an inescapable prison. He thought perhaps the Oblivate didn't erase memories so much as trap them.

While he wasn't sure if that was the case of not he had created the Libertatibus spell. It held memories in a sort of reverse obliutte. The memories were hidden and could only release themselves.

Through marking the memories with the first half of the spell he attached a trigger to them with the second half. As time passed he would slowly regain his memories until he remembered everything again.

He wanted to gain the memories at roughly half the rate he had lived them. As he was planning to dump a majority of his 23 years of life so far it would take some time to get it all back.\\
Leveraging a few favors had gotten him a large dose of liquid luck, enough for a week in fact. So first he had taken enough for a few hours and spent time in disguise in a magical language learning school.

His luck had shown through and he learned the top 20 most spoken languages in the world, including Mermish, Auroral, and Gobbledygook.

Next he had taken enough for 2 days worth and focused on maintaining his Transfiguration without worrying about others forcing him to age. His luck again held strong and he had stumbled upon a strange combination of Alchemy and Transfiguration that would set his features until he used a specific counter curse to remove it.

The second to last dose had been one that took him 4 days of pure good luck to happen. He had found a way to fuse the Elder Wand into his body allowing him to cast wandless, wordless, intent magic.

All at the low low cost of feeling like splinters were constantly stabbing his entire body. He had spent weeks getting used to the pain enough that he could perform basic tasks again.

The pain refused to subside and it took him nearly a year before he was able to live normally with it. It would still catch him off guard sometimes and he would collapse without warning.

He wasn't sure if an eternity of pain was worth gaining powers Merlin would be jealous of or not. To late to change it afterall so best to just accept the situation.

Those last few hours were reserved for now. He swallowed the remainder and set to work on killing Harry Potter and being reborn.

First he wanted to get a new look and the perfect plan struck him. He had been denied any form of childhood so far and so he would start all over again, sort of.

With a thought a bottle floated over to him unstoppering itself as it did. Soon he downed the alchemical concoction and preformed the specialized Transfiguration.

Harry Potter vanished and now stood a handsome little man who looked to be all of 6 years old. He had given himself silly bright red anime style spikey hair with playful blue eyes. (Young Lindo Tachibana for reference)

He next opened a world book and chose a random location. Creating a under layer portkey, illegal as hell and equally untraceable, he had his destination picked.

A Libertatibus spell later and he felt a strange pulling sensation before finding himself dry heaving on the sidewalk with no idea what was going on.

He could count on one hand the number of things he knew. He was a boy, he was in incredible amounts of pain (though oddly enough it seemed like he was used to it), he could will reality to follow his bidding, he was eternally young, and lastly he was in a city named Gotham.

Everything else was a fair bit fuzzy though he found plenty of other things. He was especially good at astronomy, high level math, seemed to know a smattering of languages, and could name most plants he saw.

Things were slowly filling in as he looked around. Gotham city was an absolute shit hole he could tell, even if he had no idea how or why he could tell.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

How's that for a start? If it's okay I have some plans for it that I'll follow up with.
