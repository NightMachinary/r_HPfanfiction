Could stand to triple what I wrote above in length, at least, by cleaning it up and expanding it. As I am currently sitting in my gazebo over my frozen pond drinking coffee from a thermos I just want to write more. So here is some more of this insanity. Including some notes to myself as well if I rewrite it into a proper fic.

Also Italics are translated speech.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Looking around it was dark as hell in the random alleyway he had found himself in. He had no idea what time it was but late at night seemed about right.

Shrugging his shoulders ne started walking when he realized he was wearing what looked like an oversized dressing gown. Deciding to have fun with it he raised his left hand into the air and thrust his right hand forward while shouting in French "Putain j'ai l'air bien!". A light flowed around him as he spun like a ballerina laughing the whole time.

The ugly as sin robes changed into a nice little ensemble of black leather shoes, black slacks, blue button up with a light gray vest. Laughing gaily at the silliness of it all he started skipping down the alley towards the light at the end.

He was startled when he saw a strange man in a suit and wearing a bag on his head starting running down the Alley his way. The man stopped and began talking in a rough vibrating voice.

"Are you lost little boy, perhaps afraid of the dark scary alley? Let me show you real fear!"

The man tried to spray some stuff at him but he waved it away from existence and looked at the man.

/"Lord in heaven you are so ugly you have to wear a bag on your head. I'm so sorry, and no thanks, I would not like a free sample of perfume."/

Scarecrow was trying to parse together what little French he could remember. Somehow the boy had erased his fear gas from the air and that was interesting.

/"I'll help you out just this once okay. So a quick makeover and maybe a geas to stop spraying people, that's just rude. Oh, great idea! For every person you have sprayed you must help ten people! Until then you will ummm..."/

He placed his hand under his chin and began thinking. Scarecrow was slowly making sense of what he was hearing though it was rather broken. He had heard the word geas though and he knew what that was.

Cursing his luck for upsetting some magic user he started backing away trying to save himself.

The boy noticed the strange man walking backwards and thought it was silly to see. Reaching out he snapped his fingers and changed the man.

/"You look funny mister. I curse you to help ten people for every person you have sprayed or you will only be able to walk backwards, slowly!"/

Seeing the now extremely handsome man walking backwards at a glacial pace set the boy off. Falling to the ground from laughing he kept laughing for a while until the pain snuck up on him.

Suddenly his peals of laughter became scream of pain as the pain broke free in his moment of lasped concentration. Passing out from lack of breath he never noticed the large dark shape swoop down into the alley.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Bruce had noticed the encounter and his French was good enough to follow what the boy had said. Whatever this boy was he was powerful.

To casually erase Scarecrows fear gas, place a geas and add a curse to it required some serious firepower. Watching to boy like being fall to the ground in laughter had been a sight. He really hoped this wasn't a Batmite type being.

When the laughs had turned to screams of pain he had flew down quickly incapacitating Scarecrow as he went.

The boy was in tremendous amounts of pain it seemed and he had no idea why. The scream itself reverberated in the air flowing like waves of pain never ending.

It took the breath out of him as he fought the waves to get closer to the boy. It abruptly cut off as the boy passed out from lack of air.

Bruce stood straighter and looked down at the being. This may have happened in his town but this being was league level business. Tying up Scarecrow and getting confirmation the police were coming for him Bruce approached the boy.

"Two to transport, possible reality warper, medical assistance required. Request J'onn for mind scan and Flash for assistance in possible detainment."

As they were teleported up Bruce began reviewing plans in place for situations like this. They would need to keep the being unconscious for now. Though until they knew what it was they couldn't even be sure what drugs to use.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The medical scans were a mess, even by league standards they were confusing. The DNA had bits of Homo Magi scattered throughout the tangled mess. It was close enough to human to be kissing cousins, though so was Kryptonian so that didn't mean much.

The absolute kicker had been the honest to goodness Death Being DNA. Death beings were not undead, they were anti-life beings who existed in a opposite reality. Death beings could not coexist with this reality.

The Justice League had sealed off that portal and left it well enough alone since that first encounter. That also helped explained the pain the being was in. Having the DNA of a Death Being in your body would cause immense damage to it, much less incredible amounts of pain.

The scans showed it was somehow stabilizing and it would settle in a few centuries. That had been a kicker as well, the beings DNA was hard locked and they had no idea how old he was. It was apparent he was functionally ageless.

They had managed to synthesize something to keep him asleep but the beings body kept burning through it rapidly.

Giovanni had been called in due to the Homo Magi markers and he had performed some divination. Nothing had come up except he was young. J'onn had scanned the sleeping boy and had found almost nothing.

The boys memories were minuscule at best. Mostly nothing more than motor functions, a desire to have fun, some seeming instructions to enjoy life, and what looked like a download of languages. Including four J'onn had never came across before.

Giovanni identified them as Goblin tongue, Mermish, Snake (that one was strange) and most interesting Air Elemental.

Air Elementals were the most common Elemental magic users could come across. Even then though unless you knew what to look for they nearly impossible to see.

Combined with the fact Air Elementals were almost impossible get into a conversation with and so few bothered to learn the language at all, much less have native speaker level fluency in the language.

The only memory J'onn had found was of a flying woman who glowing a golden hue with brilliant red hair. Looking down at the boy she was cupping his face with an expression of love and sadness.

(Edited scene from seeing his mother during the resurrection fight.)

J'onn had tried to explore the memory more and found he could not. Someone, or something, had been responsible for editing the memory and erasing everything except that moment. Incredibly even the background was missing from the memory.

That had led to them comparing his DNA to that of Tamaraneans. Surprisingly only a few genes had matched. Whatever this boy was he was a melting pot of DNA.

(Note add into start of story obtaining Re'em blood and using alchemy to fix his eyesight by gaining traits of an animal, probably eagle and mantis shrimp concoction. Ensure references to Basilisk and Phoenix are here. Drinking liquid luck before starting an alcheminally based custom made human Transfiguration leads to best of all parts seeping into his new form.)

Giovanni had looked over the footage of what the boy had done and declared the boy at least at the level of a Lord of Magic, likely higher.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Probably close to the character limit. Interested slightly in rewriting it, plan to make him a loosely held ward of Bruce Wayne. Will have the Bat clan in existence along with Damien and his mother living there.

He will be less superHero/Villian and more agent of fun/chaos. Should be interesting.
