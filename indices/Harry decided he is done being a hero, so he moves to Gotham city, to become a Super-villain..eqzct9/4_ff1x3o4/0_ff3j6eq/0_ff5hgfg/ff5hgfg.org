Continuing on with my hastily and extremely rough draft/brainstorming thing this is I'll keep going for now. It's been fun posting it out and letting people see the raw hot garbage my first run through an idea usually is. Feel free to comment :)

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The Boy-Who-Was-Once-Called-The-Boy-Who-Lived-But-Now-Doesn't-Know-His-Name woke up to a moderately bright room feeling the pain like a freight train. Gritting his teeth after gasping in pain he took a few deep breaths and pushed it aside.

Sitting up he opened his eyes and promptly closed them again.

Taking a peek he closed them quickly flummoxed quite a fair bit. He wasn't sure completely what normal was but a man dressed in black like a giant bat was not normal.

The tall green dude besides him was not normal either. At least the third had seemed normal enough. The last dude in red and yellow was a trip.

Taking a deep breath he started his introduction.

"I'm not sure if it's my birthday or not but I am sure I didn't order two leather fetish daddies, a captain planet wannabe exhibitionist with a leather fetish as well and their pimp."

Flash busted out laughing at the kids humor, though he was worried how a 6 year old knew what a leather daddy was.

Bruce was inwardly slightly amused though mostly he was taking note of the boys reactions. He had immediately taken note of his surroundings and used crude humor to gauge the situation.

A quick mind that was used to handling new situations while under pressure. Definitely someone to keep an eye on, that sort of skill is developed not inborn.

J'onn had to search his memories for the appropriate understanding of what had been said. Linking the words to the knowledge he had almost smirked at the crude humor. He could see how the applied labels were witty and possible interpretations of the four justice league members.

Finally Giovanni broke through past the sound of flash laughing and started the conversation.

"Interesting ideas you have young man though they are not appropriate. We four are members of the Justice League. We are a group dedicated to helping the world and turning back evil."

He then proceeded to introduce Flash, Batman, Martian Man Hunter and himself.

Making it clear he would like the boys name as well he waited for the boy to speak.

J'onn was monitoring the boys mind as they were introduced and it was difficult. The sheer amount of pain was nearly overwhelming his ability to hear any thoughts and he was getting the pain second hand.

/"I am Doctor, um can I be a doctor, yes I can I guess but to I want to be one? Nah sounds boring, what about Professor? Professor Awesome of the School of Cool. Sounds good, totally using it. Yep, my name is Professor Awesome of the School of Cool."/

Bruce raised an eyebrow, not that anyone could see it, at the boys declaration.

Replying in English Bruce questioned the boy.

"If your a professor you have to teach something. You also need a campus tho teach as well. Where is this campus located at exactly?"

Bruce had found to key to working with semi-sane beings of incredible power years ago. It was actually his constant interactions with the Joker that had brought about this breakthrough policy.

Don't question the validity or even possibility of their statements. Instead question what those statements would imply. If your a Professor what do you teach instead of you cannot just declare yourself as Professor Awesome of the School of Cool.

It would throw them off their game a bit most of the time and they were usually easier to handle. It didn't work occasionally though mostly it was a great strategy.

Professor Awesome stopped and had to think. He had no idea what he could teach to be frank about the matter. Ummm perhaps Professor Awesome was not a good name afterall. Well, no sense in giving up already though. Perhaps they had some ideas.

"I have no idea, what do you think I should be teaching? Never taught before, I think at least, not really sure, though I'm sure I'm great at it, really sure, honestly."

Batman was glad his strategy had paid off and nodded to Giovanni. Giovanni got the hint and stepped forward while giving the boy plenty of room.

"Perhaps for now we could have a class on who you are, what your plans are and what powers you have? You seem like a strong magic user, perhaps we could talk shop."

Professor Awesome brightened at that, he could do that for sure. He had an idea and the room morphed around him. Suddenly the man was smoking a cigarette and wearing a fedora sitting behind a thick wooden desk.

Professor Awesome was sitting in a hard backed wooden chair with a light shining in his face. The room had a vintage American cop film vibe, even having everything in black and white with the other three dressed as old timey cops. He started talking with a Russian accent to top it all off.

"Tsch... Okay, I will tell you all I know. Firstly I am a Professor of Awesome ya. I am teacher, you understand yes? My plans are to enjoy my childhood for the next 45 years until reality catches up"

Stopping he began thinking real hard. That number seemed solid, like the statement was something he knew for sure. It was eerie yet comforting at the same time. Shaking his head to clear it he continued his newest game.

"My powers are they magic? Maybe, I don't know, maybe they are not or maybe the are magic with something else. That is good question comrade."

Giovanni and the other league members were shocked at his casual display of power. It was a smooth transition with only the Flash noticing the changes as they happened. He realized it was harmless after a few moments of thinking in speed force time.

They were all aware of his slip up with the dates. It seemed he had not been aware of that until he had spoken it. There seemed to be much more going on with his missing memory than just erased memories.

Giovanni was interested in seeing if he could revert the room and said as much.

"Well that was fun but let's see if I can do that in reverse now? /Egnahc siht moor dna eht elpoep ni ti kacb ot lamron!/"

The the room was flooded with esoteric symbols and diagrams as his magic went to work. To change a beyond state of the art med-bay to a black and white (even the people) 50's interrogation room was impressive. Turning it back was not much easier.

It took him almost a full minute and wore him out slightly. Still he had accomplished it so he was satisfied and it confirmed the power the boy like being held.

Speaking of the boy he shrugged his shoulders with grin and waved his hand. The world snapped into focus and they realized that it had been grainy like an old television set beforehand and they hadn't noticed.

Bruce asked if the boy had anywhere to go and got an unexpected reply.

"Gotham City, not sure why, just know it's where im supposed to be. Nothing I'm supposed to do, just need to be there for some reason."

That made Bruce uneasy to say the least. If cosmic forces were choosing his town to play in he needed to know and prepare.

"Alright we will go and see if we can arrange someplace for you to stay in Gotham if that's alright? Would you like something to eat while you wait? Anything special you would like?"

"That would be nice of you to find me a place. Some food would be good as well, anything's fine really."

They nodded and left the room. There were other league members keeping an eye on the room and it was located against the outer hull in case they had remove the being.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Most of the founders were present for the meeting. It seemed batman would be their best bet to watch the being. They were reviewing everything they knew so far.

J'onn had just finished speaking of his experiences with the boy. They all were interested in the 45 year timeframe he had given.

Instead of Batman watching directly Bruce Wayne would take the boy in for a time until they had a better handle on the situation.

Bruce currently had his 14 year old son once again living with him along with Talia. That was already a handful, trying to also keep track of a 6 year old reality warper was beyond even him.

He needed a full time magic user on site to help and possibly a few others as well.

He had access to the Failsafe of Pandora and was tempted to use it. Jon was no longer a problem, having erased hinself from existence, and reality was stable. They had thought perhaps it would be best to let her rest. Now though he really needed someone of her level to help.

Barbara and Pandora had gotten along well the few times they had met. If he opened his home to the Titans and let them use it as a staging ground like Damien had been asking that would increase the numbers to something manageable.

Mind made up he addressed the league.

"I wish to use the Failsafe of Pandora. She has over 10,000 years of experience in magical matters. Hopefully with really stable I can convince her to stay. Damien has co-opted a new Teen Titans East that I can help supervise. Using those two resources and getting Barbara to help should be enough to keep this new being from causing undue trouble."

The members debated for a few minutes before agreeing to his plan. It wasn't ideal but it would work, that it also would help train the newest generation was a positive addition.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Good enough place to take a break. Please comment any thoughts about it. Not sticking to pure DC new canon, playing around with it obviously. Still should be fun overall. This is more back drop than anything else, gives the story room to move forward easily. Also looking forward to having fun with Gar ðŸ˜„
