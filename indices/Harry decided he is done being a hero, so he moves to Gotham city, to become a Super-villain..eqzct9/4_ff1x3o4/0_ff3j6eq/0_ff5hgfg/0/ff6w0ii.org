While he was waiting they had delivered a tray of food for him. Mashed potatoes and gravy, steamed vegetables and baked chicken. A rather alright meal all things considered. He was currently turning his mashed potatoes into a lifelike village of potato people when he was interrupted.

"While my folks taught me to never play with my food I'm not sure how they would react to this. Are they alive or are you just moving them?"

The boy shrugged as he started at the perfectly shaped man in red and blue.

"They're alive as long as I want them to be. Here, look."

The village and people grew to cover the bed and changed from potatoes to crystal. The colors altered and it became a little crystal village filled with people. They waved to the boy and he waved back before sending them off to the side of the room.

"It bothers you why?"

He was genuinely curious, it was clear as day the man was uncomfortable.

"It seems frivolous, to create life solely for your enjoyment. You could do great things to help others."

Ah, now he understood. This man was a responsiblity comes first type, putting his own life in a far second place.

"You need a vacation, or to get laid. One or other, wait! Perfect, I got it!"

He concentrated for a second and felt it click into place. Suddenly the man was more, more everything.

"Wow mister, I have no idea who you are but you sure are a good person."

Clark turned and looked in the mirror to see what was going on. Dianna and Hal were staring at him like they had never seen him before.

Hal Jordan spoke up first, his voice filled with wonder and awe.

"What did you do, he's like a god now."

"Wow, you really are a good guy. Everyone sees how his actions have made their life better or worse. The better he has made your life the more amazing he seems."

Dianna nodded, that was easily one of the best gifts a godlike being had granted to someone. Most of them were more of a curse than helpful. Well this was still a curse somewhat for Clark.

He would have to give up his Clark Kent persona until they fixed it, learned to hide it, or it wore off though.

Nodding happily to himself he went back to playing with his not so little anymore village of, now crystal, people.

Dianna caught herself finally and stopped starting. Clark was getting embarrassed, he had only done what was right, nothing more. Heading out here went to find Giovanni, hopefully the magician could help.

"If you are interested a friend of the Justice League has offered to house you in his mansion. That way you could stay there in Gotham while you find out more about yourself."

That seemes really nice of them. These Justice League folks were good people.

"Of course we will need a name to use besides just Professor Awesome. It's a great name, just it dosen't fit in well."

Professor Awesome didn't care about fitting in though he did understand she was just doing her job.

Another one of those weird suddenly knowing things happened and he blurted out a name.

"HJ, call me HJ."

Dianna and Hal both noticed the reaction was similar to when he had spoke of the 45 years. So HJ was either his real name or a nickname.

That was an unexpected windfall though how useful it would be was still to be seen.

Hal Jordan had startled at his old nickname and then stopped worrying about it. HJ while not a common nickname was far from unique.

Dianna took a few steps and bent down beside the young boy. Shenwqs close but still outside his personal space. Smiling she asked the little godlike boy her question again.

"Well HJ, would you like to live in a mansion with a friend of the league. He is housing several other children with powers as well you could play with if your interested."

Smiling at the idea of having others to play with he nodded his head firmly.

"Yes please that sounds wonderful."

Dianna stood up and held out her hand for the boy.

"First lets see about getting you some clothes again. The ones you arrived in are dirty so we gave you this hospital robe."

HJ jumped out of bed and the hospital robe flowed around him. Spliting apart it turned into socks and trainers, underwear and pants, and finally a t-shirt that had a picture of a T-Rex on it wearing a collar with the name Little Doggy on it.

Dianna refused to bat an eye at the spectacle and simply offered her hand again. HJ took her hand they walked down the hallways. It was a short walk to a large room with big circular platforms all over it.

Dianna told the green man there were two to transport to Wayne Manor. Standing on the pad he felt a tingle and then suddenly he was outside a big mansion.

Standing at the door was a happy looking family. The father smiled and introduced his family.

"HJ, meet my wife Talia and our son Damien. I'm Bruce Wayne and this is the family Butler Alfred."

Dianna let go of his hand as she gently pushed him forward. HJ skipped up the steps and stood next to the older teen.

"You want to play? I love to play!"

Damien agreed as he led the boy into the mansion. He remebered the brief father had given everyone on the boy.

Reality warper of unknown power, mischievous, missing majority of his memory, ageless and total power level unknown.

Damien planned to introduce reaction games and test the boy's intelligence while playing.

Making their way to a toy room Bruce kept for visitors children they started playing around.

They had started building a block tower that had evolved somehow into a block fortress. After a half hour of playing with the blocks the fortress was larger than the room had been.

The playroom had expanded as they needed room and their was always more blocks when they needed them. An army of stuffed animals was now laying siege to them as they wore medieval prince outfits with silver crowns.

Damien was giving a rousing speech to their assembled stuff animal army as the prepared to fight off the invaders.

"You may be soft and fluffy but your heart are made of steel! We will not fall at this, the final hour. Now follow me into battle friends as we defend the Fortress of Blocktown!"

HJ was giggling like crazy as he and Damien led the small army out the gates and crashe into the worlds best cuddle pile ever.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Bruce and Talia were watching the monitor with avid interest as the game had grown.

They had both noticed when HJ had reached out for a new block and it had just appeared in his hand. Damien had noticed it as well it seemed from his slight pause.

The boys had kept playing and the room slowly grew in size and the number of stuffed animals grew as well.

Bruce had pulled up the other monitors to see if they were showing the growth or not. They were not, so it had to be some form of localized spatial distortion.

When the game ended with a fluffy cuddle pile of stuffed animals Bruce made sure to grab a couple stills. Embarrassing pictures were a parents prerogative after all.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Alfred knocked on the door and opened it. Taking note of the huge fortress made of blocks, the gigantic room, and the pile of stuffed animals large enough to fill a swimming pool.

"If the young sirs are interested in tea now would be a good time. Masters Bruce and Talia would like to get to know you better young sir."

HJ nodded and tried to get up. Damien and himself were stuck in an especially deep part of the pile. Getting frustrated he willed the room back to normal.

Suddenly the extra stuffed animals vanished and the room was normal sized again. Looking around HJ willed it all to be organized again.

"All cleaned up, let's go have tea! Come on Damien, you have to show me the way!"

Damien led the exicted kid to the palor where Bruce and Talia were waiting.
