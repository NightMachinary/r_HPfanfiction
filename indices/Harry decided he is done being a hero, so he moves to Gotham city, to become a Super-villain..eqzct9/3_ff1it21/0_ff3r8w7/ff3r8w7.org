Yeah read a few of those as well. Have started rough drafting a different one in response to the prompt. More an agent of chaos and fun than anything else with little moral framework.

Basing him off the storybook Peter Pan a fair bit. The one that thinks it's okay to let someone drown when they are playing with mermaids and killing people is perfectly acceptable so long as your having good fun about it.

Have posted in this thread my basic idea so far. Will take some time to clean up the rest of the way though I think it has some promise. Let me know what you think of the premise if you don't mind.
