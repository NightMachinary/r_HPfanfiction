The first half or so of Isolation, by Bex-chan, could be described as 8th year. Without giving away too much, it takes place during Hermiones 8th year, and her and Draco are at Hogwarts, but few people know Draco is there, and he doesn't attend classes. The second half of the story is outside Hogwarts, however.
