I totally know what you mean, OP. I love Draco/Hermione but that pairing (unfortunately) suffers from quite a few poorly written fics.

Since I started keeping record of what I'm reading, I haven't found any really good 8th year fics. One that was okay (I would give it an 80%) would be Presque Toujours Pur linkffn(11153333) but know that maybe 1/3 of that story is about another pairing that is not Draco/Hermione.
