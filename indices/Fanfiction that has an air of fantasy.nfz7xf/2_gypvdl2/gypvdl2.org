It sounds like what you're looking for are fanfictions written before Order of the Phoenix was published. That's around the time the world went from fantasy and magic and wonder to McGuffin hunts and torture-porn and teenage melodrama.

There are some amazing fics that were at least started before that, which don't have Horcruxes or Hallows or Prophecy Spheres, but instead have epic-scale magic. Wastelands of Time is a great example of that, despite being a wartime story. Stories involving fey magic tend to have that kind of thing, too, but depending on when they were written they can also edge too far toward McGuffin hunts to stick to canon.

If you find any great ones, I'd love to hear about them because I'm always looking for more of this type of story, too.
