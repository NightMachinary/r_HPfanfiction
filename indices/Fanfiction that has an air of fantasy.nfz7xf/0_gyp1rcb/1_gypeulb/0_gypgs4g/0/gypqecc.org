  What bothers me is the whole magic can be taught by standardised ways and all you need to do is wave your wand and know the words.

That's not true, though. You need to learn the theory of magic as well. Harry reads three books just to learn the Summoning Charm, for example. One of the first things you learn about magic in the first book is this:

/There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words./

  Like how some people explain why the Ministry thought Sirius was after Harry in POA, that it would be kind of a symbolic act to kill the killer of his master

This kind of symbolic magic is present in the books. There's Lily's sacrifice. Ron retrieving the Sword of Gryffindor from the frozen pond makes him a better candidate for destroying the Locket. There are magically significant numbers.

/He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts./

Deathly Hallows.

I do wish Rowling had provided more, but it certainly is present.
