It makes sense, though. Wizards don't use magic from birth. They only begin learning it at 11, and even then they wouldn't be good at it. So they /are/ like muggles growing up.

It'd also be smart to not rely on magic for everything. You never know when you can find yourself without a wand. Pretty sure canon mentions this too.

And many wizards just aren't good at all magic. Tonks has trouble with basic household charms.
