I agree that this seems to be the point, more than that JKR's magic has “rules.” It's that in many ways, her wizards are just muggles with wands. Why do they have plumbing pipes in Hogwarts, for example? Wizards aren't... /wizardly/ enough. I hate when an author has someone like Ron or Draco say, in response to Harry or Hermione doing something the “hard” way, something like, “did you forget you have magic?” Witches and wizards raised wholly in the Wizarding world shouldn't think that way, as if there's anything other than the magical way of doing things.

Two stories that come to mind in this regard are Transfigurations by Resonant, a very old story, from way before DH (2003 I think?) - Draco has temporarily lost his magic, and there's a scene where he has to get out of his robes, which have many tiny buttons, and he says:

/”It's not enough to unmage me. They have to deprive me of all taste and style as well," Malfoy grumbled, pushing Harry's robe off his shoulders. "At least I've got some useful Muggle experience," he added, starting on the shirt. "My mother would have been quite unable to undo a button with her hands, even to get at a nineteen-year-old gamekeeper."/

I always loved that, the idea that wizards and witches would have millions of wildly impractical tiny buttons that they didn't even know how to do by hand, because they used spells. Why, after all, would you use your hands if you could use a wand? That's the sense of magic being...magical, and wizards being /different/ and doing things differently because they have magic, that is missing from JKR (and most fanfic, unsurprisingly), and I think it's what OP is getting at.

There's also a story called... ugh, what is it. Oh! Saving Draco Malfoy, by Dayspring, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/228288/chapters/346381]]). It is also an older story, probably pre-DH. I don't remember all the details, but in that story, the fact that muggle-raised wizards and witches lack “faith in magic” and continue to be slightly skeptical of new things that seem impossible is something Harry feels to be a weakness, as compared with the students who are magical-world raised, as they all train together for the upcoming fight with Voldemort.

Anyway, it's hard to blame fanfic authors, who are just following JKR's lead. But I too would love to see more stories that take make the magical world...more magical. More /different/ from the non-magical world. Like, not using wands to turn on the oven, or wash the dishes in the sink - but not having ovens or sinks at all.

Edited: I just read the comment below saying it sounds like you're looking for older (pre-OOTP) fics, and looking at my own links in this comment, I have to agree. Saving Draco Malfoy is maybe not pre-OOTP, though maybe, but definitely pre-HBP, and also involves elf magic and bond magic, etc. And there are old stories like Tissue of Silver by fearlessdiva, which has interesting and creative uses of magic. Canon really did shut a lot of that down.
