You do have an interesting point, which is that the magic systems in the book has a fundamental conflict with itself:

- It is supposed to be mystical and whimsical, because that is the setting that the books strive for
- It's to be taught in a boring, 7 year long high school, that's comparable to a normal school experience (graded theory tests, homework, ...)

These two facts do result in a severe conflict, because they're incompatible.

In the books it's resolved mostly by alluding to the existence of rules and laws, without specifying them.

There are 5 exceptions to Gwamps law of transfiguration, so there is a law -- but it's not stated, it's alluded. It's alluded that spells can be created, but not how. It's alluded that you can invent potions and make them more efficent, that there are rules -- but these rules are never explained. Goblins do have some magic, so do house-elfs, but they're different. How? Oh, well, let's go to the next chapter.

In other words: there's more magic, there are explanations. But they are always just around the corner, behind that door that's slightly ajar, but you can't quite open.

This fandom, however, isn't satisfied with just allusion, so they tend to analyze it quite a bit, and then fill the gaps. And, as expected, the fandom tends to overflill. They replace some canon magic, but they also add much more magical theory than needed for the story -- and because the authors are a bit amateurish, you end up with magical cores.

The inherently conflicted magical system of Harry Potter is really interesting, imo -- and you can keep it quite mysterious and whimsical, and still analyze it. But that's something an author needs to want.

If you want an author that walks this balance, stories by Taure get the nuance right, and I'd also say AutumnSouls does it (although I do beta for her, so I'm biased there)
