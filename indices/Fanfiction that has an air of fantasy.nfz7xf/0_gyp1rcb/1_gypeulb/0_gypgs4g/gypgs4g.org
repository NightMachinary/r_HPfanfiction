i think i haven't explained myself well, it's less about it having strict rules and more about the rules being there? i agree that the power levels are ridiculous, there isn't even a canonical limit to how much you can cast. What bothers me is the whole magic can be taught by standardised ways and all you need to do is wave your wand and know the words. I understand that to make a magic system you need to set down rules, and there needs to be a school for the story to happen, but magic is only incorporated in the most superficial ways. Harry Potter is, at its most core level, a boarding school story. That's why the books end when they stop going to boarding school (or when they are supposed to, anyway). I really like fics where they give magical explanations to things that don't make sense in canon, and i feel like it really makes a difference, because then wizards aren't just people with wands, they have different thought processes that come to be by being raised in a magical world. Like how some people explain why the Ministry thought Sirius was after Harry in POA, that it would be kind of a symbolic act to kill the killer of his master (it's far better explained in some posts, trust me, it makes you believe in â€˜wizard logic'). I could go on a long ramble about how this would make the whole muggle raised/magic raised debacle much more significant, but i'm going to stop now and need my rambling thoughts to myself

EDIT: sorry for the epic rant without paragraphs, these aren't ruminated thoughts, they are straight out of the idea-oven, so they may be a little non sensical.
