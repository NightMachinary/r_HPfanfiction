What are those strict rules? We only hear about not being able to conjure up good food out of thin air. Rowling's magic system is honestly one of the most broken in terms of power. Wizards casually conjure matter. They manipulate fate, time, abstract ideas like love and secrets and job positions. It's absurdly powerful.
