does anyone else feel like we've over analysed magic? for me the appeal of magic is that it isn't scientific, you can't analyse it or completely predict it. One of my greatest problems with JKRs system is that magic has a set of strict rules that you CANT break, having all those limitations sucks all the fun out of it.
