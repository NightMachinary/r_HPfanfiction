Linkao3(Certain Dark Things)

Certain Dark Things is one of my favorite fics right now and I love the magical feel of it. It's a fem Harry (Harriet) and she's fascinated by all things magic. I love how the author describes things and the tone of most of the story is light. It's currently up to third year and it's updated once, sometimes twice, a week.

On fanfiction.net I love DisobedienceWriter's fics. Linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt) is a pretty magical one.
