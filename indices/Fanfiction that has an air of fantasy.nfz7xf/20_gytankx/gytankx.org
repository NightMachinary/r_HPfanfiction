This is a big trend in a lot of fandoms. I'm not a literature student so I don't know the real name, but my headcannon is the "calcification of magic": soft magic systems get harder the more "successful" the franchise becomes.

[Sory for long post]

0) ex machinas are seen as amateurish or childish, so writers avoid them at all costs. Avoiding ex machina has 2 options: a) foreshadow and set up thematic/character/plot motifs to build up to it (soft magic) or b) reader satisfaction is based on the readers understanding of the world and how magic works (hard magic). The hard option is easier

1) big fandoms get multimedia spinoffs, especially games. Most RPG games use a magic system similar to DnD, which is incredibly "hard" magic (dice rolls, magica stats, skill trees). Very few games use a very soft magic system (Senhua?, Witcher cut scenes?) because not only is it hard to code, it's difficult to get players to use

1b) in film, hard magic is easier to choreograph for fx, especially fight scenes. Ghibli has very soft magic, but it's animated (and early ones have not speaking characters as unmoving backdrop)
