3) manipulative!Dumbledore and bashing. Older fics that wanted Drarry or Dramione needed "Die for our ship" or "Ron the death eater" tropes. As time went on, Dumbledore bashing couldn't be ignored. If you stop thinking like a story (themes, arcs, symbols), and act like a concerned real person, a lot of "good" characters do horrible or horribly neglectful things.

The Dursleys' abuse in cannon is never violently dangerous, but to a contemporary audience it's beyond the pale, and those who knowingly leave Harry there (Dumbles, McGonagall, Weasleys) are uncomfortably close to enabling abusers.

But for English children's literature, the trope is so obvious that no one noticed at first. The fish doesn't notice the water. Of course the chosen one has Cinderella step-parents! It wouldn't be fair otherwise.

This is why Hermione or Ron can't be the hero(ine). They come from loving families, so they are inappropriate thematically to gain a secret power. Even Narnia or Blighton, the heroes are evacuees or boarders (psychoanalysis of distant families in English upper class is another rabbit hole!)

But Harry's neglectful childhood is thematic soft magic, more powerful than auror training until your wand is an ak47.

Fans and writers do not want to write something that feels like condoning child abuse. But writing a very soft magic system requires thinking in stories, where the Grangers adopting Harry would weaken his thematic arc so Voldemort would win.

Harry chosing to die, and seeing dead Sirius resolves the conflict between Voldemort's fear of death and the power of love. [More recently, since HPMoR and the Dragon Tyrant, readers might disagree that death is to be accepted and the search for immortality leads to evil, but in storytelling terms choosing family over immortality is primordial, rooted in Chivalry, folklore and Gilgamesh]

Ursula leGuin, Dianna Wynn Jones, Ghibli and Gandalf are modern examples of soft magic done well. Earthsea and Chrestomanci are good for exploring worlds where magic is used everyday, affects lives, careers, housework etc, not just abstract grand thematic struggles (though actual plot points are resolved by such intangible arcs)
