I don't know if this fic really fits what you're after, but I really like the way it treats magic (sure, you can train at just a single thing, and you'll get really good at it, but the people like Dumbledore got there by learning /everything/). linkffn(10758358)

​

Edit to add a bit more about the fic: Also, Hogwarts has more cool magical secrets. One set of those - the other Founders having their own hidden rooms - was setting up to be a major plot point, though it hasn't been completed and the fic hasn't updated since 2015

​

This fic is pretty short but it's got one of my favorite versions of the Hogwarts ghosts - linkffn(6243892)
