linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) does away with most of the grit and preserves a lot of quirks and whimsy. Dumbledore is great fun, brilliant and crazy and never letting you know which of those two traits is leading. Voldemort is a minor detail. Most of the story is about spending seven years learning magic and having fun with it.

The author has quite a bit of experience with other work, and it shows in the writing quality.
