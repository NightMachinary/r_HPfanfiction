I left quite a long list on this post the other day, so I'll save space on your thread and link it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/nf57pe/long_stories_with_lots_of_fantasy_elements/gyk1ffj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3][here]] most of these are fairly creature focussed because I find that really fantastical, but I hope you enjoy some of them!
