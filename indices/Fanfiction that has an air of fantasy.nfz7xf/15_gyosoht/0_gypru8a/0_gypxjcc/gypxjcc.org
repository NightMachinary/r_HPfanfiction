Yeah, I know it's really not everyone's cup of tea; also you can kind of ignore it being Snape as for the most of the story his name isn't there. I just enjoyed the colourfulness of the picture this story painted in my head, and thought it was quite a novel idea (although, granted, I don't read that many stories).
