You'd love Alexandra Quick. Definitely in the fantasy tradition and captures a lot of the sense and wonder that you get in book 1 all the way through. It's dark but not gritty.

The only issue is that there aren't any canon characters in it, but it's worth reading if that's something you're ok with.
