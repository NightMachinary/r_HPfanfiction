Maybe I'm boring, but I would see myself as a muggle studies teacher :) It would be super interesting to see how kids/teenagers react to muggle philosophy, evolution of moral, adaptation through the ages, litt√©rature etc. Just seems cool to create a bridge between two world and since IRL I'm a social worker with teenagers, I just love to hear their point of view and help de-stigmatize half blood/squib/muggles
