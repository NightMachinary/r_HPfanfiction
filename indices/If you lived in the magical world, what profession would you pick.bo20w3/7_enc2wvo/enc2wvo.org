I'd love being a herbologist, honestly. Working with all kind of weird plants who -since they're magical- are kinda like pets. That is going from the assumption that there are a LOT more magical and active/exciting plants than mentioned in canon. And to go on long hikes in search of these plants. I'd love magical beasts too, but I'm too much of a coward to face or deal with something unfriendly. And most magical beasts are anything but friendly.

If not that, some sort of enchanter to make all kinds of weird and cool stuff that makes your life easier. The kinds of job that allow you to build your own little magical world with all the stuff you imagined as a kid.
