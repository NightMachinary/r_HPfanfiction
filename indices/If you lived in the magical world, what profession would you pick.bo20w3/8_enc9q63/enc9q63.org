I'd love to be a Newt Scamander type. Maybe a real-life Lockhart without all the fame? (though winning Witch-weekly's Most Charming Smile Award five times in a row would not help me banish any banshees (this is where you can laugh now))

But realistically? If I were to go off my current profession, Hogwarts teacher.
