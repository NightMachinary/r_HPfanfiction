I'd love to be a researcher or inventor. A bit of Dumbledore's deep understanding of magic and a bit of the Twin's craziness and skill with creating enchanted items and I could invent a ton of useful things.

Take the drawing and scanning logic enchantments of the marauder's map, add the text input method used in Riddle's diary and the connectivity of Hermione's DA galleons and I could probably make a parchment that works like a computer with wizardnet and w-mail capability.

Take the enchantments on Arthur's car and the Knight Bus, add rocket engines enchanted to run without fuel, a navigation wizard computer and some spatial distortion magic borrowed from bigger-on-the-inside trunks and I could probably make a warp-capable spaceship.

Take some clothes, enchant them to transfigure themselves into indestructible metal when needed, add rockets, a wizard painting of an AI and some strength enhancing enchantments and I'd have a functional Iron Man armor that I could sell to the aurors for dark wizard hunting.

Or how about a cloak with levitation enchantments that responds to a thought? Strange enough?

I'd basically be The Hacksmith, but magical.
