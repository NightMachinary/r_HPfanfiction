I'd love to be an Unspeakable. I'm naturally introverted and that sort of working environment would suit me perfectly. That and I would be able to research obscure and dangerous magic while wearing that awesome grey robe that hides my identity. Just the thought that I knew more than the average wizard, and even the Minister of Magic, Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump himself/herself would give me a huge thrill.

Naturally I would try to work on projects that are dangerous, but not mortally so. Since magic can literally regrow bones, anything that doesn't kill outright should be fine!
