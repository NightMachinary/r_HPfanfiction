Actually we know Grindelwald was obsessed with the deathly hallows before, as the only thing really said was that he left 'his mark', the mark of the hallows, behind carved into Durmstrang, not that he was planning to kill all muggles at that point.

And a squeaky clean school record? I seem to recall an incident where his dorm caught fire at one point. Granted, he was a prefect and head boy, so he must have been a good student, I mean, it's not like we know of any head boy that killed someone in a bathroom, right?

He was noted as a wise and even kind person, but personally Dumbledore always seemed manipulative to me. That's not to say that he is, it's just my headcannon.

The blood pact, on the other hand, was made the same summer as them meeting and Ariana's death, afterwards Grindelwald 'fled immediatly', so it would have to be created prior.

Edit: Got rid of a word.
