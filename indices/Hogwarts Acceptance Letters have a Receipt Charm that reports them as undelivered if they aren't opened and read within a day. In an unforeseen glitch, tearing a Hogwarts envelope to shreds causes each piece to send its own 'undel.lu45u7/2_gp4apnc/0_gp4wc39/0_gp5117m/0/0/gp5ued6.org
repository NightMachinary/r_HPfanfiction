That might be your headcannon, but we really know nothing about how he felt during his teenage years. For all we know he could have been all for the complete destruction of muggle society in order to control them better. Cannon only puts it down essentially as 'scheming with Grindelwald during his youth', we don't know which one was the extremist first, nor do we know how far they were down the rabbit hole.

And the best part? It's all from Rita. So really, Grindelwald might not have ever brought up his plans and Rita might just had thrown it in for controversy. The only solid thing we have(Which, unfortunately, is from Fantastic Beasts 2) is that they made a blood pact of some kind that would prevent them from harming the other.

That said, the blood pact both annoys and confuses me, as their relationship was meant to end in a battle with unforgivables being used, but this would prevent them from targeting one another in such a fight.
