"Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.

‘I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,' Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, ‘but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.'

A third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-coloured liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.

‘Madam Rosmerta's finest, oak-matured mead,' said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at each other, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself."

​

The texts suggest that dumbledore deliberately enchants them to be annoying after the Dursleys are rude by not offering him a refreshment, to teach them a lesson and get back at them for how they've treated him, harry, and all wizards even if in a small way. Even Harry suspects Dumbledore is enjoying himself. I'm not sure where you're getting that he didn't realize they weren't drinking them.
