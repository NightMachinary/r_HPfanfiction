We are not actually told that Dumbledore has all that influence to begin with. For all the talk about him being the chief warlock we are never explicitly told what powers and responsibilities come with it, our only indication is that Fudge didn't seem to have much problem in kicking him out of his positions back in OotP which doesn't really inspires confidence. My guess is that the position is more administrative and ceremonial in nature, with his only actual difference offered from the other members being that he would be the responsible for keeping the order each session. Plus we don't know to what extent he was actually involved in politics, no matter how many offices someone holds if they are focusing on something else, like running a school, running the order, their own academic research, having a semblance of a social life, caring for keeping their own health in top form and practicing on fighting to keep a dark lord in check... or maybe he just plainly didn't really feel like it, for all we know that is the society he grew up on and he doesn't really seem to have ever had any problem with those particular laws, if it makes sense than chances are that he wouldn't even think to question it (the most overt forms of discrimination like muggle-baiting or hunting are said to have been already made illegal and we are never actually shown the state of economy or the workforce's in cannon to be sure there actually /are/ differences in treatment or wage based on blood-status in first place, the very fact that Umbridge was prosecuting against muggleborns working on the ministry at the very least show that they /did/ find jobs there, and with cleaning spells available and house-elves there is really not much of a use in having anyone hired to perform cleaning duty), specially if he had no particular interest on politics or was weary of holding too much power after the whole Grindewald thing. And being famous or a renowned academic/warrior rarely translates in actual political power in the modern age (yes, unless there are people holding vast parts of the country, making their own rules and holding personal armies to fight among themselves with a religious institution profiting on the background at the same rate they indoctrinate the population then the wizarding world is not part of the Middle-Ages, if nothing else the very existence of a bureaucratic government is indicative of a modern government, and the lack of a standing national army semi-autonomous under the rule of generals fighting among themselves for political power also rules out most classic western forms of governments), the most involvement famous people are generally afforded in such societies is the one related to marketing in the sense that their endorsement of certain political figures or leanings have some pull among the masses, F ex.: Fudge being able to truthfully say that this or that move was approved by Dumbledore himself.

Plus, we are assuming that the reasonable restriction on underage sorcery is a British law, it could potentially be part of the Statute of Secrecy and Britain has to obey it unless they are willing to suffer reprisals from the rest of the ICW (and no, even in the unlikely case that being chief warlock grants him special powers over the laws and politics on Britain no country would ever allow a chairman from any international institution to unilaterally dictate their internal politics, that would be essentially forfeiting their sovereignty, international politics work when enough countries agree on something that the economic/political/social pressure they can collectively exercise on the ones not onboard is bigger than any reticence or protests those unwilling are capable of offering on the issue at a given moment) chances are that in this case the ministry would only follow the international guidelines on the decree with the only adjustments being to fit it with the particulars of their own society.
