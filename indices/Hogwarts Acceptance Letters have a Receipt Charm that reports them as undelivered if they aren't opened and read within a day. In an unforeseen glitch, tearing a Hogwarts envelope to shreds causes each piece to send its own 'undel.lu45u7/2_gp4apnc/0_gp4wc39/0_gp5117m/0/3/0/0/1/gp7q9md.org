Or it could be like the POTUS or the Prime Minister. Yes, they're the leader, and the figurehead, but if the legislators don't want a law passed, it's not going to happen.

This could be through obstruction like not bringing the law to a vote, bribing Wizengamot members to vote the way you want, or just an upperclass that doesn't care about the immigrants in their country.

Yeah, Narcissa Malfoy will pay that mudblood sickles to magically shine her shoe collection, but to consider her an equal? Hardly. Look at racial, gender, and orientation equality, and look how far (and how little) we've come in fifty years. Now, add in the fact that the British magical society seems permanently stuck in a pseudo-Victorian aristocracy where the ones at the top stay wealthy while the immigrants (Hermione) are treated poorly.

As proven multiple times in the series, this bigotry and corruption is widespread throughout all levels of society and government, and Albus is facing an uphill battle from the word go.

Then think about the world events that happened between World War II and '97.

There were Multiple wars, at least one global health crisis (AIDs/HIV), and then you add in the fact that he's responsible for Britain's education and national government, and that he's, I'm assuming, the Secretary-General equivalent to the magical United Nations, and you have one man doing the job of three for almost fifty years. In the time he held all three of those offices, there were several different "muggles" holding the post of Secretary General of the UN.

Personally, I believe that he set out to change the world, but found himself bound with bureaucratic red tape.
