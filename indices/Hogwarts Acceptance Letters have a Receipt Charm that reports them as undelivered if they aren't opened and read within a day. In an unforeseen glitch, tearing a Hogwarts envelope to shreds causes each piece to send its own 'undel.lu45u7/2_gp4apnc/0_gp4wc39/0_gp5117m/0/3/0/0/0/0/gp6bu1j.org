Yeah, true, but even if he doesn't have that much political power, as long as some part of the law he proposes appeals to a certain amount of people, then it should be able to pass. Like say a law to harm death eaters when fighting them. the light and gray faction would likely agree, and that'd be majority, since fanon has seats hold different amount of votes.

Probably not, with Malfoy gold lining Fudge's pocket, he'd probably jump off a cliff by a question. I assume that there's something similar to wartime emergency power, Fudge could probably override anything for money.
