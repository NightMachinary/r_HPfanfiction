  the light and gray faction

The what factions? I highly doubt that the Wizengamot would split itself along such frankly childish lines. If anything I could see a socially conservative faction making up the bulk of the Wizengamot, mostly because they see no reason for change in the first place, but it's more out of complacency and societal inertia than any real desire to keep muggleborns down. Opposing them I imagine would be a loose alliance of socially liberal factions, each pushing for better treatment of their chosen minority group, likely with the pro-muggleborn one holding the biggest sway among their coalition, mostly due to muggleborns being the largest minority group.

On the fringes I suspect would be the political extremists, for example maybe a reactionary group who's political beliefs most closely align with those of the Death Eaters, though they might phrase their beliefs in a more socially acceptable way. Finally, I could see one or a number of groups of radicals seeking to overturn the Statute of Secrecy, possibly for the same or similar reasons as those of Grindlewald.
