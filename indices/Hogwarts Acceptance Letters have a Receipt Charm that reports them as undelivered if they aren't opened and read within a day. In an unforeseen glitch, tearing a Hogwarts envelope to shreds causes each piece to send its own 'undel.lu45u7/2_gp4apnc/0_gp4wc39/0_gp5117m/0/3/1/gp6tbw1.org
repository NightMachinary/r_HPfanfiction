The bigotry is inspite of him, not because of. Remus had an education and job only because of dumbledore. It's his funeral that was venerated by centaurs and merpeople. He offered to pay house elves, not anyone else. He fought for the tales of beedle.

Dumbledore isn't the end all be all of magical UK! He doesn't control their laws! Why are you obsessed with hating dumbledore? The books dont even imply he hated muggles or discriminated. What would be the thematic point of that?

The trace is a huge plot hole is all.

You don't know the first thing about what he lobbied for. Not the first thing. Your first presumption can't be that he didn't care.

And he wasn't 150. He was 110 and had a shit ton of hats to wear. Researching Voldemort was his first priority. Administrating hogwarts and advicing fudge on weekly bases are all full time jobs by themselves. The story has a discriminatory trace system and such, to SHOWCASE privilege! It isn't supposed to be a utopia. That doesn't mean the revolutionary is a bigot simply for not having succeeded. Dumbledore had to cave to the blackmailed governors and leave hogwarts when it was important that he be there. He is so venerated precisely for his humility and respect. If he shoved his way past doors he just looses his credibility.
