Are we talking about the same Albus Dumbledore, who in his youth bought into the idea to rule over the muggles for their own good?

Edit: Also, start of Book 6, when he came to collect Harry from the Dursleys, he charmed some drinking glasses to bounce off the Dursley's heads when they wouldn't take said glasses and drink from them. That was textbook muggle baiting.
