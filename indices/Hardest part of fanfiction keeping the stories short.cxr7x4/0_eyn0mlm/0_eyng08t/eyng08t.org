That's a good reply. To avoid a lack of conciseness in your story you need first to have a good idea of what exactly you envision your story to be in order to properly distinguish which parts are needed and which are not. Sometime we just don't think and write too much.

Honestly, I haven't ever seen a fic as terse as the HP books. Most if not all fics benefit from established world-building and characters to begin with, so we have less of a job in this regard than JK Rowling in this regard but despite that I haven't seen anyone cram as much shit happening in their story under 80k words as the first book for exemple.
