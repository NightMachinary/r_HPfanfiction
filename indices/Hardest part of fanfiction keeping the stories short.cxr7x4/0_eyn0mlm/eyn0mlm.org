Well, the fundamental question you should ask yourself is "is this scene necessary?" You brought up the necessity of scenes and exchanges, and I like too look at scenes through that lens. There are three ways that I like to look at to see if a scene is necessary.

1) *The scene progresses the plot*. This is the most obvious one, and the one that the least people struggle with. You can't very well remove plot progression and expect to have a good story. Scenes that contribute to worldbuilding also tend to fall into this category

2) *The scene establishes the characters*. These are something that a lot of people struggle with. This one encompasses a lot of fluff scenes. They aren't important for the plot, but showing your cast in more day-to-day situations helps to keep them established as actual people rather than plot devices.

3) *The scene adds humour*. Not every fic has humour, but I find that adding in the occasional joke can keep the serious scenes from getting too dark, and good humour does help to engage readers. This category shouldn't be overdone, of course, but neglecting it can make a fic feel very heavy.

If a scene doesn't hit at least one of these points, then seriously consider just deleting it. There's no point in having unnecessary exchanges.

That being said, trying to keep things short can be just as much of an issue as drawing things out. When you try and keep things short, you risk making things feel rushed, which can be just as big a problem. It's a delicate balancing act.
