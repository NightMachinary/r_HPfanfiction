I read for the story-ideas, so I rarely end up reading completed fics...

while sometimes I end up frustrated, more often than not fics contain enough to satisfy me... I filter fics on Spacebattles/Sufficient Velocity by 20k+ Words, and on FFN it tends to be 40,60 or 100k+. Shorter fics i find through recommendations.
