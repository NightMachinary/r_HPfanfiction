From a writer perspective, having readers and hearing what people think motivates you to actually sit your ass down and complete the fic, so...

Give feedback on what you read, people! Good or bad! Somebody made an effort for free, it's the least you could do! (Barring things you read ironically because while reading things ironically is completely fine, mean spirited comments are not).
