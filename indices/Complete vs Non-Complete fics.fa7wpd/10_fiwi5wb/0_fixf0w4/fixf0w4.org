Not unconditionally. If you think a fic's ending is rubbish, it would have been better left incomplete. IMO, at least.

There was a fic I liked a lot whose ending was basically to undo everything that happened in the fic. It ruined the fic for me and I'd have been far happier if the fic had been left incomplete up to that point.
