A fic's completion status, has almost nothing to do with my choice to read it or not.

So I don't filter incomplete works out when searching, but I do approach incomplete fics, that are last updated 3+ years ago, and has less than 20K words, with more caution and make the call to read all of it or not much more swiftly. If their summary is not horrible, I still give them a chance, but if the first few paragraphs makes me think that, author couldn't have possibly managed to fit something worth reading, in 20K or so, I'll drop the story immediately. Usually before even reading the entire first chapter.
