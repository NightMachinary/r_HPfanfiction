I prefer completed. I feel the same frustration. You get 7-50 chapters in then nothing. I then check the date of the last chapter and it's obviously been abandoned for w/e reason. It's so frustrating. It feels like torture haha. Anyway, I look for those first. If I can't find any or if I have already read them then I'll check on not completed but only if they are long enough. I stay away from one shots bc i want to have the idea fleshed out. Usually oneshots are too shallow.
