I think most people /prefer/ completed stories---I mean, unless the writer's ending is really rubbish, who /really/ wants to be left on an eternal cliffie if they've got another option?---but there are so many quality stories that aren't complete and are abandoned, or have very sporadic updates, that filtering by complete just seems...wasteful.

Sure, it's kind of disappointing to get to the end of the nth chapter and realise there's nothing to tie it all up, but I prefer reading up til that point rather than just not reading the fic at all. Never reading abandoned/incomplete fics is really very limiting---loads of fics I absolutely enjoy are abandoned, and they're still good/fun/entertaining reads even though the endings are incomplete. For example, Prince of the Dark Kingdom hasn't been updated in six years, but even so, it's over 1.2 million words (and over 6 complete 'books') of fantastical adventures and interesting worldbuilding that you just miss out on if you avoid all incomplete works.
