I really wish authors would give an outline to where they were planning on taking the fic, if they are unable to finish it. I know they are writing for fun and they truly have no obligation to me or the other readers, but please!!!!

I once fell in love with a fic, only to get to the end and be devastated by the abrupt stop. I've also read to the end to see a lengthy author's note with a general summary of what didn't get written. The later is just so much more satisfying.
