While I tend to prefer completed fics, I don't limit myself to them. For one, I've found that not all completed fics are marked as complete in the header, and some that are marked complete either stop abruptly or the author says, “look for the sequel” at a point I'd consider a chapter break.

For another, some incomplete fics merely update very slowly, and it can be hard to determine which category a story falls into.

Finally, as others have said, some incomplete stories are full of wonderful ideas and writing.
