My preference is for volume. I will prefer a 100,000 word incomplete fic to a 10,000 word complete one.

However, that is just an approximation. My preference is for volume of stuff, not volume of words. Some fics pack a lot more /stuff/ into 10,000 words than most fics do in 100,000.

That "stuff" can be worldbuilding, magic, character interactions, plot twists, moments of awesome, whatever. At the end of the day I read fanfiction to encounter interesting new HP ideas which capture my imagination.

Basically, so long as a fic has something meaty I can get my teeth into, I won't care if it's incomplete. And if it's a complete fic which is full of generic ideas, I will have zero interest in it.
