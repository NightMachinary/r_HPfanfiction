Ohh definitely prefer completed ones. I'm always one of those people that love reading stuff in just one sitting and although there are great fics that are still in progress or have been abandoned, it kinda sucks not being able to complete it. It leaves a sort of incomplete feeling. I do however like to imagine the possible endings for those stories.
