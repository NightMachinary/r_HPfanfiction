I'll read in progress fics. However I greatly prefer completed fics. I rarely if ever read incomplete/abandoned fics because I just can't stand them.

I also have a thing about people putting fics on hiatus. If you put a fic on hiatus there's a 90% I will never read it or any of your other works again. About the only exception I make to that is if there's an author note that says the author is literally in hospital/death in the family/etc.
