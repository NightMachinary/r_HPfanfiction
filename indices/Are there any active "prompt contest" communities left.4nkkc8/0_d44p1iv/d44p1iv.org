You might try putting up a regular thread, or even starting a subreddit with this in mind and linking in with [[/r/FanFiction]] ,[[/r/harrypotter]] and this /r/.

The thing is, prompt contests on Livejournal and Dreamwidth are dead because the two sites are mostly dead. There are kink memes that are still active, but only for really big fandoms with active smut followings, and Harry Potter doesn't really fit the bill.

You might have luck on a site like Tumblr in searching for HP related prompts, or perhaps looking at the challenges associated with a Big Bang, but a lot of prompt contest communities have died off or gone out of fashion because of their format.

These days, in order to get people into this sort of community, you'd probably have to fragment it, because most people in the community only read within their particular window, and because the idea of the "best fic" is going to be so different based on people's preferences.

For example, you'll probably split initially by era: Marauders Era, Canon Era, Next-Gen, and then related AUs to any of those eras. Then you'll have to consider pairings, because even if someone is writing with the grace of Victor Hugo, if it's not the ship they like they're going to say it's the worst fic in the world. And then you'll have to consider genre too - humour and adventure fics versus romance, horror, action, fantasy and the like.

I think the fandom is too big and too varied in 2016 for one prompt everyone votes the winner for. It just won't work in the same way it used to.
