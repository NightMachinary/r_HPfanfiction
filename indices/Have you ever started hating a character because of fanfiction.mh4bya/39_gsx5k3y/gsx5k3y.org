Hermione was my example, too. I didn't have too much of a problem with her in canon (except for her terrible taste in men), but I've developed a real love/hate relationship with her because of fanon.

This has caused me to take another look at some of her canon activities and realize I SHOULD have had a problem with her. When she attacked Ron with the birds because she was jealous? Way out of line. Cheating to get her crush on the quidditch team? She doesn't even LIKE quidditch. SETTING A TEACHER ON FIRE! Illegally brewing a potion too advanced for her (and making her friends steal the supplies by creating a very dangerous situation in class)---then drugging and kidnapping schoolmates to use said potion.

Jesus, this girl was out of control.
