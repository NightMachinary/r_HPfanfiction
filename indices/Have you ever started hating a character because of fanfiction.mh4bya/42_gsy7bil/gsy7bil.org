I'll join you with Hermione.

I actually like canon Hermione in many ways, she's not perfect and could use a bit more focus on her flaws actually hurting her, but she's a good character.

Fanfiction turns her into this pure uber-genius who can figure out everything and will come show everyone how things are supposed to be and is the truest true love of Harry Potter and how DARE that <insert girl here> try to take Harry from her.

Even when not bashing, you often get the 'Oh god, she and Harry are MEANT FOR EACH OTHER!' swooning from everyone and it gets really odd. She's the closest thing in fanfiction to a canon sue I can think of, at times.

I still like Hermione in the books. But in fanfic? I'm really leery of stories where Hermione's a lead, especially in a romance with Harry.
