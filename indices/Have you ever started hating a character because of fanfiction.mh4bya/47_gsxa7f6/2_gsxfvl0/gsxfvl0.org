I 100% second you on how insulting it is when people say that writers only like characters because they're hot. Fanfiction is just words, and most people that write it are bigger fans of the series than they are the books. The attractiveness doesn't really matter. To write a whole multi-chapter fic because you find Hermione hot would be really boring.

I also agree that Hermione (and Ron) have a great arc and are great characters, as are all of Dumbledore's Army. Harry had his fate thrust upon him, and he rose to it beautifully but at the end of the day, he didn't have another choice and knew that. Hermione and Ron chose to sacrifice just as much as Harry when they didn't really have to, because they loved him and it was the right thing to do. Hermione was targeted as a muggle-born and the Weasleys were blood traitors, but she had the option of fleeing with her parents and Ron had the option of hiding with his family. Neither of them took it. Hermione loved Ron, and she wasn't choosing Harry over him when she was camping; she was choosing to carry out Dumbledore's mission for Harry at great personal sacrifice because she wasn't sure that she could count on anyone else to do it if she didn't. They absolutely could not have achieved that goal without Hermione. I don't love how she was given some of book Harry and Ron's best moments, like to me she knew more about magic and theory than Harry, but Harry operated better under intense pressure, so I was bummed when Harry's idea to free the dragon was given to Hermione because that's where Harry really excels, but even in the books, she's irreplaceable.

I also disagree with the idea that the books gave us a lot of great female characters to choose from. It's very male-dominated. Besides Luna, Ginny, Tonks, and Fleur, I'm struggling to think of another woman around Harry's age who wouldn't be just the writers working with a blank slate character. There are other female characters for sure, but they would require the author developing them very carefully outside of canon.
