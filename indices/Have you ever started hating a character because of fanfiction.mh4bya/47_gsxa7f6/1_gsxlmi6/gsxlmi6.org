  It's a shame that so many authors like to reduce here to a caricature and bash her.

It's the exact opposite in fact.

Too many authors writes her as some goddess of magic, that can do NO wrong and is basically capable of defeating Voldemort and his entire death-eater army on her own if she didn't have to drag around Harry and Ron all the time.\\
Too many fanfic-writers write her as a Mary Sue. Not the character you talked about.
