Same, I went through a massive Slytherin Harry/WBWL phase and they pretty much all followed the route of Hermione being a stuck up bossy bookworm who thinks she's better than everyone else. They also write her as a diehard Light fan, which is surprising given her willingness to permanently scar Marietta.

I can't actually find that many Hermione centric fanfics. There were a lot of â€˜Hermione finds out she is a secret Pureblood princess' which makes me gag, but high quality Hermione fics I don't find too often.
