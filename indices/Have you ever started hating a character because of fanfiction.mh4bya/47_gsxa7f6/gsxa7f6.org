  Also I get it, Emma Watson was hot

Note 1: Emma Watson was underage for the majority of the movies.

Note 2: Do you really think that people use Hermione in their fics simply because of how she looks? That's... kinda insulting? Hermione is a character with a /lot/ of potential:

-She starts out as a loner, which means that /anyone/ can befriend her. She's was desperate to be recognised and to find friendship.

-She is a bookworm. She likes to read everything, including random ass trivia. That means that she's a walking, talking plot device. You need the characters to know something random that is needed, but there is no way for them to know? Boom! Hermione read it in a random book.

-She has a strong moral base, and yet the first few years (because of the aforementioned loneliness and desperation for friendship) she will do basically anything for her friends. That can easily grow into an undying loyalty. Also, said pre-existing strong moral base and respect for authority can lead to some very juicy inner conflict as her actions and experiences conflict with her beliefs, eventually leading to interesting character growth.

+ a lot more qualities that make her interesting to write about.

It's a shame that so many authors like to reduce here to a caricature and bash her.
