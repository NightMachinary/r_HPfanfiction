Regulus.

In the books, he was a devout pureblood supremist, who eventually decided he just didn't like Voldemort because he tried to kill Kreacher and possibly because he didn't like horcruxes. But his only role in the story was to be a minor Chekhov's Gun, so it was fine. In fanfics, he's almost always just a perfect person with a troubled path or who got stuck in a bad situation. Or he's an excuse for the author's OC to be a secret member of the Black family. People write him as a Sirius, but better because he's in Slytherin, when he's really just a Lucius who didn't abuse house elves.

I am so sick of seeing him constantly get all this undeserved praise that he is probably the only character who can make me drop a fic just by showing up.
