Same with you on Hermione. The self-representation thing with mostly Hermione is very annoying. You see it in other fandoms too, and there's often whitewashing of that character's flaws. Hermione is made flawless way too often. They take the "cleverest witch of your age" and instead of being the cleverest 13 year old Lupin's known, many treat her as if Lupin had said she's the greatest witch of this period of history. Far too many fics treat her as the second coming of Merlin or close. I filter out BAMF!Hermione fics on AO3 for this reason. I'll still read fics with her if recommended, but as a general rule I avoid most Hermione fics now.
