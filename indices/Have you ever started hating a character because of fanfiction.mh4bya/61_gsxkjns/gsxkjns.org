I agree, canon Hermione great example is annoying. Some people make her so damn annoying in fanfic, when her biggest problem was listening to other people proclaim her the brightest witch of her age. When she literally had people handing things to her because she was chosen to be Harry's friend.

The only Hermione worth reading about is one where she's OOC. Her jealousy of any other female is canon and played up so much that its hard to even go past the summary.

She's like the Wesley Crusher of the fandom, she's annoying as hell but people insist on making her smarter than anyone else who grew up in the WW, its as annoying as it would be for me to go to the UK and proclaim that the USA is the best country in the world.

No one would be able to stand me. OOOOOOOOh how she annoys me, nagging and so damn nosy. I could go on but I have a fanfic to catch up on.
