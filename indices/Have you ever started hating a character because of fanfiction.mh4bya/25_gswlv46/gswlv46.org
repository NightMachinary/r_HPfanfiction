Hermione yes, same as you. She was just fine in the books but a bit stuck up. I wouldn't have been friends with her, she's too abrasive. But hey, she was fictional so I don't care.

Dumbledore is a character I didn't mind in the books but fanfics are really good at pointing out the flaws and just general bad plans he had. I do think of him as manipulative and evil. So I don't "like" him anymore. I don't look up to him. But I do really enjoy evil dumbledore. Makes it so much more fun.
