Nobody dared usher a word. All waited with baited breathes, looking, excited, yet still terrified, at the table where stood two very important wizards.

On one side, Harry Potter, The Boy-Who-Lived. Rumours had it that he had slain a Basilisk under the school. That he faced a spirit as dark as the night, protecting the philosopher's stone. He had won the Triwizard Tournament, which claimed the life of a strong, experienced yound adult.

On the other, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the only one to have more than one middle name in the magical world. Supreme Mugwump, defeater of Grindelwald, and the only one the Dark Lord ever feared. Some would claim him to be the strongest wizard of his age.

Slowly, Harry Potter raised a hand, approaching it towards the middle of the table. There stood the very thing that threatened to break the fragile peace between the two wizards. The last piece of the last Treacle Tart there would be this month. That it was December 31st didn't matter. /It was the last/.

Albus Dumbledore shook his head. Slowly, he raised his wand, a move which Harry mirrored.

Harry Potter frowned. Albus Dumbledore smiled sadly. "I am sorry my boy. I cannot let you just take it. You must understand that it would be way better with me."

"You know nothing, professor Dumbledore!" Harry all but screamed. "I saw it first, and I claimed it first! No ammount of dark lords you killed will change the fact that I will not leave willingly without this tart."

Dumbledore sighed. "So be it. I am sorry, Harry, my dear. This is for the Greatest Good."

Harry Potter woke up with a headache. As he slowly looked around him, he remembered the events that transpired yesterday.

"Yo Harry!" he heard behind him, and as he turned around, he saw Dean coming towards him. "I can't believe he beat you again! I saw you training your dual-bread wielding last night. Well, the night before."

Harry sighed. He did that a lot, lately, it seemed. "Yeah. Can't believe professor Dumbledore is so good at food fights."
