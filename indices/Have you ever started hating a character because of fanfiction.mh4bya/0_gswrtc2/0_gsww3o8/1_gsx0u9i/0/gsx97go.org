I appreciate a good!Dumbledore as well, but unfortunately evil!Dumbledore is so prevalent it's basically just expected at this point. It's nice to see him portrayed as a genuinely kind old man who perhaps just got stuck with too many hats for him to give each one the attention it needs. He's still human. I'm a big fan of Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay for is Dumbledore, as well as a few other things.
