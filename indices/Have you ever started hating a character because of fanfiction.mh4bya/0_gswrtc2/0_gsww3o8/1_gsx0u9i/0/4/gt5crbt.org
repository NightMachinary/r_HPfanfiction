Touched By the Arcane (HP/Bloodborne cross with female Harry) has a pretty good Dumbledore, does something that seems like it'll derail into bashing (namely, locking f!Harry up in the dungeons after her suicide attempt), but he has a decent reason for his actions (her actions and some stuff she had claimed earlier, like Yharnam only being a Voldie nightmare attack, made him think the scar horcrux had possessed her and he needed to assess the situation and get shit figured out)
