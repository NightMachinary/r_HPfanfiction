Yeah, the basic premise is that at some point while Harry was at the dursley's he turned into a small Dragon but nobody noticed. It turns out his Dragon nature is invisible to muggles, but makes him mostly invulnerable. The result is basically Harry Potter with no angst or much danger. It's pretty fun.
