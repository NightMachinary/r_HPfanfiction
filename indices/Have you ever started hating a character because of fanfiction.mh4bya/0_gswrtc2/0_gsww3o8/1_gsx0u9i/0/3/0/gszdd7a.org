Absolutely. Looking back now as a 21 years old I wonder how did I love him so much. I understand why he left Harry with the Dursleys, for starters, but I will never, ever forgive him for not checking on him, not caring that he was abused, that he hated that place. I hate that he didn't try to get Sirius a trial, that confined him to the house he hated the most. That he was manipulative enough to leave Harry mostly in the dark about the horcruxes... I don't think he's bad. But i think he isn't as good as many people make him. He didn't really care about individuals and, again, as much as I understand why, I'll never not think that there could have another way out.
