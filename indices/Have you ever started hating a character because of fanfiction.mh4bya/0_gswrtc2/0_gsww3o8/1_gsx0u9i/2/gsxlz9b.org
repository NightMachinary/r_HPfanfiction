Dumbledore the entire reason the British Isles were in such a fecking mess.

He's like Batman and the Joker, he needs Riddle around so that he can be the great Supreme Mugwhump and ensure that the Light prevails. Every time I see good Dumbledore I think bits of my hair turns white.

The guy literally left Harry in a abusive home, let Snape almost get killed and directly made him join the DE's for revenge, and created a DL. And kept Riddle being a half blood a secret, which would have stopped any DE movement.

Albus is a character that you come to hate the more you read about him and realize all of this. Genial grandpa who is actually a serial killer, lol.
