Should have been noticed by all of the teachers that he let four rich kids beat up and bully and almost kill a poor halfblood for seven years. And then people act surprised that Snape joined the DE's for revenge and/or protection.

And then used a oath on him to keep him practically in slavery.

The more you read fanfic and canon you realize how many shitty people are in charge of a school of children and Hogwarts did nothing more than churn out angry people who hated each other even after they graduated.

All of the senior teachers even the school nurse had to see how Sev was treated but did nothing, but they kissed Harry's ass so much he didn't need to use tissue.
