Definitely Draco Malfoy. He's an annoying little shit in the books, but I didn't really care. Having him shoehorned in or, worse, a romantic option in numerous fics has made me hard pass fics with him listed as a character. He's not particularly interesting, he's just a kid taught to be bigoted. I don't understand the interest in him and I've never seen him add anything to a fic, really.
