Yeah, that fight made Ron a horrible person, but no, the same people make Draco Malfoy the poorly misunderstood boy. Ron made a mistake, lets blow it out of proportion.

What if Draco killed Dumbledore, Voldemort threatened him. Yeah, like he wasn't threatening half the wizarding world with him too.

God, how can you love Draco Malfoy and then go on and hate Ron Weasley?
