Reading fanfiction has made me extremely protective of Ron, actually. I feel like he was one of the realest characters in canon and it hurts my heart to see people bashing him because he was jealous/insecure??? as a teenager??? with his extremely famous and wealthy friend and "brightest witch of her age" crush????? Y'all must be a better people than me, because I know I'd have a huge complex if I had an adolescence like Ron.
