I think that's responsible for a lot of Harmony shipping too. Of COURSE movie Hermione seems like the perfect match for Harry - she's essentially a composite character of all the best qualities of book Hermione and book Ron while movie Ron gets demoted to dumb comic relief sidekick. The fact that they also butchered Ginny doesn't help either.

Book Hermione and book Harry are much less compatible romantically; Harry loves her like a sister, but he doesn't always like her very much. He either ignores, avoids, or snaps at her when she's nagging and she can't let stuff go without Ron stepping in and telling her to cool it. Hermione is intense and overbearing, Harry is almost always constantly in a state of extreme stress, and they both need partners who can calm them down before they self destruct - like Ginny and Ron.
