I'm starting to get tired of how Goblins are depicted in figs as these snarling sneering wizard-hating beasts who'd like to be anywhere but there.

In canon they are seen as very polite, and as banking is their jobs, I doubt they'd treat their customers bad no matter how bad they are treated (with exceptions).
