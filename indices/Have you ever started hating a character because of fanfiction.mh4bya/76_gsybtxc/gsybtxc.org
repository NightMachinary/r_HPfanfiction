I'm a dude and I see Hermione being as such for Harry. And I enjoy it. I don't know which ones you've been reading, the ones I have been aren't bad.

Unless of course if they're written by someone who's clearly new, or they use some tropes that DO NOT AT ALL sit well with me. I'm not so sure you want me to elaborate on that. You might ask for some Brain Bleach afterwards.

If it's a long one, slow burn is the way to play. And the Harmonie isn't even the main focus for all of them. Take â€˜A Marauder's Plan' for example. The Ancient and Noble Houses trope is really well done in this fic.

Fanworks certainly have made me see Dumbles in a whole new light.
