I've only read *Reckoners* series from Sanderson and enjoyed it, but his other books don't interest me much despite their popularity. I'm more of an urban fantasy fan. Not very fond of kings, queens and all that.

I have read *the Dark Tower* and really enjoyed it, although it had some disappointing parts too, like that dumb happy ending for Susanna.

I tried reading the first book in *Discworld* series, but lost interest. It was *the Color of Magic*, if I'm not mistaking.

Thanks for all the recommendations, I haven't read the rest. Now I have somewhere to start. :)
