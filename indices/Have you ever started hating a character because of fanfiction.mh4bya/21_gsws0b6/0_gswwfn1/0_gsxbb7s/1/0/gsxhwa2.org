The Color of Magic is also a rough starting place. I'd suggest something like Guards Guards, or the Hogfather, as better options.

Red Rising is a good sci fi series as well, but it's in first person if that bothers you. It starts as a sci fi Hunger Games but quickly goes in other directions.

Sanderson is also writing a sci fi YA series called Skyward that is pretty good, the first two books are out and he's currently writing on the third. The second Mistborn trilogy is set in what you could roughly call a Western (they're starting to get things like telegraphs and other technologies) while keeping some fantasy elements. You can read it without reading the first Mistborn trilogy without much trouble. His plan is to have a modern era after that, and then a sci fi era.
