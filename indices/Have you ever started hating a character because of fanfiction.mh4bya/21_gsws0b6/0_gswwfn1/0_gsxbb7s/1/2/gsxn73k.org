For urban fantasy, Charlie N. Holmburg's "The Paper Magician" series might fit the bill. It is a three book series set in London in 1901. The main character is a college-aged young woman who learns magic, discovers new things about magic, and apprehends a murderer at the end. No kings, queens, knights, high sorcerers, or any of that.
