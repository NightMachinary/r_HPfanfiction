Are you a fan of Brandon Sanderson? I really love his fantasy series. If you haven't, I suggest starting with Mistborn or with The Way of Kings.

Stephen King's Dark Tower series is a really interesting mix of fantasy and horror. The first book is not representative of the series as a whole, it gets much better as more characters are added.

Tad Williams Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series is also pretty good. And his Otherland series if you like sci fi.

Speaking of sci fi, The Expanse is really good, and I really enjoy Iain Banks' The Culture series (the best place to start is The Player of Games).

Discworld by Terry Pratchett is also a lot of fun.

RF Kuang's The Poppy War is an interesting take on Asian fantasy, but it's also pretty dark.

I hope any of this helps!
