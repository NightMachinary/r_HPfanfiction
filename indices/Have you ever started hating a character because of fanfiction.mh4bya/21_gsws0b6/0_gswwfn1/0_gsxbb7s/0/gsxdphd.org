If you start with Player of Games, you need to go back and read Consider Phlebas fairly soon because the Culture/Idiran war features in a couple of other stories, most especially Look to Windward (both novels take their names from the same TS Eliot poem).

For more sci-fi, or at least, Space Opera, Alastair Reynolds' "Revelation Space" series is worth checking out.
