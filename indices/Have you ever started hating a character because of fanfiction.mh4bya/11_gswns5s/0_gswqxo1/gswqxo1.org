I am the same.

Hermione often defaults to god hermione

there are so many fan fics where harry is raised by a different people and yet he some how runs into young granger and becomes friends.

meanwhile so many fanfics just Eject Ron.

there was a fic where Sirius decides to mentor Harry after goblet of fire. and Harry has a line about how he doubts his friendship with ron will survive due to his new found maturity

and its like huh ?
