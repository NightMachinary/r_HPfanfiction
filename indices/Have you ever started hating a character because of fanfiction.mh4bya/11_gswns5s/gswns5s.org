Same, I'm so done with Hermione that at this point, any fic shipping her with Harry is a deal breaker for me.

Strangely enough, fanfics also had an opposite effect about Ron for me. I was pretty neutral about him in Canon (he was one of the Trio, with his qualities and flaws, nothing else to add), but after seeing him being bashed so much in fanfics, I became really protective of him.The boy may not be perfect, but he was not lazy or stupid, and was always there when it counted.

PS : oh yeah and movies just destroyed the character. Either ignoring his qualities or giving them to Hermione.
