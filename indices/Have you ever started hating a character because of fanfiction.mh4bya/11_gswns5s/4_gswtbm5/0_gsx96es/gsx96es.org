Yeah, while we are at it : I know Hermione was played by Emma Watson in the movies and was hot, but Book Hermione is not a model. She has untamable hairs, front teeth big enough to be compared to a beaver (at least until GoF where she deals with it) and takes little to zero care of her appearance.

Harry considered Hermione pretty exactly once in the series, and it was when he saw her at the Yule Ball where she litteraly spent her day getting ready. Hermione greatest strenght is her mind, and that's what drew people to her, not some perfect appearance.
