Yes. THIS.

I love Hermione, but fics that portray her as this massive badass just make me tired of her character. Not to mention they always bash Ron in the same breath because the writers only seem to take reference from the movies and other fanfics, and forget book canon exists at all.

I've become so protective of Ron and the Weasleys because of all the bashing...like chill, just say you hate poor people and go.
