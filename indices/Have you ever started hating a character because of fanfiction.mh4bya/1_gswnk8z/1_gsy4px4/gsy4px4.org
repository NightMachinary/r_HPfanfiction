Yeah, there was a lot I never noticed about Molly in canon which fanon pointed out as rightly worrying. Like that throwaway line about her brewing a love potion at Hogwarts (which is coincidentally when she started dating Arthur). Although it's often blown out of proportion as “she has been love potioning Arthur for the entirety of their marriage”, it's worrying enough without fanfics needing to exaggerate.
