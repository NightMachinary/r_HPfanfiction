I read too many borderline Molly bashing fics for a while and started to dislike her. I'm getting out of that habit tho, I am currently rereading the books and it melts my heart how sweet she treats Harry.

And when it comes to Hermione it switched. I grew up with movie Hermione and loved her. Then I read the books when I was 12 and hated her (I almost stopped reading, that was kinda dramatic) but nowdays I love it when authors use book Hermione and I can't stand movie Hermione.
