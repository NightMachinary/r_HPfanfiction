So instead of being a so called good mother figure to Harry and ask him like any good mother figure would or any decent adult in fact would she just chose to bury her head in the sand, wow Molly Weasley Mother of the year lets just brush of serious accusations of child abuse.

she is kind of like Fudge when you think about it, brushing off Harry's concerns about Voldemort being back, I guess Fudge was right all along Harry is a liar after all, you should never believe a word a child says. after all all children have probably lied about something at least once even Harry. You should not brush of your child or children you love because you think they are lying that is a good way of having them not trust you with anything serious again, is it any wonder Harry doesn't go the the adult in his life more for help, they never actually listen to him and help him anyway.
