  Fred and George say there are bars on his window and are starving him.

Because Fred and George are completely trustworthy.

Look, Molly has lots of flaws, but she has very little reason not to believe that Fred and George are vastly exaggerating the severity of Harry's home life. Firstly they're Fred and George, Molly is already predisposed to not trust their word given how often they lie to her. And secondly they drop this when Molly is mid rant about them taking the car, it sounds like something they're saying in a vain attempt to justify themselves and get out of trouble. Fred and George never bring it up again, if they'd come up to Molly the next day or something and said "Mum ,we were serious about the bars" she'd probably have taken that a lot more seriously.
