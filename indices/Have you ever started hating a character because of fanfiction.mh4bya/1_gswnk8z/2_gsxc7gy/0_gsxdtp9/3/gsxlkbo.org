I wish people would stop saying Molly was a good surrogate mother to Harry the reality is she wasn't a good one she was a pretty shit one.

She claims Harry is as good as her son when in reality he hardly has spent any time with her at all at that , a couple of weeks after first year a couple of days after second year and a few more weeks after third year. Overall he spends around a month with her in 15 years of his life not really a mother figure. Molly also allows harry to be sent back to be abused every year by the Dursleys simply because Albus Dubledore says, even when Fred and George say there are bars on his window and are starving him. Molly Weasley doesn't care about Harry's feelings at all. if she considered real mother figure to Harry through out the series then she is a really Shit one. Especially when it really counts
