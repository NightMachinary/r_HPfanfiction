Sirius stayed in a cave and ate rats to be close to Harry. It meant the world to Harry because no adult has shown that level of devotion to him.

Molly and Sirius simply had different approaches on what was right for Harry and they clashed. Sirius' position Harry should know more is vindicated by his own death.

Molly is being protective, as is her right- and in a normal war, which was not centered around Harry, her position is the correct one. But Harry is in a unique position in this war and that needed to be taken into account.
