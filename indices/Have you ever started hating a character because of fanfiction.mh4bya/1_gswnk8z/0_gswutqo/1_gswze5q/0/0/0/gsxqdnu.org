I think that it may be a common issue that if you read the books first, the movies never seem to live up to them, or if you see a movie before reading the book it is based on, it is harder to get into the book. At least it is this way for me. I read the Harry Potter books first, so for me, the movies left a bit to be desired, as I felt there was stuff in the books that should have been in the movies, and some stuff added, that should not have been, as it was not in the books. Conversely, I have seen other movies, that were based on books, and then tried to read the book afterwards, and had a hard time getting into the book, as it was different from the movie.
