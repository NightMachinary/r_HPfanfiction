Hermione is the logical choice for a female MC, along with switching Harry to a woman - I'm not sure why people seem surprised by that so often. She's the most prominent female character in the series, she's a popular character, she's smart, etc. There's a lot of strong points to her character. That also makes her a natural pairing for Harry, especially since the canon pairings are fairly controversial/disliked on the whole.

Basically every other female character is not particularly well developed or present - why would you think that they would be used more often? Do you think that Harry is overly used as the MC or focus of stories? It's natural that he is - he's the MC of the books and the most prominent male character, so he's the default choice. Hermione is just the equivalent for the women of the books. And there are /far/ fewer 'perfect Hermione' fics out there than 'perfect Harry' ones, in my experience.

As for characters that I dislike because of fanfiction, I don't know if there really are any. I guess I've had the opposite for Ginny with a few decently written stories involving her, where I like her a little more? I tend not to consider the negative impressions I get from characters in fanfiction to reflect on the character, but more on the story/author.
