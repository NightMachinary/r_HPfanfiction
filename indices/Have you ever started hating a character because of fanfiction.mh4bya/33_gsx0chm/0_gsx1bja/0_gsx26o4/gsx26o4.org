Based on fan reactions? Like, there's a million "Why Harry and Ginny shouldn't be together" or "Ron/Hermione shouldn't be together" articles and posts out there, they were definitely large chunks of the fandom against those pairings. (Even JKR mentioned later that the Ron/Hermione pairing was more her forcing it and that in many ways Harry/Hermione made sense)

Do we have a perfect breakdown of the reaction/opinion across the fandom? Of course not. But it's naive to pretend there wasn't (and still is) a lot of disagreement over the canon pairings.
