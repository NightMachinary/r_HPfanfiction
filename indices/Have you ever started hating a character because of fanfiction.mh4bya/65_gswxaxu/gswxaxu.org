I should probably generally speaking get off reddit, but I had this journey for Ron of

1. Reasonable human casually reading canon interpretation. Harry's kinda funny, kinda dopey, fun, brave friend, mean sometimes, mostly cool.

2. Read bashing fics. Now canon Ron, by contrast, is the most loyal, wonderful, friend a person could ask for, best sense of humor in the series.

3. Read reddit opinions. Similar to 2. Now I kinda hate him, again by contrast. Ron's a thoughtless, faithless friend, only interacts with Hermione by bullying her, does nothing useful in books 4-7. Unfortunately canon supports this one to those with this bias already in place so I'm stuck here.
