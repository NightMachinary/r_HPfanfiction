Lol bro.

If you're gonna reject actual canon moments that prove you wrong and change the goalposts, I see no point in this conversation.

And for posterity's sake, here is (nowhere near complete) a list of the times Ron praises/compliments/makes Heemiome feel good although I doubt [[/u/chlorinecrownt][u/chlorinecrownt]] will acknowledge their existence.

“I mean, I know you're good, Hermione, but no one's that good. How're you supposed to be in three classes at once?” Chapter 6, PoA

“Hermione, I don't know what's got into you lately!” said Ron, astounded. “First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney --” Hermione looked flattered. Chapter 16, PoA

“How do you remember stuff like that?” asked Ron, looking at her in admiration. Chapter 12, OotP “We just haven't got your brains or your concentration --- you're just cleverer than we are-“ chapter 12, OotP

“Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met.” Chapter 14, OotP

“Well, what's so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. “You are the best in the year -- I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!” chapter 9, HBP

“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before Hermione could answer. Chapter 22, HBP

Here are some instances that show Ron comforting Hermione or caring about her in some other way.

GoF Ch. 21 “Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything,” said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another, it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.

“Hagrid's been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore's never sacked him,” said Ron consolingly. “Worst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry, did I say worst? I meant best.”

Harry and Hermione laughed, and feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.

PoA Ch. 6: “They wouldn't fire him, would they?” said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steak-and-kidney pudding.

“They'd better not,' said Ron, who wasn't eating either.

• “You don't reckon Malfoy did something to her?” Ron asked anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. (PA217/295) [PA15]

• “You know what, Hermione?” said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. “I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.” (PA218/295) [PA15].

• With that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.“Oi!” Ron called after her, “We've got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,” he said, turning back to Harry, “she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam” (GF533/614) [GF31].

• Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night (OP626/710) [OP31].
