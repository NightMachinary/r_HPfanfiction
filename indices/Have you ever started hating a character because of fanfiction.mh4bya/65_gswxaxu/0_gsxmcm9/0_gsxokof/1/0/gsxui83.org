Honestly, reasonable counterpoint.

Here's what my horribly biased brain does to that event:

Dumbledore gives Ron a Harry-finder, Ron happens to follow it at the right time to avert a disaster, then Harry has him kill the horcrux to throw him a bone.

I guess it didn't feel like things go any different if Ron isn't there/literally anyone could have done the same thing? Like a muggle walks by, sees a drowning kid, helps him out, then Harry kills the horcrux. Or Harry puts the horcrux down, jumps in, gets sword out, kills Horcrux. Or Harry nearly drowns, Snape goes "shit", levitates him out, Harry kills horcrux.

I feel like if the JKR from PoA, who actually liked Ron, was writing this, she would have made him... follow Snape? Figure out how the thingy worked by pouring hours of his life into it, then maybe use some kind of keepsake that Harry had given him? Something better demonstrating that Ron had a choice.
