That was a tiny, goofy fanfic parodying your over-the-top hostility towards Hermione, Harmony, and fans of either. It's reasonable to think you might have found that funny. Your comment was just "this person likes a ship I don't like, therefore their opinion is invalid". It's not the same thing at all.

It's also worth saying that as a Hermione fan I don't consider comparisons to her to be particularly insulting.
