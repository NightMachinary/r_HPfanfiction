  Never heard of anyone disliking book Ginny. Or Movie Ginny I suppose.

/waves/ You have now. I found her creepy in the early books. Her relationship with Harry in the later books felt a bit off to me, even several years before I heard about the love potion theory.

Bill's the only Weasley whom I actually like. Ron, Ginny and Molly I actively dislike, while I have mixed feelings about the rest.
