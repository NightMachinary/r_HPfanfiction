Only time I disliked Ginny in the books is the one time she snapped at Hermione. The sectumsempra chapter was so bad, ‘at least Harry had something good up his sleeve' and snapping at her about not understanding Quidditch was so unnecessary. Harry absolutely deserved Hermione and how she was talking to him he had almost killed someone and would've if Snape wasn't near by. Harry didn't even feel enough remorse to actually hand in the correct potions book which is despicable and Hermione was right. He was using spells he didn't know or understand even McGonagall said he was lucky to not be expelled. He would have been expelled if he was the the BWL.

People can argue that Harry ‘felt horribly for doing it' but it's simply not true he said the worst punishment was losing quidditch, and after Ginny defended him he ‘felt lighthearted'.

Which certainly altered my love of Harry but Ginny was so wrong there. Yes Draco would have used Crucio but Harry used a disarming spell on Voldemort why not on Draco?? I truly never understood how both Ron and Ginny were like ‘meh' after Harry attacked Draco, Hermione seems to be the only one who isn't excusing his actions even if it is because she is arrogantly happy that she was right about the book being dangerous
