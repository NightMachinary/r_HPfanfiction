- Ron (though I didn't like him much even in the books)
- Ginny
- Dumbledore (though I can take good and bad Dumbles equally)
- Molly (though again around GoF I wanted to punch her in the face mostly already)

I guess the only change there was really Ginny. Book Ginny is reasonably great. FF Ginny tends to really go off the rails. If you don't like smother-y adults you can reasonably be sick of Molly Weasley in the books. Even though she's never a bad person. Especially with that borderline Cathy Bates behavior in OotP. But not Ginny. Never heard of anyone disliking book Ginny. Or Movie Ginny I suppose. That was a solid casting.

PS - fuck Ron.
