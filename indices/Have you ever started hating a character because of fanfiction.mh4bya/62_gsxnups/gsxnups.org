Hermione, definitely. Dumbledore, too. I don't necessarily /hate/ them, but I do hate a lot of the actions they did or some of their personality traits. Some traits of Molly Weasley, too. I don't remember what I originally thought of her while reading the books, though I do know that I was annoyed when she was the "overbearing" mother, especially to Sirius. They didn't really make me hate them, since the resentment was there, but they did remind me of things that I might've forgotten.
