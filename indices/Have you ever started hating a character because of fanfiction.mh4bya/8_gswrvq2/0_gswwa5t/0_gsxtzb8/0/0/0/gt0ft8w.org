Books with male protagonist, and mostly urban fantasy, although I read good books from other genres except romance if they are good. Some of my favorite fantasy series are **Nightside**, **Alex Verus**, **Ranger's Apprentice**, **Demenata**, **Felix Castor**, **Dresden Files**, **the Dark Tower**, **Hawk and Fisher** etc.

Most fantasy series that are popluar nowadays are full of court politics and political intrigue, something I really don't care for.
