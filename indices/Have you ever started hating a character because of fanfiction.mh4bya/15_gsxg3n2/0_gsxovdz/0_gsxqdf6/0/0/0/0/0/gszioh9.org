First of all, the “chosen one” isn't even public knowledge until book 6 and even the Order sans Dumbledore and Snape don't know about it until book 5. Second of all, Harry is still just a kid. He needs to be /protected/ from people who want to use him for political reasons. This is part of why Dumbledore wanted him to be raised in the Muggle world (even if that turned out to be a terrible idea).

You're making a lot of assumptions and “well this COULD happen” here, and none of them even lead to a Lucius that's a good influence on Harry. At best he becomes a quiet racist that doesn't actively commit hate crimes. Still doesn't make him a good role model or guardian for a child.

So you admit “training to defeat Voldemort” is irrelevant to the discussion at hand then. What Dumbledore does and doesn't do has nothing to do with whether the Weasleys or Malfoys would be a better influence. Moving on.

Dumbledore is ON the Wizengamot, he is not the entire Wizengamot, and it's extremely unlikely he's personally involved in child custody cases. The Order is not a ministry-sanctioned group and Dumbledore's status is therefore irrelevant to legal matters. His position as the guy who will be this kid's school headmaster in 10 years is just as irrelevant. Dumbledore may have wanted Harry at the Dursleys and personally delivered him there, but considering James and Lily had no other friends or family that could take Harry in, he was probably going to end up there anyway. There is no reason to suspect Dumbledore was involved with Harry's placement at the Dursleys and no evidence the Weasleys even knew about the blood wards. If they wanted to fight about Harry's living situation, they would have to take it to court, not the school headmaster, and Harry would likely have to testify against the Dursleys.

Writing in character is still important in an AU unless there's a REASON the character behaves differently; a life altering experience that didn't happen in canon, a life altering experience that DID happen in canon but not in the AU, raised by different parents, etc.

Andromeda was never a death eater and left her family when she was a very young adult. There was no evidence that she ever bought the pureblood supremacy bullshit, but even if she did she wasn't in nearly as deep. It's a lot easier to admit you were wrong when you're young and in love and NOT part of a terrorist cult. I'm not saying the Malfoys CAN'T eventually change their ways a little bit, but it would be extremely difficult to write well without going wildly out of character, and quite frankly most fanfic writers do not have that ability.
