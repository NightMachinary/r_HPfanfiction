  You're making a lot of assumptions and “well this COULD happen” here, and none of them even lead to a Lucius that's a good influence on Harry. At best he becomes a quiet racist that doesn't actively commit hate crimes. Still doesn't make him a good role model or guardian for a child.

Sure, but better than the Dursleys. You seem to have no issue with /Dumbledore/ being Harry's mentor. Yet you insist that in a scenario where Harry was not close to the Weasleys as in canon (e.g. where Harry ends up in Slytherin and makes friends with Draco), even a fairly reformed Lucius/Narcissa could not possibly have provided any structure, support or kindness at all compared to the Dursleys. From what we see of Harry, he spends a hell of a lot of time at the Weasleys', but he also slacks off with Ron at school, and relies on Hermione for answers. I don't think Lucius would have stood for that.

I'm pretty sure that had a Slyth!Harry in an/alternate universe/ spent an equivalent amount of time at the Malfoys', he might have had more emphasis on other things, such as discipline when studying, and extra magical techniques. Are you suggesting that, for instance, he might never have benefited from using Draco's Potions lab? Or from the extra subject knowledge that Draco had? Or just from... I don't know... learning about how magic is used in other cultures? Or whatever other generalised knowledge it is that Draco has soaked up from his 4 or 5 extra years of magical schooling and growing up in a wizarding home?

I'm not suggesting Harry jump for joy at the prospect of visiting former DEs. I'm not suggesting Lucius bend over backwards to welcome Harry into his home, teach him Occlumency and then proclaim that he's going to host a tea party for the Prime Minister.

I'm just saying that in an AU fic, had Harry eventually spent most of his summer holidays at Malfoy Manor, he would've had a lot more structure during his holidays. He would've had more 1:1 interactions with Draco and a quieter time of it. That's what I mean by structure.

And maybe he could've had some exposure to different aspects of the magical world than we got with the Weasleys. Yes, I am talking about an AU fic in which Harry befriends Draco instead of Ron.

And yes, I do think that there are interesting conversations to be had around why Lucius joined the DEs and why he no longer believes in them --- whether that's between Harry and an /AU/ Draco, Draco and his parents, or Harry and the Malfoys.

By that logic, you could argue that Dumbledore was also “a quiet murderer” because he once allied himself with Grindelwald. Even in DH, his ‘greater good' philosophy is still there and it sucks.

Yes, but in canon, most of the DEs are painted as thugs. I don't understand how it's that much of a stretch to believe Lucius might, as a result of his conversations with Harry, or some other defining experience during the twelve years LV was believed to be dead, realise that Voldemort was legitimately wrong. And then maybe not destroy the Diarycrux - or at least try to get out of it. These are all AU scenarios.

I am actually suggesting that perhaps, before or during PS, Lucius, Narcissa or both could have an inciting incident which changes their view (however slowly) on Voldemort and/or Muggles. I don't understand why that's so hard for you to grasp. People can change as adults, and in a realistic world, they do.

  but considering James and Lily had no other friends or family that could take Harry in, he was probably going to end up there anyway.
#+end_quote

As much as I cavil at Remus as a potential guardian, he /is/ one of James and Lily's friends. And even if James and Lily had no other friends, why not send Harry to some other reliable household, either Muggle or magical, when it was seen how the Dursleys were treating him? Even if we assume Dumbles didn't want to put Harry through the potential trauma of the Muggle adoption system/fostering, I'm sure there were plenty of wizards willing to adopt a child. I can imagine someone like Andromeda, who lived in the Muggle world, raising Harry without pampering him.

The blood wards themselves could easily have been placated by having Harry “stay” at the Dursleys' house for two weeks a year. As it is, the Dursleys treated him like shit, so it's not like decent treatment is a condition of the blood wards.

#+begin_quote
  There is no reason to suspect Dumbledore was involved with Harry's placement at the Dursleys and no evidence the Weasleys even knew about the blood wards.
#+end_quote

Except for Harry himself, who could have told them in PS or COS. Again, AU scenario here. And clearly Dumbledore has Mrs Figg monitoring Harry by OOTP. Why is it so implausible to imagine a scenario in which he'd ask her to keep an eye on things /before/ PS? Or have someone else pop by incognito, like Andromeda, to make sure Harry's doing alright?

  If they wanted to fight about Harry's living situation, they would have to take it to court, not the school headmaster, and Harry would likely have to testify against the Dursleys.
#+end_quote

Fair, but again, once they'd taken it to Dumbledore, it'd be out of their hands, and in the hands of the Muggle and/or wizarding authorities. Testifying, while traumatic, is made easier by Pensieves and Veritaserum. I hardly think the Dursleys would be able to argue with those. /Or/ that they'd balk at giving up Harry (or only seeing him for two weeks a year, or whatever) if Dumbledore actually asked them to.
