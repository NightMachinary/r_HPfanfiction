The Weasleys chaos is a good thing for Harry. He's never had a family and loves being in the hustle and bustle of a bunch of people.

Nobody outside of a shitty Lord Hadrian Potter-Black AU is going to help a 12 year old kid make political allies, so of course not.

The only canonical “pureblood side of things” is racism. Neo-Pagan holidays, betrothal contracts, family seats on the Wizengamot, and inheritance rings don't exist in canon. They are made up by fanfic authors purely to make people like the Malfoys seem less shitty and racist and like there's a “culture” that genuinely needs protection when there isn't.

Training him to defeat Voldemort isn't their job. They try very hard to keep him out of the whole thing, prophecy or no, which is exactly how adults responsible for a child that feels it's his duty to fight a genocidal maniac SHOULD behave.

Neither the Weasleys or the Malfoys would have any claim to Harry even if they tried. As far as they know, the Dursleys are Harry's legal guardians and Dumbledore has jack shit to do with it. I will admit that Lucius is probably rich enough to bribe the right people and get custody of his son's orphaned best friend if he really wanted to, but that would he wildly out of character for him and will become a HUGE problem for the whole family when Voldy shows back up.
