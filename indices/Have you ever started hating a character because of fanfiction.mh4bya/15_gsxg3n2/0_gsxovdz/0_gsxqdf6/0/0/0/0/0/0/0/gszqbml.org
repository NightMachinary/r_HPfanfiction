Show me where I said no incarnation of the Malfoys could ever “be better than the Dursleys.” Show me where I mentioned the Dursleys in relation to the Malfoys and Weasleys at all. Stay on topic or concede the debate.

Draco doesn't have a potions lab, extra subject knowledge, or 5 extra years of magical schooling, and I doubt the racist white family knows much if anything about magic in other cultures. Again, you're falling into fanon nonsense that doesn't align with the original lore.

Harry would've hated the “structured” way of life at the Malfoys, assuming that's even correct because again we know nothing about what they do during the summer. Sure, it would be better than the Dursleys, but that bar is so far below the earth's crust it's not worth discussing. He is not the kind of kid who likes to sit around, study, and sip tea all day.

Again, the only “different aspects” of the magical world the Malfoys have access to and the Weasleys do not are places like Knockturn Alley. Nothing worth seeing and nothing a child needs to be exposed to.

  The blood wards themselves could easily have been placated by having Harry stay at the Dursleys' for two weeks a year.

No, they could not, and I'm tired of this being used as a loophole in fanfic. The blood wards only work if Harry's /primary residence/ is with Petunia. Harry only has to spend 2 weeks per summer with the Dursleys because he attends a boarding school and that's all that's needed for the magic to establish that he still technically lives there, not because 2 weeks is ALWAYS enough to make the magic work. Moving him in with Remus or Andromeda or whoever would make them void no matter how often he goes to the Dursleys to visit.
