I don't understand why we can't dispense with that aspect of the blood wards entirely, though. It's not a “loophole” to avoid, it just plain makes no sense. Harry's primary residence isn't even the Dursleys', it's /Hogwarts/, once he turns eleven. It's his Gryffindor dormitory, or Gryffindor Tower. He actually considers Hogwarts his home, and justifiably so.

So you're basically saying that an AU version of Harry might not enjoy a quieter experience? How do you know Draco doesn't have a Potions lab? I don't understand why you're insisting that we stick to exactly what canon shows us and can't invent details, particularly if we are making /Draco/ legitimate friends with /Harry/. In canon, this scenario would never happen anyway.

Um, again, how do you /know/ this for sure? I agree that a majority of the wizarding Britain we see is white, but blood purity-prejudice isn't the same as colourism/racism/xenophobia. It's the wizarding world, it doesn't have to follow our prejudices to a T. Just because Lucius hates Muggleborns doesn't follow that he thinks the /wizarding/ versions of other countries are inferior. Or that he thinks non-white people are inferior. There's no evidence for it in canon, but there's none against it either. It's not like the Dursleys, who are xenophobic in canon.

Once again, he can be prejudiced/former DE/anti-Muggle while also being fine with other cultures.

That was just an example, anyway. I'm sure there might be other valuable aspects of the WW that this Harry, in this ‘verse, /might/ learn from Lucius.

I never said the Weasleys sucked and Harry hated them. I never said they were awful to him.

All I meant was that they were alright, but some structure during his holidays would have been a lot better for Harry in terms of being disciplined at studying, brushing up on his Potions and History of Magic with Draco, etc. Especially if he didn't learn anything from Binns and hated Snape. I'm not talking about cramming, sipping tea, measuring doilies and eating rock cakes 24/7. I'm talking about an alt!verse Harry who might have benefited from Draco as a role model to cultivate discipline, rather than doing everything at the last minute --- and from Lucius making sure that there was a balance of study and play.

I'm talking about an alt-verse Harry who might, at some point, have come round to staying at MM, in the middle of a fic, after 100k+ words of character development.

Okay, I grant that it wasn't the Weasleys' job to train Harry up. But it would also have been nice for Mr and Mrs Weasley to be a bit more proactive in actually following up with Harry about why he was being abused, for example. Or report it to whatever authorities deal with child abuse in the WW (if any). Or, failing that, report it to /someone/ who could have liaised with the Muggle authorities. Again, the primary-residence thing could easily be dispensed with.

No, that is not their job, but it is something you'd do for a child who has to be rescued from a freaking prison in the middle of the night. It's not like Harry was just a little bored, overreacting to his aunt and uncle's reasonable rules, and being a typical moody teenager. He had no friends in the Muggle world, his family was abusive his whole life and his primary school failed to pick up on it. He was obviously traumatised from the Dursleys /and/ from whatever Voldie-encounter happened at his school that year. Not to mention grieving Sirius's death.

What do Molly and Arthur do? Sweet fuck-all till the end of OOTP, just send him care packages. What happens at the beginning of OOTP? He gets put on trial for legitimately defending those same relatives (and himself!) from Dementors at his aunt and uncle's home. So, again, not real safe, is he?

And it would've been nice if, furthermore, at any point, they'd said, “Hey, Albus, this kid is fifteen. Why does he have to kill Voldemort, again? Why can't all the adult wizards --- including Moody, the freaking Auror - find a way to defeat Voldie and kill all his cruxes? Or why hasn't Voldemort sent another DE to Privet Drive to take him captive and shot/imprisoned/Obliviated him?” Snape, Yaxley, Rosier, anyone could've walked in and kidnapped Harry. Are you telling me any of the Dursleys except maybe Dudley after HPB, would've shed a tear?

You can't tell me that it'd be OOC for Voldie to send one of his minions to shoot Harry post-GOF. Or, hell, Imperius someone to do it. Especially not when he grew up during WWII. Even easier for him because he could've done it without it being traced to him.

I'm not going to engage any more because I have no idea why you're insisting that plotholes that don't even make sense in canon should be stubbornly stuck to, that a distinctly AU-verse Harry must be exactly the same as in canon, or that structure can't be better for a kid than mucking around till the last minute.
