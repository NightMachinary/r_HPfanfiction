  The Weasleys chaos is a good thing for Harry. He's never had a family and loves being in the hustle and bustle of a bunch of people.
#+end_quote

Agreed, but in a scenario where Harry had never met Ron?

  Nobody outside of a shitty Lord Hadrian Potter-Black AU is going to help a 12 year old kid make political allies, so of course not.

The Chosen One? Really? The one prophesied to defeat the greatest Dark Lord since Grindelwald?

  The only canonical “pureblood side of things” is racism. Neo-Pagan holidays, betrothal contracts, family seats on the Wizengamot, and inheritance rings don't exist in canon. They are made up by fanfic authors purely to make people like the Malfoys seem less shitty and racist and like there's a “culture” that genuinely needs protection when there isn't.
#+end_quote

Okay, but the point of fanfic is that there /could/ be a culture to protect, beyond Magic itself. Even in the absence of a pureblood culture, there are plenty of ways Lucius can still be racist but no longer agree with genocidal murderer. As we see with Dumbledore, people change. It's possible that an AU PS!era Lucius genuinely does regret that he murdered people in the name of blood purity. Yes, he would still hate/fear/be prejudiced against Muggleborns and Muggles. But there's a difference between that and rejoining a genocidal maniac to carry out raids on innocent people.

Even without a culture, no reason Lucius can't be aware of, and terrified of, the rapidly rising Muggle population and advanced tech, for one thing. Surely at least some wizards know about guns and weapons of mass destruction. Even Hagrid comments that Muggles would want magical cures for everything.

Frankly, a lot of magic is also just bizarre, inefficient and outdated (owls? Brooms?), so it's not like we can't go the other way and have Lucius realise that a) Muggles have actually innovated significantly in the absence of magic, and b) what he's defending is largely bullshit.

Then there's Voldie himself. Depending on how sacred unicorns are, I can even see Lucius being caught off guard if he ever finds out pre-COS that Voldemort killed a unicorn and drank its blood. I sure wouldn't trust someone who doomed themselves to “a half-life, a cursed life” to lead the wizarding world to glory. By GOF, were I Lucius, I'd be questioning the wisdom of working for someone who's split their soul seven ways, performed a Dark resurrection ritual and come back looking like something out of a B-grade horror film. Voldie is far from sane or persuasive by that point. He's Visser Three levels of “How dare you breathe in my presence, minion?!” /decapitates/

#+begin_quote
  Training him to defeat Voldemort isn't their job. They try very hard to keep him out of the whole thing, prophecy or no, which is exactly how adults responsible for a child that feels it's his duty to fight a genocidal maniac SHOULD behave.
#+end_quote

Right, that's Dumbledore's, and a bang-up job he does. By OOTP, the prophecy is moot because /both/ Harry and Voldemort are alive. Per Dumbledore himself, it is /Voldemort/ who has “marked Harry as his equal”. If Voldemort just stopped pursuing Harry, the issue would be over.

In DH Dumbledore essentially tells Harry to kill himself, instead of finding some way for /someone/ to prevent the death of a seventeen-year-old kid.

So, basically, this is Rowling handwaving all Harry's victories because ‘love'. Never is Harry given the tools to kill Voldemort outright (pre-DH), or the training to deter him in battle. His power is just his mother's love and sheer dumb luck.

#+begin_quote
  Neither the Weasleys or the Malfoys would have any claim to Harry even if they tried. As far as they know, the Dursleys are Harry's legal guardians and Dumbledore has jack shit to do with it.
#+end_quote

What on earth are you talking about? I'm not just referring to adoption. Dumbledore is the leader of the Order. He's also on the Wizengamot, magically knowledgeable and is Harry's guardian in loco parentis while he's at school. He's the first person, bar perhaps McGonagall, they would turn to to find out if the blood bonds could still be active while Harry stayed at Hogwarts over the summer holidays. At the very least, they should be outraged on Harry's behalf and demand to know why he's being locked in his room like a bird in a cage in COS.

#+begin_quote
  I will admit that Lucius is probably rich enough to bribe the right people and get custody of his son's orphaned best friend if he really wanted to, but that would he wildly out of character for him and will become a HUGE problem for the whole family when Voldy shows back up.
#+end_quote

I mean, yes, I agree, but that's only if you're sticking to canon. We're in firmly AU territory here.

And like I said, adoption /doesn't/ have to be the only scenario in which the Malfoys become /closer/ to Harry and less wedded to their ways. If Andromeda could marry Ted, why is it such a stretch to believe that the Malfoys might... I dunno, wake up and smell the roses? Realise that Tom was talking bullshit?
