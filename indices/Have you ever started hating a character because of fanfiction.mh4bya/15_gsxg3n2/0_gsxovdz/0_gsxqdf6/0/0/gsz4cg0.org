The Weasleys are kind of chaotic. Harry is a little lost in the crowd of kids. Sure, they love him, which counts for a lot, but they don't /do/ a lot for him in terms of getting him extra allies, teaching him about the pureblood side of things, training him up to defeat Voldemort or... really, even speaking to Dumbledore about why he was placed there to begin with, and getting him the hell out of Privet Drive permanently.

I was thinking of a scenario where Harry is sorted into Slytherin and becomes best friends with Draco rather than Ron. In canon, yeah, Narcissa and Lucius rejoining the Death Eaters is not exactly a ringing endorsement of good role modelling, to say the least. If we're talking PS!era, though, Voldie died over a decade ago. The Malfoy parents are ripe for reformation (by Harry and possibly Draco too) in an AU.

You could also mix it up and write Gryff!Harry being good friends with reforming!Draco /and/ Ron and Hermione. That way he'd get to visit the Weasleys and the Malfoys. It doesn't have to be the Malfoys practically adopting him, either, it can be a build-up over a couple of years. I can absolutely see it being a point of contention between (friends) Harry and Draco that Lucius was a Death Eater and that Narcissa is related to Bellatrix.
