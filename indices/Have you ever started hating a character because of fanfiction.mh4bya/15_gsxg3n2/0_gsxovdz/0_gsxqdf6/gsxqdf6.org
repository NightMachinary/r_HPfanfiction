I agree - there's something about Harry and Draco's friendship which I like. They both have a similar outlook on life, in some ways - we don't know how Lucius was as a father, but certainly he has high expectations of Draco. Obviously Harry's upbringing was legitimately abusive, but he at least understands the value of hard work and can relate to Draco on that level.

Arsinoe de Blassenville does this really well.

As you say, I can see a bratty-but-polite first-year Draco being good friends with Harry and perhaps learning to be more empathetic towards other people (particularly Muggleborns), rather than lashing out verbally and magically. And I can see Harry learning coping mechanisms from Draco: learning to make friends, get a rein on his temper and perhaps even seek therapy for his abuse. The Weasleys were alright, but I suspect the Malfoys, written the right way, would have been a much more stable influence on Harry.
