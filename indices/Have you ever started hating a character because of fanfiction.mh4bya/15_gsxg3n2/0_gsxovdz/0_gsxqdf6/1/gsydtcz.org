Yes! It's quite facinating, how both of them are really similar despite their upbrigning. A lot of people believe Draco to be a spoiled little brat, but I have a feeling that he was pushed to learn a lot in his childhood. His mother was a Black and his father's a Malfoy, and he's the only Malfoy spawn, the only one to continue the line. Can you imagine all that he's had to learn and all of the expectations he has on his shoulders?
