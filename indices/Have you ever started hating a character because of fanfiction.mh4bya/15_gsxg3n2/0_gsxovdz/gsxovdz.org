I feel, that depending on the fanon personality, that Harry and Draco could actually be really good friends. Draco was a bit of a whiny brat in canon (from what I remember), but if you make him grow up a bit, he could be a really cool mature character. I've kind of taken a bit of a break from writing fanfic (I decided it was a good idea to try and rewrite two of my Marvel fanfics to try and build up motivation for my Harry Potter fic, which had the consequence of making me lose interest in /all/ of my fanfics, so I'm working on my original book for a while), but I want to write a fanfic where Harry and Draco become either really good friends or perhaps even romantically involved (no sex and probably not even a lot of kissing) in a time travel fic.
