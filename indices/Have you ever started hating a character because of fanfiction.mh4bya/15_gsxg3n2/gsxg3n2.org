â€˜Hate' is a bit of a strong word, but Malfoy. A fair bit of the series, his rivalry with Harry was just that, rivalry that cropped up throughout. Harry frequently gave as good as he got. I mean, yeah, okay, he wasn't a cherry pie cinnamon roll, but it was only in OOTP that he really started being more actively involved in the series. And let's face it, Harry and co weren't exactly saints early on, either --- setting off a live firework in a cauldron? Knocking out Crabbe and Goyle and impersonating them?

Up until he started trying to poison people and send them cursed artefacts in HBP, I really didn't feel strongly about him.

Now I've read the Drarry/Draco in Leather Pants that just have them getting together... because... reasons... I've just become generally irritated by him even early in canon. I can believe that Draco changed his ways after school, but I cannot believe that he and Harry would ever decide to be romantically involved.

I've read some Slytherin!Harry fics that have them as good /friends/, but romance? Nope. Can't see it. The one Drarry I've ever been convinced by is Sacrifices, and that Harry is so radically AU as to be far removed from canon.
