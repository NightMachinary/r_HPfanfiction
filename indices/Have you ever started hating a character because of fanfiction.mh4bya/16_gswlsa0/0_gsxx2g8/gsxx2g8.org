Ditto. Canon!Neville is a fun character because he's genuinely shy, awkward, and more than a bit of a klutz and I wouldn't call him a coward but he's also much more fearful than most of his friends in Gryffindor (which might just be indicative of common sense if I'm being honest). He's likable because he acts and supports his friends despite these shortcomings. In the Battle of Hogwarts he was offered a free pass because of his blood status but he declined the offer, instead choosing to fight against some of the people that frighten him the most. That's admirable.

Now fanon!Neville on the other hand... Oh boy, if he doesn't turn from a stuttering mess of nerves into "*I AM LONGBOTTOM OF LONGBOTTOM!!!1!!*" at the drop of a hat then he's suddenly a magical prodigy after a new wand and a bit of encouragement. And don't forget to turn him into a 6'8" muscular chad that absolutely saturates the air with his big dick energy.

Even if I ignore that people often use him as "Harry's /real/ friend" they still seem to enjoy Neville Longbottom only by turning him into the /exact opposite/ of Neville Longbottom.
