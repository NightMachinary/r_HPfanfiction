Dumbledore says as much at the end of /Philosopher's Stone/.

#+begin_quote
  'There are all kinds of courage,' said Dumbledore, smiling. â€˜It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville Longbottom.'

Neville got those ten points by doing what he felt was right, even if it meant going against his friends and his own fear, to the point of getting ready to fight them.
