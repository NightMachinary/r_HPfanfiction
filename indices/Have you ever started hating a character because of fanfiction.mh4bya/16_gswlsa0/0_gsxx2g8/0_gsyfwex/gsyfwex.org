I would go as far as to say Neville's fearfulness is why he's in Gryffindor in the first place. Real courage is being scared shitless and doing it anyway, not being too stupid to be afraid of a life threatening situation in the first place. When you're pretty much terrified of everything and you go on with your life anyway, that's about as brave as it gets. (Definitely not my own anxiety disorder biasing me here lol)
