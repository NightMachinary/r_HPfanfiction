I mostly stick in in-character representations when I read my fics. However I did sort of started to hate the twinspeak (tbh I never found the twins that funny in canon either... mostly annoying). Also Luna... was not that fond of her canon version either (if you ever end up at a bar talking to a drunk crazy who doesn't get the hints that you're uncomfortable, you'll understand) but making her this pure innocent all-knowing spiritual loveable seer angel makes me puke. Yeah, she is sweet and has her quirks, but god if I could stand listening to her more than a minute before I'd start looking for a polite way out of the conversation.
