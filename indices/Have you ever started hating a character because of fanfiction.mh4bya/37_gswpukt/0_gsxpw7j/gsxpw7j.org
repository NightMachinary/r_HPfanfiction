Canon Ron isn't actually as anti-Slytherin as I originally thought. I'm writing a Harry Potter fic where Harry travels back in time with Theo and they redo canon events, which means that I need to reread the books to get a good idea of what happened, and I realized that it was actually /Harry/ who was anti-Slytherin. Ron in the first book only said:

  “Whatever House I'm in, I hope [Hermione]'s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell --- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.”

  “What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.

  “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.”

  “That's the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”

  “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

Ron's only worried about his parents' thoughts in this, and as his grandmother was most likely a Slytherin, I don't imagine that he's super anti-Slytherin. (I'm only assuming his grandmother was in Slytherin, though, since Cedrella Weasley used to be a Black and they're a well-known Slytherin family.)
