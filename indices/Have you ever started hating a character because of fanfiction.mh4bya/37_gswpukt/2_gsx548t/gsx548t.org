Reading the books I was always meh on Ron, I think Jk Rowling didn't do justice to the boy I think of? Like there's just so many moments in the books where I think hm that's pretty shitty of him but then there also really redeeming parts of him too?? Like it was so fifty fifty but JK wanted us to love them all as a trio and hyped Hermione whilst putting down Ron and it affected views of both their character.

Ron was a great friend and would be with Harry to the end but ultimately how his jealously presented is how I came to dislike him. He literally rescued Harry from his relatives in CoS, so he KNEW how badly Harry was treated. Ron gets his family to practically adopt Harry yet in GoF he didn't speak to Harry for a full month because he was jealous of the â€˜glory' Harry always has.

Ron was a bit of a prat to Hermione especially like disregarding her S.P.E.W efforts by calling it spew or spug. Ultimately I think she was wrong for spew but how was she supposed to know as a muggleborn who had only just seen Winky being treated horribly?
