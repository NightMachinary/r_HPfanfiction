Yes!! I wish they expanded on his chess strategy as being a good planner! His character to me always felt stilted in terms of growth, which is why I never understood Romione. Like I could see them if I saw his character growth but I never, I saw him leaving when it got hard and dating Lavender to hopefully get Hermione jealous? His redeeming portion about saving the house elves in the end just wasn't enough for me to be like ya they should be together, with their spats I saw them like siblings.

Agree with the ministry break in, like spells and knowledge for Hermione yes. But why does she have to have the whole thing? It's why people don't like her, she was built up so much and he wasn't. (Still love Hermione but I can acknowledge the character has flaws!)
