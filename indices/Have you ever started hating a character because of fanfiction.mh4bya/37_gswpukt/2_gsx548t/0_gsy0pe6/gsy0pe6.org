Ron was so good early on and then in the later books JK Rowling didn't let him add anything to the plot. It would have been /perfect/ if he was the strategy one of the trio because it fills a niche role and makes him actually useful rather than replaceable. Take the Ministry break in for example- it would have made /so much sense/ for Ron to come up with the plan considering his dad literally worked there. But instead Hermione comes up with the plans /and/ knows all the textbook hardcore magic stuff.
