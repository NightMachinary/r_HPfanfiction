i hate to say it but no, if anything I've started to hate the fandom for how they write characters. I don't mind crackish stories but it's when you have a good story but you can feel the authors dislike for a character that i'm put off. Don't have this ff version of Slytherin Harry be so well written but go on a tangent about how he hates Hermione for being a know it all, or how he understands why Snape hates Gryffindors as a whole like?????? The Harry you wrote wouldn't have those thoughts so why are they now here?
