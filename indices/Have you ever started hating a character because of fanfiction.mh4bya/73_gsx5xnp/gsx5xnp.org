I already disliked Molly for being a Toxic parent, Dumbledore IS manipulative, and Hermione DOES disrespect the wizarding culture (no matter how wretched it is, you just can't behave like an unmannered tourist in Japan or a radical feminist in A. Saudi)

Canon Wizarding world has waaaaaaay too many flaws, so I tend to stay with one or two more plot-driven fanfic worldbuilding versions. Mind you, they have flaws too, but less and more logical.

If anyone has a nice well worldbuilded fanfic recommendation I would appreciate it :) Gen if possible, I avoid romance as a rule when looking for plot.
