Most people write what they know. We spend most of the time getting to know the Golden Trio so we know them best. The only females we get to know more about are Ginny and Luna. All the other girls get passing chapters throughout the books. Johnson, Patel, Chang, we don't really get to know hardly anything about them or their personalities. They're blank slates which can be a great challenge for a writer, but how do you do them proper justice without turning them into a Hermione clone in some way.
