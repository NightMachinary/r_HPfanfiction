I did at first. But eventually, I came to realize that literally every character you can name, can be written in such a way to either be a bad guy or a good guy. Dumbledore is written as a manipulative cold bastard in a lot of fics and there's a lot of circumstantial evidence to support it, but honestly, that's just fancy thinking because fanfiction authors want to read more into it.

The truth is that the stuff that happens, happens because the jrk wanted it to happen that way. I sincerely doubt that she gave certain things or certain arguments as much as a second thought.

Plotholes happen because the author either didn't think it through, or they did, but the plot in a later book, disagrees with it and so it just gets ignored.

Anyway, if there is one character I still have a strong dislike for, then it's Snape. Talking as someone who was bullied a lot when he was younger, I can tell you that I can hold a grudge. But I would never in a hundred years abuse that position to take revenge against a child for his father's sins.

Not to mention the utter CRIME of wanting to condemn an innocent man. Yes, Sirius was a little shit when he was a teenager. But the man spend more than a DECADE in hell on earth.

If that doesn't mean he hasn't paid for his crimes, then I don't know what is. I think of everything that Snape does in the books, that one thing, condemning an innocent man, stands in the top three of Terrible things he's done.
