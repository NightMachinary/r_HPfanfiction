Yup.

I don't mind bashing in general, if it feels like the author's doing it for fun rather than hate, but the sheer Ron hate makes me wonder how many people read the books instead of just watched the movies. Ron was Rowling's go-to guy for stupid dramatic conflict, but he was never freaking evil. ;P

Ginny... the only truly bad thing I can say about her is she's a non-entity for most of the books.

I will admit Molly got annoying in book five and six, when it felt like her lips were glued to Dumbledore's arse (the whole bit with Sirius in his own house was annoying), but people turning her into a psycho just because annoy the hell out of me.
