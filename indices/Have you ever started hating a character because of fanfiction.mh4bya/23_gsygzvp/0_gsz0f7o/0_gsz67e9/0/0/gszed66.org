An important thing to remember about Molly is the books are written from Harry's point of view and he's an unreliable narrator. Of /course/ the closest thing to a mother figure he has is going to come off as overprotective and annoying, he's a teenager and one that isn't used to adults actually trying to take care of him to boot.

I'm not saying Molly was always right or always made good choices. Like idc what Dumbledore says, Harry does deserve to know something about the prophecy that's ABOUT HIM, even if that something is “there's a prophecy about you but we can't tell you the full details until you master Occlumency in case Voldy decides to brain rape you for information,” and the way she baselessly accused Sirius of trying to replace James during that argument really pissed me off. But even at her worst she's not some horrible nagging bitch, even if Harry thinks she's kind of being one right now.
