Eh. I hear the 'unreliable narrator' excuse a lot to try to deprecate things that actually happen in canon.

Like 'Oh no, in spite of Neville having Snape as a boggart, Snape was a wonderful teacher, Harry is just an arse about him!' and so on.

I tend to find the 'unreliable narrator' argument a bad one. It's basically a way to cherry pick which parts of the books a person wants to really apply and which ones they want to ignore because 'unreliable narrator'!

I'd be more accepting of a theory that maybe Molly was overreacting for various reasons than 'it didn't happen exactly that way, Harry is an unreliable narrator'. :)
