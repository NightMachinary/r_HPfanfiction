Well, then, what I said stands either way, though I've understood it to be different. (Though I guess in some matters, Harry could be an unreliable narrator due to lack of information).

Molly's behavior - not what he felt, but her behavior - in books five and six were really oddly focused.

Of course, I know why - Rowling needed it that way, it's a flaw of her work that characterization is subsumed by plot. It's the same reason Dumbledore is so easily bashed by some. Doylist, we know what he's supposed to be, but if we look at the books Watsonianly, he looks pretty shady.
