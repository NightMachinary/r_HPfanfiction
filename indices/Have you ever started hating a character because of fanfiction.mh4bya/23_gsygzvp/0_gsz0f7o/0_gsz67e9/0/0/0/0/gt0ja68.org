That's not what unreliable narrator means and people doing that are using it incorrectly. We're supposed to feel Harry's frustration with Molly and she's supposed to come off as unreasonable and crazy; we don't get to see into her head and understand why she reacts the way she does. We don't hear her point of view or how she feels.

That's what unreliable narrator means. I'm not saying “well XYZ didn't actually happen, Harry's just an idiot and got it all wrong.”
