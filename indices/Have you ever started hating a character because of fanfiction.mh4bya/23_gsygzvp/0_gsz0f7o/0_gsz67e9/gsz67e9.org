It's even worse when they pair it with evil Ron / Weasley bashing, which they almost always do.

Yeah, sure, Ron Weasley is an evil bully because he's occasionally insensitive and stupid like every other teenage boy on the planet and isn't worthy of Perfect Queen Hermione because he likes to mutually bicker with her. And Molly is abusive because she's a little overbearing and Ginny is a slutty fangirl because she had a crush on Harry when she was 10.

Draco Malfoy, the spoiled rich brat who uses racial slurs, was wishing death on other children at the age of 12, and bullied Hermione every chance he got, is just a misunderstood nice boy and is actually Hermione and/or Harry's perfect soulmate. And Lucius is either a really nice guy whose past is conveniently never explored in depth or an abusive monster, depending on how wangsty the fic is. Narcissa is always a saint who doesn't share Lucius' beliefs despite being canonically racist enough to cut off her sister for marrying a Muggle born and never apologize, and may or may not have been forced to marry Lucius in the first place depending on which version of him we get.

Like just admit you hate poor people and save yourself the effort of writing bad fanfiction.
