Oh yeah.

Draco.

The number of fanfics that say "The whole reason Draco hated Harry is he didn't shake his hand, and that's a HORRIBLE INSULT in pureblood circles! Draco's a good guy otherwise!" You see that SO MUCH in certain fanfics.

It's just a wishy-washy excuse that ignores his overt bigotry. This is the kid that happily called Hermione mudblood, that crowed about mudbloods being next in book two, who was ecstatic that Voldemort had returned and he'd kill all the mudbloods at the end of book four, who didn't seem to care an iota about Ron and Katie nearly dying while he tried to kill Dumbledore.
