I don't judge canon characters by the way unskilled fanfic writers portray them, but there are plenty of characters I'm tired of seeing in fanfic.

I'm tired of mentor / father figure Snape. I'm tired of good boi Draco that completely glosses over his racism. I'm tired of perfect Mary-Sue Hermione. I'm tired of evil Weasleys, evil Marauders, and evil Dumbledore. I'm tired of Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass.

Write the characters as they were written in the books (unless your fic involves a justified reason for a drastic character change, eg a character was raised by different parents) or just write original characters. If you MUST butcher characters for no reason, at least be original.
