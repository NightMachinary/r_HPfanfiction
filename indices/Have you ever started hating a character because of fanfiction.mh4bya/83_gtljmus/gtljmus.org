Hermione, for the same reasons and for the reasons they like to elevate like she is the person that matters the most to Harry, but most of the fics I read she is portrayed the same way like in the books and called out on her bossy behavior to that point that it actually makes her grow as a person(or if not, just was left behind), or she is just a side character in them/or not at all there. Too many bushy wankers like to overglorify her moments like she is the sole reason Harry and Ron and the rest of the world didn't die. I'd really like to se a Harry Ron duo, or Harry Ron other male/female character that doesn't have the same traits as Hermione trio a thing, just to see how inventive some authors would be with the story.
