Is the reverse ok? Like after reading a bunch of fics I started to like or at least understand this character after previously hating them and then going back to hating them after re-reading canon?.

If so that applies to Snape for me, after reading a lot of fics where he's sympathetically portrayed I started to if not like him to at least understand him. But after reading cannon I've gone back to heavily disliking him again.
