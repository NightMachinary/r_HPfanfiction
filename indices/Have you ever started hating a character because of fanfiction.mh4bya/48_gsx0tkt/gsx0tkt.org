Not a character, but a ship (and I wouldn't say I /hate/ it, merely just dislike it). Before getting into fanfics, I was indifferent to most canon ships, besides Romione and Remadora which I had a slight dislike for. Notably, I was mostly indifferent to Jily. Sure, IMO, the aftermath of defense O.W.L. didn't exactly portray him in a good light, but this is just one scene, portrayed from the point of view of someone who loathed him. Then I read one too many "romcom" fics where their relationship was basically portrayed like this:

- James: "Oh this Lily girl seems precious! I want her!" ... "Lily, do you want to go out with me to Hogsmede?"
- Lily: "...why would I go out with a toerag like you?"

This was repeated ad nauseam starting from roughly 3rd year until she ultimately caves in during their 7th year because "if he's chosen as Head Boy, surely he can't be that bad?". Now, the reason I disliked Remadora (even before I started reading fanfics) was because Nymphadora basically coerced Remus into a relationship, which I don't find romantic whatsoever, but just creepy. So let's just say that reading several fics with basically the same dynamic for /years/ between James and Lily didn't exactly make me view it in a good light in the end. Hell, it's likely why I like LE/SS in first place -- "oh look, a fic that portrays Lily with someone who /isn't/ James!" -- despite the major flaws with that ship on its own, since the flaws with that one is entirely different.
