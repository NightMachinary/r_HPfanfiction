Honestly? You can pretty easily argue that Hermione is the main character in the story (she certainly has more of an arc than Ron or Harry), so it doesn't surprise me that she shows up in so many fics, just like Harry.

Although it is a bit more jarring because Harry is passive and acts as a Readers Viewpoint, explicitly to act to give the reader a view of the world. So it is *so* much easier to simply imagine him a bit different, thus all of the AU Harry's, the entire independent Harry thing. It still fits within the bounds of the character, and thus you get a lot of different versions.

It doesn't work as well with Hermione/Ron, who have more of a strict characterization, if you deviate it too much it doesn't necessarily feel like you are still writing the characters people want to read about. Not that it can't work, its just harder.

Or, to put it another way, there are more intentionally blank spaces in Harry's character sheet (thus allowing the reader to map themselves onto him), and this allows for more creativity in fanfiction, than with Ron or Hermione. Even though plot-wise they are really as central to the plot as Harry, if not a bit more really.
