At first when I started reading fanfics, I saw a ton of Dumbledore bashing ones that pointed out questionable things he did in the canon series and I started hating him. Later I started seeing other fics where there were actual explanations to his actions other than "he's evil" and decided that I don't hate him anymore because the canon version doesn't actually do anything blatantly bad. Dumbledore isn't canonically Harry's magically guardian, he didn't block Harry's magical core, he didn't embezzle funds from orphans or the school, etc. I dont like him but I don't think he's total trash anymore.
