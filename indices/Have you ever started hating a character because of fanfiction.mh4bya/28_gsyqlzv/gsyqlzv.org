Hermione is an easy antagonist, hero, friend, lover, ect... there's the ability to use her authority/book worship against her or for her.

She has empathy but the self righteous can cause problems, like with her SPEW.

I don't see her as someone who would betray Harry because an adult told her too (aka Dumbledore) because Harry saved her. If anything Hernione/Harry works better than Hermione/Ginny.

I started hating Ginny/Molly because of fanfiction lol.then again I'm starting to hate certain tropes but I've been a reading for 10+years so it's a given lol.
