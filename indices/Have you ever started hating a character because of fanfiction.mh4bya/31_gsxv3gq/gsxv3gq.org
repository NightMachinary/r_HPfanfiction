I've come past the point of hating Hermione and curved back into liking her, as long as she's written decently.

Fanfiction did manage to make me hate a character that exists only in name in canon, however. Ice Queen Daphne "Mary Sue" Greengrass feels like the new OP!Hermione, except even more disconnected from reality.
