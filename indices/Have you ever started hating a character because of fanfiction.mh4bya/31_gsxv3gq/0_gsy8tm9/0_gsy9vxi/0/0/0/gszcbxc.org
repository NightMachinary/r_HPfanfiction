Yeah. Agree so hard.

Harry: "Hi, it's nice to meet you." Daphne: /Disdainful sneer/ "Like I'd talk to Dumbledore's Golden Boy." Harry: "GOSH I want to get to know her!!!!11!1!!1one"

Yeah, no. Fuck off with that. Any intro that caustic is NOT somebody the average sane person is going to pursue even a casual friendship with. She can prance right the fuck off with that shit. I hate OC!MarySue!Daphne.

Unless I'm in the mood for really bad fanfiction. That's a different guilty pleasure. Sometimes you just have to watch the train wreck.

Or throw another log on the dumpster fire. Pick your metaphor.
