I started disliking Dumbledore after certain fanfictions where he was too manipulative but also so realistic, exactly to be expected.

Also Lily, after reading WBHL stories and Marauder era Snape centric stories, where she was self-centered and vain character, also not a loyal friend. I do understand there are certain theories, fans take either Lily's side or Snape's, but some well written stories really show her in a bad light.

Even though l enjoy both good!dumbledore and good Lily stories where she keeps her friendship or maybe relationship, some fanfictions really opened my mind, so l started seeing canon characters in different light.

As a child first reading the books, l never saw through Dumbledore and l have always seen him as a benevolent, grandfatherly mentor.

However, l empathised with Snape and did not like Lily. Unrequited love is a strong feeling that gets through every reader as we have all probably experienced that kind of pain in our lives. Her abandonment is debatable, and fans take sides. A talented writer can make anything happen. I enjoy reading about both.
