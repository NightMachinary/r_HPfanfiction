I always make sure to differentiate canon characters and their fandom alternatives, ‘cause otherwise I feel like I would have accidentally spoiled the series & great, complex characters that are in the books.

And also it pisses me off when someone hates on a character because in other fanfiction they were bad :)) like I had that one girl who said “dont hate snape, theres a fanfic called XYZ where hes a good godfather” or “ginnys a whore she cheated on harry in XYZ” or “i hate ron cause hes homophobic in most fanfics” LIKE WHAT ????
