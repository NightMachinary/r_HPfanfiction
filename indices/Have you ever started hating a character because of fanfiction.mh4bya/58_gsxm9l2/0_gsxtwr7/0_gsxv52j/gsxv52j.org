Taking a step away from this sub, you're right. My entire time in FF there's like 20 Ron-bashing fics to 1 Hermione-basing fics. Hell, that may be an understatement.

Still, it'd be hard to tell in THIS community. Gun to my head, I'd bet on folks linking fics hammering away at Hermione for the bird attack or her parents mind-wipes at a much higher rate than a less-than-rosy representation of Ron.
