Eh, I use Hermione because of what she could have been, not necessarily what she was. She was intelligent and had fire, but she obsessed over authority and refused to think for herself or really challenge her own beliefs. She probably thought she was better than most people too, that she knew better even when she didn't even when she made snap decisions based on emotion over logic and stuck to them.

She's a devoted follower, but sadly she chose to follow Dumbledore and established authority instead of her friend with a talent for leading others that rarely came to the surface. And yes, Harry was never as wise as Dumbledore or as competent (Something I blame the lack of useful teachers for; if you have a chosen one destined to fight an evil you get them as much damn instruction/practice as they can take, damn it.) but his motives were a lot more pure.
