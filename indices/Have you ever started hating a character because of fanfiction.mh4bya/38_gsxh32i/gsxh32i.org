Molly and Ron.

In canon, Molly is a lovely and caring mother but does have some very slight issues. Ron as well, he's a supportive friend and someone potentially fun to hang around with but he does have some very frustrating immature tendencies. All in all, both of them are generally great. But most fanfictions like to focus on their faults and bashes them, subconsciously shifting my perception of them.

I think the reason Hermione is so often mentioned in fanfiction is because her contribution to the story in canon was very significant and the strengths of her character was clear for all to see. She's also the smart one out of the three main protagonist which makes it quite easy to write her in to solve any problems that the other characters might face.

In addition, she's also the main female character in the student-age category. The only other two significant enough that I can think of right off the bat are Luna and Ginny, both of which were mentioned and showed a lot less in the books and films. There was a graph posted a while ago on [[/r/dataisbeautiful][r/dataisbeautiful]] showcasing the number of times each character was mentioned in the books and films. In the graph, it showed that Harry was mentioned the most, obviously, then closely followed by Hermione and Ron. Every other character after them were mentioned significantly less. Often in fanfictions, writers like to have a main male and a main female character, since Hermione's character was so significantly more developed than others, she became the number one choice to fill the main female role.

Lastly, the 'golden trio' fame certainly played a significant role as well. I'm a relatively new to the HP universe, only having delved into it in recent years but even long before that, I already knew about the golden trio, Harry, Ron and Hermione. Even without knowing the story, I already knew about these three characters which certainly builds a bond that will last long after knowing every detail of the franchise.
