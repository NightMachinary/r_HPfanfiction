I despise Dumbledore at this point. He's just almost never portrayed as a good guy, even when he's not an actual enemy. Molly Weasley is also one of my top hated characters, because of the tropes where she tries to force Harry and Ginny to marry, or she's a gold digger for Harry's money, etc, I won't say the situation where I absolutely started to hate her for trigger warning.

And I love canon Luna, but fanfiction Luna is the worst. She's always way too OP, way to involved, if she isn't a perfect seer that holds Harry's hand through the entire book then she's an OP goddess/reincarnated Rowena Ravenclaw/long lost multiple greats granddaughter of Ravenclaw/always the most intelligent in the room although she can never make sense at all which can lead others to trouble and it also opens the gates for a stupid over hormonal fight with Hermione mostly over Harry even though none of the books I've ever read involved Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna.
