Dumbledore, Ron, Molly, and surprisingly enough Snape.

I started to dislike Dumbledore, Ron, and Molly after reading too many bashing fics (some of which actually did have some good points) but I'm working my way out of it

Snape I disliked very much, but now it's really full-on hate.

There are a few exceptions to this: if it's, like, a time travel fic or a Marauder's Era fic, then he'd have to do something really really horrible to get me to hate him as much as adult Snape. If it's an adult Snape who doesn't bully children, then I don't hate him.
