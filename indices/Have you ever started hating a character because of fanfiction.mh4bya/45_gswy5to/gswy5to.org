I've never been able to stand Harry/Hermione fics. I keep trying to stomach it because sometimes the fic itself has an interesting premise, but I can never stick it out.

As for hating a character because of fanfiction... I've become very suspicious of Dumbledore. I try not to bash him, but the decisions he makes in the books are very questionable, and he straight-up admits he sentenced Harry to "ten years of misery" or whatever in the fifth book. I didn't take much notice of it at the time, but some bashing fics make really good points that hey, you shouldn't stick a magical child with magic-hating muggles maybe???

I also went through this weird cycle of hating Ron because of bashing fics and then loving Ron as I grew out of bashing fics. I'm very protective of him now, and like stories where he's at least a nuanced character. Yeah, his view of the world is two-dimensional, but he's still a kid and should be given a chance to mature
