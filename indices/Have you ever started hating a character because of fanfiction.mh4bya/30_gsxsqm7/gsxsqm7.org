Snape

ok hear me out I know that he was a good character acting as if he was a bad guy in the Books/Movies attached to that was his genuine hate for Harry which made his job easier.

But in Fanfiction, he most often than not gets portrait as this tragic wizard whose heart is breaking every time he has to shun Lily's little boy and it makes me sick to the core.

Snape was written by Rowling as a human being who saw all his failures in Harry. He failed to get the girl he loved (/was obsessed with) portrayed in Harry looks forever a reminder that he lost her to his nemesis because of his own fault. Then he sees his responsibility for getting her killed every time he sees Harry's Scar.

You get the drill. Therefore he lashed out at Harry in his emotionally abusive self dumping all the hate and misery he has accumulated on an 11-year-old boy.

In fanon, he is portrayed as this master spy who is putting everyone else above his own self which is in my opinion not true.

Fannon turned Snape from a human into a Machine and it just sucks everything out of him.

- the amount of Snape/ Student character fanfics is disturbing I do NOT support pedophilia. He is a good 18 years older than most children at Hogwarts at least
