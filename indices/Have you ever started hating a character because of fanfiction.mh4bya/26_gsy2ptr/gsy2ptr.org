Ever since I started reading Manipulative Dumbledore fanfictions, it's just made so much sense to me in canon. I won't get into my reasons why I now hate Dumbledore and certain members of the Weasley family, 'cause if I do, I'll go into a tirade, but I will say that those fanfictions have opened my eyes to a darker world of the Harry Potter universe. It genuinely surprises me that Harry himself didn't end up becoming Dark Lord more powerful than Voldemort with the amount of crap he's been through. I would have thought that line would have been crossed with Sirius' death tbh.
