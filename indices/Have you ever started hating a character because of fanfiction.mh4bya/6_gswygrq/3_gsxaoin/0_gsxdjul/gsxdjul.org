Izzythehut writes Sirius very well. Ashesahesshackles has written some good one shots and character studies of all the marauders as well. I've also been recommended the author The Divine Comedian by someone I trust, and will read when I have the time. Your Stars are True by Penelope Muir also has good Sirius characterization, and a nice exploration of the bond he had with Regulus. Look them up on ao3. They have a variety of fics. A good barometer for good marauder content is how they treat Snape. If they bash him, then that's a big red flag for fanon marauders. Same with the Snape writers. If they bash the marauders, red flag. If you're willing to read Snape centric fics, we_built_the_shadows_here and Jaxon are Snape writers whose snily fics feature some very good marauder characterization (the formers portrayal of wormtail is perfect). But I understand if a marauder fan doesn't want to read those types of stories, so they're side recommendations. Finally, There is Nothing to Fear by Callmesalticidae is a Gryffindor!Riddle fic that among other things explores what the marauders would have been if they were exposed to negative influences in their house. It gets Dark, but doesn't bash them at any point. The characterization isn't perfect, in that they tone down Wormtail's psychopathy and whitewash Remus a tad, but it's still pretty good. I hope you can enjoy at least one of these!
