I kwon of one where James travel to the past from the moment of his death to his seventh year, thinking that Peter gave the information after being tortured. They basically train themselves, I think Sirius kills Lucius Malfoy and the Lestranges, convinced his family he is really a Slytherin consorting with Gryffindors, blablabla. Peter is also a good friend who is capable to risk a condition similar to lycanthropy (but being a rat) just to be more brave and help his friends changing his animagus form. I don't remember what did Remus a lot, but I'm about to ask for the name of the fic so if you want to read it I will let the link here.
