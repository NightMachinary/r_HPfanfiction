In a comment below I put my recommendations. However, if you want the best marauders I have seen written then I recommend linkao3(The Secret in the Heart of the Forest by myrskytuuli) incredible characterization overall, and her James is the best and most compelling I've seen. She even takes a lot of shitty tropes (Indian heritage for James) and incorporates them into the character to make him more interesting and fleshed out while keeping every single aspect. I recommend it to anyone.
