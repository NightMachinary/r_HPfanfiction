I think fanon goes both ways - either there is withwashing or there is making them the greatest bullies of all time. The truth is somewhere in the middle. They were cruel to Snape, there is no question in that.

On the other hand they were unbelievable loyal to their friends. James, Peter and Sirius were all brought up with prejustice against werewolves - but instead of casting him aside they helped him.

Sirius fought against the cruel ideology he was brought up. That's not a small thing either. Standing up against your parents at the age of eleven is very brave.

James and Sirius also decided that they would fight against a wrong ideology and give their lives for it when they could easily live their lives under Voldemort without any problems.

They are complex characters. They are cruel and irresponsible as teenagers, but they are also loyal and brave. I can't think of many (if any) fanfictions that really show that dichotomy.

And Peter always get tossed aside in fanfiction - regardless if it makes the marauders heroes or villains. I think that's wrong. I think they were a very thight knitted group of friends. Sirius trusted him more than Remus. James was willing to risk not only his live but also that of his wife and his son by trusting him. I don't think he would have done that if James and Sirius didn't see him as good friend.
