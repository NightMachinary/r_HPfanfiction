But the marauders really weren't as close as friends, at least not as adults. James fatal flaw (not his biggest flaw, but his fatal flaw, there's a difference) is that he believes that the marauders are all a tight knit group of friends who could never betray each other. Meanwhile Remus suspects Sirius of being the spy, and viceversa. Remus is being frozen out, and all along Peter is betraying them (It says a lot that not a single member ever once suspected him). This is not a close group of friends. Maybe in the past, but not right now. Even the good things you mention they did as a group are double edged swords. They turned into Animagus to help Remus, and used that to run around Hogsmeade, where they almost bit people many times. That's the point with the marauders. With the exception of Peter, all their best moments come as individuals, (Remus with Tonks and Teddy, James with Lily and Harry, Sirius with Harry, joining the Order). When they're together, they consistently bring out the worst in themselves. James, Remus and Sirius may have had many fine qualities as individuals, and been good people overall, but the marauders as a group... suck. They're toxic to each other and to other people. Real growth with them only comes when they attach themselves to healthier groups and people. (Peter is as always the exception in that he's a psychopathic monster, but even this is fucked up by fanon, they make him incompetent and/or a coward, when he isn't, he's just evil and completely lacking in empathy, and by feats the most competent and magically talented of the four). And I do think that the bullying Snape suffered is understated. There's a reason for why Snape is more scared of Remus and Sirius than he is of Voldemort. There's a reason for why he barely reacts to Harry trying to /crucio/ him, yet explodes when he tries to use /levicorpus/ on him (like his father before him). He is suffering form the effects of huge, untreated trauma.
