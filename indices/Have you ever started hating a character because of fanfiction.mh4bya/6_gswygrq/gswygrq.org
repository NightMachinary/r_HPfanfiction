This is gone now that I've limited what I read more, but for a long time the marauders. Fanon marauders are some of the most boring characters in the fandom. With the exception of Peter, they're grey characters, and supposed to be read as such. They're interesting because of their flaws, and because their friendship was collapsing internally (and eventually it did). In fanon they're whitewashed to huge extremes, all of them, but especially Remus Lupin, who is made a caricature, a gay uwu soft boy who loves chocolate, and is very timid. I like the marauders because they're a toxic friendgroup of pretty terrible people who enable all of their worst impulses, and who only in their interactions with other people do they grow into becoming good, not the mayonnaise and milk bitches of fanon.
