I'm pretty good about splitting canon characterizations versus fanon characterizations, so while there are quite a lot of fanon characterizations that I really hate, my opinions on the canon characters have stayed largely the same.

You might want to step back on the fics though if it's enraging you this much. I do wonder how you keep ending up with so many Hermione-heavy fics if you dislike her so much. Aren't there ways to filter out her character?
