I am probably minority here but it is Ginny for me. Mostly because most fanfic writers have hard time writing genuine strong women. It seems lot of people confuse being bitch to being assertive. And I have seen too many fanfic where Ginny come across as mean, nasty to me but praised as strong character because for some reason being nice, pleasant is considered weak. It is like fanfic writer try to prove Ginny doesn't need Harry by overcompensating.
