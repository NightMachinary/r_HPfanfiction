The thing I totally dislike about Pro-Hermione fanfics is that they bash Ron unnecessarily.They write Harry and Hermione OOC,and warp Ron into this irredeemable monster who deserves to be burnt. This is exactly why I dislike Hermione's toxic fans.For them,Hermione happens to be this goddess who can do no wrong. At one time,I went through a strong anti-Hermione phase because her stans ruined the character for me. Now?I don't dislike her or hate her.I do like her,not as much as Harry or Ron,but yeah,I like her.
