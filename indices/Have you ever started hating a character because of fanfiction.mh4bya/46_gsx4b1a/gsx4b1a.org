I share the sentiment about Hermione. It's so infuriating because it's like we're supposed to enjoy her being such a godlike perfect figure because feminism~ but she always acts like the worst kind of person (let alone friend) and I just can't understand why no one ever tells her off. I really can't muster any interest in her anymore. And Emma Watson really isn't that good of an actress and looks just plain so it's really passing me by.

But, but, the most important: REMUS ! I already didn't care for him much, reading the books (i mean, contrary to the fanon, he's almost a non entity in the books until he decides that, yes, he should stick to his dead friend's orphan lost in a war because owning to his shit is too tough). But his fanon whitewashing, his becoming this poor little helpless cinnamon bun who never has a bad thought, who is always so nice and so loving towards Harry, who would fight the good fight for everyone, and did we explain how innocent and blameless he is for his very own actions? He's a bloody coward, an ADULT, and he is as arrogant and self-centred as James is supposed to be. He's a right dick at times. And I just can't stand reading about him being this super cool uncle for Harry when he never was interested in him---even when he was his bloody teacher. Fuck that dude. (He's also a terrible match for Sirius, in my opinion. I can totally see either of them being LGBT, but they're a terrible match.)
