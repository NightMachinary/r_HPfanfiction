  I guess you could pass it off as 'magic can manipulate energy' but that feels kind of boring.

Yeah, but then what does energy even mean, when thinking about fields? If energy isn't constant, a whole lot falls apart.I don't think that the Harry Potter magic system is necessarily good for this. With other fandoms (like Eragon) you probably would have more luck.

Especially since magic appears to be largely concept based (you can curse a teaching position, and when you apparate don't gain momentum based on the delta in latitude, and when you go back in time you stay in the same place, ...), I'm not sure if you could easily make it make sense.
