I had thought about vanishing and conjuring, and they were some of the problems I was running into when trying to make sense of anything. I guess you could pass it off as 'magic can manipulate energy' but that feels kind of boring.

I know, theoretically speaking, that trying to explain magic without bending the laws of physics is impossible, but a man can dream. I just wanted to see if anyone has some sort of creative solution to hurdles like conservation of energy, momentum, etc.
