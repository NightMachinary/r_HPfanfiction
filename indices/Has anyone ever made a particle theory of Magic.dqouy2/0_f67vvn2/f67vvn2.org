I'm a theoretical physicist in my day job I believe it'd be a hard sell, honestly, to pull off what you want in a consistent way. Transfiguration, e.g., in the HP world is ridiculously broken in a matter-energy equivalence sense: vanishing a jelly donut means you have to do something with the mc^2 ~10^16 J, about the energy released by a 2 Mton nuclear device. Like watching Marvel Universe films, it's probably best not to over-think it.
