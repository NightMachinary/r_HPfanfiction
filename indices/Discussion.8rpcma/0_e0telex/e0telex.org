A couple of things I think you should consider here, that sort of make what you are saying, and by proxy what Hermione is trying to do in canon, look...fairly arrogant and narcissistic even:

1. This is a problem LOTS of people have, but the idea that house-elves should not only be treated as equals to humans but held to the same standards as humans. Why should they only be paid in galleons? All of what you are proposing /presumes/ that house elves, when given equitable treatment, would want or even desire the same thing as wizards/witches. Its a lot like the conflict Bill mentions in DH: wizards treat purchase of objects as their's for all time, while goblins see their craft as only being 'loaned' to that particular wizard/witch. You, and by proxy Hermione, would be doing the same thing: assuming that /of course,/ given fair treatment, they would want/desire the same things as she or others would. Its a very ethnocentrist viewpoint, which the centaurs are pretty on the money about honestly.
2. Setting a specific 'standard' for how much you pay house elves is perhaps even worse. Think about this: what do you think would happen today if a country decided to pass laws setting a 'minimum' wage or whatever for a specific ethnicity, but was different from every other? Now imagine that the only people who /make/ those laws are not in that ethnicity and have had, on average, far less interaction with that group than others (Hermione's a muggleborn, Harry was muggle-raised, etc.). You may be trying to improve their lives, but what you're saying is trading what master-slave contract with a broader contract, neither of which had anything to do with WHAT THE HOUSE ELVES WANT.

Improving their lives, getting them fair treatment, these are good idealistic goals. But that kind of high-mindedness, where of course you know whats "best" and "right" for others and don't need to ask them because they're slaves and brain-washed, is vain in the extreme.
