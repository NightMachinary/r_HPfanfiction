In theory an elf shouldn't need to be paid even if Hermione's laws passed. They are housed and fed by the family. If i was Hermione i'd try for stricter laws punishing abuse of an elf rather than try and get them wages, especially since the elfs really don't have anything outside of say food that they'd want to buy.
