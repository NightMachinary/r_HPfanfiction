What I am saying is they are a species of indentured servants that have always been indentured servants as far as we know. We don't know what they like, their is no industry for them and their is no products for them. This isn't like slavery of other people where they can slowly and seemlessly (in theory) start transitioning from being a slave class to being paid lower/middle class where the industry, jobs and other things are basically already their. You would have to work for decades and i mean decades to start training young free elves to start their own inudstry and other products specifically for elves so when you start making laws to free elves they can actually start working and making a wage.

That's why I think Hermione's plans are flawed, she needs to start slowly instead of jumping head first like she normally does, You can't just say "these laws are now in effect House elves should now be free and paid" and enforce them especially after a war. You need to slowly start implementing change over time, What should happen is introduce humanitarian rights for house elves first, say things like "House elves should be given periods of rest of no less than 8 hours a day from working" and "No house elf shall be without food or shelter as it is inhumane" or "Self Punishment and death penalties are now illegal against house elves" once you have those set up you start working towards giving them more things like money and such, but as the wizarding world is now especially in it's current recovery state their isn't much she can do, especially since it is shown that the wizarding world is still recovering from Voldemorts war even during her tenure as minister, she needs to focus on the current wizarding economy before focusing on a minority class, yes she can implement the "human" rights for house elves that are in service, but i highly doubt that she can realistically set laws to free them, give them all jobs/government aid, and set up new markets for them without destroying wizarding Britain's economy first.
