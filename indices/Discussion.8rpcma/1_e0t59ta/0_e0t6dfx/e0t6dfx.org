The teachers are housed and fed too, but I still assume they make money. Housing and food justifies a lower wage, but not its complete absence. Maybe they'd want hobbies, or to buy clothes for themselves, books and games, or even just free-time and leisure money. Not treating them like dirt is a start, but slaves that go unharmed physically are still slaves.
