No matter your feelings on how Snape is as a person, while I think the whole "he has to be cruel because he is a spy" argument is utter bs, there's something in that when it comes to Harry. It is strategically unwise of Snape to /not/ dislike Harry, because if he has a relationship not built upon mutual dislike -- even if it's merely just respect -- Voldemort is going to demand that he abduct Harry, abusing Harry's trust in him. Thus, Snape has to engineer a dislike for him, the easiest way probably being to deliberately project James Potter upon him, even if Snape might objectively know that it might be a gross misjudgement (after all, Harry hasn't known James since he was a toddler).

Thus, he'd probably just give Harry a detention for backtalking as a result of that reply.

Note that I /only/ give him a pass for the treatment of Harry specifically. It does not justify how he treats others -- such as how he bullies Longbottom, the infamous "I see no difference", etc.
