I think that's more due to Basilisks being rare and artificially made creatures than any link to Rooster-rareness, so they'd probably be found more often in dark dingy dungeons and hidden lairs off in the middle of nowhere than by Farmer Maggot's prize carrot crop. I don't imagine the Rowling-World tends to get many Dark Lords keeping chickens, so they'd be mostly safe unless intruders knew a basilisk was around and could handle a distressed Rooster well enough to drag it into a deep dark dungeon.
