I believe the note said something like "the cry of a rooster is fatal to it." Maybe the argument could be that while fatally damaged, death is not instantaneous for the basilisk? So it has time to fight back... maybe a smaller basilisk might die quickly, whereas a fully-grown basilisk might still live for days... think of a rooster-cry as poison to the basilisk, instead of an Avada Kedavra.
