Goblin blades only take in what makes them stronger if I remember correctly so it should be fine. I was thinking that maybe Harry in your story would get the basilisk stuff by a combination of basilisk /blood/, basilisk venom(maybe) and Phoenix tears. To make it more rare so that questions about it not happening already don't crop up, maybe Voldemort performed some ritual on his soul to make it more accepting of snake-like qualities.
