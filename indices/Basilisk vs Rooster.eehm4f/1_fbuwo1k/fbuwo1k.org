The only instant death from a rooster I've read in a fic is a crack fic. The rest have the whole frantic death scene where it's wriggling around and screeching. Usually doing more damage to the heroes than the battle itself.

I headcanon it by saying "Crimes against nature always receive an easy-ish counter." Still have yet to think up a good one for Horcruxes though. I vote patronus. Probably something stupidly easy. That the Unspeakables know of. But hide as Dark Lord bait. Hell, it gives more credence to the Love is the power he knows not.
