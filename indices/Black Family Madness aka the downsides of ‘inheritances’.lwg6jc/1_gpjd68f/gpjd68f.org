I interpret the black family madness to manifest as obsession. Bellatrix is obsessed with the blood purity movement. I like to think that when you get the madness it's a long slow road to becoming fixated on one central idea to the exclusion of other thoughts.

Like the moon landing hoax people who would accost notable astronauts in public places. Or the Oklahoma City bomber for a direct comparison to Bellatrix (intelligent, skilled, and absolutely a menace to society).
