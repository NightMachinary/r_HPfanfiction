I've definitely read one, I don't know who by, but it was quite short. Might have even been in one of those collections of ideas fics? It was pretty great, because by the time he makes that decision he's super over the magical world, so he's like â€˜you know what? Fuck magic' and everyone is incredibly horrified and don't understand. and him becoming a squib made Voldemort a squib too, lmao

Possibly he retired to an island with Sirius? That's the end of a lot of fics though, so I might be confused
