Please, reddit won't shut down over it. No one should even be surprised to see this being possible.

Writing rights over the database basically means that. He can change your password if he wanted. Beside, it's not like only bad things came out of it, by reminding people admins can modify comments, maybe reddit won't take itself as seriously and won't be usable as testament and proof in court anymore.

It's something that can be done anywhere, Facebook, 4chan,twitter, Tumblr, forums, ff.net, etc.

We will all pretend to be offended for a while, and then forget about it in two weeks
