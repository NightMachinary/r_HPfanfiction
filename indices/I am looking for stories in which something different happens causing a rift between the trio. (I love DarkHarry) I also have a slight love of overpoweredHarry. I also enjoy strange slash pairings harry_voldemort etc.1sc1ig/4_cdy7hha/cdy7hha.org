[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/Harry_Potter_and_the_Descent_into_Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] is quite good. The trio is split after the Goblet of Fire spits out Harry's name, with both Ron and Hermione thinking he did it himself. That rift closes somewhat over time, but it never fully heals.

During this time of solitude, Harry discovers the Horcrux in his head, and...well, things happen from there, really. Harry is a very Dark character in this fic, and there's an eventual Harry/Voldemort pairing that works well and has logical reasons behind it.

It has an *abandoned* sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Breeding-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Breeding Darkness]].
