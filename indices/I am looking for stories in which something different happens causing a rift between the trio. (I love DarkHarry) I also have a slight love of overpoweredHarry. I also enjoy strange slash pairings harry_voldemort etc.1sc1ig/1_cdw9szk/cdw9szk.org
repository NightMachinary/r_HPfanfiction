If you don't mind that it traipses off into bizarro land toward the end, then Teufel1987's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/][Rise of the Wizards]] has much of what you're looking for: falling out among the trio, a darker, exceptionally powerful Harry, etc. (It's not slash though).

If you care for slash, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer has an amped-to-eleven-powerful, dark Harry in a same-gender relationship (fem-fem--it's revealed in the first few paragraphs that Harry's time/dimension travel lands him in a female body). The trio hasn't much of a role in it.
