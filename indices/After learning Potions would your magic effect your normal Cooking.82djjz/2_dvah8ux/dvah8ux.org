The Gemino spell means the entire country can eat the same food. A collective of farmers each competing to be the best at producing one type of produce. This year, Agnes Prewett has the best honeycrisp apple, while for tomatoes, Yvette Lestrange won the national contract for both sweet and tart varieties. If you aren't a fan of black krim or green zebra, don't worry; Lily Luna Potter's got her sudduth brandywines available at select locations in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Meanwhile, on the citrus front, Teddy Lupin's lemons have a real bite to them.

Bluebell flames would probably be better than /Flagrate/ -- safer, certainly. I could see them being used, depending on how they work, as a decoration, or a way to slowly sear something, or as a primary means of cooking.
