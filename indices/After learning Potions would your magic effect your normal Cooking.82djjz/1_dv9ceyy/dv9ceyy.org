I don't think so, any more than saying an incantation without the slightest intent behind it and without waving your wand would produce the effect. Not to mention Potions only really work thanks to the magic in the ingredients, even if the potioneer's own magic is necessary to kick things off; it's not as if you can just mix up any old brew while /intending/ to get a potion, and get something that actually does anything. The whole point of Potions is that it's very precise, and if you steer just slightly off the recipe or add your powdered asphodel just too early, the whole thing's either going to explode or turn into useless goop.
