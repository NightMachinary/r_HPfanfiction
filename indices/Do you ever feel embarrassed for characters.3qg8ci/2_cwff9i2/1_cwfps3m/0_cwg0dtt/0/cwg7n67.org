Nah, Robin Williams wouldn't be embarrassed, I think. To him it would probably just another character in his endless list of characters he portrayed (or will portray after the release of that movie). It could, however, probably be hugely embarrassing for Field & Brosnan to be acting opposite of Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire :p
