Ah shit, I shouldn't have said Robin Williams, what I really meant was the character he was playing, Daniel Hillard. The situations he gets into and the fear of getting caught absolutely permeate that movie to the point where it isn't funny the first time around to a lot of people. And when he is caught, like by his son, peeing? That is just absolutely horrible- people in 1993 didn't really understand cross-dressing or anything trans and there was a real fear from this kid that he was about to be murdered by a pervert.
