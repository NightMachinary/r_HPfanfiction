[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11536461/1/Legacy][This fic]] basically embodies everything that I hate about this so-called "Heavy Handed Harry".

What's worse even than how painful it is to read (I couldn't make it past the first chapter) is how effusively praising all of the reviews are. I couldn't find more than a couple of negative reviews. Other than that, everyone who reviewed */enjoyed/* this level of unapologetic douchebaggery.
