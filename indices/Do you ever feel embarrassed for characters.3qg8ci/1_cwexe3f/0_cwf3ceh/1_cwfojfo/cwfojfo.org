You got me curious, so I checked the first chapter of what you linked. I will partly disagree with you. This case of HHH (welp, we even have an acronym for it now) seems not /that/ cringe worthy, especially compared to some of the other fics out there.

That said, I wouldn't say I am a rabid fan of the story, but for different reasons: the introductory prose felt a bit weak, and secondly we have the 'Henry' 'Peverell' trope, which /might/ cause 'embarrassing' moments later on, but it could also be handled well. Anyway, chapter one hasn't given me reason to really hate it either.

Most importantly, in this one Harry is seventeen when he acts like that, which makes it a little more believable than those other fics where an eleven-year-old Harry starts making grandiose proclamations in the Great Hall or the Slytherin common room. (DZ2's Demon of Hogwarts comes to mind.)
