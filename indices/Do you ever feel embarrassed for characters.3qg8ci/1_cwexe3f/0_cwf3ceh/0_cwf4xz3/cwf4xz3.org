To be fair, though, anyone who actually has taste either got out of there as quickly as was possible or soldiered through the suffering just to leave a review that the author most likely will ignore.

Bad fiction gets some good reviews because people want to help. Total crap fiction gets no good reviews or nearly none because each and every one of those is a lost case and unless you are doing it out of sheer stubbornness and misplaced pride leaving any sort of review accomplishes nothing but wastes your time.

But I'm starting to rant so I'll stop now.
