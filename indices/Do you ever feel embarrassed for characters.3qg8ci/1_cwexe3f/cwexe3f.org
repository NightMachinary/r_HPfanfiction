That's what I like to call "Heavy Handed Harry," and I fucking hate Heavy Handed Harry with the passion of 10,000 burning suns. He is incredibly boring to read, and yes I think it would be accurate to say certain things I've seen HHH do are pretty embarrassing; such as when he gets naked in public and points out scars from his muggle beatings, etc. The claw of ragnarok unbroken just made me ^{nope} out of that story though, more out of a desire to not be bored by HHH than embarrassment.
