Yes, I cringe a lot, especially when Harry is yelling at Dumbledore in the Great Hall for stealing his money and bribing his uncle to buttrape him, and then smirks because the Goblins emancipated him or some shit so he has wandless magic now or whatever. Alienating all his allies in the process.

Generally when he's acting especially idiotic and pathetic. There's a line to how much he did it in canon, and authors constantly step over it by miles. Or when the author plays it as if Harry is acting cunningly, but he's really just acting stupidly, because the author apparently can't actually write clever characters.

Overall, I can't stand 99% of fics.
