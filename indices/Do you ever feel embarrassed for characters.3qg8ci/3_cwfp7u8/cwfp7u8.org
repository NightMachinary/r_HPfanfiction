I think one issue with this is American authors trying to write British characters who have a very specific sense of humour and sarcasm; teasing; banter. I've heard mentioned before that some American readers find Harry, for example, to be a bit of a dick, where British readers would just see him as a bit cheeky or a bit of a tease.

That is to say, American fanfic authors will sometimes take things too far in the wrong direction, so we have things like super-cool!Harry or mean!Harry that can seem really OOC.

Pervy Sirius is another one, and super-heterosexual!Lupin - these tend to crop up in very Americanized story settings and I've always thought its the direct result of taking a character's core attribute like 'cool' and thinking of all the things that would make a character cool....in America. Unfortunately this isn't always the same as what JK, as a British woman of a certain generation would have written, and so it can create a bit of confusion sometimes.

OOC is fine in an OOC or deliberately AU setting, but it can be jarring when it suddenly pops up in a setting that's trying to be otherwise canon-compliant.
