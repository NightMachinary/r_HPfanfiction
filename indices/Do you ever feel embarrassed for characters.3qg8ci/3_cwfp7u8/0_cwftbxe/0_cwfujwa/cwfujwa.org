mm. Het Lupin is fine, but some authors go overboard with it and make Lupin into this lech that's always after women and making pervy remarks... I don't know, I've always considered Lupin to be a very reserved character so acting like that has always seemed OOC to me.

I've edited the original to make it clearer. I've never seen a /macho/ Lupin as such, but I've seen authors go all out to give Lupin excuses to talk about his heterosexuality - as if to make it /absolutely clear/ that he's /not gay/. And it shows.
