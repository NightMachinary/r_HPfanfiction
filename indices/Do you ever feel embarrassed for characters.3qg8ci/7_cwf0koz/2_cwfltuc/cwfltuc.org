Yeah, Wastelands of Time is one fic where I don't feel like this at all because the whole point is the utter ooc awesomeness of Harry. It's like an action movie- the one-liners can be stupid taken out of context, but you just have to relax, suspend disbelief and go along for the ride- and the explosions. :)
