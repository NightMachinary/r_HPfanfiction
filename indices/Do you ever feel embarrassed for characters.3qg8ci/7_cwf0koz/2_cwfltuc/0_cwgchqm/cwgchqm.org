It's all in the delivery. Could canon Potter deliver this line credibly? lol no. But WoT Potter is insane and absurdly confident and competent, and so he can manage to deliver the line.

Actually, even if you imagine he /didn't/ deliver the line successfully, it's still interesting. That just makes him look even more insane, and kind of sad, which is still compatible with the characterization of him the author's trying to achieve.
