Honestly, after living for what is 1500 years I'd probably be too tired to actually get enjoyment from people's reaction to anything dramatic I'd do, what with the mental fatigue resulting from that, especially with the time looping and so the pool of new things to do that I'd want to do being limited. So not really, after so many years I think anyone, or at least most people, would be way past being overly dramatic, for the most part.
