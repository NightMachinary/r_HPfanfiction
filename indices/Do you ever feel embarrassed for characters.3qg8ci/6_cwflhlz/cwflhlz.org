I feel embarrassed for the characters and cringe when they do something that embarrasses them within the story- like if they say something stupid and they know it, if they mess up something important, etc.

For- are we calling it Heavy-Handed Harry now?- anything like Harry Crow, I tend to laugh and jeer at the author more than get embarrassed for the character.
