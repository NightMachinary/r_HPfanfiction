All of them?

There's next to nothing your average indy!Harry could do to manipulative!Dumbledore that 'Dumbles' couldn't reverse with just a handful of well placed spell. The only times where I saw him do that was in a couple of one-shots. In the rest of cases, Dumbledore just tries some convoluted scheme that makes him look more like a petulant child before being subdued by the heroic Harry Potter, with his bethroed Hermione/Daphne.
