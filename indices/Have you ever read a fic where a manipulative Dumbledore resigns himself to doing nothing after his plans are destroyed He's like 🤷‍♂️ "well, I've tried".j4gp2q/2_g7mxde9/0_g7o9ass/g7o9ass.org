I also vaguely remember one where Dumbledore realizes he's become manipulative and a hinderance to society. Then he wants to go hide in a cave in some far off country or something in shame until the end of his days. But his friends convince him to stay around and simply retire (from ALL his positions) and become an occasional volunteer lecturer at Hogwarts. Kinda nice actually. I don't see many manipulative!Dumbledore fics where he gets a redemption arc.
