Canon! He put a dumb cryptic symbol in a book with no explanation. He also didn't even give a hint about where the sword of gryffindor was, or why he even wanted to give it to them. Also he put it in a frozen lake bottom and just let Harry be a moron and go in to get it. :( Dumbledore really liked watching Harry flounder about in canon. He could have saved years of time by just sitting down and telling him exactly what he needed to do, what he expected him to do at least.
