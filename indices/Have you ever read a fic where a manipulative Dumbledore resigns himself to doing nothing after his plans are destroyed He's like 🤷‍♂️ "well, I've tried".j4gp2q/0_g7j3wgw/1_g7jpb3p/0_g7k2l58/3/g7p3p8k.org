  I doubt Gryffindor sword spent more than 1 hour in the water but the true question is "Why did Snape put the Sword into a frozen pond (outside of the obvious similarity with the Arthurian legend) ?"

because:

  “Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster's chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that *it must be taken under conditions of need and valor* --- and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry's mind and see you acting for him ---”

The sword needs to symbolically be taken under conditions of need and valor for the magic to work

  He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio Sword.”

  It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy, the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.

  Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless.

  What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? *Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat*. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry's head answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.

  Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.

  He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.

  With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where “chivalry” entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.
