My best guess for this, and it still seems kind of stupid: we know that Snape didn't want them to figure out what was really going on before time, due to moderate risk of Voldemort legilimizing them.

We also know that Snape, despite ultimately being on the right side, is a prejudiced asscrack who thinks gryffindors are all attention seeking idiots. And that he believes they won't think too hard about something that looks like a quest.

So If he had just dropped it outside their tent, they might think it was a trick or trap or something. But if they see it at the bottom of the frozen lake, it's (to their tiny gryffindor brains,) obviously been moved by some magical being and is part of some great rest.
