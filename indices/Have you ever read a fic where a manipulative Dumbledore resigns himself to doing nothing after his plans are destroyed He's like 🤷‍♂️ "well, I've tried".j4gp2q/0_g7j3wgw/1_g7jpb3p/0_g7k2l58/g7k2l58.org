I'm not sure if you are sarcastic or if you forgot about canon (kinda hard to tell in writing), so I'll say it just in case, but Dumbledore didn't gave Harry any hint about where the sword of Gryffindor was because . . . he didn't know?

In Canon, Snape kept the sword hidden into the Director office, and brought it to Harry when he was finally able to locate him (thanks to Phineas portrait). He used his Doe patronus to attract Harry outside of his protected campsite, and then guided him to the Sword. I doubt Gryffindor sword spent more than 1 hour in the water but the true question is "Why did Snape put the Sword into a frozen pond (outside of the obvious similarity with the Arthurian legend) ?"
