Well now. I'd like to think that no one had any idea she also caused weird things to happen, so she treats Snape exactly the same, until her letter shows up.

At that point, everything changes. Petunia is ecstatic at not being overlooked for her special, pretty younger sister, and the animosity between her and Snape lessons ever so slightly.

At that point, it depends where she goes. Slytherin is possibly the best fit....but I think it likely she wouldn't survive the seven years. She'd either die, or drop out. She's no Griff or Ravenclaw, so I'd like to think the Hat has /some/ intelligence and puts her in Hufflepuff.

She'd be happy there. Probably get some good friends. Chances of dying would still be high, especially once Voldemort heard the prophecy.

I'd see petunia either getting a kick out of seeing snape bullied, or disliking the Mauraders and playing interference for both Snape and Lily.

I could see Petunia and Snape marrying, tbh. They'd have a Ron and Hermione relationship, with vinegar instead of ginger.
