She wouldn't marry Vernon but probably a wizard, Petunia wouldn't have hated Hary, Harry would have confidence in himself and wouldn't have befriend Hermione and Ron (or at least not best friend). The main reason why he befriend them in canon is because of a lack of friend in his childhood and a need to keep them happy. He never felt the need to befriend other people or to get to know them. Example with his trial (5th book) where he didn't recognise that Amelia Bones was the aunt of his classmate Susan. When I was in school, I knew at least the lat name from the people my age.
