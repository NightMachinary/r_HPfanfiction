As a muggleborn witch whose sister is also a muggleborn witch that just happens to have married a pureblood, Petunia would be high on the list of people to kill as far as the Death Eaters would be concerned.

Especially if she showed a knack for magic Voldemort's followers would have deemed to be dangerous in a muggleborn's hands.

If she did survive, then that piece of fanart would be applicable, but odds are that the Death Eaters would have designated her a priority target due to her sister's marriage into the Potter family.

She would most likely not have survived for very long afterwards.
