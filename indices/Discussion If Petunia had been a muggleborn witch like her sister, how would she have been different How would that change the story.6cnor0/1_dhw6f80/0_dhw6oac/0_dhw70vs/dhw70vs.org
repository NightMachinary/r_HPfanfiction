I suppose it could be written like that. But it could also be written a hundred different ways as well.

- Petunia escapes the war by moving to wizarding Majorca

- Petunia goes underground using the Fidelius Charm or other means

- Petunia marries a Voldemort sympathizer and joins the cause

- The Death Eaters don't know she exists/they're related- both have married and changed names and they don't think to keep track of Muggleborns
