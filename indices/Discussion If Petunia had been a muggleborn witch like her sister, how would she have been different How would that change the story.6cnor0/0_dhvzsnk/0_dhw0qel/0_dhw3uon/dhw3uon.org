Snape was a prodigy of a kind: he'd managed to make his own spells before he got out of Hogwarts, and was also quite good at potioneering. People like that often get rumours about them of just this kind as time passes even if it is fairly obvious that they can't really be true, and the fact that he joined Tom's sparking band of comedians did not help Snape with the rumours. If he managed to be friends with Lily as a kid, surely he couldn't have been a miniature dark lord.
