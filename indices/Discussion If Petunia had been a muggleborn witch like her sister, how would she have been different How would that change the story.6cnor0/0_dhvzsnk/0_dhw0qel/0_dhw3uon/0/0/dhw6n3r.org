  Sounds to me like apologism. If at any point in your life you not only consider but actually decide to join an "organization" such as Voldemort's you're seriously fucked in the head.

I won't debate his head-fuckness or lack of it because for me the fact that he cannot get over himself and act like an actual adult when it comes to dealing with Harry is evidence enough that he is petty and an arse, that much is enough for people to have a low opinion about him because seriously, the fuck Snape, grow up.

That said, I do not feel it to be apologism to say that joining an organisation like Death Eaters, heck, even just associating with them in any capacity that people would know about, is bad for his reputation and obviously will not help him with any bad rumours circulating about him. I mean, seriously, how can it be apologism when I am not looking for an excuse but instead pretty much saying “well, bad rumour have more fuel when you do fucked-up shit”? The rumours are that /as a first-year student/ he knew more dark magic than some seventh years, or something like that; /that stuff/ is obviously not true and just rumours, fuelled by all the stupid crap Snape did and his fairly negative reputation amongst people. Now, during his higher years, he obviously was a fairly bad egg in that regard, whatever the reason for him going there, and if the rumours were that as a /fourth/ or so year he was oh-so-dark you wouldn't be able to reject them outright, but when talking about a firstie such rumours are nothing more than rumours.
