Yeah I sort of agree. Snape was probably a loner and over the years cracked under the pressure. I see the very real possibility that a Snape who had a different kind of adolescence might have turned out to be a good guy.

I have to object to this though:

  the fact that he joined Tom's sparking band of comedians did not help Snape with the rumours

Sounds to me like apologism. If at any point in your life you not only consider but actually decide to join an "organization" such as Voldemort's you're seriously fucked in the head. At this point we're probably not talking about mere rumours anymore (and lets face it, the guy didn't just decide to join from one day to the next). At some point during his Hogwarts years (after a steady decline towards whatever the likes of Lucius Malfoy enjoy doing in their free time) there were good reasons to want to have nothing to do with the guy (and I bet in Lily's case the "mudblood" comment was merely the final straw).
