In my opinion we don't know enough about the mechanics of spell creation to declare him a prodigy of some kind. The Weasley twins were doing something similar and while creative they weren't meant to be absolutely brilliant. Sure he was uncommonly gifted with potions but its the nature of the dark magic he knew. He was the sort of kid who pulled the wings off flies and dissected pets. Being friends with Lily wouldn't be hard when you think they met at what, 8? He realised she was magical and it something that only he shared with her in the whole town. He knew more than her and she was inquisitive.
