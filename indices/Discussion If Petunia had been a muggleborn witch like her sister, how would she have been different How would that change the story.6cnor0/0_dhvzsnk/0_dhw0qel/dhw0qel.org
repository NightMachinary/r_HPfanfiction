Interesting, Snape was always weird, it was said he knew more dark magic in his first year than most seventh years. I can't imagine the neighbour watching supremely judgemental Petunia would be okay with Lily being friends with such a odd person. Which way that would push the friendship I don't know but I severely doubt Snape and Petunia would ever like each other.
