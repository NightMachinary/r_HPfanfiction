I think it could have possibly changed the outcome of the entire series. I think Petunia and Lily would have remained very close. I also think it could be possible that Lily might have wanted Petunia as secret keeper, in which case maybe Lily and James would never have been killed?

Alternatively, they might have all been killed and Harry may have been placed with magical guardians (like the Weasleys) and have had a far nicer upbringing.

Had Lily had Petunia, she might never have become friends with Snape (seeing as her older sibling could tell her about the wizarding world), so I guess Snape might have succumbed to the darkness a lot sooner. And without his redeeming qualities of love and loyalty, Snape probs would have grown to become Voldy's most dangerous supporter with nothing to turn him over to the light.
