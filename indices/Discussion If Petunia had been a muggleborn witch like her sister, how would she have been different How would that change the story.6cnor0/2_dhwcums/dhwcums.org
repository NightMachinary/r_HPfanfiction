Lily wouldn't be friends with Snape for long because Petunia would see him for what he is and what kinds of friends he has. Lily wouldn't latch onto him because her she already had her sister to tell her about the magical world and not just the kid with poor hygiene and a bunch of racially motivated terrorists as friends. Because she is not defending Snape she has less fights with the marauders.

Assuming that Petunia survives the war and Dumbledore doesn't meddle like he usually does Harry is raised by a loving Petunia who does not like the magical world (it costed her her sister, she is discriminated against and murderers walk free).

And now I want Harry raised by a bitter but caring Petunia.
