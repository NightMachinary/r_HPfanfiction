  And now I want Harry raised by a bitter but caring Petunia.

linkffn(12479244) This story might be right up your alley. It's fem!Harry, Petunia's still a muggle, and it's just started out, but it's off to a good start so far and looks to worth following. The author seems to be juggling a lot of in-progress stories so expect slow updates, but his work tends to be fairly good in my opinion.
