  Violet Evans was a quiet introverted girl who just wanted to be left alone. She liked reading, talking to snakes, helping out her mum, and didn't really care much for the world at large. When Petunia told her she wasn't actually her daughter, that she was born Harriet Potter, she wasn't impressed in the slightest. No, she knew who she was, and the magical world could just sod off.
