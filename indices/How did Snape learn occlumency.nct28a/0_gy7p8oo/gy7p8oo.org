my headcanon is that either a) his mother taught him, or b) in his own personal practice of trying to learn wandless magic either in a desperate bid to get around the trace, or just learning how to use it to look more powerful or something (hello robe swishes), he discovered occlumency listed as a wandless magic and was like â€˜that sounds like something I want/it will make my brain cooler'

I just see young Snape as wanting to seem as powerful and big-brained as possible to gain him some form of personal power and control, which led him to the mind arts (including leglimency/mind rape) like Riddle's somewhat similar path led him to horcruxes because he didn't want to die etc etc
