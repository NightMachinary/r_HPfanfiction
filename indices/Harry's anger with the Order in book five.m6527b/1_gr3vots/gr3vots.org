The whole point of the Order of the Phoenix is to have more information than the general public. If they have just as much information as a biased newspaper, then they're obviously doing something wrong. Of course, they are under no obligation to share such information with Harry, but that isn't the point.

Ah, yes. A teen who just saw an acquaintance murdered and was tortured by a dark wizard craves for the company of his two best friends (who are obviously together, without him)... So self-obsessed.

One of the main priorities of the Order was to keep Harry safe. Even though Voldemort was lying low, they only went to Platform 9Â¾ with "security". IIRC, Harry didn't even go to Diagon Alley to get his stuff, Mrs. Weasley did. Going out in the muggle world is the exact opposite of what the Order would want him to do. They practically took on the role of "babysitting" Harry themselves.

Canon Harry clearly didn't hold Ron and Hermione's "useless" letters against them. He gave up on it in a space of 3 pages, got off of his capslock-screaming high and let the topic die.

Now, if you want to call out fanfic authors for their needless bashing, sure, go on. The whole "Harry is a selfish, lazy, over entitled brat" is counter-bashing of the worst sort.
