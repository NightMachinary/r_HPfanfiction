There is a fanon that launched a thousand bashes: that Harry was kept incommunicado. Whereas, his friends did write to him, just not about the things he wanted to read about.

Now, to add to the OP, it was, in fact, a bad idea to put information about the Order into a medium that could be intercepted by a delinquent house-elf, precisely when the Ministry was looking to find dirt on Harry and Dumbledore both.

That said, I do get the sense that nobody properly explained this to Harry. A "Sorry, Harry, but we don't know who is could be reading these. Remember Dobby?" would have gone pretty far. (Or, maybe they did write that, and Harry was just being a self-obsessed teenager.)
