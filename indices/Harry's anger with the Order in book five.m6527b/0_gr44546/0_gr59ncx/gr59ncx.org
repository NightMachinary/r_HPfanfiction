Plus the Order's headquarter is Sirius's home, so while the Order isn't a babysitting agency, Sirius's being his godfather I say it would be pretty normal for him to be there, even more secure than Privet Drive since Grimmauld Place is under a fidelius

For the Weasley though, yes everyone know he is friend with the Weasleys, but it's Harry who is the target of Voldemort, so while they are targeted too, Harry going with the Weasleys would make them even bigger targets and thus endanger them. Doesn't stop him from going to Grimmauld Place where his only remaining family lives though
