After Fifth year yes it would but that summer, no. Even the OP admits that this was when Voldemort was laying low, he wouldn't risk a full fledged assault while the Ministry still had the vast majority of the population that he was dead and he had the freedom to move however he wanted. So Harry being there wouldn't have placed the Weaselys or Headquarters in any more danger than they were already in.
