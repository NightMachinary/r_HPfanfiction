You sound like every fanon Snape bashing fic put together, you do get that right?

He was a kid who got kidnapped by a psychopath and watched a friend get viciously murdered in front of him. Any idiot would know that with someone in that kind of situation leaving them alone with people who actively disdain him is about the worst way to handle this possible.

As for making the Weasleys a target, no he would not have. It was already easily common knowledge that was extremely close with the Weasleys so it would hardly draw new attention and this was the summer that Voldemort was trying to lay low to capitalize on Fudge burying his head in the sand. He absolutely would not have risked a full on assault of a well known Wizarding family to take a potshot at Harry that had zero guarantee of success.

As for the baby sitting remark, funny how they seemed to have no problem with having Ron and Hermione chilling at Headquarters then huh? It's pretty much all or nothing kind of deal, either they aren't a babysitting service and the Weasley children and Hermione should be at their respective homes or they should have brought Harry there at the same time so he could be with people who gave a shit.

Lastly, if you actually bothered to remember instead of indulging in your weird counter bashing rant Dumbledore was for all intents and purposes ghosting Harry that summer. I doubt he would have even responded much less done it.
