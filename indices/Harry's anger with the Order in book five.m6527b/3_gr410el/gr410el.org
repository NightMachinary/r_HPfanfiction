Well at this point Harry is suffering from PTSD evidenced by constant nightmares of Cedrics fate on top of being a moody teenager. I mean from an unbiased perspective ofcourse noone will give a 15 year old with a short temper information on a secret organizations goings, but we look at it from Harry's PoV.

Another point I have looked at lately is that Harry is very very selfish about the war in his cannon portrayal, going "noone else will die for me" etc. And constantly neglecting the fact that noone is fighting for him, but rather the future he stands for. Which ofcourse given his story isn't surprising but when you look at it like that it makes sense for him to be annoyed.
