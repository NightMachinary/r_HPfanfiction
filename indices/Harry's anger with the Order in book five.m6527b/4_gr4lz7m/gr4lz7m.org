Another thought that occurred to me as well that I can't believe I skipped over, The Daily Prophet? Are you joking? It's a blatantly biased rag that is completely and totally under Fudges thumb, they don't print a word he doesn't tell them to and at that point the official party line was “Potter and Dumbledore are crazy lying famewhores, don't believe a word they say. Voldemort is dead and never coming back.”

What exactly was he supposed to draw from that? Voldemort could have incinerated fifty muggle villages and they still would have stuck to the party line and blamed it all on Sirius.
