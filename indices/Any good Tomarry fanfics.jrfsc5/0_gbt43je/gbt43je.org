Try linkffn(Lord of Time by debstheslytherinsnapefan) It's done really well (one of my fav authors) it has good progression and it's basically MoD!Harry in the Riddle-era. No MPreg and Dark!Harry.

Or you linkffn(Embracing his true self by debstheslytherinsnapefan) this one is still in the golden era and it's basically Harry his been hiding in a mask his whole life and now he lives with Voldemort that slowly progresses to a relationship.

These are both by Debstheslytherinsnapefan. They right really good fanfics.
