linkffn(Core Threads) is the end-all of "Harry gains god-like powers and crushes all opposition". By virtue of not having any conflict, and using magical cores in its worldbulding, it /should/ be yet another boring, obnoxious OP!Harry story, but somehow it's one of the most enjoyable things I have ever read thanks to a mix of humor and worldbuilding, and fits the "highly unusual" part by going lightyears further in overpoweredness than literally any other fanfic ever.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake) and linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild) both have a highly unusual premise that it would be very easy to muck up, but end up being some of the most hilarious ongoing Harry Potter fanfictions, in the vein of linkffn(Seventh Horcrux).
