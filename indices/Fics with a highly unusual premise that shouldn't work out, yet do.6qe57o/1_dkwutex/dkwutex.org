The premise is very silly and you would think the fic was either a badly written cliche non magical AU or a total crack fic because can you really expect a fic about Hogwarts being a ballet school to be any good?

But it just works so well and it's not really what you expect from the summary. The story draws you in and gets super intense at times. It's somewhat of a psychological thriller like the movie Black Swan with a blurring of different realities, a good plot and great characterizations.

It's about a dance school putting on a performance called "the prophecy" thats basically the plot of canon events. It's a story of double meanings and parallels between the plot, the characters performing the play, their canon counterparts, the events going on in the dance school and canon universe. As time goes on, the characters start losing their grip with reality and the parallels between them and their canon selves become more apparent. Focuses on Harry and Tom Riddle who are both great in this fic.

It's not complete though and the updates are extremely slow.
