I'd say this sub probably tends much more towards the die-hard type of Harry Potter fans than [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]] does. I'm sure there are plenty of very casual fans that go on that sub because they saw a few of a later movies, while not many people that aren't serious Potter fans are very likely to be reading fanfiction based on it, much less subscribed to a sub dedicated to that.
