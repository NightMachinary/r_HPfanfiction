Definitely. Not to mention fan-fiction can be a rather time consuming hobby if you are a slow reader, so it sort of has that intimidation factor as well, given that there are stories longer than all seven books /combined/.

You should go over there and read some of the discussions. I read one post chain where the same person said the following things. (paraphrased)

1. /Where did you read that? Minerva McGonagall was never married!/

2. /Neville didn't marry Hannah Abbott. What are you talking about? Who is Hannah Abbott anyways?/

I was mentally cringing the entire time. I didn't have to check the front page of reddit for political cringe-posts for once!
