What are you talking about? The OP asked for unusual premises... JKR's premise is super cliched and has been done a million times. It's not crazy or off-the-rails at all. As you said, it's based on "your typical bland coming-of-age novel". Her writing certainly elevates it above that, but a common fantasy formula is definitely not something that I would categorize as "shouldn't work, yet does".

Maybe I'm not getting the joke here.
