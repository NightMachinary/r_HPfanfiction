I'm not certain if it qualifies as highly unusual, but I've never seen it done by anyone else. I'm writing about Pandora Lovegood, Luna's mother, in her school days, as well as detailing her strange friendship with Severus Snape. Pandora's canon background is quite scant, so I'm attempting to flesh out the character and give her a history in a believable way.
