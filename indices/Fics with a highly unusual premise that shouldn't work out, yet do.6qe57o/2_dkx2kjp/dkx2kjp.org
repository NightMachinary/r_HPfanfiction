This fanfiction is incredibly busy, lots of moving pieces, but everything came together so fluidly and I don't understand how? I'm also real shitty at describing fanfictions, but basically Harry is the messiah and Ginny is some hardcore powerful Egyptian God who ended up in Slytherin instead.

Really weird, brilliant writing.
