This is quite good so far. Thanks for posting it! I usually only search for new fics on fanfiction.net and ao3, so I miss out on a lot of stuff like this that's on other sites.

Edit: I got a few chapters in, and it definitely starts to spiral off into ridiculous Mary Sue land, but the beginning at least is really solid, and the premise is interesting.
