The pairings follow the most common tropes (guy 1 and guy 2's sister, guy two and girl 1, who always seem closer to kill than to fuck). The only thing more clich√© at that point would have been Harry/Bella. And there's not really a lot of built-up while Ginny at the end of HBP seems like a dickhead (not that Harry's break up scheme was much better tbh).

The idiot ball has been mentioned a lot so I won't go into detail here, but focus on the epilogue instead. Malfoy should have been in Azkaban for a long list of charges, Ron's casual mention of assaulting his driving instructor should have consequences, neither Albus nor Severus deserve the respect Harry pays them and the "all was well" sentence is very dickish, especially from Teddy's or George's pov.
