In my humble opinion, it's good that JKR didn't go that way. The books aren't about politics and post-Hogwarts problems of muggleborns.

Even it's shitty, the Epilogue ended on a right note. Pair Harry with Hermione, get rid of "Albus Severus" crap and we'll get a good ending. We can even assume that Malfoy spent some time in Azkaban for his crimes.
