There we differ - the books are all about politics, in my opinion. Pretty much from the start, it's about fighting bigotry, racism, fascism, nazism, government corruption, abuse of power and slavery.

Replace "muggleborn" with "people of colour" and the Death Eaters with the KKK and it's even clearer.
