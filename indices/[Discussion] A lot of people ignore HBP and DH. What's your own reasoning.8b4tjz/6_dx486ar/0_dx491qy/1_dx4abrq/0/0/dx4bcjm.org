Those things define the environment the Trio operates in. But none of them actually seriously fights it. I can remember two "significant" attempts:

1. Hermione's "spew" that died our very quickly;
2. Harry's DA that ended with the book 5.

None of the Trio represents something serious outside Hogwarts.

How their political future could be introduced into the books organically?
