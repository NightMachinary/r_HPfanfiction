What? The entire struggle against Voldemort is a struggle against bigotry, racism and nazism. Fighting Voldemort and his Death Eaters is "seriously fighting" it. The evil of slavery is shown repeatedly in the books, up to the elves fighting Death Eaters in the last book. Abuse of power is a theme, from Sirius's imprisonment to the campaign against Harry in year 5 as well as Scrimgeour's abuse of power in year 6.
