Under "pretty strong things" I meant:

#+begin_quote
  By opposing bigots at school, saving fugitives pursued by corrupt authorities, civil disobedience in the face of a corrupt and oppressive government and by fighting nazis, fascists and bigots, especially once they launch a coup. We fight slavery by freeing slaves.

Sorry, if it confused you.

Despite good intentions the books provide a clear example how you *must not* fight nazis. All children actions are based on luck without any strategy. As result (let's ignore drama element) they are meaningless. By the end of 7th book Light side was losing once again. The Second war literally repeated the First one: it ended with Riddle death only.

And that's alright. "HP and ..." series are not history books, but fiction for teenagers, nothing more.
