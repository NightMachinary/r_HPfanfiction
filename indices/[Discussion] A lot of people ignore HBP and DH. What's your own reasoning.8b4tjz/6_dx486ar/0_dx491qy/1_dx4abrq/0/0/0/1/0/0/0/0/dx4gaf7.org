I think you are taking it too serious. They are books for children, not history books. You named pretty strong things, but using them randomly without any strategy usually leads to the only thing -- failure.

And even according to the book the only thing that worked is the final confrontation with Riddle. Everything else was pretty meaningless.

Even DA, while sounding noble, is controversial. It's possible without it children wouldn't be too confident to fight killers, escaped Hogwarts and more of them would be alive.
