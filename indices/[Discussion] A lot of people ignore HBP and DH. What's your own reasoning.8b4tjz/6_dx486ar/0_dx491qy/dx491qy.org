Yeah. Whatever you write, don't finish at Voldemort's death. Show us how justice is dealt out. Show us the changes the war caused - for the kids who fought, for the muggleborns who faced a genocide, for the scum who supported Voldemort with words but not deeds, for the establishment who saw their country taken over by Death Eaters and then freed by a bunch of kids, revealing how hollow and weak the entire Ministry was. Show us Hermione leveraging her and her friends' power to push through radical changes to creature rights and other reforms - it's not as if anyone would oppose the people who just killed Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

Whatever you do, don't end the book with that shitty "we all fought and so many died so we could return to the status quo" epilogue.
