With regards to Daphne - I tend to skip stories where she's playing a major role since I'm not interested in the "OCs with a canon name". That Daphne often is used in "purebloods are actually right, the DEs are just too extreme" stories is another negative for me.

How are you planning to show the ending? Extended epilogue? Or a whole arc/part?

Why is everyone ending up at Hogwarts?
