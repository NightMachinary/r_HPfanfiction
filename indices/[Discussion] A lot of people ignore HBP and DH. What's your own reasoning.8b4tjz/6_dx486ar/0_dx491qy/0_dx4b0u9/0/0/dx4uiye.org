Not OP, but from my experience, Daphne is not about "pureblood bigotry is right" but in 9/10 cases

  All purebloods are evil. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of +men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor and on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth+ Potter and House Greengrass, the only /grey/ house, who never had anything to do with Voldemort, well besides uncle Aldrin, but we aren't talking about him anymore, resisted Voldemort and fought valiantly on the grounds of Hogwarts, they shall fight on the beaches, they shall fight on the landing grounds, they shall fight in the fields and in the streets, they shall fight in the hills; they shall never surrender.

I love using the name only characters because you can write them any way you want. Have them interact with the known characters. In both of my stories, Penelope Clearwater plays a far larger role than in canon. Both have background characters as love interest (Lisa Turpin and Nymphadora Tonks respectively). If you show more than just the main cast, you add life to your world. Sure, it doesn't matter that two background characters are together, but mentioning that there is something going on in Hogwarts besides the main plot makes a better narrative IMO.

Canon is lacking in the regard of using the reserve bench. Harry spent 6 years on the Quidditch team. He ought to be more affected by Katie getting cursed than "oh well, just another Saturday. Or in GoF, where Harry is desperate for a date, would it have been that difficult to ask Alicia after Fred asked Angelina? Instead of spending a few weeks making a fool out of yourself, why not ask your friend. It was a social obligation because Harry got shafted by the staff and Ministry, not a marriage.
