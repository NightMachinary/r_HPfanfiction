I mean, that can actually work if the author keeps their opinions well away from the plot. linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) does a convincing job of this. Harry and Daphne both argue their points well - in a conversational sense, at least. It's not about who's right or wrong in the end, but that the argument sounds like one between two marginally rational human beings.

Author tracts aren't fun on either end. Even "Muggles are morally superior" stories are a drag to read.
