Be careful making Hermione all that. Through out the series she shows very little ability to compromise or just make friends. Consider, for all her intelligence she lacks the skills to get people over to her side other than brute forcing her views upon them. She's a skilled witch but I can't get behind the idea that she'd do well playing nice with others. Between her personality and her association with Harry, as in, people will assume that she used his name to get where she has, plenty of people would be willing to block her promotions before we even get to her policies.
