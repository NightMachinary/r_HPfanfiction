Well, I already have the end game planned out, so let me know if you'd like the build-up to it:

Harry/Daphne (she's a blank slate, so I have an easier time dealing with her). He works with the Aurors for a few years, but becomes the DADA professor after his son is born.

Draco serves five years. When he gets out, he meets Astoria. Lucius dies in prison while serving his sentence. Narcissa at first vacations and then pretty much lives with Andromeda.

Hermione revolutionizes the Ministry. Then she becomes the youngest Headmistress in Hogwarts history. Neville is her deputy because Harry doesn't want to draw anymore attention to himself.

Haven't decided what to do with Ginny, other than she remains a background character.

The existence of Albus Severus is nary a thought in anyone's mind.
