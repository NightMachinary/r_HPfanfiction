Because I checked... unless I missed something or forgot.

The information probably originates from Pottermore or a Rowling interview. Yeah, the reference in the wiki links to a Rowling interview. If someone writes a Fanfic based on the books Daphne is a blank slate. As far as I can see her only mention is that one line in Book 5.
