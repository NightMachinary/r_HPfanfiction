I'm just confirming [[/u/Deathcrow]] 's statement here. It's fairly easy to get hold of the text of the books in soft-copy and then it's trivial to search for the words "Daphne" and "Greengrass". The one time either word appears is in the sentence quoted above.

Yes there's other stuff from Pottermore and interviews, but in the books it's just that passing mention. Astoria doesn't even get that.
