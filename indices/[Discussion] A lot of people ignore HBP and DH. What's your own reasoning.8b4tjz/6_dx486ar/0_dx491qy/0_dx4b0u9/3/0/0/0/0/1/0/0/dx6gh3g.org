I wasn't criticising you.

The first time I read somewhere that Daphne was only mentioned once, I didn't believe it either. That's /why/ I found the books online, downloaded them, put them into one text file and now keep it on Dropbox so I can check it easily wherever I am. It's only 6.2M so even my phone can handle it.
