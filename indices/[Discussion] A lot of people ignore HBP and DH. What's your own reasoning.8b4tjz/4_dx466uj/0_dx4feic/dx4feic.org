That was very well put and quite succinct!

I've certainly thought the Dumbledore faction should have been much more decisive at some point and not so passive and loser-ish.

I can even accept not wanting to "become the enemy" and mindlessly kill all the Death Eaters, but there's a wide range of options (especially when Magic is involved) that is never explored. Securing a school full of children through the use of Veritaserum and Unbreakable Vows certainly seems appropriate in a time of Civil War and Terrorism, when students have been attacked.
