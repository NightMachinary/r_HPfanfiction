And yet, Dumbledore can arguably be said to have shown considerable ruthlessness when using Snape. (Possibly towards Harry as well.)

But that ruthlessness, or even just practicality, is shockingly lacking in many other situations, especially concerning the Malfoys.

I much prefer DianeCastle's Dumbledore - that's a cunning and ruthless man whose actions are both consistent and make sense. At least more so than canon Dumbledore's.
