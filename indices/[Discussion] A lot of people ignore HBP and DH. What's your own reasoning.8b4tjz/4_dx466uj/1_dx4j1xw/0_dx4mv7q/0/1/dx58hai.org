Spider-Man too. I love Spidey, I really do, but the fact that he has to fight the same enemies dozens of times is ridiculous. I know that it's just Marvel wanting to reuse familiar characters, but at some point, I have to go, "Okay, so Rhino just killed a bunch of people in his rampage... again... for the tenth time in the last five years... Why isn't Spidey just finishing them permanently?"

I mean, fuck, if you don't want to kill them, at least make sure they won't ever be able to walk again or something. If you don't want to become a killer, at least paralyze them.
