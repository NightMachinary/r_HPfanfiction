Actually, in some ways canon Dumbledore makes sense, if you see him as a war-weary general who wanted to retire three decades ago but everyone kept piling shit on him and there were no suitable replacements. He has to make hard choices but doesn't want to and is therefore hesitant. Said hesitance makes sure nothing gets done properly and in the end the death toll is far higher.
