In my opinion, the characters - all of them - were pretty much holding the idiot balls for most of those books, and acting wildly out of character just so the plot wouldn't get derailed. That was a tendency of the earlier books as well, but it became blatantly obvious when the tone shifted from children's books to more serious YA novels. The idea that Hermione and Ron (and everyone else from the Order) would dismiss Draco as harmless is so shitty it beggars belief. The "flight of the seven Potters" is a plan a six year old would have dropped as stupid. The revelation that you can be your own secret keeper, as Arthur and Bill demonstrated, suddenly revealed Lily and James (and Dumbledore) as idiots who missed such an obvious security measure. Capturing murderous Death Eaters, yet not killing them, or at least obliviating them down to children, beggars belief. The whole camping trip is a farce that has "I don't care about logic, they have to be hungry and cold, even though they're wizards and witches, and could easily avoid that" written over it. And Dumbledore wasting his last year on shit he could have taught Harry in an afternoon and somehow not telling the trio all they needed for the hunt in advance (as well as handing them the items he had prepared for them well ebfore his death, so the Ministry couldn't mess with it) takes the cake. Once more the supposedly most powerful and intelligent wizard of Britain is reduced to some useless plot device, instead of actually acting out his experience and smarts.

Either the books should have kept the children's book tone and be more whimsical and less bloody, or the bodies of Death Eaters should have started to hit the floor starting in sixth year as the Order and the Ministry went to town on Voldemort's supporters, using everything Dumbledore could bring to the table. At the very least, Dubmeldore should have used his restored influence and power to get rid of scum like Umbridge, and pretty much everyone else supporting blood bigotry int he wake of Voldemort's return being revealed. By the time he died - if he has to die, even - the Ministry should have been remarkably free of open bigots, and much stronger, and Malfoy should have been dead.
