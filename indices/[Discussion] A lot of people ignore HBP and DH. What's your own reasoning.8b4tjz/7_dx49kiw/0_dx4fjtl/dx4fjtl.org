  If you need a Potion of Luck to move you plot forward, your plot is crap. It's all I can say about HBP.

There's a much bigger issue with this: Way too much weight is given to something that Tom Riddle once told a professor. I mean okay, sure, that's a good starting point, but just because he told Slughorn that a Soul split in seven parts might be a good idea doesn't mean that he actually did that. It blows my mind that this is the only thing they have to go on for the rest of the books. What if Riddle decided "Fuck magical numerology!" and made 13 Horcruxes?
