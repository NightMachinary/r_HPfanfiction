  The Potion of Luck is just another stupid plot device that requires everyone to be holding the idiot ball.

Oh, but it gave us "Stages of Hope" and Harry's manic Luck Potion addiction in it. So I can't really feel that bad about it's addition to canon.

To be totally fair a lot of stuff is stupidly overpowered and introduced as a plot device without thinking through the consequences: Polyjuice, Veritaserum, Unbreakable Vows, Fidelius, Apparition, Time Turners... etc. A potion that makes you a bit more lucky seems the least of your worries if you're concerned about things that should or could have been used to better effect. Time Turners just for the fact alone that you can exist twice at the same time are completely ridiculous. Not to mention that you can use them to spy on events after you hear about them. Oh and add Invisibility/Metamorphagi/Polyjuice to the mix and suddenly you can save people from death by replacing them with a polyjuiced and confounded Death Eater.
