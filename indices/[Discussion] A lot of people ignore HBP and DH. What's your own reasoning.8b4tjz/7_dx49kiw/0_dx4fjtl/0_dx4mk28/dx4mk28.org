There's also another, potentially even bigger issue: If there's such a potion of luck, and it's so damn useful, why wasn't it used before, and afterwards? Why wasn't the Order dosed with it before entering battle? Why didn't the Death Eater use this before trying to get the Prophecy?

The Potion of Luck is just another stupid plot device that requires everyone to be holding the idiot ball.
