I don't ignore it, but I do find the people in them annoying. I find Hermione incredibly frustrating, especially, with her constant dismissing of important things Harry says or thinks. And Harry really should have tried a little harder to get better at magic.

And the whole Elder Wand ending was dumb. Had Dumbledore's plan worked, and the wand died with him, Harry would have likely been squashed by Voldemort. It felt like a cop out. It felt like JK Rowling went out of her way to make Harry as normal as a prophecized child could be.

I just really didn't care much for the last 2 books.
