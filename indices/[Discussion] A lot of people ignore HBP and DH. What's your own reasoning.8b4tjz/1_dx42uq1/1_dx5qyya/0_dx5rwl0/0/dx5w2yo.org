  He might've wanted Harry to use his wand to defend himself, but to finish Voldemort off?
#+end_quote

I meant Harry defending himself, but actually now I think on it, it might attack Voldemort too. It did attack him with golden flames that one time... I just looked up where Dumbledore explains this to better understand, and this is what he says,

#+begin_quote
  Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters.

  “I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort's wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius's wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort's own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy's stand?”

  “But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?” asked Harry.

  “My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.

He's only talking about Harry's wand destroying Lucius's though, and not about killing Voldemort, but still interesting. I suppose it's possible Dumbledore was depending on Harry's wand more or less doing the exact same thing the Elder Wand ended up doing, and from what actually happened, I think that's a reasonable assumption for Dumbledore to have made.

But despite this, I do not necessarily think Dumbledore even expected Harry to be the one to kill Voldemort at all. I don't get the sense Dumbledore cares all that much about what the prophecy says, or for things like fate or destiny. He works off of facts and trusted magical theory, and he does not seem to trust Divination. From the living Dumbledore's perspective, anyone can strike the final blow so long as Voldemort is mortal. Harry is the only one who can make him mortal, but anyone can do the actual killing bit. I think that's what the Order was supposed to be for, but things just worked out differently because of that "flaw in the plan". Anyway, I don't really think there was enough for Dumbledore to plan the moment of Voldemort's death. Only after he's dead do I think Dumbledore's perspective changes about who can kill Voldemort; in King's Cross chapter both he and Harry are now aware that Harry is the master of the Elder Wand, and Dumbledore explains things to Harry with the new circumstances in mind, that Harry /can/ kill Voldemort. Not that he has to, but that he is capable of it:

#+begin_quote
  “I've got to go back, haven't I?”

  “That is up to you.”

  “I've got a choice?”
#+end_quote

He asked Dumbeldore about the afterlife, and after getting a vague answers, says,

#+begin_quote
  “Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.”
#+end_quote

And Dumbledore responds,

#+begin_quote
  “True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.”
#+end_quote

And I think they both know what that means.
