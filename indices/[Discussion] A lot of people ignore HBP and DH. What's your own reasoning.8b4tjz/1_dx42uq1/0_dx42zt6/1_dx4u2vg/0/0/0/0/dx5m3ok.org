I don't know why you're so hostile to me about this. I don't particularly appreciate it.

Harry definitely learned the spell and practiced without the boggart. He also practiced with it, but none of those speak to the overall difficulty of the spell, just the conditions of casting.

Also, when he cast it at the end of PoA, he even says that the only reason he cast it was because he knew he already could since it had already happened--a boost of confidence that helps a lot with intent based magic.

Harry was always meant to be the everyman thrust into a magic world....not a magical prodigy. Rowling wrote a prodigy, it was Riddle, or Dumbledore. Harry was clearly nothing like them. I know, its disappointing. But that's what fanfiction is for.
