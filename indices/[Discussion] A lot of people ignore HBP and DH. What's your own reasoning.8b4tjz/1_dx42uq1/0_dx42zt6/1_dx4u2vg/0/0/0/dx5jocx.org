Come on, if you're even remotely familiar with the Harry Potter books you know perfectly well how the spell works. Harry still experienced the horrible effects from the precence of a dementor when faced with the boggart. So he was learning the spell while fighting the effects.

It's mainly this effect that causes the spell to be so difficult to cast, as I clearly explained in my last comment. You must be capable of imagining that focusing on a happy memory is a whole lot easier to do in a normal situation than when a dementor or a boggart pretending to be a dementor is sucking all the happy memories out of you.
