....it's either highly advanced and difficult to learn, or easy to be taught to the DA....it can't be both.

Harry was also taught without the presence of dementers, though the boggart gave him some sort of dementer practice. He still learned in a classroom without the threat.

"Highly advanced and difficult magic...well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level"

Right, so like Calculus. OWLs are taken at 15, wizards live to be 100+. The end all be all of advanced magic is not simply "beyond Ordinary Wizard Level"

Edit: also passing with good marks doesn't mean he didn't struggle. I don't have the text of the books in front of me but I don't recall him getting through classes with any particular ease. He was just....normal.
