*Furthermore, Rowling never really showed Harry as being particularly adept in books 1 and 2...he struggled in exams and on homework,*

Ehm...

Also:

*Sure, it's impressive, and most people don't do it, but that's likely more related to the fact that it's a highly specialized charm that the average wizard is very rarely going to need than any particular difficulty.*

From PoA:

  ‘There are -- certain defences one can use,' said Lupin. ‘But there was only one Dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist.'

and

  ‘Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just --?'

  ‘It has nothing to do with weakness,' said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry's mind. ‘The Dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have.'

Again, PoA, have you read that book at all?

#+begin_quote
  ‘So ...' Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. ‘The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.'

*Harry managed to teach a few of the DA to cast it in fifth year in just two weeks, and it only took him a couple sessions over the course of several months to learn it in the first place.*

The quote above shows why Harry could so easily teach the DA. It's the effect dementors have on people that makes it so difficult to succesfully cast the patronus charm. In the DA, he taught them the spell without any dementors present. But learning it in a classroom and casting it against actual dementors are two very different things. And people who have experienced more trauma have more difficulty casting the charm, which is why it's so impressive that Harry can. He is more affected, yet his patronus is incredibly strong.
