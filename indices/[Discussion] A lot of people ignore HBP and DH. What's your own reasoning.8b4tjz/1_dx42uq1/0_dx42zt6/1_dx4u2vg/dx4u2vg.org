Which admittedly we don't have a lot of evidence that it's any more than just an esoteric spell that doesn't have much call so no one bothers to learn it. Harry managed to teach a few of the DA to cast it in fifth year in just two weeks, and it only took him a couple sessions over the course of several months to learn it in the first place.

I always took it to be the equivalent of a geometry student learning the basics of calculus, such as a few derivatives and integrals, rather than the equivalent of a sixth grader learning to design and launch a rocket.

Sure, it's impressive, and most people don't do it, but that's likely more related to the fact that it's a highly specialized charm that the average wizard is very rarely going to need than any particular difficulty.

Furthermore, Rowling never really showed Harry as being particularly adept in books 1 and 2...he struggled in exams and on homework, Hermione was always the one with esoteric spell knowledge, and at the end of the day he was always shown as just kind of a average student with a big heart and a lot of reckless bravery.
