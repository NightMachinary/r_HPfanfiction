This is the epitome of my love-hate relationship with these books. Having grown up with "Harry" as a friend (same age as book releases for most part), watching him cast a patronus at 13, speak parseltongue, quidditch prodigy...I wasn't looking for Super!Harry but I was expecting...greatness...I got fed up with fifth and sixth book because I was constantly waiting for him to finally get serious about something, anything..
