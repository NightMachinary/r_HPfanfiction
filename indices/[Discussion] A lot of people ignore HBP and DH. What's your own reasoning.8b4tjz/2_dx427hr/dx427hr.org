The ending is contrived in order to align with the overarching theme of the book. However, this does not stop the ending from being contrived. Nobody's plan should ever rely on "should"s. I much prefer some practical action from the most powerful wizard of the age, not a plan based on myths and hope.

So many people in this series need a kick in the pants and to be told to get over themselves. Those with power and choice bear a responsibility for those beneath them.
