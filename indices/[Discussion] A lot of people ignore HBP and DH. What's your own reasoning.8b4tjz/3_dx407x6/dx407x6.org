To me, it is that Harry is hopelessly naive- he knows that a powerful wizard is out for his blood, but he doesn't make any effort to improve himself. Sure, there is the DA, but that is made to pass their standardized test. Harry doesn't seem like an "equal" to me at all- he was caught by snatchers in DH- wizards we can all agree don't hold a candle to Voldemort. He won due to the Elder Wand backfiring- not because he was marked as an equal. Just my opinion, don't kill me lol
