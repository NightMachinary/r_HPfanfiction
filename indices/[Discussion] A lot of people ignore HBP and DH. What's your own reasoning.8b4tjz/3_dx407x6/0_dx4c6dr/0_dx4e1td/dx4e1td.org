Harry's experience, while greater than anyone else's at Hogwarts isn't vast. Primarily he was teaching spells that could be tested on in the exams. I'm sure some members cared more about their exams than Voldemort since at that point all they had was Harry's word backed up by Dumbledore.

For the second part, yes he won because he was good, that's fine for a children's story but the series grew up. Its what made it so great when I was growing up, the series aged and changed as I did. By the time of the Seventh book it was very much young adult territory rather than children. At that point people want a real solution. Power of friendship etc doesn't cut it. People wanted to see Harry grow and take on the mantle of the chosen one, to leave his childish delusions of normality behind and become every bit as great as Ollivander predicted. Obviously greatness has different definitions but the ending was underwhelming for a lot of people. It was contrived and outlandish but not magical. Harry accepting his death might have been emotional but at the same time it felt like giving up. With regards to people standing up, they stood up to Voldemort before Harry, he might have been a figurehead but they were doing it long before he was born.
