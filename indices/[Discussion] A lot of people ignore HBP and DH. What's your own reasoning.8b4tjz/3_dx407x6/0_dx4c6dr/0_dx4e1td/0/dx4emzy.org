  Harry's experience, while greater than anyone else's at Hogwarts isn't vast. Primarily he was teaching spells that could be tested on in the exams. I'm sure some members cared more about their exams than Voldemort since at that point all they had was Harry's word backed up by Dumbledore.

I challenge you to find anything in the book that backs up a single word you said. Like I said, passing their exams played a part, but by far the most important reason was to learn to defend themselves, as is made perfectly clear in the book. What you said was inaccurate, simple as that. Those examples I mentioned can all be found in the book, and there are more.

There also is (but I admit I may possibly be wrong about this) no mention that Harry chose spells because they were likely to come up on OWL exams. For instance, the examinor asked Harry to cast the patronus charm as a bonus, showing it wasn't part of the exam. Harry chose spells that he thought would be useful for them to know. He makes this clear with the disarming spell and I believe several others.

I also didn't claim that Harry's experience was vast. Just that it was the main reason Hermione asked him to be their teacher.
