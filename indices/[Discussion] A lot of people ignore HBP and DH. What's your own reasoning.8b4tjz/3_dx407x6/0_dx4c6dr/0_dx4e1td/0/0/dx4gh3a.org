You're asking me to prove a interpretation. 'I'm sure some members cared more about their exams' I'm not claiming that they openly said it. Comparing what is written vs what is in line with the characters of a story is silly. Character as people have their own motives. We experience the books from Harry's point of view, we don't get insight on every character's motives for joining the DA. Heck, Michael Corner joins because of Ginny. His friends that came a long might care more about their exams. We don't get told every member's reasoning for joining, there isn't an in depth interview stage. It is reasonable to suggest, given the scepticism surrounding Harry's claims that some might have just wanted to practice magic that wasn't allowed in the class room. Me thinking its reasonable enough I'm willing to suggest at least one of the members saw their exams as a priority is me saying I'm sure. They aren't all convinced Harry is telling the truth, the chapter at the Hogs Head shows that. The fact that plenty sign up without full confidence in Harry's story is enough to suggest potential ulterior motives. You're taking my thoughts as a personal attack.

Harry isn't teaching them the spells that Dumbledore and Voldemort throw around at the Ministry at the end. He doesn't know them. What he has is Hermione, the books Lupin and Sirius gave him and his textbooks. Taking the resources he had available and his motives its highly likely that the spells he taught were part of the course and the spells he learnt at the end of the last year for the third task that he thought were useful. Harry thinking they're useful isn't mutually exclusive to them being tested. You look at where he found the spells and you draw conclusions.
