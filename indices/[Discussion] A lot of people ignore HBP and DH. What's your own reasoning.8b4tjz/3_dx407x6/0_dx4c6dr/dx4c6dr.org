First of all, I think you're confusing Harry with Umbridge. She's the one who said exams are what school is all about.

The book made it perfectly clear that the main purpose of the DA was to learn to defend themselves in the real world. Passing their O.W.L.s was a small part of it, but certainly not the main part.

It's mentioned several times. First when Hermione asks Harry to be their teacher. They want him specifically because he's had real life experience fighting Voldemort, and that's the most important thing to learn.

Then in the Hog's Head they're discussing it and Macmillan says something along the lines of 'Surely you wabt to pass your exams as well?' And Hermione says something along the lines of 'Of course, but most of all, we beed to be able to defend ourselves against Voldemort.'

As for the second part of your comment, this comes down to personal opinion. It was never about Harry being as magically powerful as Voldemort as the books made very clear, and I personally like that. It sets Harry Potter apart from your standard hero.

He didn't win because he was overpowered, he won because he had a good heart and was a good leader who inslired people to follow him. That's what makes him a hero. When Voldemort lost, the Death Eaters fled. But everyone stood up to protect Harry and kept fighting when they thought he was dead. Because he had inspired people to stand up to evil.
