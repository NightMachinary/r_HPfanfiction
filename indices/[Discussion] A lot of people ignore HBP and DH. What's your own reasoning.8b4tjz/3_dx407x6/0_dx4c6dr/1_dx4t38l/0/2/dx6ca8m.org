> Harry explains why he chooses to teach them the disarming spell, when Smith scoffs at it. And the stunning spell proves itself to be useful.

whenever i read or listen to this passage, i feel the urge to strangle Harry. Yes, the Disarming Spell PROTECTED Harry, but ONLY Because of the Special Connection with the Core. Would he had any other Spell, the Avada had killed him. Harry is spreading false information, that the Disarming might be work and Protect against the unforgivables (the avada in particular). Harry could also have stated "hey, if someone casts the Killing, just simply counter with the Disarming spell." (really, why hasnt anybody thinking about this genius idea?!. The only good Point i see in his statement is that it silenced Zacharias, whos suprise was totally right, because...like i said, any other would be killed. But Harry seems (as so often) forget about what he learned in the Years. He seems to think, that the Disarming is the natural Protection against the Unvorgivables and totally forget that Dumbles mentioned that it was only because of the Cores...if he was aware of it, than it was dangerous to be quiet about it, as this was a necessary information to keep alive. Now that i think about, Harry seems to be a little like dumbles ("I dont care if Lives of faceless people would die in the Future, as long as you are alive"). But again, i give him this Point against Zacharias.

But this is a Fiction and Fantasy World. Realistically, the DE would only (or mostly) use the Unforgivables to make things easier, unless of course, Voldemort wants a Victim alive, than its captured (it it stay unharmed is another thing).

> Just like we only see a few DA meetings

actually we witness all of the DA meetings, but not all of them are as detailed as the First meeting. Mostly we get a summary from Harry about the teaching progress.

> Even in GoF, Crouch Sr.'s decision to fight fire with fire was seen as very harsh and controversial.

But it was reasonable. cruel, yes. But personally, i tend to Judge Bad action by its causes. If someone kills your Family right in front of your eyes, would you kill this Person in an act of Rage and Revenge or would you let him kill you, because your "morals" forbid you to kill this attacker? If someones does hurt other People and enjoys it, everyone has the right (in my eyes) to attack this Person, ESPECIALLY those, who are harmed by him. The Victims never asked for their Pain, but the Person was WILLINGLY causing the Pain and rejoiced by the Pain and Fear that he caused. I didnt came in such a situation yes, thank God

Imagine you meet a new Person, but this Person punchs you everyday, when your Paths are Crossed (on work). You know this Person is an evil Person and likes to hurt others. After an encounter, you say "stop hitting me, or i hit you back!". HE will be WARNED, he can adapt to your encounters and prepare for possible counters. If you keep silent and wait for the next time, YOU hit First or immediately after he hits you. You take him off-guard and throw all your anger in this Punch (and possibly more punches) and he has no time to defend or adapt to your attacks....i think, Bartys way was a plausible one to get out of the "Darkness", a cruel one, yes, but how many People did support him? Many, because they were desperate and wanted to be free again, free from the Pain and fear.

> Moody was considered a great auror by at least Sirius for never stooping to the level of Death Eaters, never killing unless he really had to, and we're talking about an adult and an auror who is trained to do that. Even he doesn't like to go that far." Nope, sorry, but now you are interpretating something in others actions and Behavior. We only have Sirius report about Moody. But how did he really thought? Remember the Pensieve scene with the DE in front of the Wizengarmot? Moody: "Lets take the information out of him and send him back to the Dementors". What does that say? Moody didnt want to execute the DE, no, he wanted them to suffer, if possible, untill they die. And i dont think he made a Joke about it, considering he was talking to dumbles about the latter not liking the Dementors. moody acts like one of the DEs, but im not blaming him. Hunting down the Trash of the Society must cause a rub off on someone.

> The good guys did win the wars, regardless of what you think of it

you mentioned it before: its a fantasy world..and if i may say so, a childbook series (Rowling even stated that she didnt saw the Books as Childhood series, but she wrote them for her "children" to read. Yes, it implies that her Children might not be physical children anymore, but can an Adult still have Fun with the Book 1-5? And the Good Guys won the War, because they were supossed to. The Evil is defeated, the Good wins, all are happy and the Mainchars marry and have Family.

> Apparently holding the moral highground did work; the proof of it is in DH

again, its a Fantasy World, a childbook series (who are supossed to teach morals) and most importantly, a Fiction, that Connects (or tries to) with the Real world. So the moral worked, because it was supossed to work. Why did Harry not Murder Voldemort? Because it would be bad, if Harry would became a Murderer. He had to be "pure" and innocent. The Children were teached that Murder by the Protagonist is bad, despite all the Problems and complications they would suffer through it.

> Again, personally I think incapacitating people is better than killing. I believe in a justice system that doesn't involve the death penalty, let alone people acting as judge and jury themselves.

Im split about it. But the "Justice system" is also built by Humans, and Humans might be corrupted by their Power, so they can kill innocents just because they dont like them or threatening them. Or it can set free Dangerous People, because of a "formality" or bribe. Incapacitating People contains the all-time Possibility that said person can Escape and Vanish without any traces, nowhere to be found, continuing the Killing Spree, but in other Countries.

People acting as Judge and Jury themselves......if the Justice System clearly has failed because a Letter or a Date was incorrect in the Culprits case, and he is set free and continues in killing People, the Government will say, that the Cases have Fault, because someone was editing them wrong. But what excuse do they have if the Culprit vanishes without a Trace? Or if all Evidences speak for the Cuprits fault, but the System sets him free, because its corrupted? As im said, im Split, but considering the Circumstances. Vigilantism isnt always that bad. The Gouvernment just tells its People that its bad, because they dont want the Citizens to kill each other and so make a lot of Paperwork or to reserve its right to "kill someone legally" (death penallty IS STILL a Murder, a Kill, but its Legal)
