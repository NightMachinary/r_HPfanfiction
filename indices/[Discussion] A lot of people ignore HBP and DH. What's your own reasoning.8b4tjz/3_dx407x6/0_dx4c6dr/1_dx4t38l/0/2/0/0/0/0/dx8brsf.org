Yes, i have of course been serious. But the thing is: they created an Adult cover for a Childbook series, so it would appeal more "attractive" for adults.....its as if Disney made more "adult" covers for all the Kids Movies like Junglebook and the Little Mermaid. And the fact that the Content, despite the adult fitting cover, is still more made for Kids. But that doesnt mean, that Adult wouldnt have fun with this. But there surely would be some who say "what kind of shit is this? i have been tricked by a appealing Cover, but the Content is just Kids doing things. Thats "false labelling"" Its was a way, to attract the Adults, but i wonder, if the effort fo such a Group might be smaller, when they only sold the child art version. Im not from Britain, but i discovered, that on my Country there are adult version selling too. But it wasnt necessary on THAT time, they read it, if it was interesting, or not. Sorry, if i was bothering you
