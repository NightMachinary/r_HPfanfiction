> I'm really glad people in my country generally don't have this violent mentality.

this were just my Opinion and initial Thoughts about Criminals, that werent dealt ordinary with. And WE can only imagine, via Sirius Report, how the World was. Everyone could be a Spy for the Dark Side. Going the "Soft" way, would only slow down the Process, be more morally, yes, but also giving the DE the possibility to adept to this "typical light side" tactic and eliminating its cause with preventiv measure. "the way to hell is paved with good intentions", i can easily imagine that Crouch was just wanting to end the misery, but over time, he got corrupted by his own Intentions and the fact about his Son. Thoughts are free and you cant tell me, that you wasnt driven once in your life so far, that you imagined, you would go violant against another Citizen.

> I don't really get the hate against the disarming spell

you say it yourself: its not the hate, but Harrys Reason for it being useful, atleast for me. But we see Harrys reasoning and it might be considered Naive.

> I doubt Harry would advise people to use the spell is useful against unforgivables, he knows perfectly well what the spell is for

he more or less indirectly, confessed this by making Smith silent with his Statement. Keep in mind, that No one knows, why Harry survived through the Killing Curse. Maybe all might think, that the Disarming might be especially powerful in his hands. Smith could have countered "come on, you want to tell me that the disarming would work against the Unforgivables?" and Harry would been defeated. i guess we can all assume that Voldemort only used the Unforgivables, maybe not against Dumbles, because for him he needed a Bigger Arsenal of Spells. Well, atleast it sounds to me, that Harry is submiting, that the Disarming would work against the Unforgivables.

> And Harry is aware of the twin cores thing.

the thing, that we cant Witness Harrys thoughts right after he makes Smith mouth shut, refuse me to believe that. As i said, Harry forgets a lot of Things during the Years. Think about that even Hermione didnt believed Harry in Book 7, as he mentioned that the Cores did this. HELL, even Dumbles believed Harry and even explained this to him, but the so called "know-it-all", refused to believe what Dumbles said -.-

> But he also knows that it's a useful spell and I think that it was a great first spell to teach the DA.

Sure, the thing is, the he made a state, that the Spell might be useful in defending against the Unforgivables and we never see him denying this fact. Of course, there are other More adult and more experienced Wizards, but as multiple times proven: Harry is a powerful Wizard. So the fact that he can defend with a Disarming against the pure Evil, might give a lead, that its possible, but the other Wizard are not talented enough. Too bad for them.

Im talking about the Content, not the nice Cover Art
