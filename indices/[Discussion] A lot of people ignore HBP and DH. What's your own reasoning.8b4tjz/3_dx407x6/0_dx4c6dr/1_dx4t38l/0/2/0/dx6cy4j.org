Well, I don't agree with you in the slightest. I'm really glad people in my country generally don't have this violent mentality. But I get where you're coming from and you're free to your opinion of course.

I don't really get the hate against the disarming spell though, even if I understand why people don't like Harry's reasoning.

A wand is a wizard's main weapon. Disarming them of that weapon is a great idea. It's an excellent spell to use in a fight.

I doubt Harry would advise people to use the spell is useful against unforgivables, he knows perfectly well what the spell is for. It's a bit silly to think that. He just tells Smith that the spell came in useful for him and it did, as it was the first spell he could think of when faced with Voldemort. And no spell can block the avada kedavra anyway. And Harry is aware of the twin cores thing.

But he also knows that it's a useful spell and I think that it was a great first spell to teach the DA.

Do you really have to ask this? The adult cover was made for a reason and hundreds of thousands of adults still love the books. And not just adults who grew up with the books. I kniw plenty of people who first read the books as adults.
