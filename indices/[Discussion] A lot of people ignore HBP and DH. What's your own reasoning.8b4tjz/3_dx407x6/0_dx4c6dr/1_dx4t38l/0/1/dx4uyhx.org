I suppose I should make it more clear that my comment was in response to this:

#+begin_quote
  Sure, there is the DA, but that is made to pass their standardized test.
#+end_quote

We know what the intention was of starting the DA by the people who actually started it. I completely agree that other students have had their own reasons, like Macmillan who considered the DA to be important to pass his OWLs.

However you say that the DA was made to pas standardised tests, but it's Harry, Ron and especially Hermione who made the DA and they make it perfectly clear why.

And this comes down to my interpretation of your comment, but 'that is made to pass their standardized test' sounds more to me like 'that is the whole point of starting the DA', rather than 'a few students among the DA were in it to pass their tests'.

I also accidentally quoted this line: 'I'm sure some members cared more about their exams than Voldemort since at that point all they had was Harry's word backed up by Dumbledore.' which made it look like I was disagreeing with this. But for the record, that was a mistake and I'm not disagreeing with that part.
