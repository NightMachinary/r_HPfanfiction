No Death Eater died during the DoM battle or the Hogwarts raid. During the truce of the Battle of Hogwarts, the inner circle seems to be mostly alive as well.

Also considering that Voldemort ordered an uphill frontal assault on a fortified position, across several hundred yards of open ground nonetheless, shows that the defenders were not aiming to kill. The defenders wouldn't even need to aim, just throw area of effect curses in the general direction of the Death Eaters and you are almost guaranteed to hit something.
