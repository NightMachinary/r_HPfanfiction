  The twin core effect was a fluke on Harry's part. If anyone else tries that, they are dead.

I'm not saying Harry was right, I'm saying that the spell being useful for him was his reasoning for saying it was a useful spell and for teaching it to the DA. I explained it from Harry's point of view, not my own.

But personally, I do agree with Harry, regardless of the twin cores effect. A wand is a wizard's main weapon. Very few wizards are capable of deliberate wandless magic, and most Death Eaters are unlikely to be among those. That makes the disarming spell a very useful one.

  And in which context is stunning members of a fascist street fighting gang, which, in all honesty, is a bad SA ripoff, the better choice than killing them?

Again, I'm not talking about killing people in the terms of whether it is a good or bad choice. I'm saying that it's not consistent with the characters' personalities and decisions and the way the use of dark magic is viewed by those characters.

As for the stunning spell, there are several scenes in which the use of spell proves succesful. Luna stunning Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room for instance.

Again, personally I think incapacitating people is better than killing. I believe in a justice system that doesn't involve the death penalty, let alone people acting as judge and jury themselves. While it's understandable that in a war they make choices they wouldn't otherwise have, catching and prosecuting Death Eaters sounds better to me than killing them. But that is my personal opinion, as straight up murder being better is your personal opinion. Don't confuse your own opinion with those of the characters in the books.
