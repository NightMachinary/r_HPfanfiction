  And Hermione could nag Harry into agreeing.

I doubt it. Harry usually responds to Hermione's nagging (usually in this order) by 1 ignoring, 2 deceiving/avoiding, 3 as a last resort bursting out in anger. He finds her nagging annoying and turns away from it.

But yes, Hermione is usually the one who makes the more morally ambiguous decisions. Though the centaur thing is not confirmed, it's just the assumption people make on the real world myths on centaurs.

Also, this is just fantasy, but blaming the victims for the bad guys' actions is very harmful. I think I've had a discussion with you on guns in the wizarding world before and we're never going to agree on that. So I have no wish to start that endless discussion again. I get your view though.
