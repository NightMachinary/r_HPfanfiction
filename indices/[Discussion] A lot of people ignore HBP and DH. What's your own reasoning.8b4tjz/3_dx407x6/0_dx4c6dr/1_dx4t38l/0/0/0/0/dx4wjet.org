One of the biggest problems with the later books is that the "light" side tried to win a war with non-lethal weapons. As edgy as it usually is in fanfiction, they should have realised that the only thing they achieve that way is to increase their death toll. You win wars through superior firepower, tactics and most of all logistics. Holding the moral highground does nothing in that regard.
