I don't know if they did. Lupin makes a pretty good argument that the Order needs to kill. He chides Harry for disagreeing on this point.

I also assume the Order killed Death Eaters during the battle if we are to believe fifty are dead - however, based on this not being explicitly stated and JKR's math issues, this is more of an interpretation than something that can be proven.
