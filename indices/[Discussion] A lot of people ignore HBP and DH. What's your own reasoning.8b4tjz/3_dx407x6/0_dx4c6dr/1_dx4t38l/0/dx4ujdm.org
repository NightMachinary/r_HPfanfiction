Harry explains why he chooses to teach them the disarming spell, when Smith scoffs at it. And the stunning spell proves itself to be useful. As for things like Sectumsempra; that's dark magic. I find it unlikely that Harry would choose to learn and teach curses like that.

As for why the books only show quite a limited amount of spells and tend to use the same few several times, I don't know. They have learned a lot of spells that we don't know about, as they studied in school for 6 years and we only see a few classes. Just like we only see a few DA meetings. We don't see Harry really deliberately using dark magic until DH when they were desperate, or in anger, which is due to Harry's main character flaw; to act rashly out of anger. It doesn't seem very in character for him to deliberately teach other students dark magic.

And again in DH, Harry makes it clear that he doesn't like using stronger spells than those like stunning and disarming, when Lupin berates him for disarming Stan Shunpike. It's consistent in his character. Maybe you imagine 15 year olds in the ministry to be maiming and killing people left and right, but that doesn't fit with their characters. Even in GoF, Crouch Sr.'s decision to fight fire with fire was seen as very harsh and controversial. Moody was considered a great auror by at least Sirius for never stooping to the level of Death Eaters, never killing unless he really had to, and we're talking about an adult and an auror who is trained to do that. Even he doesn't like to go that far.

It is also explicitly mentioned several times that learning to defend themselves was the main reason they chose to start up the DA. If you want to scoff at me saying that, just look up the proof for yourself.
