So why were they learning disarming and stunning, and not let's say stuff like sectumsempra? Most of the Dark Arts seems like "1001 ways to kill people painfully", but a few of them seem like the superior choice for combat. And by the time the DE were broken out of Azkaban, people knew that stunners were pointless and it might very well come down to "them or us".
