Personnally, I don't like them because I felt that the bad guys were dumbed down to provide a feasible challenge to the good guys so that it doesn't look like a nundu vs a bowtruckle like it would have been if the power levels weren't changed.

Obviously the correct path would have been, IMO, to make the trio /good/ in a area of magic, or even a special perk like an animagus transformation. Anything, really, that made them something more than school dropouts that doesn't know more than the curriculum.

The pairings should have been different. If not at the Battle of Hogwarts than the Epilogue should not have H/G or not as a happy couple but as one that would stay together because of convenience. Hr/R I personally think they would have separated/divorced fairly quickly.

The inventivity of magic is missing, if at eleven they thought of levitating their enemy's weapon to beat him with it rather than just battering it with a spell, why don't they do the same thing later? Like, I don't know, transfigurating some tables into wolves when the snatchers arrives. Especially since IMO the TWT was in part to showcase what HP&co would be able to do by 17.

The ideologies: why is Voldemort and his followers fighting for besides ethnic cleansing? Why is Dumbledore? Shouldn't there be disagreements within both parties? As in: "the Dark Lord is wrong, it's not a parentage issue, it's a culture issue, that is why we should kill the parent's of muggleborn when they are babies and raise them in proper society" or "the Death Eaters are way too extreme but it is fascinating how they do not bar werewolves from leadership position".

Of course, I would have preferred more exposure of my house, Ravenclaw (along with a pairing HP/LL but that's another debate altogether).

And finally (for now at least) would be that there are too many Deus Ex Machina and incoherences in the magic. I usually don't mind a Deus Ex Machina or two but I like to have a Chekhov Gun to go with it.

*EDIT*: sorry, forgot about this:

Why is the Jesus/martyr imagery is so pregnant? Especially when it could have been less shoved down our throats easily.
