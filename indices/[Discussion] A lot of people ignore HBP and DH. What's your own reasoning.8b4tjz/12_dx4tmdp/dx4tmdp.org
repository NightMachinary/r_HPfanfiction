Most of the books fault were that they were written in Harry's POV, at Hogwarts or out camping, cut off from the rest of the world, where all the interesting stuff happened, and not only that...

I mean, Harry mastered apparition, something that the author only saw fit to mention as barely an afterthought. And come on, why wouldn't Hermione, or even Ron think that Malfoy was up to something? And Albus Severus Potter. You'd think Ginny would have had a thing or two to say about that middle name, having suffered under Snape's regime at Hogwarts...
