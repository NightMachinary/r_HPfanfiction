I liked the implied promise of OotP abouy Harry becoming more independent and making his own way. Most indie!Harry fics sadly take that way over the top, but JKR took the story in the exact opposite direction and made Harry more into a puppet than I could have ever imagined.

The themes in HBP and DH are somewhat interesting too, but not at all what I would have liked.

On top of that there's a huge amount of very specific issues I have with things that happen in those books:

Hermione acting like a thot and getting mad over Harry doing good in potions; the non-romance between Ginny and Harry, killing off Hedwig, saying that a totally non-compatible and awful couple like Ron/Hermione is good to impressionable children and teenagers, shitty camping trips, Ron being a deserter again and welcomed back with open arms again, awful plot contrivances (very convenient timing for coming back there Ron), the "plan" to defeat Voldemort is utter shit, implying that being on the side of Dumbledore somehow redeems Snape, imitating Parseltongue by making hissing noises, Molly killing Bellatrix (yeah yeah I get it HP is about protection not revenge, but if Molly-Wobbles is such an awesome duelist maybe make use of those skills earlier? Totally should have been Hermione/Neville/Harry), a stupidly convoluted plot introducing new wand-loyalties and weird blood magic protection mechanics so that Harry can survive, Harry naming any of his children Albus Severus...

Book 1-5 have their flaws too, but I could never just write such a huge list off the top of my head for any of them. Also I can totally ignore some flaws when the pay-off is good enough. In HBP and DH the pay-off is awful. "All was well" still sounds more like a taunt to me than anything else.
