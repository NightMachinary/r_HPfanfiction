From a romance point of view, HBP is around the point where characters start to come of age. They're also still in school, so student/teacher ships and DA/Jnr-Death-Eater ships are also still an option. Because of changes made by the fanfiction author to the HBP plot, the DH plot must often be modified or disregarded to fit with these changes.
