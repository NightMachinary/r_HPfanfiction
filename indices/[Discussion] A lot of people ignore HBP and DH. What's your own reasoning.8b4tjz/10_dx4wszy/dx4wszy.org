A lot of good points have already been made here so I won't repeat them. However, I wanted to slap Harry around in Half-Blood Prince. His character was so bloody infuriating and quite honestly, I can't even tell you why. To me, he just was and grew increasingly unlikeable as the book progressed. I know he hates the titles he's been given in his life, like /The Chosen One/, but in Half-Blood Prince, it's like he uses this whenever he sees fit. He becomes a hypocrite, really.

As for The Deathly Hallows, much of how the story unfolded was utter rubbish. More in like it wasn't plausible by any sense of those who had functioning brains. I mean, come on, would it have killed Dumbledore (and by extension, Harry, Ron, and Hermione) to tell other trustworthy members of the Order about Horcruxes? That's something that I never understood. I think Lupin could've been a real asset on that hunt. And again, Harry acts like a little prissy brat in the book. I mean, people complain about Ron leaving Harry and Hermione but if you look at it from his point of view, it makes one wonder how he stayed that long with them (namely Harry) and why on earth he decided to return.
