You forgot to mention the immediate post-DH fic that has been written a million times and reads the same every single time. Would a modicum of originality be too much to ask for?

Anyway, I've got a few recs for you:

- St Margarets's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=4384&chapter=all][Magic Within, Magic Without]] is an excellently written summer romance. I absolutely adore the setting of the fic at Ginny's great aunt's house. There's a magical feel about that place, like the first time we were shown Diagon Alley and Hogwarts in the main books. My only complaint is that Ginny is slightly OOC, but this is still my favorite romance in the fandom.

- linkffn(The Children's Crusade by theelderwand1). Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione travel to another dimension to kill Voldemort. Sequel to linkffn(Stop All the Clocks by theelderwand1) which you have to read first.

- linkffn(Failsafe by Hannanora Potter). Post DH HP/LotR crossover.

- linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Goblet of Fire). Ginny participates in the Tri Wizard Tournament held at Beauxbatons the year after the war.

- linkffn(Epithalamium by Northumbrian). One of the very few pure fluff fics I like.

- linkao3(your losses or your arrears by irnan). Ginny tries her hand at investigative journalism. There are other fics in this series that are pretty good too.

- [[http://pocketfullof.livejournal.com/229285.html][The Grown Up Driver]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1181280][Compromise: A Love Story]] are two of the best canon-compliant post war oneshots that exist.

- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is my favorite fic in the fandom (one of the two anyway), but it is partly set at Hogwarts and romance is far from the main aspect of the story. Most of the story is outside of Hogwarts though, and it has some of the best characterizations ever.
