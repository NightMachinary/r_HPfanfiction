#+begin_quote
  When Ginny was little, she was surrounded by the love of her big family, some by blood, some not. On a Halloween night, it was all lost. Years later, the family she thought she lost becomes the family she found. AU Harry loses his parents when he is eight years old, not one. Major character deaths.
