EDIT: Note that some of these aren't on FanFiction.net, so the bot isn't going to see them all.

Somebody PM'd me a while back asking for something slightly similar... I'm pressed for time here so I can't go through and filter the ones of these that don't fit your specifications, but I'm pretty sure 85% of them do, so, enjoy! (I literally copy-pasted the PM, so if some of the language seems odd, it's bc I was replying):

  - If you haven't read anything from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum][pottermum]], definitely take a look at her list of stories. Many of them (seriously, like, a /ton/ of them) fall into some combination of post-hogwarts; H/G never met; etc etc. She writes some really great stuff, and most of her stories tend to be a good length for passing 2-3 hours if you read rather quickly, though she does have a couple long ones which are just as good.
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1816754/sbmcneil][sbmcneil]] has a story called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4936039/1/Remember][Remember]] which, while not post-hogwarts, is definitely in the H/G "never met" category (as you might guess, they did technically meet, but cannot remember ;) ha). She also wrote one (for an SIYE challenge I believe!) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10869280/1/Love-Me-Not][Love Me Not]] which fits the bill. Really, most all of her stories are great imo, and she does still update every now and again, which is awesome, so if you like her writing, don't hesitate to read her other stories, even the incomplete ones!
  - st122's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7768541/1/A-Cannon-s-Harpy][A Canon's Harpy]] is another favorite of mine, and is particularly enjoyable even if you don't care about quidditch, so don't worry about that. Also from them, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7103775/1/Summer-s-Breeze][Summer's Breeze]], which is short and sweet.
  - SarahC20's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9914577/1/A-story-of-Love][A story of Love]]...it's just in my fav list on FFN, reading the summary makes me want to re-read it, and it fits haha
  - thebackupkid's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9702836/1/The-Thing-He-Didn-t-Realise-He-Was-Looking-For][The Thing He Didn't Realise He Was Looking For]], another one that I remember and need to re-read. It's a bit grittier, which you can probably guess from the summary, but I remember it being great
  - slincoln's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10721707/1/When-You-Wasn-t-Famous][When you wasn't famous]] is another quidditch one, different from A Canon's Harpy, and not as good imo, but still worth a mention for sure
  - jojor99's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7630045/1/A-Set-Up-Gone-Wrong][A Set Up Gone Wrong]] is excellent.
  - TheLastZion's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Marauders]], gosh what can I say about this one. It's certainly not post-hogwarts, but it is very much H/G-never-met-but-fall-hard-when-they-do territory. It's definitely a super!harry story, but I still highly recommend it even if that's not your usual cup of tea, because while it's definitely super!harry, there are so many other characters who are super! that it's not too unbalanced. Well...unless you're the bad guys that is...or some other characters haha ;) Seriously, at times you might think "is this a crack fic?", but it totally isn't, because all of the plot points do actually make sense within the story... I could honestly keep rambling, but just read it, it's an experience, not something which can be summed up lol. You won't regret it. Do it...doooo iiittt.
  - Trinka's [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=3685][Reality Bites]] is super AU, which is likely quite obvious by its summary. Admittedly, it might also sound rather dull. But the ending is very rewarding, just... perhaps read this one when you have a bit more patience for /sloooow/ build.
  - DragonHeartString's [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129851][Seeing Double]]...tbh, I don't remember much about this one, but it does sound like it might fit?
  - You said you've read on SIYE, so perhaps you've seen Pilargirl's [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129299][The Commoner Queen]], since its last chapter was uploaded a couple weeks ago. If not, it's good, read it!
  - Ohhh yes, Count Westwest's [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty]] is very very good indeed.

And then I sent a followup email once I realized decided that I wanted to list out some specific pottermum stories since she has so many, so here's the exact copy of that PM as well:

#+begin_quote
  I honestly forgot /just how many/ stories pottermum has lol. Let me save you some time browsing through her page (though you still should! there are some great H/G fics she wrote that aren't on this list!):

  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10985124/1/Daughters-of-Heroes][Daughters of Heroes]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11041352/1/Family-lost-Family-found][Family lost, Family found]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11103258/1/Healer-of-his-Heart][Healer of His Heart]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11262376/1/Serendipity][Serendipity]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11299554/1/Living-for-the-Moment][Living for the Moment]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11423633/1/Married-in-Haste][Married in Haste]]
  - Annnndd last but not least, her most recent one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11567591/1/It-s-Complicated][It's Complicated]] (NSFW for SURE, but the back half of the story isn't as smutty as the front half. It's just a great smut-fluff story.)
