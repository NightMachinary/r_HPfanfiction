Wow, that's a lot of fanfics!

I know a couple of them already (just finished re-reading Remember), but I'm afraid you didn't quite understand my request.

I simply wanted a fic where the main setting isn't Hogwarts. And I really don't like fics where Harry or Ginny disappears for x amount of years, and then returns, and a whole heap of angst and heartbreak happens before they finally get together. So a lot of these fics are not that attractive to me. Could it be that you intended to post this on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/43sfnj/help_finding_au_hg_story/][this very similar thread from earlier yesterday]], but mixed it up a bit by accident?

I'm sorry :( you've put a lot of work into this post and here I am, telling you what isn't good about it. Still, thank you for the collection of stories. I really appreciate the work you've put into it! I always love these kinds of long comments with endless lists of fanfics.
