Well, there is linkffn(Lord of Caer Azkaban) not that that's really all that great, but it does exist and it's mostly grammatically correct. I guess it's readable.

Edit: That's the wrong Harry in Azkaban story. Oops. *pokes through already read fics...*

There it is! /Earl of the North/ by Lord Silvere. Linked farther below, since I swapped the title of those two different stories in my head. Been six months or more since I read them, small wonder.
