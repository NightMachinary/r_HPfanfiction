[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man who Lived]] has got to be one of my absolute favourite Draco fics. Amazing. A believable redemption fic. 253k words. Complete. And the writing is good enough to be a published novel, in my opinion. I read it ages ago and still find myself thinking about it every now and then.
