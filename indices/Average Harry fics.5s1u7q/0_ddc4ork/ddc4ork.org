Harry isn't an average wizard in cannon, he's actually above average, he just doesn't apply himself. His OWL scores(and the fact that he could take on death eaters when he was 15) are testament to his intelligence/talent considering all the crap he went through that year:

- Umbridge detentions(Torture).
- Vilified/shunned by a lot of people in the wizarding world.
- Snape's 'occlumency' lessons that turned into another chance for Snape to screw with Harry.
- His connection to Voldemort which caused him to have mood swings, lack of sleep, head ache's, pain in his scar etc etc.
- PTSD from Cedric's murder.
- The fact that theres a war brewing and he is at the centre of it.

Yet he still managed to do relatively well in his owls.

There aren't many fics where Harry is an average wizard because it's fan fiction and no-one really wants to see an average protagonist. Usually authors change one thing pre-hogwarts and that sets off a butterfly effect which see's Harry apply himself ultimately leading to him reaching his potential.

linkffn(Forging the Sword) is probably the best in terms of keeping Harry closest to his cannon counterpart in terms of magical potential.
