Did you actually read the list? Harry had a lot more to worry about that just Umbridge.That's the thing though, Ron, Neville, Hermione, Ginny and Luna are all above average or have the potential to be above average too.

- Ron was lazy but when he applied himself he was actually a really good wizard(not on the level of Harry and Hermione but certainly better that the average wizard).
- Neville had a lack of confidence but after he joined the DA he started improving in leaps and bounds.
- Hermione is pretty obvious.
- Ginny has always been described as being talented.
- Luna is a Ravenclaw, the house of intelligence.

Oh I get it, I only read super!Harry or unique!Harry pics as a guilty pleasure. I am of the opinion that Harry doesn't need any special ability he just needs to apply himself more. The problem is there aren't many good fics out there there that keep Harry closer to canon because it would effectively be a canon rehash.

Have you read:

It's a dark lord Harry fic where he doesn't stray from cannon to much in terms of power and intelligence.
