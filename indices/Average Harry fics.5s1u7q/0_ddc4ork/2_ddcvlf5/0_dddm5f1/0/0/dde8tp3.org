Nah, I'm not talking about their age group but rather wizards in general. The ministry 6 were taking down people that were supposed to be feared in the wizarding world and that is them as self taught in defence, could you imagine if they had proper training? Also in a post Voldemort world where things changed, Harry ended up becoming the youngest head Auror in history, Hermione became the MOM, Neville became a professor, Ginny a Quidditch star Luna a renowned magizooligist and Ron is running a successful business with his brother.

Yeah, I really didn't mind either way with the shipping so I thoroughly enjoyed it.
