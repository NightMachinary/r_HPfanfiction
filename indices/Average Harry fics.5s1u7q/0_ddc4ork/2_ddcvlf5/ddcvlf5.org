I don't see any evidence that Harry was above average in power or intelligence, most of his friends fought Death Eaters at 15 as well, and Ron got similar OWL scores. And if we don't count his OWL's because of Umbridge and Harry worrying about Hagrid, there's more than one book to look at. He was very good at D.A.T.D.A., and flying, but he was not above average in most other subjects.

I think that was one of the things I really liked about Harry though, he was not born with any special powers or abilities (for a wizard, that is). He was a regular boy who happened to be the boy who lived. I liked that his "special power" ended up being something as normal as love. I liked that Harry needed help from his friends to succeed because he wasn't good at everything.

Anyways, even if we go by the idea that Harry was above average compared to his fellow students, that's not really what I meant. The fics I'm talking about, I guess the Indy!Powerful!Harry fics, makes him the superior of everyone around him. It makes him so powerful that he uses non-verbal wandless magic, sometimes without training, becomes an animagus overnight, beats Hermione in all the classes, is the descendant of all the founders, is so nice to goblins that they remove the horcrux from him without him having to die etc...
