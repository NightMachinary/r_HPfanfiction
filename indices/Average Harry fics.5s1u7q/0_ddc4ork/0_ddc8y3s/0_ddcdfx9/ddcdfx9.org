I have always been of the opinion that innate power is not actually a thing in Potter-Verse, and there is a lot of canonic evidence to support it, despite the fandoms apperantly need to nerf magic for logic reasons. I have always viewed magic as being done when you concentrate and hold a spell in your mind. Sure, doing it over and over could be mentally exhuasting, but no more so than taking the SATs. Harry is the Dark Lord's Equal, in that he has an almost ridiculously good intuitive sense of spells. He cast a Patronus repelling a hundred Dementors in his Third Year, was able to learn and master multiple spells for the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and successfully cast two of the three Unforgivables. Magical knowledge and understanding of spells is what constitutes "power", so if Harry did start studying magic deeply similar to Voldemort, he could easily have gotten to his level. Obviously this all leads to silly tropes like Harry studying 48/7 with a time Turner, but it can and has been done well.
