Wouldn't he being 13 and casting a spell that not even trained professionals could cast be enough to show that there is innate power in the Potter-verse? Or what about Snape casting curses even before his Hogwarts days, when it's practically confirmed that children cannot cast certain spells do to age difference (Moody in GOF and the fact that we never see 13 and 14 y/os cast Avada). I don't know about the intuitive sense of spells, he apparently studied night in day in order to master the Expelliarmus and Summoning charms, respectively.
