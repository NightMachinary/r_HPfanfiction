Not if it has to do with understanding. After all, if it was a pure power requirement, he could not have taught it to numerous others in the D.A. who were also fairly young.

The Unforgivables actually support the theory. They are directly powered by the intent to torture, enslave, or murder. It can very easily be argued that a bunch of 14 year olds simply didn't have what it takes to understand the Avada in its entirety, and still have the intent to murder someone in cold blood. Tom Riddle did, and the emotional requirement can be chalked up to some form of mental illness on his part. I am not a psychologist, but I am pretty sure Riddle is just about a text-book sociopath.

Snape casting dark spells before Hogwarts because he was powerful makes less sense than him being able to cast them because he understood them. Although definitely an above average wizard, he has never been said to be on par with Voldemort. Voldemort himself would serve as a better example for your power argument, demonstrating controlled accidental magic, but that can be explained away as Riddle understanding that something was happening, and figuring out how to do it again.

Your last point, is hard to debate. Perhaps it was an example of Rowling being inconsistent. Perhaps something else. But I will point out that every charm that Harry took the time to buckle down and learn that way, he has mastered, with the notable exception of Occlumency, which is rather debatable in itself. And when I say mastered, I mean Harry is able to cast from his seemingly limited repotoire, almost perfectly every time, consistently above the average wizard. Stunners, Stupefy, Protego, Patronus, Impedimenta, Incarcerous etc. All those spells, Harry is pretty much Auror grade with, not just in power, but in quality and reliability.
