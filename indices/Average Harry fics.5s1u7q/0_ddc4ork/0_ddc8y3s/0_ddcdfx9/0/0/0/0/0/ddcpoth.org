I'm not saying that you don't need emotion, but that's hardly all you need. Righteous anger/vengeance felt like a cop out, considering the fact that you could use a plethora of different 'states of happiness' for the Patronus. I feel like, once again, JKR was trying to make him more human, him having a weakness, in being unable to cast a spell that is considered one of the 'three great curses' (I think it's a pretty dumb concept just to have three spells lying around that have that much power with no drawbacks, such as extreme magical drain).

You really think I have a good point with the magic system? Because I had this other idea, where your imagination plays a great amount into how your charm is done. Think about how Harry managed to shield the people around the great hall from interfering in his battle with Voldemort, with a simple Protego. I think this happens because of how you want the charm to be done. That is why we get so many different interpretations of Incendio and Agumenti (creating localised fire/water, shooting a stream/jet of fire/water, even creating an arc of fire ala Dark Souls). Although the power of charms cannot be changed with imagination, only with how much power you put into it. That is why there are so many different uses of elements in combat without charms because it's a waste of magic when you have inherently powerful fire spells like FiendFyre. And that also plays into the whole "Jack of All trades" shield spell thing, it can be changed around for need, but it isn't the most powerful in any fields.
