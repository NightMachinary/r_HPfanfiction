I'm not saying that understanding a spell doesn't increase your ability to master it, but that isn't all there is. Lupin said multiple times that there were people who completely understood the mechanics, could do everything right, yet couldn't summon one. Not to mention the fact that it is said to show that a wizard has great power. The DA cast mere phantoms of what Harry cast, he stated himself that they were unlikely to hold of any Dementors in a real fight (disregarding The Battle Of Hogwarts, because that whole thing was a definite inconsistency).

I don't know, 14-year-olds can be pretty vicious, not all of them are the same. Moody/Barty was pretty confident that none of them could cast it. Another spell that possibly supports the power theory is Protego itself, it is said to be a minor shield in the grand scheme of things, and considering the fact that there is a nigh-infinite amount of spells in the magical world, why didn't Harry just learn a new shield spell? Instead, he was capable of blocking most high-level hexes and curses when he propped it up. Personally, I think it's another hole in Rowling's magic system (it's like swiss cheese darn it!) I like to chalk it up to the fact that she didn't create this book with magic in mind, sure she created spells with a lot of thought put into them, and a lot of background researching etc... But she never explained the more intricate details of magic. How it felt to cast a spell, for example. Or how about the fact that most transfiguration spells are way too specific? And instead, should be set into a couple categories with one incantation for each category (IE: Transfigurus, Conjurus etc...)
