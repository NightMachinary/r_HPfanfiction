One could still blame them for not having the requisite emotional requirements and happy memory, but that topic is at the point of quibbling at semantics.

The issue I have with the fandom interpretations of the Unforgivables, is that they don't take it seriously, or ignore it for the sake of Edgelord McMurderface Harry. I would like to have a couple very pointed conversations with whoever thought that the Cruciatus was invented as a defibrillator. The Unforgivables are thus named because you have to have absolute intent. You can't cast them on accident, or even with righteous anger/vengeance as Harry finds out. You have to deliberately want someone to feel pain and suffer, deliberately want to enslave another human with full control over them, or deliberately want them to die, and to believe that they deserve to die. If we are to look at the muggle world, we can use school shooters as our odds of having children capable of murder. [[https://www.decodedscience.org/risks-school-shooting-versus-airplane-crash/40830]] this website takes a look at the odds, and estimates that there are .02 incidents of school shootings per 100,000 school hours. Also keep in mind that the population of Hogwarts is much lower than standerd schools, which also messes with the data. But it is possible.

You have an interesting point with the magic system. My personal opinion is that Protego is simply a good all around shield. Jack of all trades, master of none, and all that sort of thing. Whereas other shields would be more specialized towards the spells to be used with, and with potential drawbacks.
