I am of the opposite opinion.

I think that Dumbledore didn't want to be a mentor to Harry because he didn't want to get attached to him knowing he would have to die because of the horcrux in his scar. He thought that if he got attached he would hesitate to do what needed to be done to defeat Voldemort. Dumbledore needed to look out for the good of the wizarding world and getting attached would have hindered him. Harry was nothing like James tbh, from everything we saw in terms of temperament he was like Lily, the only thing's he didn't get from her was her work ethic and social skills. Although I think if Harry had grown up with a more nurturing family he would have been far more like Lily but with James' confidence. The Dursleys really screwed him over in that regard.
