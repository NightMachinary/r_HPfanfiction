I don't really know, I always thought that in what little of Harry we see, dialogue wise, he was James. In the Lily sense, you could say that that's where he got his skill in charms, but from most of the dialogue between Harry and Sirius in POA-OOTP, they seemed to be very similar in a lot of ways. To the point where Sirius would just follow as Harry led on (Department of Mysteries being the prime example). In his social skills, I definitely agree that he got James, as James always looked at the bright side no matter what, Lily instantaneously (from the looks of it) cut-out Severus as soon as he called her a mudblood. It seems that she didn't have the patience for touch and go with friends as Harry did (GOF, DH being the prime examples).

But Dumbledore is highly a coin toss, I'm sure there were ways to extract the Horcrux other than killing it (after all, if Nagini died of old age, would his soul forcibly eject from her or would it still be the remains of the snake? Could he transfer it to another vessel?) Of course, this is assuming (as JK Rowling did) that the Horcrux was fully created, but the 'nasty ritual' was circumvented somehow. But let's be honest for one second, why else would Dumbledore send Harry to the Dursley's? The story could have been just as good, if not better if it was a well-cared for Harry discovering that he was a wizard with a muggle family, or already being in-tuned with the wizarding world and just introducing us and learning his destiny. I'm sure that 'blood connection' wasn't the only reason Harry was put there. I feel that a protection like that is a bit overkill for just hiding Harry, an over-powered notice-me-not cast on him when Lily and James died could have achieved the same effect.
