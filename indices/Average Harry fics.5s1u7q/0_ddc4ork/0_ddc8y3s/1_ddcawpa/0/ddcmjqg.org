I agree with the top point, although I think it has a deeper meaning than simply "keeping simple". I think Rowling really disliked the fact that Harry could possibly not win on luck and chance, and instead outpower Voldemort. So she gave him an Achilles heel in the second book, just to make sure that he wouldn't get too far when it came to magical education. That Achilles heel was definitely the Disarming Charm. I agree with that last point, and I'm deeply saddened that we have yet to get a comprehensive Dumbledore mentor fic, although, it would admittedly require a huge amount of world-building talent. I think that the reason Dumbledore thought Harry was not going to survive is simple, he didn't trust that Harry would even with training. When Harry first appeared in his first and second year, he was very unlike Dumbledore, the happy-go-lucky, cast every spell on first try prodigy. He saw too much James, too much personal attachment, and he knew that that would kill Harry as it did James. That was his main reasoning for putting Harry with the Dursleys in the first place IMO, he wanted Harry to become like him, introverted, content, uncaring of what others think. When he either heard or understood that Harry pleaded with the sorting hat for a house change, simply because he wanted to honour the legacy of dead parents, Dumbledore knew that hope was lost in training Harry.

Maybe his faith was mildly restored when he heard Harry was capable of fighting off hundreds of Dementors, but he didn't see it happen first-hand, so he wouldn't know if it was an exaggeration or not, but once again, that magic just further shows that Harry had too much personal attachment to everything, that he was willing to die for his friends rather than win and have his friends die.
