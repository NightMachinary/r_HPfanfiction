I actually think he knew a lot of spells but always kept it simple when duelling, I'm pretty sure Hermione pushed him to learn a fair few spells in 5th, 6th and 7th year. He would have also learnt a fair few during the quad-wizard tournament in 4th year. I think a big reason Dumbledore didn't give Harry personal training/instruction is because he didn't think Harry would survive. I really found it disappointing that we didn't get to see Dumbledore as proper mentor to Harry, it would have been amazing to see all the kinds of magic Dumbledore knew.
