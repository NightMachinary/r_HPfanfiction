Yeah, never understood why people thought canon Harry was average in power or magical ability. Although, in canon, it was never touched upon why Harry never attempted to further his magical knowledge of spells, or even take up Duelling, as he seemed to enjoy it whenever he did it (practised disarming on others in the second year, simply because he wanted to, and I believe that it was either Hermione or Sirius that gave him Curses and Countercurses, showing that most people know about his love of battle magic). I'm surprised he didn't get a wand of Ebony.
