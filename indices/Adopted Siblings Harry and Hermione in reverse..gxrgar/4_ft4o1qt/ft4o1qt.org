I liked it, this is a nice setup of the story (certainly not worse that the reverse ones like linkffn(One World by Stellar Magic) and linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel)), but the question remains what kind of plot the author builds on the top of this setup (as it was with the mentioned reverse stories).
