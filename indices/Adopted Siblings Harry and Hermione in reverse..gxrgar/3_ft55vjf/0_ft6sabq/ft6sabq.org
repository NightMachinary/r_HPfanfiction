Eeeeh not exactly. While the stereotypical orphanages were pretty much closed down by the 80s, group homes for children do still exist and definitely existed back then. They're different than the old style orphanages, for sure, but it's not out of the realm of possibility for Hermione to be in one - especially as many of them are specifically for children with "issues" and I'm pretty sure accidental magic would end up counting as a qualified issue to weirded out social workwrs.
