FYI Orphanages in England wouldn't exist in the 1980s. She'd likely be raised by grandparents or relatives and barring that she would be quickly adopted likely by whatever foster family she would have been placed with.

I think a more likely narrative would be the foster parents try to rehome her after she uses accidental magic, the ministry picks up on it to keep the statute of secrecy and a magical foster family is found to take her in, the Potters.
