The following is from her tumblr. Yes, she says it's not abandoned and I know it's been years since her last update, but I am so very very dependent on this book and clutching at straws is my final hope :)

I've been.... around.

I am alive and well, super busy with the whole working fifty hours a week thing, but still around. And sort of hiding from my inbox because I am a coward.

TLAT is on hiatus--not abandoned because I still plan on working on it in the future, but I've been working on some other writing projects and those sort of have my attention at the moment. I'm sorry I haven't been more communicative!
