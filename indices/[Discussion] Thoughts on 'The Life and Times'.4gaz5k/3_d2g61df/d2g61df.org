It's not over. The author claims she hasn't abandoned it and says that the next chapter is in the works, but it's been over two years since the last update so... I think it's abandoned.

Which is a shame because it's one of the few fics that is really really good despite being tropey. Although I've heard it's also the one that started a lot of the tropes.
