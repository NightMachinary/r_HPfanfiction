Well, it's part of the Dangerverse /well/ towards the end, but you'd have to read a lot to get there. Several books full of stories.

Link to first story of that lot: linkffn(Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow)

If I remember right there is slso some Peter-redemption in the "Truths" universe by Neurotica. But again it takes some time to get there, snd I don't think it was complete redemption.

Link to the first one of that series: linkffn(Truths by Neutotica).

I am now also curious if there are any stories that make his redemption a central part.
