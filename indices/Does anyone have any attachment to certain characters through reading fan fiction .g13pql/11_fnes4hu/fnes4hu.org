I grew extremely fond of Regulus Black, Severus and Sirius. I know the first two of them are weird but I sympathize with them and feel like I understand them.

I am in love with the relationship between Regulus and his house elf and some of the fics where the tense relationship between the brothers clear up though I have never found stories like that, that has an affectionate relationship between them.
