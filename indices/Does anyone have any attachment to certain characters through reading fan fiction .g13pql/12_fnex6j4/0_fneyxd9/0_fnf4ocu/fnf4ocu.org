No, actually. I rarely ever see Neville as the focus, the only time I do is when he replaces Harry as the BWL, and fics like that make him feel more like a replacement instead of his own character. I don't care to know what he could've and couldn't have done in Harry's place, I'd want to see what he does as simply Neville Longbottom. :(

After all, his whole character is being brave despite no one expecting him to, not even himself. Timid Gryffindor beong brave for his friends and all that.
