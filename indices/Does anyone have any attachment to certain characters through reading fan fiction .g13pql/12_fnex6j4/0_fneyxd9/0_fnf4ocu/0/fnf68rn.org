Yeah I see a lot of those :/ I'm not a huge fan of that either. I think Neville's character is so wonderful in his quiet bravery - like he did things even in his first year that was brave like trying to warn the trio of Draco's plans to get them in trouble. I wish there were more fics with him where they didn't change him :( like you can just grow off what you know about him and develop him that's great, but why change everything ??

I write a Neville fic and the lack of Neville fics really fueled me to want to write one. I still look for them to read. We need more Neville fics !
