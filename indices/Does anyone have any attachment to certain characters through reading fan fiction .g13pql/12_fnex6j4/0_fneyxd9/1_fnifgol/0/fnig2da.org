He totally would make a good husband. Patient, loyal, calm, slow to anger quick to forgive, honest and always about doing the right thing. A bit shy and unsure of himself but give him the right girl to push him a bit I think he's a solid guy. Not to mention I imagine Neville wanting a very quiet calm life after the war and who wouldn't want a peaceful household with a pretty garden!
