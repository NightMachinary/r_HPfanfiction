There's a particular species of Mugglewank fic which we might call "Muggle cultural victory via liberal values" where the author rants a lot about how backwards the wizarding world is in comparison to Muggle society. These stories always feature a scene where Hermione wears a bikini and all the wizards are scanadalised by how much skin she is showing, and thereafter you can tell whether a character is good or evil depending on whether they are comfortable with revealing clothing (shares Muggle values therefore good) or not (socially conservative therefore evil).

Glossed over is the fact that liberal values are far from universal in the Muggle world. Also glossed over is the fact that Hermione likely falls somewhere towards the moderately conservative end of the scale of Muggle values.
