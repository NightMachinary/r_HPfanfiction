I have the opposite situation. I don't think there's any character where I feel like their fanon portrayal has improved upon their canon depiction. On the other hand, there are plenty of characters I liked in canon but whose typical characterisation in fanon has started to negatively affect my feeling towards that character:

- Hermione (Super!Hermione, Mugglewank Hermione, swimsuit Hermione, etc.)

- Ginny (Most often a vehicle for saccharine fluff and the propagation of traditional gender stereotypes and relationship cliches.)

- Fleur (All the Veela stuff.)

- Sirius (In PoA he was menacing, had a dark side, and was powerful enough to scare even Dumbledore. In fanon he is a womanising man child.)

- Snape (Snape fangirls have destroyed his character.)
