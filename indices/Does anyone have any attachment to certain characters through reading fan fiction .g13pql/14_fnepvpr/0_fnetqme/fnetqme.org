This is true 99% of the time, but there are a handful of authors out there that take these characters, especially Ginny and Fleur (though never in a Harry/Fleur), and flesh them out well beyond their book characterizations.

Probably the most obvious example is Annerb's Ginny, who isn't quite canon but is extremely well done and bucks the traditional relationship stereotype far more than canon Ginny. And I say this as someone who likes canon Ginny.
