Yeah I know exactly what you mean, the lack of information on them is what interests me though like I like to make up in my head what happened and I definetly find it exciting. I do find it depressing because all of their lives are so tragic! The people who lived throughout the first Wizarding war really have all had such horrific lives , however, I do enjoy an angsty story! Personally, I'm not a massive fan of Snape and lily, I so respect Snape in the end but in the fanfic I read he always is so annoying in them! I feel awful for adult Snape though, one of the saddest storylines there is:(((
