It's been a long time since I read Harry Potter so my memory of characters outside of the golden trio is like very distant. Recently I read a marauder's era fanfic and I used to avoid reading this era because of the limited information in the actual book and how bad some writers write the story. This recent one started out innocent but by the time I finished it, I was really sad that Harry was denied the happy family he could have. Like almost everyone died. Two characters stood out to me, Snape and Lily. I liked their friendship and was very sorry to see it break apart due to the circumstance.
