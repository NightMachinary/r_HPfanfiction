Ooof. I just stumbled upon this post and saw my giant letter answer from a while ago- wow.

A couple of months later, having read a lot more fanfic, I have a reply that answers your question instead of random bullshit- Sirius, Lily and Peter. 

(Before I talk about why these specific characters, I'd like to mention that my growing interest in these characters is not solely because of fanfiction and there are other factors. I think a big part of me loving Sirius, for example, is because of the kind of home he came from and how his circumstances were much like the ones I grew up around, albeit way more fucked up.) 

​

1. When I started reading fanfic, I didn't have much of an opinion on Sirius Black. I thought, as a decent chunk of the fandom still does that he was a bully and an asshole, and that was that (he was a bully and an asshole, but that was not it). The second time I read the books, after discovering Sirius!Centric fanfiction, I paid way more attention to his character- I genuinely kept a piece of paper beside me while reading the Sirius-heavy scenes to take down notes (I was going through an annotation phase, okay?). As I got more and more swept up in his character, I started reading more fanfiction about him and got particularly interested in his childhood (which, to this day, I find fascinating). My Young!Sirius headcanons, informed by multiple fics, have coloured my perception of Sirius as an adult, but this version of Sirius is still Canon!Sirius (I didn't take anything away), just with a more rich backstory, explaining how he became the person he was by OotP.                                         
2. Now, Lily. Lily is much more of a blank slate than Sirius, so to clearly define her, I had to read the two pages of Snape's Worst Memory over and over. Eventually, I was able to separate her from the Hermione 2.0 (or would Hermione be the 2.0?) that the fandom has created, and realise that in the few scenes we have, Lily was kind, a bit naive, brave, care-free, and somewhat righteous (or at least that's what I picked up on). My view of Lily became way more elaborate through fanfiction, and I was able to see her as more than the perfect mother I had in my head. And I got into Lily!Centric fics through Sirius-Lily friendship fics, funnily enough, so I suppose that was another way that my interest in the character developed through non-Canon materials. 
3. And finally, Peter. Let me admit- I was already interested in Peter before I got into fanfic, but not quite to the extent that I am today. The thing that got me into Peter the first time is that he must have been a likeable person at one time, right? He may not have been King Charisma, but there had to be something to keep his friends from abandoning him. And he had to have had some relationships with the Marauders. Loads of fics ignore this, but the ones that acknowledged it drew me into his character, and now, the story of Peter's betrayal is one of my favourite arcs in the entire series.

​

{Sidenote: I'm surprised how many fics completely ignore Peter as part of the Marauders and stick to Remus, Sirius and James. I understand that betrayal is hard and painful to write, but if Peter isn't part of the Marauders, then you aren't writing a Canon Compliant story, but an AU (not that there's anything wrong with that- most of my fics are AU's)}

Having said this, I have also experienced the opposite. I think fanfiction ruined somewhat Hermione and Harry for me (with the constant tropes)- with characters who I already knew, it was easier because I was able to ignore the tropes (I knew where to look), but with the Golden Trio, it's just shoved in your face. Luckily, I avoid bashing, so my precious Ron has stayed whole. Let's hope it stays that way.

In the end, I would like to go back to my original answer (April 2020)- fan fiction is something that flourishes because of ambiguity in writing. Luckily for us (though maybe not so much for her), while writing Harry Potter, JKR had issues writing clear backstories and fully developing most of her characters. There were also plenty of background characters, which gives the fanfiction community a lot to build on top and leaves things up to the imagination of the average reader, too. Her characters are perfect for writing fanfiction about because there is enough ambiguity for your interpretation and headcanons to add something to them, without revamping them. My Sirius, Lily and Peter headcanons do not contradict source materials, but they make the characters mine which makes them all the more interesting.
