For me it was Ginny in Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood, although she was dead from the very beginning of the story. But the way Harry reminisces about her was very touching, and the end was very sad and great at the same time.\\
Normally I had never cared much for her.

And I´ve got to mention Tracey Davis too. There were several fics with her in it but when I started to write my own ff I really got into her character. But I think that´s nothing out of the ordinary.
