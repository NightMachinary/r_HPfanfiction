Ginny. Within the books, she's a character I wanted to like but could never be fully invested in. In large part because Rowling's romance writing is one of my least favourite elements of the books. Fanfiction is able to move away from that and dig into the elements of the character which didn't get much time to shine or which drew my interest originally.
