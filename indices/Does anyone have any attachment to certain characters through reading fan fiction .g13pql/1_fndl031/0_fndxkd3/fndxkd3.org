I think that's cool, I wish I could like Ginny but I agree, I never loved her in the books, she always annoyed me! I've not read any proper fanfic with much of her so I'll have to give it a try! I'm finding it super interesting to see everyone's answers, like everybody likes different people for different reasons and I think that's so cool!
