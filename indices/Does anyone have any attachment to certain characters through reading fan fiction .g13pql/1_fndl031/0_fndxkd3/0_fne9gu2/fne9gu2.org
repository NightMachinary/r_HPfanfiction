Yeah, I wouldn't say I ever disliked Ginny---though the Ginny/Harry content itself isn't my favorite---so much as felt she was underwritten. She has traits and relationships which could be compelling. In practice, however, she's not given much to do outside of Harry and her characterization only breaks out of the spunky little sister box in brief flashes.
