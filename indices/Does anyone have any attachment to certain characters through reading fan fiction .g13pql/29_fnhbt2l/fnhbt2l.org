My favorite is Orion Black for sure. Well I usually read marauders fics. But once I discovered izzythehutt's â€˜Black mask' I could never stop reading it. Very well written - a lot of fully developed minor characters from Original hp books. It's my favorite marauders era fic. Sirius used to be my fav of all times but it's getting even more interesting if you think about this handsome rebel's parents. After all, like father like son.

Actually I'd say that it's one of the best Sirius characterization I've ever read as well (for those who like a complex character of Sirius Black it's a must read).

Also I never cared much for Regulus while reading books but he is quite a popular character in fics - I guess now he is also one of my favorite. His life and his motivation definitely deserve more love and attention.

So I guess it's the trio I rediscovered through reading fan fiction.
