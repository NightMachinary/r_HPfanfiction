Yes!!!!!!! I've been telling everyone that series is my favourite fan fiction I have ever read! Amazing characterisation and I acctually really loves Walburga in it! The intricacies of the family was such an amazing read! I always read stuff where walburga and Orion are like so evil , so to get a different take on it was awesome!!!
