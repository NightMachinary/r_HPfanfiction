* The thing about JKR's writing is that though she is a great worldbuilder, she isn't all that great at developing characters, which is annoying when you are just reading the books at surface level for the first time, but great for FanFiction readers/writers. Characters like the Marauders and just throwaway ones like Daphne, though on opposite polls regarding their importance to the story, are given the same amount of Fanon development... I'm not saying we know them in the books at the same level! Because there is so much room for characters from the books to become OC's, people imprint onto them. The reason you like Fanon Sirius more than Book Sirius is that you relate to him better since he is more fleshed out. The thing about Fanon is that you can pick and choose between what different Fanfic authors have put out there while keeping Canon in mind and essentially create a version of Sirius that you like better. That's what's so great about it.
