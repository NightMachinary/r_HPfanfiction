I know I find it amazing! There is literally a fan fiction for everyone! I read an amazing AU fanfic recently and I felt sad that that wasn't what had acctually happened but after a while I realised I could just view them as different entities! Like it's still a story that's out there and it doesn't matter if it's not canon compliant !! Hope that made sense lol
