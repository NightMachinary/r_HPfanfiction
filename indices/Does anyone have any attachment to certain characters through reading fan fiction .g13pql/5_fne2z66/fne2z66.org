Ginny, in the books, barely gets any focus before her sudden promotion to Love Interest - and even then, not really enough characterization to make me care about her. I only really started to care when I found a few fanfics that explore her as a character.

Luna Lovegood is a character that's essentially begging for a character-exploration, what with her beliefs and her surprising amount of insight - and fanfics have a lot of fun with it.

Sirius Black is a unique case in that we do see a lot of him - for the books where Harry knows he exists, Sirius acts as a sort of confidante for Harry - but he's still only really seen as the man-on-the-run. Fanfic explores how he is without having to hide, and that made me like the character as a whole a lot more than the books alone.

There's also a few characters that are named but that basically get no characterization apart from having a name. Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, Millicent Bulstrode, most of Hufflepuff House, most of Ravenclaw...
