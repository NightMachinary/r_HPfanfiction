I actually really came to like Fleur Delacour through Harry Potter Fanfictions. Similar to the other usual fanfiction characters (Daphne, Zabini, etc.) you really have a large playing field with the character.

And also through fanfiction, I really started to slowly dislike Ron Weasley more. I really hate that, as I actually like the character, but almost every fanfiction that follows the tropes I enjoy reading usually involves some form or another of Ron or even Weasley Bashing. I really hate that.
