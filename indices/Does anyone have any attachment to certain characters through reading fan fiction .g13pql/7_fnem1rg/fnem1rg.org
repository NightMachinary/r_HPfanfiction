Severus Snape. Reading the books as a child, I never had any particular attachment to his character - he was only ever the antognistic character who could not get over his hatred for Harry and his father.

However, fanfiction develops his character in a more appealing way as a mentorship towards Harry in different situations. That being said, any "evil" characters such as Voldemort/Tom Riddle, Draco Malfoy etc etc are some of my favourite characters to read about. Of course, I understand that they'll never have any form of relationship/friendship/mentorship towards Harry if you think about it in terms of canon, but when fanfic writers develop and go into detail about how the character could be redeemed or even change the circumstances so that they aren't inherently dicks, then that's something that I can agree with.
