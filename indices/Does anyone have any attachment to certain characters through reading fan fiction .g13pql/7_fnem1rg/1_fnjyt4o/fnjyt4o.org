Yes!! I love a good Snape redemption arc. Literally love him solely bc of fanfiction. When people critique Snape based on canon I get it, but in the fics I read he's usually a hero of sorts.

I've recently been very into fics showing him as a good teacher. There's so much from the administrative side we miss out on in the books from Harry's perspective as a student. But I'm super interesting in him diligently keeping track of students and their work, being a good Head of House, etc...

The Hogwarts Potions Professor is a great behind the scenes look!
