She /is/ just a face in the crowd in the books though. The only mention of her is her exiting the OWL exam with Hermione and some other students whose last names start with "G".

In the wider canon of JKR's writing we get three things more (1.Slytherin 2.Draco's sister-in-law 3.hangs out with Pansy), but she has zero traits in the actual books. She's literally just a name of a girl in Harry's year.
