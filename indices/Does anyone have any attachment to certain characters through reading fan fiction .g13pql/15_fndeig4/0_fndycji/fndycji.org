Don't get me started hahah! All my fav fics are usually Sirius centric to be honest so if your not a fan of him you'll probably hate all of these!!

In the black and black mask by izzythehutt (a03 or ffn) I think this might be my favourite ever fan fiction, it's still being updated but there's a lot to read! It's largely based around the black family and it's set not long after the marauders leave school so it's first Wizarding war time! The idea is that Regulus survives the cave and it brings the black family back together and it's so funny at times but also super angsty! It's a great mix, honestly one of the best characterisations of certain characters I've ever seen, like the Dumbledore is so on point, I think if you like JK Rowling writing , you'll love this!!! I also like Falling Star by Goldenlioness4 (ffn) , it's during 5th or 6th year I can't remember and it's spanning the prank and Sirius running away, I really loved it - there is a Dada teacher who has amazing characterisation and I usually hate OCs but I've fallen in love with this character ( Professor Keenan) and I'm gutted he's not in any other fics !
