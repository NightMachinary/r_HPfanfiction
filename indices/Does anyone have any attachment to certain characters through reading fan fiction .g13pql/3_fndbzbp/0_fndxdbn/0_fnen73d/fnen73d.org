I would recommend that you download the FFNet app instead. You can download the fic so you can read while offline. Also, I did an experiment. If an author decided to delete the fic from the website, you will still have a copy of it in the app if you downloaded the fic. I have several on my faves before. There was one time I want to read a specific fanfic again but I can't find it anymore. Found out that the author decided to delete it.
