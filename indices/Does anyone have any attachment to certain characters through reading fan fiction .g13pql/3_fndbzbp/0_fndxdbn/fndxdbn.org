Yeah I loved that prequel !! Really nice to see a happy james and Sirius because I'm the books obviously James is dead but Sirius is lowkey depressed! Yeah, certain fanfics really play up on random characteristics, one that bugs me is when Sirius spends hours on his hair and stuff , like that's not realistic and I don't think he's that vain!! I've never hear of that fic , I'll try it our thanks!! :)
