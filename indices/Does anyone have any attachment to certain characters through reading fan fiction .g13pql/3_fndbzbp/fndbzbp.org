I do. Fanfictions actually help because Rowling has only mentioned what happened to the Marauders through interviews and on her website. There was one though, the Harry Potter Prequel where James and Sirius was caught in the Muggle World by a policeman, which is really wicked!

The one thing I dont like is if the fanfic would really play up their character. Like its not canon anymore. I would stop reading immedietely and look for a different one one I dont like where the author is going with the character build up.

My favorite so far is The Debt of Time. A time turner fic where Hermione went back in time and became James Potter's twin sister. The charqcter built up of the marauders are so good and on point.
