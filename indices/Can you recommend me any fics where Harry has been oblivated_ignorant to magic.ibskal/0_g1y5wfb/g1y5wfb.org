Harry tells the Ministry to fuck off during his trial. They bind his magic and obliviate him. Things pretty much immediately go to shit and years later Hermione finds him and uses time travel to try and fix things. Harry doesn't get his memory back, he remains a 20-year old that just found out about magic in a kid's body.
