The only story I know of in which Harry has his knowledge of magic obliviated (apart from You're My Density, which has already been mentioned) is linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream), in which Umbridge tries to have Harry obliviated during the summer after 4th year. It's a cross with Sherlock, and unfortunately unfinished.

Most of the other "Harry was obliviated" stories I know of involve Harry discovering that Dumbledore or Ginny (or both) obliviated him to keep him under control, but still knowing of magic.
