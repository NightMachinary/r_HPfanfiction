  most owls are notoriously dumb. They don't live up to the whole wisdom thing at all!

Most owls aren't Post Owls. It always seemed clear to me (seeing how Hedwig seems fully capable of understanding human speech even not directly related letters, and all HP owls' ability to track down their targets even if they're not at their usual address) that Post Owls are not mundane owls, but a special magical strain; either enchanted at birth, or, more probably, inherent magical owls who are to regular owls what wizards are to Muggles (with their magic partially manifesting as increased I.Q.).
