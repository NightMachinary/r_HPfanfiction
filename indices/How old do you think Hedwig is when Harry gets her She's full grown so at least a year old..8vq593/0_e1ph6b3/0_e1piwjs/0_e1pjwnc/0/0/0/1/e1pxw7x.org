Having a bird is fun, but a lot of work.

You have to put time aside to talk and play with them every day. Doubly so if you only have one, since having just one means *you* are their best friend. If I'm going to be out, I put music on for her so she doesn't get bored - bit by bit, I'm slowly building up a playlist of songs she likes, since she will insist on having Opinions. Occasionally she gets bored anyway and starts trying to break out of her (latched) cage.

See what I mean?
