A clever parrot is roughly on par with an ape. They think on about the same level as a four or five year old human. Tool use, understanding English, problem solving...the works. Having a pet parrot is like having a kindergarten kid that can fly.

Hedwig is demonstrably not /quite/ that bright. She understands English, and does problem solving (bringing Harry food) but no tools that we ever see.

So if we boost magical owls up to be on par with parrots, and give them a homing instinct to magic that's been bred into them...
