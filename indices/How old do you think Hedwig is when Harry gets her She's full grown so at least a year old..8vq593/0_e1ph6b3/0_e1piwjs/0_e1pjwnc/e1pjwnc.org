Oh, you could train an owl to do things, given enough time. Even an ordinary owl can be trained. They're just not as bright as many of the other trainable birds - raptors aren't as bright compared to corvids or parrots. Magical owls probably /are/ cleverer than most, but they can't be THAT much better.

I mean something more like...what a jackdaw learns in one week might take an owl two or three.

Hedwig is well trained when Harry gets her. She's not frightened of his hand in the cage, she stands still to have things done to her (like attaching letters) instead of moving away or nipping, even though Harry doesn't really know how to touch her yet. That takes a while with a parrot - it took me a few weeks with mine - so she must have had someone doing work with her before she was offered for sale.
