I'd say a year and a half to two years. She's already comfortable with being handled and already trained as a post bird when he gets her; we don't know how long that takes, but most owls are notoriously dumb. They don't live up to the whole wisdom thing at all!

So still a young bird, but old enough to be adult or close to it and to have had some serious work put into her education before being left with an eleven year old who's never looked after a pet. If someone had given Harry an untrained bird, he wouldn't even know where to start on teaching her how to be touched.
