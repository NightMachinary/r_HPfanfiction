ðŸ˜­thanks but ive read keeping appearances and ik its not that one. Harry was actually raised by harry and was sorted into slytherin when he first went to hogwarts, and when he went to hogwarts it was under his name as Hadrian(possibly?) Riddle. Dumbledore didnt figure out he was harry potter for a while and Tom/Hadrian let dumbledore believe that Hadrian was just Toms son but that they werent close.
