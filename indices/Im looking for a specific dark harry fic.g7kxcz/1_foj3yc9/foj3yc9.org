I think I recognise this - I'll just look at what I've favourited now

Keeping Appearances is the one I was thinking of, and is pretty similar - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6963092/1/Keeping-Appearances]]

Carpe Omnia and it's sequels has Harry/Vasilis being LV's son and gathering followers in Hogwarts - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11360472]]

Others that are pretty good with a more morally grey Harry, though -

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1182551]] Shadow Magic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1051935/chapters/2104982]] The Bone Man

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21949021?view_adult=true]] Harry Potter Master of Malicious Compliance
