linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is an amazing trilogy and requires no knowledge of the Dresden Files series (for which it is an x-over). Loads of knowledge, fight new dark lords, Harry's too badass to ever really need money.

linkffn(Sword of the Hero) is the beginning of a ridiculously epic trilogy which goes far beyond simply fighting in new dimensions. It's the most epic work of fiction I've ever read or come across. The sheer sense of scale makes fighting in different dimensions look like child's play.

linkffn(Emperor) is one in which Harry has loads of money and knowledge, but most importantly, loads of /cunning./ This Harry embarks on a journey to conquer the world. Full of intricately woven political subplots as Harry must infiltrate and pit various factions against one another so he comes out on top.
