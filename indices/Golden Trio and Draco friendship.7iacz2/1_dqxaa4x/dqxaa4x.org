Huh... You know, I don't think I've ever seen it- only time Harry and Draco are friends, Draco still hates Ron- and often in those kinds of fics where it happens, well, more often than not Harry's a Slythern, or at least wary of Ron's friendship (Whether kind or manipulative, I think at least Molly, and possibly Dumbledore planned for the meeting, after all, yelling about your secret worlds platform in front of the people you're supposed to be hiding the secret from is a bad idea- and no seats, really- after two wars and the population culled there's no other seats? Ha)

Harry+Draco slash/friendships are nearly synonymous with Ron Bashing.
