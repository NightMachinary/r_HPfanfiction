Well, linkffn(1297222) is about a Harry who's gay, though it's not of huge significance throughout the story.

It doesn't deviate too heavily from the stations of the canon, but it does have Harry, Ron & Hermione becoming somewhat friends with Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Neville. Its sequel deviates a little more when Harry & Co kill the basilisk early and Riddle changes his plans.
