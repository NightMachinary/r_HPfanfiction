I have only seen this in the fic where an AU Harry promised to kill all versions of voldermort so he travels to different Harry Potter AU's. In one with the classic "Harry is super-powerful and merlins apprentice has billions of galleons.. Etc." He tells the other harry to try and Accio Voldermorts head. Does it ring a bell?
