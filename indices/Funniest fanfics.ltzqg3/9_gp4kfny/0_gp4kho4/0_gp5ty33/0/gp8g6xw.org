A lot of Clell65619's stuff is very funny and/or clever. I'd recommend going through his stuff, especially "Thrilling Tales" which is a series of one-shots (some a little tortured, I admit). He's got some here as well: [[https://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]]. Most are duplicates, but easier to download if you've a mind to.
