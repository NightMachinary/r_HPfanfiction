I would have harry (This being a "snarky" harry) tell Rita Skeeter to look into the events surrounding Sirius' imprisonment. I would have harry hint that it wasn't what it seems, and that fudge is covering up the mistakes of his predecessor. The bit about fudge purely being so Rita has a target for her, unique style. Rita takes care of the rest, digging up the info, getting it to the public, shaming the people in power to the point that, as fudge puts it, they have to "be seen doing something". That is how I would do it.
