- Grab a Death Eater\\
- Give him Polyjuice to appear as Sirius
- Stage a duel between Harry and poly-Sirius in the middle of Hogsmeade, with the poly-Sirius Confunded or Imperiused to attack Harry
- Harry kills poly-Sirius - he won't change back into his own shape if the potion was still active when he died (reference: Mrs. Crouch dies in Azkaban while Polyjuiced as her son. No one sees her revert).
- Sirius can return to society as a different guy entirely. Harry will inherit all his stuff, so it won't be a huge sacrifice for Mr.... Pink.

EDIT: Slightly more complicated but more reliable version: immediately kill poly-Sirius, then stage the fight with Tonks acting in Sirius' stead, but when Harry hits 'Sirius' with the 'final blow', it's messy enough for them to pull a switch between her body and the poly-Sirius corpse.
