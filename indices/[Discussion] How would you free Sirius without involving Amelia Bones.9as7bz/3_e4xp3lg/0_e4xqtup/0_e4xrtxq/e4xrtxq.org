Firstly we don't know if Dumbledore was even chief warlock at the time

Secondly there is no reason to think that his job involves making sure that everyone is entitled to "due process" or that what was done to Sirius wasn't perfectly legal in the Wizarding World.

In fantastic beasts the DMLE head was perfectly within his rights to order an execution without trial. And from what we see in OoTP, where a minor is summoned to before the Wizengamont and Fudge attempts to try him in absentia by changing the trial time at the last moment, we can assume that "due process" in Wizarding Britain is very different from the muggle world.

As to finding out why his Army was betrayed, while many people would want to find out why he did it, it's pretty normal to not want to see someone who did something so foul.
