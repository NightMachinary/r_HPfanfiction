At the end of POA, as long as Harry had Wormtail, there would be enough evidence to exonerate Sirius. Fudge was still trying to curry favor with BWL at that time, and Dumbledore was also vouching for Sirius (forget those fanon manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore). Fudge could score lots of political brownie points by correcting a 'major mistake of the previous administration'.
