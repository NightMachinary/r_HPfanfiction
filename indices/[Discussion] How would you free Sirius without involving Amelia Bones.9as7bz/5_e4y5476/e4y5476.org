Logically, the most straight forward ways would be:

- Harry see Pettigrew on the Marauder's Map, either overreacts and jumps the gun or runs to McGonagall/Dumbledore (a lot like in canon actually). Of course Dumbledore would know the political and legal ramifications, so he would either need to be clever and find some technicality. Example, the fact that Ministry never held an open trial negates all legal declarations, forcing the Ministry to release him into someone's custody (lets say Lupin or something). Thats the way Dumbledore deals with them in OOTP: find the loopholes and tighten them on the bureaucrats necks.
- Some relative of the Blacks gets worried because Sirius is the heir and with his death their property/money would pass to other families or maybe be claimed by the goblins and Ministry. Prince of Slytherin actually did something sort of similar, though with different motivations. It also seems in line with the Blacks characterization: your lineage comes before anything else, and even a blood traitor can still breed for their noble house (yeah I know).

Most feasible ways involve some sort of powerhouse, either 1) Dumbledore (duh) 2) a member of the pureblood class or a conglomerate that wields not insignificant political acumen to put the screws to the Ministry or 3) some powerful OC (or Grindelwald, because why not) that comes out of nowhere and blindsides the Ministry folk. Point is, you need some counter-force to the Ministry.

What I would like to see though?

- Lupin gets his shit together and puts together a rag-tag team of former 70s Hogwarts students to break in "The Rock" style. I just need to figure out who will be Sean Connery...
- A full on assault on Azkaban to break down the prison. Dumbledore storms the place and lays low all the guards (Dumbledore: Despair is no threat to one carried on the wings of a phoenix/Let us see who is truly 'Demented'). Yeah.
