linkffn(To Play The Devil) is a buddy cop fic starring Harry and Voldemort. They are forced by Minister of Magic Draco Malfoy to investigate a series of disappearances in France.

linkffn(Yes, I am Harry's Brother) has Lord Voldemort pretending to be Harry's illegitimate American brother. Pretty good imo, but some people have problems with Voldemort being a little out of character.
