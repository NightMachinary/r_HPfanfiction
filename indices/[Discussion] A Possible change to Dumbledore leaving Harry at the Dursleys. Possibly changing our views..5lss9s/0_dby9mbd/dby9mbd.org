Readers and writers who like to bash characters will always find something to hate. If they can't, then they'll literally just fabricate ludicrous scenes in order to justify it and/or exaggerate the worst aspects of a character a hundredfold to justify it.

Dumbledore left Harry at the Dursley household because that is where he felt he would be the safest. And for what it's worth, he was right. For 11 years, Harry was safe from any form of attack from Death Eaters and such. He knew Harry wasn't going to be treated well. That was simply secondary to ensuring Harry's safety. There is a scene in which he tells Harry this and asks for his forgiveness, I believe, but I can't remember which book it was in.
