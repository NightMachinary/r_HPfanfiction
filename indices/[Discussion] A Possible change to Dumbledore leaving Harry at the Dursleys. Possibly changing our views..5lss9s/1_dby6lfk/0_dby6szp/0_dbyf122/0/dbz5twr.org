Why should Dumbledore check up on Harry? I cannot fathom how people can even bring this up logically because it's not Dumbledore's job.

Dumbledore is the headmaster of a school, he has like ten other titles as well. I just cannot imagine him having the time to pop by the Dursley's, knowing that Petunia didn't really like him for denying her access to Hogwarts, and having a cup of tea.
