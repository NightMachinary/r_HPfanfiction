It is, but it's almost in every fic depending on the situation. 'Bashing' has a lot of different meanings and Googling 'character bashing' has a rather obscure result.

Maybe it's different for Harry Potter? I dunno.

When I first got into fanfiction, I was all for Harry telling Dumbledore where to shove it, but now it's just unpleasant. There's a very fine line between bashing and character qualities.
