Pottermore is technically the 'official' source, and you can find information there on the HP universe, but ever since they integrated it in the general Wizarding World site it's been frankly ridiculous to navigate. If you want meticulous information on as many topics as possible in the Wizarding World, I would recommend the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/][Harry Potter Lexicon]]. It's created and run by fans who have done some incredible work going through canon and organizing it in an easy-to-access way.

Any of the other HP Wikias out there are also probably simpler to go through than Pottermore, though their information may not be as accurate as the Lexicon.
