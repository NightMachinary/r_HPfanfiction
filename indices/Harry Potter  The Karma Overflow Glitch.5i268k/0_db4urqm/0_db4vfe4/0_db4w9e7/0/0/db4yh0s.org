It would be pretty awesome as an antagonist, voldemort gets kinda boring over time but having a dark w/lizard ragemonster stomping everywhere and threatening the statue of secrecy just because he's not aware that it exists would be pretty interesting.

It would probably be treated more like a natural disaster than a dark lord but seeing many wizards coming together to defeat the threat would be interesting.

Dark lord T-rex could totally break into the dragon reserves in romania and build a powerful dragon army against the wizards. Harry is immediately drafted to fight because he defeated the last dark lord and he understands what the lizard is saying because of his parselmouthery.

Maybe horcruxes are a reptile thing because everyone who used one in the past seems to speak parseltongue or has some sort of affinity to reptiles, iIrc Herpo the foul was a dark herpetologist or something like that.
