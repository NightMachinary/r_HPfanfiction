Everything was going peachy until the planet suddenly exploded under Harry's feet.

Harry's amazing luck suddenly took a turn for the worse as Hedwig developed an inexplicable case of diarrhea while perched on Harry's shoulder.

The sight sent various Slytherins at their house table into hysterical laughter, which triggered bursts of accidental magic from each of them, which washed over the hordes of Harry's worshipers, squeezed into the Great Hall with him.

Slowly, those worshiping eyes turned to madness as a wire in their brains was crossed just the wrong way by the magic, and Harry's followers suddenly charged at the Boy-Who-Lived with their bare hands, wands, knives, arrows and laser guns.

In the resulting 'kerfuffle', Harry lost several teeth, several fingers, both of his unmentionables, one of his eyes, and got something rather unpleasant tasting in his mouth.

Flailing around, desperately trying to escape, Harry's own magic accidentally activated, combining with the residual chrono-energy from his previous trip through time, opening a space-time rift in the Great Hall.

Dozens of innocent people were torn apart by the rift; somehow, this counted as close enough to 'murder' for Harry's soul to fracture, and residual energy from the horcrux meant that bits of Harry's soul went flying everywhere, turning dozens more survivors in the Great Hall into horcruxes.

More importantly, however, Harry himself, far from being torn apart by the space-time vortex, was cast back millions of years into the past...

Harry groaned and slowly opened his eyes, squinting at the bright sunlight.

"Uh...okay, what just-"

~NOM~

He was promptly eaten in one gulp by a Tyrannosaurus.

And then a certain meteor landed on the Tyrannosaurus, blowing up everything for miles around and burying Harry's chewed up and pulverized corpse deeep below the earth.

This wasn't quite the end of Harry, however, because he still had a connection to his accidentally-created horcruxes in the future.

This meant that, fully conscious, his spirit was buried deep, deep underground, with very little ability to move the packed earth around him.

/The next few million years are going to suck.../ Harry thought to himself.
