Link just in case I didn't use the bot right.

Pretty sure no one else has mention this. But while reading No Difference I also found a fic named /If I Could Have Been There/ by tess4aria on ff.net. It's a continuation / alternate path of /No Difference/, where Harry chooses to stay in the past with Eileen and Snape.

It's got pretty good writing, with very nice domestic moments. I'd give it a try if you want to see interactions between Harry and child Snape. Along with Eileen, who felt so quickly brushed aside in /No Difference/ imo.
