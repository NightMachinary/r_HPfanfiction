  Harry Potter is Master of Death and contemplating time travel. Should he prevent Dumbledore's influence, adopt Tom Riddle as soon as he's born, rescue Merope Gaunt, or save his own family? So many possibilities, but he has time to do them all if he chooses to, he is Master of Death after all. Canon through DH, but not epilogue compliant. Pairings HP/MG
