malfoy and his ilk would most likely put the blame on muggle(not without reason), which would probably make people dislike muggles even more and when voldemort got the stone he would come back in a stronger position then when he originally did. dumbledore would probably never learn about the horcuxes or at least have definitive proof of them, due to never learning about the diary so would never look for them meaning voldemort would remain immortal and eventually kill dumbledore and subjugate wizarding britian. he would probably conquer the world due to him having two forms of immortality.
