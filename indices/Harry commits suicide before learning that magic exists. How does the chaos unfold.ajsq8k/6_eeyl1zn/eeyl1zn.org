Isn't Voldemort Harry's horcrux as much as Harry is Voldemort's horcrux? Neither can die except by the hand of the other.

Harry would become a horcrux ghost.

That or Harry's spirit would be the one that dies. Then his body would rise as the piece of Voldemort takes control. Then the Durlseys have literally Voldemort living in their house.
