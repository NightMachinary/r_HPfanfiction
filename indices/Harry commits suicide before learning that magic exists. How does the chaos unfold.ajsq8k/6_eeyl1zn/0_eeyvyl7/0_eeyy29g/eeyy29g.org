Harry's forehead scar is a horcrux. Personally I like to believe that it's a co-horcrux and works both ways. Vodemort can't die as long as it exists but neither can Harry.

Hrm, come to think of it that would be a 3rd option. Harry hangs himself only to discover that he just won't die and instead keeps reviving just like a Highlander immortal. A tough lesson since he would hang there until someone gets him down.
