Hm...wouldn't that lead to a pre-teen who has nothing to lose (if he attempted suicide he does think so at least!) using that fact (note: Would that turn him into a wraith after he kills his body or would he simply wake up later (or would he simply not die)?) and doing all sorts of crazy things? Seriously, if I found out that I couldn't die? You bet I'd try a lot of crazy stunts :D

ps: I also wouldn't kill the means of my immortality (fuck the prophecy and fuck the uncaring sheeple in the wiz-world! Voldy? You can have the UK!)
