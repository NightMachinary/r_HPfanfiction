While it doesn't have Harry committing suicide before learning about magic, I'd still like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones][Digging for the Bones]]. Someone in Harry's year dies (not suicide) and it causes a big ripple effect on Hogwarts. Both Harry and someone else try to kill themselves later on, and it's a very beautifully written story.
