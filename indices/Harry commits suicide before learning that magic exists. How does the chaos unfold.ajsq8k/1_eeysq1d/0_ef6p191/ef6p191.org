I'd like to read that! Frankly as much as I like reading HP, I hate the incompetent adults (and I don't agree that you need them to write young adult fiction! Seriously, people can be competent and still make mistakes (not seeing stuff that a teenager might see or hear just because he is there and wasn't noticed and being unable to convince an adult doesn't make them incompetent (as long as they are truly competent otherwise, like say noticing the abuse Harry suffered and putting their foot down - "No, Albus! He's not going back there! If I have to I will resign and take him in myself! I'll even use the media against you, if need be! Oh - and don't think about obliviating me, I've told some others already!" (note: That is something a competent McGonagall could have said and done!))! It is a bad trope!

ps: I also hate it when characters (who were probably not even invented at that time) look kind of bad because they never did anything in the past! IMHO if writing a series you should really think up your full cast beforehand and give them excuses for not being part of the story from the start (So, the coward - Remus Lupin - needs an excuse for not ever looking for and visiting Harry!)...you also should have your story arc down (no sudden Deus Ex Machina (Deathly Hollows) or other things ('cruxes!))
