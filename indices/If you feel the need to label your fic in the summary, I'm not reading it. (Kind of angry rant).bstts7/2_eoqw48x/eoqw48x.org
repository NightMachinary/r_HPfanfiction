You must be new to the fandom.

After a while of reading through subpar and dubious quality fanfics, readers and writers want to see and show the tropes. I don't want to read 15+ chapters to find out Dumbles is manipulative if I don't like that kind of thing. I want to see it front and center in the summary or the first AN before the story starts. Saves me time on looking through shitty stories.

If a writer is well known/rec'd here often, then yeah, I expect better. Starfox, WhiteSquirrel, mugglesftw, etc -- I know what I'm reading, and I like what I'm reading. They have a type. But if an author is new or lesser known, tags really help.
