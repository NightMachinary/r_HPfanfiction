IMO, it's because some people prefer specific fics, like Independent!Harry for example (me lmao), because they can't stand seeing a weak Harry; or Manipulative!Dumbledore because some of his "Greater Good" acts are morally questionable and they want to read something that shows clearly that he really is manipulative. So the labels are there for people searching specifically for these fics.
