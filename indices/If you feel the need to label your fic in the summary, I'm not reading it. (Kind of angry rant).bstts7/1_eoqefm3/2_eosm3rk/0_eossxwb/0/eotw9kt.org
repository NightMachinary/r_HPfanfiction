This interpretation is fanon. I mean, it could be so, but it could be also explained (and be still 100% in harmony with facts from canon) that it was just honest mistake and he truly tried to protect the stone by means he thought were sufficient but turned to be completely inadequate.

Yes, it is hard to believe, but in all honesty, I still believe more in the interpretations of linkao3(14078862), or linkffn(12155794) (I have plenty of objections to the latter story as such, but its Dumbledore is one of the best I have ever read): he was just truly getting old and he makes bad mistakes.
