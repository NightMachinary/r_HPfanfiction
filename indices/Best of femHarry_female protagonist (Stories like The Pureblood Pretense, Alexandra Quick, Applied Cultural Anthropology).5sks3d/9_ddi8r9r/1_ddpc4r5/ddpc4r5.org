Because some people do have an easier time with identifying with female characters, for one, and when you read a story it is most common to try identifying with the protagonist. As the amount of stories of any kind centreing on female protagonists rather than male ones is fairly low all things considered, it is fairly obvious why some people would want to read or write stories with such and thus search for them.

Add to that the thing with sexuality being a different thing entirely than one's gender, and there you go, there is reason enough to make an originally male protagonist female even if you pair them with another female character.

That said, in this case the slash character was supposed to serve as an “or” rather than a mark of a pairing.
