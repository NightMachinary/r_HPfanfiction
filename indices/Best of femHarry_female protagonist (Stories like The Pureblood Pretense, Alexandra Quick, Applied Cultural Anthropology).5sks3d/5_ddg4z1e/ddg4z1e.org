I'll submit linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829); Hermione-centric fic where Harry gets captured in the first chapter, setting off Voldemort's victorious take-over of Magical Britain. Dark, almost cruel to the good guys fighting as insurrectionists on the run, but it doesn't bash anyone. In fact, there are some great Weasley moments all the way to the end.
