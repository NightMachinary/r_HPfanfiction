Are you alright with genderbender? linkffn(11862560) is probably the best i've read so far.

Harry's (Mel's) development as a character is absolutely fantastic, his slowly coming to terms with the fact that yes, (s)he is a girl, and really, she always has been, even if she occupied the body of a boy and coming to terms with the fact that she's not a freak, confronting her past and the abuse she suffered from the Dursleys makes for very interesting reading.

Fair warning, it starts with the simple premise of Harry turning into a girl but quickly moves into bigger AU territory and it can be a little off putting for some people. I really don't like some of the things the author has done to James' character and the way marriages work but it's certainly worth a read despite that.

The author is also writing a fill fem!Harry story but i haven't read it yet.
