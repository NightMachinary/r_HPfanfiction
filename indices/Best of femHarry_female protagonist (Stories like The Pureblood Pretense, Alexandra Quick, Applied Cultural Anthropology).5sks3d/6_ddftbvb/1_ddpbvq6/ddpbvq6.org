  Harry's (Mel's) development as a character is absolutely fantastic, his slowly coming to terms with the fact that yes, (s)he is a girl, and really, she always has been, even if she occupied the body of a boy and coming to terms with the fact that she's not a freak, confronting her past and the abuse she suffered from the Dursleys makes for very interesting reading.

Yeah, it's all built very well as far as that thing goes. Heck, even the ignored epiphany when reviewing +his+her own past memories somehow serves to make it all even sweeter.
