[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: The author built a new, very different world completely from ground up. Hermione in this story is adorable and yet scary, intelligent and yet mistake prone, incredibly strong and yet very sensitive. The Trio had also compiled a huge body count throughout their adventures.

"Divided and Entwined", linkffn(11910994): It's another smart and ruthless Hermione story. This time, she led a small guerilla group of Muggleborns and dished out massive losses to Death Eaters and its Ministry minions. But Dumbledore, Harry, and Ron were doing their part too.

"Call Me Moriarty", linkffn(11602420): This dark fem!Harry is too intelligent and over powered, but the story is bloody fun to read.

"Murder Most Horrid", linkffn(10099028): There is no Voldemort in this AU, and Bellatrix became a cynical auror/detective instead, until she met Hermione. It's a very good crime/mystery fic with the Bellatrix/Hermione pairing.
