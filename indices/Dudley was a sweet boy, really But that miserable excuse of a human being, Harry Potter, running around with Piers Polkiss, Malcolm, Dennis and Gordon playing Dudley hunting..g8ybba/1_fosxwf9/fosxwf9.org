Interesting prompt. I don't see a way to continue it without making Dudley a wizard too. Otherwise the perspective would have to be from Bully!Harry perspective, which would be difficult to make an engaging character if he's such an asshole that he bullies his poor cousin and leads a gang of ruffians.

It would be super interesting though if Dudley turned out to be a wizard too. Spending the first 11 years of his life being bullied by his cousin, thinking that he was going to get a break when Harry heads to Hogwarts the same way canon Harry looked forward to Dudley going to Smeltings. Only to have that ripped away from him when he gets told he's a muggleborn and needs to go to Hogwarts with Harry.
