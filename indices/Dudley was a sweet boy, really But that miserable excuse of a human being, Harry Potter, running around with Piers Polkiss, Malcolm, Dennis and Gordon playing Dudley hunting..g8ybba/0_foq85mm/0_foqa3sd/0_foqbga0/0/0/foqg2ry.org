Not to be rude, not meaning to be; but: Stricter? Right, because being raised in a cupboard under the stairs is only strict, and in no way abusive.

Also, I don't know about you, but if we're going with this AU, Vernon and Petunia would rather have Dudley continue the Harry Hunting, then the other way around, or as I said, if they were both magical, they'd likely ignore them, with how much they hated magic.

Even in an AU, it'd have to be really convincing to get Vernon or Petunia to care about Harry.
