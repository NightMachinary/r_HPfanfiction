The only real way that I could see Petunia or Vernon for that matter for letting Harry to bully Dudley, would be if either both of them were magical, or Harry was a Squib, and Dudley was magical.

Otherwise I don't see either one of them allowing Harry to bully Dudley. The only reason Dudley did it was because he was taught, or assumed it was okay, because his parents never stopped him. Otherwise I don't see them letting Harry bully their son, they just hated magic way too much to let it convincingly happen.
