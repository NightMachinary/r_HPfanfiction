I recommend this one, it's one of my favourites. Harry is /kind/ of like what you described, sometimes getting dragged into it / because he has to do the right thing. It's a recurring theme.

The fic has got good action - - grit, humour, adventure, plot, and light romance. I really like the fighting scenes and use of magic without making Harry op at all.

Edit: getting dragged into it is a recurring joke/theme but Harry is also definitely a prankster and too investigative for his own good.
