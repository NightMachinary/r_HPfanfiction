I disagree, I feel the completely made up parts of his childhood and even his years in Hogwarts are fantastic. I feel it loses a lot of steam when it comes to the more 'canon' parts, I should have worded it a bit better. My problem isn't with him being sympathetic but I feel it tries too hard starting from when he's inducted into the Death Eaters to keep him as blameless and sympathetic as possible. When he's in the Death Eaters he just makes potions and spells and therefore isn't involved in any of their horrific acts, he's kept pretty far away from Voldermort apart from a few scenes, it all feels like the writer is trying really hard to make him naive to the bigger picture of what he's involved in so that he can still be sympathetic.

The same with the explicit canon stuff, in the books Snape is a straight up ass to Harry for seemingly no reason apart from he reminds him of James. In this Harry is bad at potions and that's the main reason why with only a little a bit of the fact he reminds him of James (so far I'm only up to CoS) in it. The author has Snape pallying up with Fred and George as well with the offer of a toe nail growing spell which just seems against his character. To me it feels like the author is trying so hard to go out of their way to rationalise behaviour to show Snape in a more favourable light instead of showing him warts and all.

I've not finished it yet as I've started to struggle a bit with it but I won't deny it's fantastic writing and one of the best bit of fanfiction I've written, I just think it's trying so hard to sanitise Snape.
