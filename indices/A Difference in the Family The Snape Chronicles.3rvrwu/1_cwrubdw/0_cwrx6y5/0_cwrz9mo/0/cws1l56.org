As far as the Harry years go, the source material is told mainly from Harry's point of view. As such, the character profile we get from the books for Snape may be subject to Harry's bias or limited point of view. So we don't exactly know the nuances of Snape's personality. Sure he was an ass, but we don't exactly know what went on behind the scenes.
