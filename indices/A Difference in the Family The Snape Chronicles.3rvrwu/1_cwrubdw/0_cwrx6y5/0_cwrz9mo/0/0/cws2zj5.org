That's a fair point however I'd argue that even though the books are from Harry's POV if were to accept that they're an accurate representation of what happened then Snape is a bully plain and simple. He's horrible to Hermione, constantly belittles Neville and iirc outs Lupin as a werewolf. Now Snape does have some redeeming qualities as seen in the books but my argument here is this story seems to try so hard to warp everything that's shown in the books and before that to make Snape seem like he's not that bad of a guy. I could understand some of it because obviously everything looks different from someone elses perspective but with this story it seems like everything is downplayed or changed to make someone other than Snape look bad.

One example that springs to mind is the Slytherins practicing when Gryffindor had the pitch booked, now I could be wrong here as it's been a while since I've read CoS, but in this story Gryffindor had the pitch booked 4 weekends in a row. So this gets used to make Snape letting Slytherin practice look completely rational, now on it's own it's not that big of a deal and kind of believable but when it's constantly piled on and on with other parts so that nearly all of Snape's actions look fair it eliminates some of the allure to his character in my opinion.
