I get where you're coming from, but I have to ask how would you suggest going about delivering an opposing view that doesn't whitewash? The reason I ask is because as far as canon goes you have racist, prejudiced, bigoted, rich, inbred, dark, twisted, torturing, killing Death Eater Pure-bloods. That is what they are, period, and on the otherside we have the unquestioned good guys- the hero of which used unforgiveables a couple of times. I don't even remember Snape doing that, but the Gryffindor Head of House Imperios someone when there were clearly other options. So the point is I feel like it is written in stone that some people are bad and some good. The only 'redeeming' feature we see of any of the bad guys is that they will turn traitor. So from my point of view they aren't people so much as "scare-crows" ie. evil straw-men who don't have a leg to stand on- who exist to be wrong thinking and acting bad people, and to then be beaten.

So the problem is that in trying to write something which expands or explains the wizarding world I run into the fact that 1/4 of it is inhuman seemingly. I mean we all know subconsciously that Walburga Black and Dolohov weren't always horrible people, or weren't horrible all the time, or to everyone. However while your reasons for disliking the portrayal are well reasoned I, in general, see a sort of resistance to portraying anyone in the pure-blood mania camp as partially good (though lots of people that just make them flat out good, which are just bad fics imo). The response I often see is essentially that of whitewashing. Of course most fanfic authors can't pull it off well, but there does seem to be a general resistance to the only two things an author can do 1) use previous events hinted at in canon to explain how things aren't always as they seem. 2) make stuff up to contrast the canon portrayal.

I guess this is mostly ranting but I I brought up (an exaggerated) thread of Hagrid being horrible. The other things were all minor (or plain dumb to bring up) but at the end of the day Hagrid, 70 year old adult, Hogwarts staff member, brave Gryffindor, OotP member (?- at least trusted implicitly by its leader), wizard does dangerous human transfiguration on a muggle child who knows nothing of magic prior, and gives him a pigs tail. Permanent (canon-wise transfiguration doesn't revert etc.)- Dudley would literally have been a pig. Hagrid was expelled /years/ before he would have had the chance to be taught this. Regardless of whether Dudley is a huge bullying prick, 'cursing' him is reprehensible. The fact that Hagrid does this after /Vernon/ angers Hagrid with an insult of Dumbledore (Dudley doesn't say a word)- that is absolutely horrible when you look at it in a 'real life' sort of way (rather than fairy tale payback). This is to a massive extent glossed over as kids book, deserved it, or just /not/ concerned over it. The point being that a proven canon incident of a good guy doing something that is objectively bad is forgiven and forgotten. Where as we don't even know any good things about the bad guys (or just really really unlikable ones ala Snape), and so I can't help but be pessimistic that any objectively decent/good thing that is created (or altered from source material) for the bad guys is going to be received as whitewashing. This I think is most starkly the case in attempts at canon-compliant or canon friendly works ie. not AU happy Voldemort/goblins etc.

Honestly I am trying to work on something which gives the bad guys /something/ to work with- ie they aren't all born evil, they aren't all stupid and enjoy torturing, there might be things that Harry is unaware of etc. that gives them half a leg to wobble on. So I guess what I am saying is I AGREE with you (pre death eater parts of Snape Chronicles are stronger, whitewashing goes too far) and yet how the bloody hell can I portray the worst of the worst of them in a way that shows them not innately evil or necessarily wrong? ie. Even if wrong/misguided- As the hero of their own story?

*TL;DR* - Do you have any recommendations on how to portray even more fucked up characters- Walburga Black, Dolohov, Voldemort in a way that fleshes them out (including admirable qualities, actions which are good in their own right, etc.) ?
