Again it all depends on how close to canon you want to stick. The problem with young Voldermort is everything we hear of him doing is there to show him as having a disregard for rules from an early age. I'd definitely call trying to explain those behaviours away as whitewashing because Voldermort was never created to be a deep character with deep motivations, he's just an evil person with ridculously evil motivations that can't really be logically explained away or softened. Good luck trying though I'd be interested to see what you come up with!
