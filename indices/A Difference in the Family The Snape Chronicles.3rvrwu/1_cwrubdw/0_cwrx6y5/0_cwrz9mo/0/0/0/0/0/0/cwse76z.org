It's difficult portraying the Death Eaters as 3 dimensional characters because like you said they are evil straw men, just henchmen that JK gave names to too flesh the world out. That said it can either be a blessing or a curse when it comes to fleshing them out because they're essentially blank canvases. Near enough any of the DE's except Lucius or Bella can be given any story you want really as their plot points are very few and minor.

As for giving them redeemable qualities or showing them as not innately evil it's difficult because the main characteristic we know of them is that they hold extremely prejudice beliefs to the point of murder. Your best bet would be to look into history, the Nazis did heinous things yet they were still humans with human qualities, Rudolf Hoss for example would spend his day job thinking up mass extermination techniques then go home to his wife and kids. I think you need to resign yourself to the fact that without some massive tinkering to DE characters that they will never be relateable characters in a story because at the end of the day the point of the group is to target and kill people who have no idea why they're being targeted (in the case of Muggles) or on the basis of pure lies (in the case of muggle borns). That will always be bigger than any good qualities that they have. If you do decide to write a story on certain Death Eater characters an interesting way to go might be to juxtapose a Death Eaters regular day to day life with their life as a Death Eater and emotional conflict that might cause, but it might be difficult to get a full story out of it.

However you can give them strong characterisations as to why they hate muggles easily. Fear would be the big one, humans/muggles can be just as destructive as Death Eaters and they out number wizards by a ridiculous amount. You could bring up the atom bomb, all the world wars, the witch trials everything violent and destructive that wizards do can be seen in the real world on a much larger scale, that might be a good thing to bring up as good motivaton as to why certain Death Eaters hate muggles.

Finally I'd recommend looking up Nazi documentaries; Auschwitz: The Nazis and the Final Solution is a six part series that goes into a little bit about some of the Nazis involveds feelings on the holocaust. Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil is a book written about Adolf Eichmann that explores a bit about how he reconciled the awful things he did with his morals. Shit even give American History X a watch, that's a good example of a terrible person but it's more of a redemption story than anything.

TL;DR An interesting story can be written about them, it's just not going to be easy if you're trying to avoid complete black/white morality and will probably have to delve more into characterisation that straight up story.
