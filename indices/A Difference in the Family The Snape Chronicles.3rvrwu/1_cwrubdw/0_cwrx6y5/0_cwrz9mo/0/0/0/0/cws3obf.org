That's my only real problem with it other than that I'm enjoying it a lot. I loved the build up, especially his time at Hogwarts and the build up with the students trying to recruit him and the hushed talks about Voldermort. I thought it was building it up great to where I could totally buy why he would go to the Death Eaters. I guess I just feel a bit let down than rather having him wrestle with his conscience and showing a man who has done bad things for personal reasons it instead tried to keep him relatively clean to the point where it's kind of blunted the edge that makes his character so interesting.
