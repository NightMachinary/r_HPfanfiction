I think you're looking at it wrong; you are judging it by the source material. Think of it as a tale set in the Harry Potter universe rather than straight-up fan fiction. It's a story of a guy with clinical depression who happens to be a talented wizard. As such, it is a magnificent piece of writing. Sure, the circumstances of Snape's life as set up there are horrid, and if you compare them to canon it feels like someone drew circles around dots and said "bullseye"... so just don't.

It is a compelling narrative once you read it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. From a literary perspective, it is a solid work, and actually outdoes most published fiction... and is aimed at a more mature reader than the source.

And as to OP: AFAIK no other character has a biography nearly as well written.
