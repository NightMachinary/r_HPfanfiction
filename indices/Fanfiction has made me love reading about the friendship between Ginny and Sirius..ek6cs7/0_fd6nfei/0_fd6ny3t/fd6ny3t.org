Im currently reading this one, its basically about Sirius making a betrothal contract between Harry and Ginny to protect them in case he or Arthur dies. The first chapter so far has really gone into his relationship with Ginny and how he sees her. On a side note it doesn't just do the "lol we should marry them" route alot of betrothal contract stories like to do. Sirius really hammers home how this will protect them from the ministry and voldemort and its pretty believable.
