The most important thing to do would be to be very subtle about your knowledge. Lets say that you want to get Harry away from the Dursleys. Instead of coming up with some complicated scheme to free Sirius, catch Pettigrew and get emancipated, keep it simple. Perhaps find a way to contact the Tonks family via phone book and a phone box and claim that you have a vague memory of them or some Divination bullshit. Instead of exposing the evil potion Queen Molly Weasley, first of her name, just avoid the Weasleys if you don't like them.

I'm assuming a lacking knowledge of magic here (you don't know how to cast spells) so instead of trying to /fix/ the books as fast as you can, you will spend a lot of time learning magic. Your peers will be 11 year old children so you won't find them good company. Find yourself a mentor (Penelope Clearwater, one of the background Professors) so you can actually have someone close to your mental age to talk to.

And, as [[/u/amy713]] said, have flaws. For example, were I to write a SI, he'd be a socially awkward and craven guy. I'd much rather miss an adventure than risk my life. Ginny ended up in the Chamber of Secrets? Sucks to be her. DA? I'm not joining that. You don't need 27 people to learn a shied charm, you can do that with a single friend and so can anyone else. Due to these limitations, I would have to come up with my own solutions instead of simply making myself look good by fixing the canon.
