There can be some good points about writing a self-insert I suppose, as you know how you would react to a situation, which probably makes writing dialogue and thoughts a lot easier.

The thing that most people who use self-inserts do wrong however, is that they make the character an idealised version of themselves. This often leads to an annoyingly perfect character, even to the point of creating a Mary Sue.

So I would say, if you use a self-insert, have a good think about not just your good qualities, but also your flaws and how both would come into play in the story your character is part of.

Another thing to keep in mind is that if your self-insert is Harry's twin in your case, so it's likely the character has grown up very differently than you have. So you might want to consider to what extent that upbringing makes the character's personality and actions different from yours.
