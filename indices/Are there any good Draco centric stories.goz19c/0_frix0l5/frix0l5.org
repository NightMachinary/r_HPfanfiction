One is Drarry, a pair that I don't ship, but the set up is extremely believable with solid writing so I love it. Another is a friendship story with Draco/Harry when they get caught by one of Voldemorts spells and get sent back in time 20 years and have to figure out how to survive till they can catch up to present day.

I enjoy Dramione and would be happy to send you a few more links if these are to your liking. On mobile at present and finding it difficult to sort through too many fics at a time.
