The Dark Lord's Equal linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal): Time-traveler Harry with Hermione to remove the Horcrux

The third book in the Thorny Rose series linkffn(10288020): Ginny and Harry in order to remove the Horcrux (also creates a soul-bond, but its probably the least intrusive one I have ever encountered)

Technically, most of the "bonds" in the Firebird Trilogy require sexual activity, though Harry himself doesn't require it to perform a bonding.
