Oo~ For Marauders Era, I believe it's called I Am Mister Nobody And I Want To Come in. It's about the night Sirius shows up at the Potters after running away.

For Golden Trio era, It's My Life, in which Harry makes an executive decision and goes to school in America after year two, and one I believe is called Harry Potter and the Scottish Education, in which Harry goes to school in Scotland bc his mom was offered and now the offer is his.

Edit: I Am Mister Nobody And I Want To Come In= Linkffn(Knock, Knock,)

It's My Life= Linkffn(It's My Life by Fyreheart)

It's Ireland not Scotland= Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Irish Choice)
