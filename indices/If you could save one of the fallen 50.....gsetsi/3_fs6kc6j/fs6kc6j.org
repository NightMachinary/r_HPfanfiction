Hedwig. No, seriously, it was the saddest death for me.

If Hedwig doesn't work, then Tonks or Remus. I don't particularly care for either of them, but the fact that both of them died always seemed forced to me, like JKR tried too hard to create a parallel between Harry and Teddy.

Snape makes for some interesting interactions. Would Harry want to talk with him, thank him maybe? How would Snape treat Harry knowing he had seen his memories? Would Snape stay at Hogwarts or retire? Would he be celebrated or shunned by wizarding community?
