Lavender was only savaged by Greyback in the book: she was seen to be weakly moving after, so unless she died off-scene, I'd say she was still alive.

However, the movie had her as being killed, and JKR had a *lot* of creative control over the films -- from casting to scripts.

So, it's a toss-up, I guess?

As for someone to be saved? Hm... for story-line potential, I'd say either Lavender or Tonks.

The former would have to deal with post-War trauma and issues -- even if she doesn't become a full werewolf, she'd still be contaminated in the way William Weasley was. Plus, a vain girl like her dealing with horrific scarring? Character maturity/development.

A few fics out there have this already, too.

The latter? Wounded, possibly disabled, widow and single-mother. 'Nuff said.

A possible storyline could be that, over five/ten years, Tonks gradually grows closer to Harry, Teddy's godfather, to the point where it causes issues (especially if Harry's still with Ginny).

Hell, if Teddy calls Harry "dad"...
