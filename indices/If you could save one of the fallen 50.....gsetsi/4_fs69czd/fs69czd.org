Also definitely Tonks or Lupin for me. I totally understand the parallel of having Teddy grow up like Harry but with a loving family and no worries of a war. It just never quite sat right with me. There's already quite a few parallels between Harry, Voldemort and Snape due to their childhood upbringings and I hate that Teddy is also thrown in there despite having a fairly minimal similarity.

I really like Tonks but I can probably make more cases for Remus because he's the last Marauder and Harry never ever got to hear a lot about his parents (at least canon wise?). It also feels like Remus should've been a father/uncle figure to Harry if things were right and we never really see that due to him dying. I also feel bad that Remus dies after suffering so much.

I do agree that Tonks is underused and a vibrant character in the bits that we get. For me, I want either or both to live for similar reasons: I wanted more. Whether it's more happiness/contentment for Remus or more scenes and info for Tonks.
