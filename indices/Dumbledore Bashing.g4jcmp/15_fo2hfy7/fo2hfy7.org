He has much to be Bashed for tbh. Many fics go to ridiculous lengths of course but his canon actions are bad enough really.

1.) Has a child he has no legal right to, kidnapped from his legal guardian. Dumbledore is not the Minister. Or an Auror.

2.) Leaves that child with only a blanket and a letter on the doorstep of Lily's magic-hating sister in the middle of a November night.

3.) Knew that Harry wasn't being treated well(thanks to Figg's updates) and did nothing about it.

4.) Re-hired a man he suspected to now be possessed by Voldemort, compromising the education of the entire castle in the process.

5.) Left a dangerous artifact that can trap people, just lying around a school where any child could come upon it.

6.) Basically pointed the students to the forbidden corridor.

7.) Told the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs(who both go the same way to get to their dorms) to go in the direction of the Troll that could kill them.

8.) Allowed children to serve detention in the Forbidden Forest with only Hagrid as a protector. Hagrid, who isn't allowed to practice magic and certainly can't control what is in the forest if something is in there killing unicorns against his wishes.

9.) The 'protections' for the Stone were rather pointless. Three children passed them, meaning an adult possessed by Voldemort surely could. Either he is insane or he's setting Harry up in a test.

10.) Was lured away from the school that easily? Or did Harry need the right push?

11.) Despite Ron, Hermione, and Neville being perfectly okay days before Harry even awoke, he did not award them their points. Harry then woke up days before the leaving feast and also didn't get his points. Dumbledore waited until the winners(Slytherin) had already been decided and were CELEBRATING before pulling a switcheroo on everyone and ruining Slytherin's moment. I'm not saying those points weren't earned, I'm saying he had days to award them and would have avoided the horrible unfairness of the situation.

12.) Hired another teacher that he knew was suspicious because he was friends with 2 of the people in Lockhart's tales and knew the truth. He knew the whole year that Lockhart was a fake, and compromised the education of the entire castle once again, while also doing nothing about it.

13.) Somehow, despite being the 'Great Albus Dumbledore', never put 2 and 2 together on where the Chamber of Secrets was? With all the context clues?

14.) Allowed the entire castle to bully Harry for being a Parselmouth when, as the Headmaster, he could have imposed a punishment of some sort and lowered the number of haters greatly.

15.) Gave two minors access to Time-Travel.

16.) Allowed the entire castle to bully Harry for being in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. He might not have been able to stop the foreign students, but he could have done something about the Hogwarts students.

17.) Somehow didn't know that his 'friend' wasn't truly his friend the entire year? And let him demonstrate the (illegal)Unforgivable Curses in class?

18.) Sends Harry back to the Dursley house after the 4th Year ends, without any real help. Then proceeds to once again, control Harry's life to an extent he has no right to. He is Harry's Headmaster for 10 months each year and that is it. He should not be contacting Harry's friends to tell them to avoid writing to him. Why he even thought that was smart, to isolate a child who was just tortured and had to watch a friend be murdered because he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, is stupid and beyond me.

19.) Avoids Harry without proper explanation. Seriously, he could have just said Harry's potential connection with Voldy is dangerous and it was best to avoid each other to keep the Dark Lord in the dark where he should be. Then Harry could at least feel as if he was participating and doing some good instead of internalizing everything.

20.) Not even a blip of help with Umbridge when the Black Quill mess began and she barely had any power in the school. But 'he didn't know' right?

21.) Making Harry learn Occlumency from Voldemort's spy. I like Severus but even I know that wasn't smart. The lessons went better in the books than in the films(by a long shot) but those two should not be around each other at all if it isn't required.

22.) Admitting to knowing Harry wouldn't be treated well with Petunia. (Canonically has been choked by Vernon, struck with a pan by Petunia, degraded, forced to live in a cupboard for years, forced to do ridiculous amounts of chores before being allowed to eat 2 slices of bread as his meal, and actually locked in a room with a cat-flap and bars on his window where he's only fed a can of soup that he splits with his owl. And sometimes Petunia 'forgot' to feed him.)

23.) Believed a muggle drunkard's word about a magical child without hesitation. Then lit what that child considered to be his only possessions on fire(stolen or not). He lit the possessions of a orphan in the Great Depression, on fire. As a lesson. He admits in a later Memory to wanting to scare Tom onto the straight and narrow. A man with no legal right to a 10 year old he didn't know, decided it was his duty to punish this child for crimes he doesn't actually have proof that the boy committed. He tried to traumatize a child into being Good, but only succeeded in pushing him away with his example. Also, the reasoning he used to do it, at the time, was that theft isn't allowed at Hogwarts. Of all the crimes Tom was accused of, that was the one Dumbledore addressed with concern and not potentially murdering someone's pet?

24.) The entire time, Dumbledore gives no vibe that he wants the Houses to get along. He even once tells Severus that the good things he did to bring about the end of Voldemort mean he should have been Sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin, implying Slytherins can't be good or do good things.

25.) As an educator, he is responsible for teaching Tom Riddle. As the Deputy Headmaster, he has more responsibility when Tom is away from his legal guardian. He was supposedly suspicious of Tom the entire time he was at Hogwarts but did nothing at all to try and help him? He could have tried at least, but he didn't. Tom being like Gellert was damning enough apparently?

26.) Dared mock Severus Snape for switching sides because someone he loved was in danger due to his own stupid actions, when Dumbledore only switched sides because he might have been the cause of/shares blame for his sister's death. The man wanted what Grindels wanted once upon a time and changed for the same reason as Snape. His lack of owning up to his own faults is annoying while shaming another for doing the same thing.

27.) Aberforth explains that Albus wasn't the best sibling and was more concerned over not being able to see the world and explore, than he was about raising his delicate sister who needed help and had killed their mom accidentally.

28.) The whole raising Harry to be a martyr thing is a big issue with so many details that I don't feel like listing right now.

29.) Now that I think about it, if he was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, why did he allow Sirius to be imprisoned without a trial? They have a law system. Even if the person claims they're guilty they still should go to trial. The Lestranges did much worse and got a trial. Sirius was accused based on assumptions and his own supposed confession, but did not get a trial?

This isn't even all of it tbh. There is much more, but based on these alone, it's hard not to see him as manipulative(in the worst possible sense) and cruel.
