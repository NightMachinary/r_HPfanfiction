Considering the sheer war in discussion going on above, I'll just link to a very well written fic that portrays Dumbledore as what J. K. Rowling had wanted to all along. The powerful, caring, wizened old warlock who did have obvious plans going on behind the scenes but did ultimately do everything for the interest of everyone. And when he stepped into a fight, it wasn't going to be a fight for very long. /(also its really really good and amazingly well written and entertaining)/
