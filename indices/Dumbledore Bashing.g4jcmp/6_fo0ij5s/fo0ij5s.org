Pulling from my response to a similar thread

There are definitely strong feelings on both sides of the Dumbledore table. In my mind it comes down to writing and thinking of Dumbledore by his actions as written or his character as written.

JK Rowling wrote an inconsistent series that experiences serious growing pains as a result of adapting from children's fantasy to darker general audience fiction. Things that are whimsical in early books, like the trope of the chosen one being abandoned to live with bad relatives (a la Cinderella) become horrifying if seen through a more realistic lens, with Dumbledore admitting that he knew he was condemning Harry to a horrible childhood by leaving him with the Dursleys in the fifth book. Additionally, actions taken by Dumbledore for the sake of plot (cant have competent adults in a children's book or there wont be anything for the hero to do) when looked at through a non fantasy lens are unacceptable, such as allowing Quirrel to stay in the school, leaving the school by broom, protecting the stone with childish traps, etc.

On the other hand, Dumbledore the character, as written, is a generally good guy, well meaning, accomplishing much good, but making mistakes.

To a fanfiction writer this leaves three options: ignore it like Rowling, hold Dumbledore accountable for his actions, or provide justification and explanation for his actions.

For many fics, treating the whole situation like Rowling does can be best, just pretend that everything is fine with child heroes doing everything. This allows the author to focus on the main story they want to tell.

For others, if a fic is intended to have more strictly enforced logic, this can't be allowed. Which leaves the other options, vilify or justify. Dumbledore is out of touch and lacks empathy whether from a malicious or good hearted place. He still did bad things. OR Dumbledore is magnificent like in the books and has reasons for everything that must be explained, there were spells keeping Harry safe on the doorstep, the traps weren't intended as an actual defense for the stone, just the mirror, etc.

Where bashing takes over is the place where high emotions interrupt the writing process. I've known people that were abused who could never forgive the character of Dumbledore for his actions in placing Harry with abusive relatives, this coming from people who've never read fanfiction, just the canon abuse. For them, there is no room to justify Dumbledore's character. He makes them angry. If they were to write a fanfiction, it would almost certainly devolve into bashing. One doesn't need to be abused themselves for high emotion to enter the picture. Harry fills the role of the reader, the reader is supposed to empathize with him, and while Harry might forgive Dumbledore and love and respect him, most people wouldn't in his position, if it had been them.

A Dumbledore critical fic can be written without bashing or poor writing, but it falls into the same traps mentioned before. If Dumbledore is made aware of his failings, he must either fix them, in which case there is less room for a Harry centric plot. Or he must ignore them or justify them, in which he becomes less likeable and would be considered to be bashed by some readers.
