In HBP Katie Bell was almost killed because of Draco and Dumbledore did nothing. Then Ron was almost killed and Dumbledore still chose to do nothing. He is the headmaster at a school where two children almost died and yet still let things 'play out' despite having a pretty good idea who was responsible.

I understand why you like him but I'm not sure how you find it weird how he is treated in some fan fics given how incompetent he was many times throughout the book. Harry and Co. in many ways succeeded in spite of Dumbledore...not because of him.

He may be a great character but he isn't, on the whole, a good person. And I don't believe he is wise because of his own failures because he repeats the same mistakes with Harry throughout the book series.
