I think it ultimately stems from the place that people accept that Dumbledore is manipulative but do not accept the validity of his actions. I think this is mostly because he's seen as a utilitarian who acts for the Greater Good and everyone's seen Hot Fuzz by now. Mind you... I think Dumbledore is a paternalist and paternalism is really unpopular because, well, because it's a fantastic justification for meddling with well loved values like autonomy and liberty. So... maybe people just really dislike manipulation and aren't willing to listen to why. Which, you know, maybe that's fair enough.

That being said, I don't think Dumbledore bashing tends to come from a place of critique. I don't see fics which critical of utilitarianism or paternalism or whatever other ethical justification one wants to use... the books go with love, which I take as paternalism but maybe it literally just means "love is enough" (Harry certainly seems to think so).Rather, Dumbledore seems to be bashed because he sets Harry up to die based on a guess. And this just seems... ill informed. All the fics which I've seen work like this, invent their own (almost always just as risky) alternative means of de-Horcruxing Harry and they all use the existence of this alternative as a basis for bashing. I mean, is letting a Dementor, say, suck the Horcrux out really the safer option?

But, then, would I give a bashfic that is about the problems with Dumbledore's ethical motivations that has a safe or, possibly, the same solution to the Horcrux the credit it deserves? I think, probably not. Why? I like Dumbledore. As you say, he's interesting because he's flawed... because his policy in OOTP makes things worse /and/ because I see why he was like this. It's like how Sirius is more interesting as the guy who tried to turn his best friend into a murderer than... whatever else.

Mind you... Seventh Horcrux's Dumbledore appears to have no idea what's going on and I'll happily read that. I guess that's because Harrymort thinks Dumbledore's fifty steps ahead whereas he's really just rather harmless.
