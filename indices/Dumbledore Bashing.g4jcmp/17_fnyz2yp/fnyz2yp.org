I remember a story, don't ask for the name I don't remember ðŸ˜…, where Dumbledore /seems/ like the typical machiavellian bad guy but the just mentally ill. He has OCD (or was OCPD?). iirc they called it OCD but the symptoms looked more like the other...

Nevermind my point is that I thought that was a good take on the trope.
