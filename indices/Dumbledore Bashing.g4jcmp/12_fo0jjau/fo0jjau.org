I think many dislike how Dumbledore had the power and responsibility to do more and he failed to do so. He didn't have Harry trained properly and didn't fix his health issues when he finally arrived at Hogwarts and prevent summertime abuse, he didn't ensure the Order had a plan for his death, which he was enabling, he didn't support Snape by telling McGonagall the truth, he never got Sirius justice. Those were all his *duties* as Chief Warlock, as Headmaster, as leader of the Order of the Phoenix, as Harry's magical guardian (even if only while at school), and as the receiver of the prophecy. Dumbledore is a fascinating character, and truly well worth writing well. But he also was a failure many times due to his past experiences making him hesitate to take charge. Overall, he was a well-meaning, decent person who wasn't a good leader.
