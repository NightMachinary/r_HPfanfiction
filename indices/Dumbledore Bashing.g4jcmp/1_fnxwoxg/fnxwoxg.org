Bashing in general is just poor writing. An author /can/ make a fic work with bashing, if they're otherwise talented enough... But it's very hard to do so, because it's so excessive.

Dumbledore obviously suffers heavily from it - but to explain it, he /is/ the authority figure with the most control over Harry, his plan /is/ incredibly convoluted, and it involves Harry dying. Combine that with the reconciliation of his incompetence in the first half of the series (a narrative choice made to let Harry be the hero), and... well, he's an easy scapegoat.

It's a shame, because an actually manipulative Dumbledore would be an interesting villain to have in a fic. It's obviously not canon, but hey - that's what fanfiction is for! He's got all this power, operates behind the scenes, is an incredibly powerful wizard in his own right - he'd be a far more formidable foe than Voldemort, if Dumbledore were truly evil under everyone's nose. Or, at the least, if he was personally power hungry. That'd be an interesting premise.

Unfortunately, bashing makes it almost impossible to do that premise justice...
