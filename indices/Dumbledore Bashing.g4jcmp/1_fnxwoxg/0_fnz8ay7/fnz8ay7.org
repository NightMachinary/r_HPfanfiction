  It's a shame, because an actually manipulative Dumbledore would be an interesting villain to have in a fic. It's obviously not canon, but hey - that's what fanfiction is for! He's got all this power, operates behind the scenes, is an incredibly powerful wizard in his own right - he'd be a far more formidable foe than Voldemort, if Dumbledore were truly evil under everyone's nose. Or, at the least, if he was personally power hungry. That'd be an interesting premise.

Its very close to canon. You don't even /need/ a convoluted-yet-painfully obvious plan involving paying the Weasley's to keep Harry on his side. He could be a bit more callous or a bit more well-meaning, like in his younger years where even at his darkest he genuinely thought it best for both muggles and wizards if wizards ruled the muggles.\\
He'd be plenty dark if he just thought Harry was a necessary sacrifice to be made, with or without his loyalty. Or with Snape. Why do those fics not explore their complex relationship a bit more? I mean, I'd imagine it being complex, Snape, like Dumbledore, (almost) going dark and stepping away at the last minute, BUT it could be argued this was for the 'wrong reason' sooo.... surely Dumbledore must've had thoughts about that? Or reflecting on his cold treatment of Snape earlier yet having to work alongside him. Or his ideas about how sometimes 'we sort too soon'? I don't remember any fics where that was touched on, so if anyone knows any, that'd be nice
