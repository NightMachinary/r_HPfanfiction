  in canon he literally was almost a Dark Lord

That's a stretch, I think. I think a close reading of the text shows that he would not have ever become a Dark Lord. He spent a couple weeks to a couple months planning questionable things, of course, and that is definitely bad, but it is also a far far cry from actually doing those things without remorse. Dumbledore barely dipped his toes into the Dark Lord pool --- and he knew all summer he was deluding himself about what Grindelwald really was, but he kept lying to himself that everything was fine. He hid from reality until reality slapped him in the face. Whether it was his family or other victims, Dumbledore always would have realized this violent cruel game was not for him. The point of Dumbledore's backstory with Grindelwald is not to realize he could have been a Dark Lord, but to realize he is and always has been a huge coward.
