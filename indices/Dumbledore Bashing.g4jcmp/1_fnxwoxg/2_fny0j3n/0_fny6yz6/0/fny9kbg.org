I don't agree with calling Dumbledore "a huge coward". The ability to turn back from the dark side after Ariana's death is a hallmark of his courage not cowardice. He took the right decision to abandon Grindenwald. And right decisions are never easy. In the main story he pleaded a friend to kill him so that a child's heart is not tainted with murder! Yes, he was dying anyway. But if what he did to give Draco a chance of redemption is not courage I don't know what is! He might have been foolish sometime but never coward!
