  The ability to turn back from the dark side after Ariana's death is a hallmark of his courage not cowardice.

I agree with you. I tried to keep my comment short, because otherwise it would have turned into a 2-6 part comment, lo.. I do think Dumbledore has, at times, been one of the bravest characters in the show. My main point of my previous comment was to shift people's thinking of Dumbledore's character into the realm of cowardice/bravery rather than Dark Lord/Manipulator. I think people have a hard time seeing the more mundane human-like emotions when they are talking about him in relation to becoming a Dark Lord. Your comment makes me very happy, and I'm very glad you responded.
