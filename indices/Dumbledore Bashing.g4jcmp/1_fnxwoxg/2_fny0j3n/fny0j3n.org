While I disagree with him being incompetent (I explained why in reply to another comment) I agree that often FF writers waste his great complexities that could make a great villain or antagonist (in canon he literally was almost a Dark Lord). I've never understood why they would take away all the nuance and character death in making Dumbledore a villain? Don't they know good villains have depth and motivations? I'd excuse it as them being young readers and writers but I know for a fact that a lot of the worst examples are middle aged women bashing a gay character in a badly written unhealthy slash fic. (this is a reference to a horrific time travel tomarry fic I once read by an author you can probably guess. Dumbledore got the dementor's kiss in it)
