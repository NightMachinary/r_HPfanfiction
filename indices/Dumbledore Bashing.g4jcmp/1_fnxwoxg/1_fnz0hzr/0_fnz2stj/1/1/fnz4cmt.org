Nah - Dumbledore is not perfect, and treating him as though he is would be bad narrative. He makes a lot of mistakes throughout the books - though many simply due to narrative reasons to let Harry be the reason.

We can acknowledge that Dumbledore had major flaws and that his plan for Harry was a callous one - but still not go into bashing. I agree that bashing is invariably the lazy approach, and it's very hard to find a good fic involving it (and instead it's /despite/ it). But let's not swing too much the other way! ;)
