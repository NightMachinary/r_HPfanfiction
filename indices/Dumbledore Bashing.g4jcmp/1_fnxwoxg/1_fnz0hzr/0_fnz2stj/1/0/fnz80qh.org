I don't know man, maybe there was a Temple in Egypt where you could summon an aspect of Anubis who would have removed the Soul Shard (I am probably using that in one story)

But I agree, to the best of Dumbledore's knowledge, and he seems to have spent more than a few years doing research, that was the only way, I completely disagree with the bashing, I see where people come from, because the way he went about was very traumatic to Harry, and often increased his suffering(the isolation and lack of information), I even agree when people write that some aspects of it blindside Dumbledore until someone throws it on his face, I, however, don't think he was doing it with malice, just ignorance.

I think Dumbledore is just hard to write because he is nuanced, so people want to reduce him to a one dimensional character because it's easier to write, imagine a story where we have a version of Canon!Dumbledore playing 3D chess with a Harry who is smart and assumes Dumbledore is trying to kill him, or even a Harry who is going Darker(as in Grey) and does his best to get out of his influence. Two people who are not evil but whose goals are contrary to each other.
