I think we can be pretty sure that if there had been another way to do it, Dumbledore would have figured it out. He has Harry's best interest in mind.

This is what makes Dumbledore bashing so infuriating. The fanfic author makes up an alternate, non-canon way to get rid of the horcrux and then bashes Dumbledore for not doing it. It's moving the goalposts!!! Often combined with the narrative calling him stupid and bashing canon for not just going to Gringotts and doing the super duper powerful horcrux killing ritual that they've just made up!!

Maybe you can tell that I'm annoyed by this. Bashing is always lazy and stupid. And bad writing.
