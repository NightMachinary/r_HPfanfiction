I believe the leading theory was that the sacrifice of Harry's life, which mirrored Lily's in many aspects, bolstered the blood protection and created a weaker version around those he sacrificed himself for. It wasn't as strong as a mother's love, but it was still there. The books have many moments in the final battle where people survive impossible odds, for example.

In any case, when Harry was hit by the killing curse, both him and the Horcux went to Limbo, where Dumbledore had remained. The scene spells out clearly what happens - Harry was hit with one curse, and he still had the lingering protection on him, which was also entwined with Voldemort's body, which juxtaposed the two souls and allowed the one with more agency (=himself, as he is a human and the horcrux some weird baby thing) to choose life, while leaving the other behind.

So he returned to his body and the Horcux was destroyed.
