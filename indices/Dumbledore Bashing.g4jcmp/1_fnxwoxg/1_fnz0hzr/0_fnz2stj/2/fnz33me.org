We don't know what Dumbledore is doing offscreen most of the series, so he could have been researching alternatives. As for not telling Harry, Harry /had/ to willingly let himself take the curse believing he would die in order to survive. If he thought he'd survive he wouldn't. Knowing that I can see why Dumbledore waited to tell him, so that he wouldn't have months or years agonizing over the decision.
