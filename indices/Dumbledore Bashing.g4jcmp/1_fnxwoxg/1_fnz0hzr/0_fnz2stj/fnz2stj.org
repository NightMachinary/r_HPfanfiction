I don't accept that it's the only way to kill him. Magic is powerful and varied enough to make other options possible - but JKR just wanted that to be the way to go, which makes it difficult to say - because, well, author fiat can make it seem like that's the only way. But a human horcrux is unique enough that we just don't know all that much about it, after all.

Even if that's the case, it's still pretty callous to have a plan involving Harry's death, and not telling him about it - while seemingly not investigating other methods.
