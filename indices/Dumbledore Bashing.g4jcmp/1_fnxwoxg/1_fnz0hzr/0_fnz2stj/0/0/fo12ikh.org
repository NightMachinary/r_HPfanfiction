Harry's protection doesn't do anything to Voldemort's soul, though. It burns the body, and in the instant of its creation could turn the killing curse, but it never acted upon the soul, only Voldemort's corporeal form and his influence over mortal flesh was affected.

We see this by the fact that Horcruxes can be touched by him without any ill effects to the item or the soul within.

The scarcrux is such a weird case because a horcrux takes over any host body it can - as seen with the diary or Nagini. Nagini is a human that could turn into a snake that has lost the ability to return to being human, and her entire being was corrupted.

If anything, the blood shield managed to prevent Voldemort's horcrux from exerting its influence over Harry, but it was never strong enough to affect it directly.
