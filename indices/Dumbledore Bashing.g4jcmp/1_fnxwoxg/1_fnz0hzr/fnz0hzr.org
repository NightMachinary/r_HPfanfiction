For the convolutedness of the plan:

It was really the only way to destroy him. Canon doesn't have convenient goblin horcrux extractors, even basilisk venom directly inside his bloodstream did nothing.

A vessel has to he destroyed beyond repair, that necessitates death.

Was there really a choice? Like, critically thinking about it, was there? We never want to be in a dilemma like this, basically a modified version of the trolley problem, byt exponentially more difficult. Studies have shown that some people would make the choice, some would run away, and some would do nothing.

If there is even a snowball's chance in hell that Harry survives through some bullshit technicality, I can't fault Dumbledore for risking it. I mean, the worst that can happen is he dies anyway.

But he /must/ die. Without his death, Voldemort appears again and again and again. If he is imprisoned he simply kills himself. Dementors obey him. He's the strongest wizard on earth.

Hell, Dumbledore even remained in Limbo to level with Harry and inform him of the choice he might have, or to accompany him into the afterlife instead of rejoining his family there right after he died.
