Draught of Living Death. Canon, Book 1. Thank you.

For all that one should not decry and discard estabilished rules of the setting, one should not go to the other extremes and acclaim the method chosen in canon as the only possible one out of a wide variety of others that the very same material makes available. Such as a sleeping potion that requires a very specific antidote and has the potential to keep its target in a state of suspended animation indefinitely.
