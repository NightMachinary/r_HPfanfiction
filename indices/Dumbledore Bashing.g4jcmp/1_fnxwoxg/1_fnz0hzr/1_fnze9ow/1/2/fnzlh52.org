It entirely possible he has made himself immune to it but until you know it for sure it's still an option, you might not be able to make yourself immune to it. It could easily be delivered with actual physical weapons(Sword, Bow+Arrow, Gun).

You could do it while he's distracted, read a fic do this while Volde was sleeping and take him to the place where the locket horcrux should've been.

And even if you could beat him in combat that wouldn't negate his horcruxes you'd still need to track them down, with the draught you could avoid that.

Your example falls into the same trap you mentioned why would I curse his soul into insanity, I'd argue he's already insane and/or this could make him a lot more dangerous, why wouldn't I just use Avada or another lethal spell to kill him instantly. I would have to track down the horcruxes quickly in this scenario.
