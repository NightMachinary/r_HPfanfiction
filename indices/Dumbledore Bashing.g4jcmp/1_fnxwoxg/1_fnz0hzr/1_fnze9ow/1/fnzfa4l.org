You're a fool if you think Voldemort didn't immunize himself to that sort of potion.

Not to mention, how do you even get it into him?

If you can beat him in open combat, then you don't need the potion. And nobody can do that, not even Dumbledore.

If you can give him a potion, then you can do things that are a lot more destructive, like cursing his soul into insanity or something.

This argument is like saying you don't need to fight a battle because the enemy general is vulnerable to poisoning. I mean, yeah, obviously, but that doesn't help one iota.
