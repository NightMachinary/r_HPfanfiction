I disagree here.\\
Dumbledore was able to go spell for spell with Voldemort, the problem was not truly winning a battle. It was not allowing the conflict to become a war of attrition, because Dumbledore had to defend normal people who were not particularly determined to fight to begin with, while Voldemort would just recruit another bunch of wackjobs or a discriminated against group.

When given an opportunity, Voldemort ran. That part is well documented. problem was restricting his escape options.

Now Voldemort had two things going for him: horcruxes and prophesy that said X would defeat him. So, the objective here is to take Voldemort down long enough to administer the potion - possibly forcing a rebirth so that physical characteristics could be disregarded. Defeating Voldemort permanently was prevented because a, prophecy and b, horcruxes were hidden at that time. The goal here would be to stall until the Light champion was ready.

But after attack on Potters there was a ten year period of free action, and with Fawkes, Dumbledore could have theoretically appeared just as Voldie was emerging from the cauldron - or even as a babyform - stun it, feed it the potion (r just portkey it to a room with unpotted young mandrake) and work on researching a more permanent solution. Or even possibly with Quirrelmort.
