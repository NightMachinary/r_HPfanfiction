I remember discussing this recently. Anyway, I would really like to see a fic where Dumbledore actually tries to manipulate adult ministry workers and Wizengamot members and not just school children. I'd like to see a Dumbledore who just wants to keep the peace and tries to appease Voldemort. There is a precedent- some British were against war with Germany in the '30s. Particularly Neville Chamberlain who is still a controversial figure. It's boring that every manipulative/ evil Dumbledore fic has him steal Harry's wealth and plan to have him die in battle.

I don't know why in fanfiction Dumbledore often refuses to kill Death Eaters. Wasn't that a Batman thing? Anyway, one possible justification I've come up with is that he probably taught lots of the older Death Eaters and no matter how bad they are now he still sees them as students and can't bring himself to kill them.
