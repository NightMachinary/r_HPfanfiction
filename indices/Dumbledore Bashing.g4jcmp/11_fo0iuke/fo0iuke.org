The saying "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" is applicable to Dumbledore. And it's easy to make that case going from his canon behavior, including failing to ensure Harry's care given his family's contributions and sacrifice, his failure to ensure good education at Hogwarts (Snape, Binns, Umbridge, the DADA curse/lack of good teachers, not preventing bullying), and his willful need to give too many chances even if it endangers innocents (Draco's actions in trying to kill Dumbledore endangered others criminally). It's an easy AU to make it more extreme, so easy that it can fall into the realm of bashing and badfic.
