The series would really have benefited in my opinion by having a few incidents where we are shown Dumbledore fulfilling his multiple roles. Him being called abroad to be the supreme Mugwump and it having some influence on something. Harry visiting Dumbledore by only finding mountains upon mountains of paperwork. Something that really showed that Dumbeldore is always busy and have someone like McGonagall argue with him about taking on too much. That way it makes it easier to see how things can slip through the cracks.
