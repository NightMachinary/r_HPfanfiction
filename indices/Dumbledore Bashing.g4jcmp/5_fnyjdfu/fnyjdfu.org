Here's the problem of Dumbledore. As we get him in the books, his character is inherently flawed by the premise of the story. If he were doing his job, Harry would never get the chance to be the protagonist, especially in the first few books.

In the end, you can either treat him like a character, or as plot device, but not really both. In the first books he makes a lot of decisions that make no sense, outside of "the plot wills it" and "JKR hadn't invented that magic yet". In the last several books, JKR decided to make him an actual character, but what we were told about the Dumbledore of the last several books doesn't mesh with the Dumbledore we saw in the first few. On top of that, half of the needless conflict in books 5 and 6 could have been shortcut by actually communicating with Harry, and his grand plan for Harry in book 7 had Harry committing suicide by Voldemort, with a mere hunch that Harry /might/ survive it. It doesn't take a whole lot of work to twist things into the point where Dumbledore has to be evil, incompetent or both.

That last statement is the bane of nearly every Dumbledore bashing story I've read. It might not take a /lot/ of work to twist the story (and let me be clear: they are twisting the story, and taking things out of context), but you have to do more work than "Harry sat down a made the same list he's made in 5000 other fics"
