From the Watsonian perspective of a Harry that per canon was "Dumbledore's man through and through", and who had come to understand him as a flawed, but great man, Albus works fine.

From the perspective of a reader, who wants to fit the Watsonian perspective of Dumbledore over the whole series? The cracks start to show.

Add to that, we have over a decade of fridge brilliance (when you go to the fridge, and think "wait a minute") and fridge horror, and and it becomes pretty easy to convince someone that those cracks hide a very gnarly truth, and that Harry named his kid after two people who were responsible for a great deal of the pain in his childhood and teenage life.
