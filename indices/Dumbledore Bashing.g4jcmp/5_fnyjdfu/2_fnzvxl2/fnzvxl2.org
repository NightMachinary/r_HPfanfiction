The problem with the books in general is that the first 3 books are bog standard boarding school adventure books for children. Then there's a big tonal shift in book 4, making it into a strange mix between children and YA that kind of wants to be a serious book for adults.

The character of Dumbledore that we see in the end didn't exist before book 5.
