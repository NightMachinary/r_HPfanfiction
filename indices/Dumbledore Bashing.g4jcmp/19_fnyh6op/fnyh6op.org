To me, bashing comes off as really immature regardless of who's being bashed, especially when it's for no reason other than the author hating the character. Like some other people said, fan fictions ten to be black and white with no in-between. Every character in HP has good and bad qualities and yes Dumbledore has made many mistakes, and done dark things for the greater good but so has everyone else. It makes no sense to me how a lot of people hate Dumbledore but they love Snape. Snape sort of redeemed himself a little in the end due to his sacrifice but that doesn't change the fact that he's still joined Voldemort by choice which means that he also believed in that whole nonsense too.
