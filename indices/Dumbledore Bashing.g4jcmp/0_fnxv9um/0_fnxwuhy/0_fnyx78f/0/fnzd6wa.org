The list is actually quite long if one cares to look, but Dumbledore is a convenient target because not only is he magically powerful, intelligent and capable, he is also old, respected and politically powerful (that, or given a bunch of important sounding but hollow titles so that he can be blamed, but not act- a fun avenue to explore).

He also had opportunities to change the world, being part of Main 7 plot, as well as Fantastic Beasts (correct me if I'm wrong).

Additional reason behind Dark Lord Dumbledore is that he easily could have been.Before you pull out your pitchforks... We have testimony of Bathilda Bagshot regarding his childhood - it was not some great epiphany that turned him away from that path, but his sister. He would have many other chances at redemption even if that was averted, but would he take them? A topic ripe for discussion.

Next we have his high degree of influence over Harry, and the way people often exaggerate his treatment at the Dursleys as well as degree of knowledge and influence Dumbledore had there.

Finally, we have the way he is portrayed in the Main 7, again. He is alternatively portrayed as a shining beacon of light, hope and forgiveness, and a man past his prime, stretched too thin across his many positions, across his many games. The first invokes in some fans "Love the heroes, but love to see them fall more". The other?

This is my main grudge against Dumbledore.He was filling too many positions, of which each would count as a full-time job if done properly. After he was lured out of the castle with the pretense of urgent summons to the Ministry in Book 1 he should have started looking into replacements. It proved, after all, that such could be used against him to the detriment of his charges, and while Dumbledore freely admits to his mistakes and even apologizes...

We do not see a lot in the way of making up for those. Unfortunately. We see him stop doing bad stuff, but never be proactive about good stuff. Even if we disregard the Gordian Knot of cold cases, rumours and whispers that included the Stone, Hallows, Chamber, Sirius Black and others...

My respect for Dumbledore died in Book 6. Because it was then that this old man, whose very presence acted like a shield for those who trusted him, who held many key positions that had no clear succession - decided he'd sacrifice himself for Draco Malfoy. (And yes, the ring... That is still a year for some political shuffling, and other arrangements.)

By placing almost all of the Light's hopes on his own shoulders and the remainder on Harry's... When he went down, so did their hopes. They lost not only their leader, but also their heart.
