Yes, the plot was enjoyable. Good story.

But my problem was that Dumbledore first sheltered his people, then abruptly vanished. That meant they had to grow, mature and step up very quickly, not having had time to grow into their roles.

They were left with a pair of too-big boots to fill, and no giant to lend them a shoulder to stand on. Sink or swim. This is thing that happens, no doubt. But if something can be easily prevented, I usually feel compulsion to do so. Should I project my expectations on a fictional character? Probably not. But I had an opportunity to crawl before having to run, and for that I will forever be grateful.
