I have wrote about it in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][my review]] of linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities;Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities). I think it is the case of the teenage moral reversion, where everything good is suspected to be bad. Notice that good bashing usually means that all good guys (Dumbledore, McGonagall, Weasleys) are suspicious, whereas bad (first of all Snape, Percy Weasley, but sometimes even Voldemort, Bellatrix, Lucius Malfoy) are in fact good. {Sna,Dra,*}mione and Dark!Harry fits in the same category, I am afraid.
