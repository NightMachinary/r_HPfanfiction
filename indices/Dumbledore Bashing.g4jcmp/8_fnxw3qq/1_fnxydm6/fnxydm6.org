Exactlly!! He should have been much more complex and subtle but even the canon failed at this in various occations, using him merely as a tool to put an end to the unresolved suspenses.

But efforts to complete the character can be seen in the latter books, where his own past was unveiled, so personally IÂ´d say it would be interesting to write something on how he was hit by true remorse with the death of Ariana and split with Gridleward, but somehow clung to the Greater Good with a slightly different interpretation later in his life.
