I disagree that Dumbledore is "best written character" in the Books.

On the contrary, he's the archetypal dumbed down plot device in a children's series. His actions border on criminal incompetence, negligence, and dereliction of duty.

Plenty of readers saw through the charade of the in-book propaganda such as "the wisest wizard" and "the greatest headmaster", and they write Dumbledore accordingly in their fanfics.

Unfortunately, dumbing down a dumbed down plot device character further is not conducive of making the story better. Here I disagree vehemently with these authors. *I'd like to see a Dumbledore who's up to this game, who faces great odds against both Voldemort and a malicious Ministry, and who makes mistakes but agonized over them.*

We need more fics that cast Dumbledore in a better light and bash the true enemies: Voldemort, Death Eaters, and the Ministry.
