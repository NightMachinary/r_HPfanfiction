I disagree , to the notion of him being incompetent in the early books. In the first book there is plenty of evidence in text of him orchestrating the events of the novel, not in a sinister way, but to test Harry and get a gauge on LV. Whether this is wise, is another question.

In the second book, while he knows who is doing the attacks, he has no way of knowing how, and his hands are tied by other means. As Harry is the MC and quite heroic it makes sense that he answers the hero's call and solves the mystery and defeats the basilik.

As for the third and fourth books, its mostly the same deal. As he isn't omnipotent and omniscient he has no way of knowing Moody is being impersonated as BC Jr. does a rather good impersonation and Dumbledore is quite otherwise occupied.

I think a lot of the disconnect to Dumbledore being dumbed down is that he often seems to wear a silly facade.

I think a lot of the bashing stems from him placing Harry with the Dursley's. Ideal? Fuck no. However what other options does he really have? In canon there is no other option that keeps Harry safe from the Death Eaters and eventually LV. The "solutions" to this problem in fanfic almost always fall apart under further inspection and what we know of how canon magic/ world building works. Given the choice between emotional abuse (which he doesn't know the worst of bc Harry isn't forthcoming with any details) and a child dying a gruesome horrific death what is the ethical choice there?

As for him plotting Harry's death I think that's oversimplifies canon.Dumbledore does not want Harry to die. He suspects he might have to (which he does) and dreads it to such a degree that he arguably puts off far too long telling Harry about prophecies and horcruxes. It's a flaw but an endearing one.
