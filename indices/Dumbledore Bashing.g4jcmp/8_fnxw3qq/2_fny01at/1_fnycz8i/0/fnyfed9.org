Plenty of death eaters just gave up when Voldemort failed, Sirius seemingly blew up a street and when the aurors came said he killed them, we know he was just blaming himself for getting them to use Peter, but when you combine it all it's pretty convincing.

Clearly he betrayed his friend (noone else could have after all) in the name of his true master, but when he saw that it was for nothing he simply fled. Then Peter tracked him down looking to avenge them, but Peter was never as good as his friends, everyone knew that, so naturally he lost.
