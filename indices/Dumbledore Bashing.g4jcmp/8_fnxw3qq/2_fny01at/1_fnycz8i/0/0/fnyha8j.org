Yeah I know Sirius saying he did it is very convincing, which is completely fine if that was only information Dumbledore had on Sirus being in that situation, however it isn't. Dumbles knew that was after the motorbike Harry incident though. When you examine it through the lens of logical mature level, if you are a fanatic follower, you betray your best friends, then your leader dies by this kid. You're first instinct is to....give up the kid willingly and also give your motorbike so he can be sped away quickly? No Bellatrix, Barty, etc.'s first instinct would have been to kill the kid or steal him and certainly not give him up. But apparently in Dumbles mind, Sirus the traitor just said oh well, I just betrayed my best friends for my lord and my best friend's kid just killed him, guess I'll just give him up, you guys won after all, Imma go cause more mayhem. Sure Dumbles probably just got caught in the moment, but at no point from getting caught up in the moment to 12 years down the line did he reexamine that night and say wait a minute things don't add up...
