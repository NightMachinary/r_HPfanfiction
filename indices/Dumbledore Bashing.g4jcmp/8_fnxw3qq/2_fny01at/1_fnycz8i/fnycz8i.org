I don't see Dumbledore as evil, sometimes incompetent but most assuredly he's an asshole, in my opinon. Reminder that when Snape first told Dumbledore Lily and James were going to be targeted, Dumbledore's first spoken response wasn't "Thanks Severus for the info, or I'll get them to safety..." It was "What will you give me in return?" Also, "Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy..."

Dumbledore bashing also stems from the fact that at no time did Dumbles believe Sirius was innocent or tried to help him prior to the events in POA. Even though in the first scene of the first book Hagrid mentions the fact that Sirius didn't fight at all about giving Harry up to him, he even gave him his motorbike. Does that make Dumbledore incompetent? In some sense yes it does to me, because where is the logical jump from Sirius killed Harry's parents so Voldemort could get Harry to Sirius put up no resistance whatsoever when Hagrid came to collect Harry.

Dumbledore says there was no better option without exploring them, I mean yes obviously this is children's story, but most fan fictions are not from the perspective of a "children's story" It adapts it to a more mature audience and exploring these, holes in logic, are interesting I think. It does result in a lot of bashing, we don't really see what happens if Dumbledore does explore other options. A lot of bashing is lowbrow, but there are perfectly valid criticisms against his character, in my opinion that people don't articulate too well.
