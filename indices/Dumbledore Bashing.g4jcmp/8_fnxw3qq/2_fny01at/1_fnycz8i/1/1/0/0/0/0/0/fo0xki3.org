To me this says less about Dumbledore's forgiveness in others vs his willingness to do absolutely whatever is necessary to stop Voldemort. If Draco had actually killed two kids, Dumbles probably would have just let him so he could make Voldemort think he wasn't in on their plan. After all Dumbles is perfectly willing to let Harry be raised in the shitty situation of living under some stairs, and sacrificing this kid just so he can defeat Voldemort.
