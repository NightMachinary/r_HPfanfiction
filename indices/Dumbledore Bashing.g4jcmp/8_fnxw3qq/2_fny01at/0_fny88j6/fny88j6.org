  In the first book there is plenty of evidence in text of him orchestrating the events of the novel,

I'm curious what this plentiful evidence is. I don't mean to be contradictory or anything, I just genuinely don't consider the first book detailed enough to have any evidence whatsoever, much less plentiful evidence. I'm not saying that this means Dumbledore did or did not do certain things, I only mean to say that I do not see there being evidence one way or the other. In fact, I would argue that the only evidence is Harry /believing/ that Dumbledore was helped them, and that is not evidence at all. I would even say that all the plot points that get Harry into that chamber are so incredibly coincidental that even if Dumbledore were behind them, Harry has no reason to realize this, so he has no reason to make that statement at all.

Again, I'm not arguing that Dumbledore did or did not do things. My personal belief is just that the background plot is not actually very well written. I think we are /probably/ meant to understand that Dumbledore was behind everything, but if you honestly look at the plot, it because really confusing how he possibly could have.

  I think a lot of the bashing stems from him placing Harry with the Dursley's.

Dumbledore, as a character, is in a sticky intersection that makes it hard for readers to relate to him. Most people, especially young readers, side with the underdog. Dumbledore is in a position of power, therefore, he is not the underdog. The series also brings his morality and trust-worthiness into question, and while those are arguably showed to be red herrings to the truth, many readers take this things at face value and use this information as permission to believe that anything Dumbledore says as a lie. Therefore, him showing emotions and being vulnerable are not interpreted as genuine or valid emotions, but "tactics" and "schemes". Maybe /a/ authority figure can be seen as being emotional and vulnerable, but Dumbledore is reserved and stoic, and those are not viewed as raw enough to be convincing to people who are already inclined to not believe him.

There are honestly a LOT of reasons, but those are just some of my thoughts.
