As I said in my previous comment, I believe the reader is meant to consider Harry's statement true. My problem is that Harry himself has no reason to come to that conclusion. The things that made him go to the chamber are coincidences, most of it was him overhearing Quirrell talking by happening to pass him as Quirrell was talking to himself in empty rooms. For Harry to say that Dumbledore is behind it all is for him to think that Dumbledore has control over the words Quirrell says (not to mention the timing of when Harry walks by), which makes no sense for Harry to think, and it also brings into question the cohesiveness of the entire premise of the book and series, but that's a different problem.

To be absolutely clear, I /do think/ we're meant to believe Harry, because it's a children's book and JKR had no reason to think anyone would take a second look at her plot. That is why I think the real flaw is the plotting. If JKR or the editor wrote and edited that book now, I think there /would/ be plentiful evidence that supports Harry's statement. But the way the book is written, there is no /evidence/ that Dumbledore had anything to do with it /except/ for Harry's bizarre belief that he did (which I don't think counts as real evidence in the strictest legal sense). If Harry had not said that line of dialogue, then no reader would have thought Dumbledore was behind it because there is /nothing/ to make the reader think that. Except, of course, Harry's line of dialogue.
