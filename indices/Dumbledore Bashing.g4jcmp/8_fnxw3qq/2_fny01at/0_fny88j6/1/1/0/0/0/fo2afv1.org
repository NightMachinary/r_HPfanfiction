Ah yes. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian "the only person Voldemort was afraid of" Dumbledore was completely unable to take down the Dark Lord despite dueling him to a literal standstill when Harry was just 15....and that was after Voldie got his body back. I figure it would have been easier to stop him while he was a wraith.
