  Making sure Harry's first contact with the wizarding world was a friendly half-giant that can't keep a secret?

My point is, how does the reader know this was Dumbledore's intention to do this? This is an assumption the fandom makes to the point it has become fact, but where /in the books/ does it ever suggest this?

Dumbledore doing things does not prove that he did those things with the express purpose of getting Harry into that chamber. I'm not interested in assumptions that every fan has decided they believe. I'm interested in /specific textual support/ from the books for why Dumbledore's motivations are specifically to get Harry into that chamber during that school year.
