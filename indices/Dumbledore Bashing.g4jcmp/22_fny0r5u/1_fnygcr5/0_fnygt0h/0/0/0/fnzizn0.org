I first read it when it was already finished, so I didn't have that experience. It certainly gets more serious over time, but that's true of the canon books as well. I periodically reread some of my favourite chapters, and I don't find there's a jarring difference between the later ones and the earlier ones.

I do agree about the story being a bit too long, particularly the parts that deal with student battles, but in the grand scheme of things I think that's a pretty minor sin.
