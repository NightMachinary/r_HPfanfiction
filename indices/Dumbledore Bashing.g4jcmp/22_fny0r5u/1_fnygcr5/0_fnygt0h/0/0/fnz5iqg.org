I can't speak for the person you were talking to before, but HPMOR was the or one of the first fics I read. At the time I remember really liking it and I ended up following it through to the end... although, I think I left it for ages and came back to find it finished. These days I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. And the main reason for this is because it started off as a satire (what happens if a rational character meets an irrational world) and evolved into an earnest take down of canon's philosophy using concepts that do not exist in canon. That's a big change in what the story is.

I'm not sure I'd call it outright dreadful. Seriously misleading, certainly. Too long? Definitely. But the main thing I remember people taking issue with, i.e. Draco's suggesting that he'd rape (iirc) Hermione, is something the text quite specifically used Harry to criticise.
