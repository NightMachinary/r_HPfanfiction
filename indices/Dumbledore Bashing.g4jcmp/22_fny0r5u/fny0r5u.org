I'll just point out that he is definitely a flawed but interesting character in Methods of Rationality. But it's a long story that a lot of people hate, so mentioning it attracts downvotes like flies.

And I think that a lot of his failings in canon can be best explained by remembering that he has half a dozen important jobs to do, so anything that isn't obviously urgent may be neglected.
