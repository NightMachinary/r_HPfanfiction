WHile I don't think I finished MoR I didn't mid Dumbledore in that fic so much. If it was bad, it wasn't offensively so, and I do not recall it. I like the idea of him being a great teacher, an inspired warrior and figurehead, bit not a particularly good headmaster. Headmaster is a mostly boring job, and some brilliant teachers IRL are quite miserable and bad at it.
