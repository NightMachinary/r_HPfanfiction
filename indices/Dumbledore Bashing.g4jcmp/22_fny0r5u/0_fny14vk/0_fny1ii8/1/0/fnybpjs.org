Did you happen to reach chapter 122, where Harry looks back over the past year and concludes that he's a walking disaster and a complete idiot, that the world has been extremely lucky to have survived and owes much more to Dumbledore's "cryptic madness" than to himself, that he's been just smart enough to have the right words to describe his own epic failings, and that he really hopes to have enough time to grow up into the person he needs to be?

There is a reason, after all, that the author is part of a community titled /Less Wrong/. Because the premise is that everyone does a lot of stupid things, including the people who can recognise and label those stupidities in themselves, and the hope is simply to do a bit better than before.
