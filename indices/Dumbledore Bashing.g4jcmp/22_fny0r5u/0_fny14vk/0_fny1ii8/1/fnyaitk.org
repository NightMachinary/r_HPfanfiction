This is an aside from the topic of the post, but I personally didn't love MoR because I found it often betrayed its premise, leaning too much on edginess and not enough on rationality. Like the bad guy was obviously the bad guy, all the evidence supported him being the bad guy and using the methods of rationality Harry should have anticipated him being the bad guy by chapter 2, yet Harry never actually seems to /use/ methods of rationality. He name-drops complex philosophical and scientific theories every paragraph but very rarely seems to apply them to actual magic, learning, or adversity in common sense ways. It would be fine if the fic itself and Harry weren't so preachy about using rationality all the time--the hypocrisy was a little much for me. That's just my two cents about why it was frustrating to me. Dumbledore was fine though.

Edit: I also feel like the story is subject to a higher level of scrutiny and criticism than other fanfiction works because the author has sold copies and profited from the story.
