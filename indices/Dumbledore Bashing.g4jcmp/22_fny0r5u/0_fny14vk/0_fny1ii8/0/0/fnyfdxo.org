I was referring to Harry's characterisation in MoR, yes (although actually, canon Harry, while not arrogant, is often rude).

1. In context this could actually have been pretty well in character. Harry was clearly pretty sensitive about the issue of investigating child abuse complaints, which he attributed to having read quite a bit about them, and it certainly isn't unusual for an eleven-year-old boy to lack self control. It's very unlike canon!Harry, yes, but then again, canon!Harry spent his entire childhood being told, through words and actions, to keep his head down and try to be ignored. This Harry didn't.

2. Not having read all of canon might be a hindrance, but it's not automatically a fatal one. I gather that the author had read enough fanfiction to grasp the key points; if his characterisation of Snape ended up a bit closer to fanon than canon as a result, that isn't an automatic write-off. (And honestly, Snape withholding information in a way that makes Harry much more likely to fail his secret test of character, then piling on criticism, is pretty accurate; just consider Harry's Occlumency lessons.)
