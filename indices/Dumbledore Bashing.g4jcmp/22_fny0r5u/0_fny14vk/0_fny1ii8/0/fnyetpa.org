In this fic? Yes. In canon? Not so much.

What really put me off MoR were:

1. Harry's absolute meltdown in front of McGonagall in an early part of the fic like goddamn son get ahold of yourself.
2. Snape, seeking self-justification, deliberately withholds evidence to get Harry's opinion, and then when it doesn't come out to his liking, proceeds to emotionally bomb Harry with the missing piece, being that the scenario presented actually involved Snape himself.

Also, the author freely admitted he hadn't even read all of the series but proceeded to blithely write his idea of Snape's and Lily's relationship anyway.
