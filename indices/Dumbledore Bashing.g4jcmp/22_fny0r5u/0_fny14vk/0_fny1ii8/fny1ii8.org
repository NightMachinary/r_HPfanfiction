I think what mostly offends people is Harry himself. He is undeniably arrogant and often rude, wanting to help his fellow men but not actually having much respect for most of them.

But the storyline does repeatedly kick him in the backside for that. And his thoroughly different childhood does justify a very different personality. And even when he's wrong, his views are thought-provoking.
