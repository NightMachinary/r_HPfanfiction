Mild MoR spoilers below:

If you didn't read through to the end, then you didn't really get to see Dumbledore's character. An awful lot is revealed in the last few chapters that gives context to his actions throughout the story. Whether it justifies the 100+ chapters it takes to get there is a matter of taste, but it is a very interesting take that I haven't seen in any other stories.
