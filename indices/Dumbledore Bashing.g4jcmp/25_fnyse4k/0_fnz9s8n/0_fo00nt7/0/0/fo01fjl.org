Everyone in Slytherine is Gay! Hermione somehow manages to be a pureblood supremacist for the Light side! Ron has the IQ of a piece of toast! Everyone got payed to be friends with Harry! The Weasley clan's secret have never failed Love Potion!

I'm not going to lie. Those stories are a lot of fun to read parts of when I'm in the mood.
