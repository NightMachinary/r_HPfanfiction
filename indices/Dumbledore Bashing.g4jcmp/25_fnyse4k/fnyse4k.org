Honestly some of the best fanfics I've seen for Harry Potter have had zero Dumbledore bashing, and have him more as a mentor for Harry that really molds his character. Most people just use Dumbledore bashing as a crutch, a long with bashing Ron, Molly, and/or Ginny. I cant count the number of fics I've seen end their summary with Dumbles and selective Weasley bashing.
