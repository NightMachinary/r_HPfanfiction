Bashing is bad writing and bad writing is integral to the very fabric of the medium of fanfiction. Fanfiction isn't really meant for good writing or compelling stories, even if it can sometimes produce those. It's mostly an outlet for fans to explore their own fantasies of versions of events that happened in the books. Fantasies don't generally make for good writing. I've learned to get over the stupid cliche fanfic tropes I don't enjoy, and focus on the trashy cliche fanfic tropes I do enjoy, like Harry travelling back in time and fixing all his mistakes! I think it's okay to indulge in bad writing that doesn't make sense sometimes. :D
