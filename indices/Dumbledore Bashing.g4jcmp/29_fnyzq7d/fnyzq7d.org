I'm not the biggest Dumbledore fan, but I think he is one of the most complex and well-written characters, in my opinion he's actually one of the best! I really do like his relationship with Harry and I genuinely believe he loved him and saw him as a son, but he did have to think of the greater good not only was he headmaster but the leader of the order. I feel like he felt his feelings for in the road of Grindlewald and he didn't want to see his feelings get in the way of stopping Voldemort. Not only that but he definitely blames himself for Ariana's death and probably feels similar towards Harry, idk that's just my take
