Okay here's my take.

/Added paragraph topic key/ 1 - Personal disagreement with OP assertions (irrelevant to Dumbledore bashing) 2 - Dumbledore's Characterization 3 - Trap of Canonicity 4 - On Voldemort 5 - Personal Opinion of Dumbledore 6 - What classifies as Bashing (this one could be read first)

First I want to address something. I agree Dumbledore is a well written character in Harry Potter, one of the best even. I find it extremely faulty to claim he's one of the best in the genre.

Now, I want to really get into why Dumbledore is routinely bashed in fanfics. The main reason I find is his characterization, and things we see him do. Now whenever I read the books I find that Dumbledore is very manipulative, and that causes an issue and conflict with any sort of self-aware Harry. Dumbledore is responsible (in some way or another) for nearly* everything that happens to Harry. The exception being Harry being made into a horcrux. If Harry is self aware or really thinks about most of the things that happen they quickly tie into Dumbledore. Now personally, I read Dumbledore as manipulative as it's the only way I find his character to make sense, it's either that or he's comically incompetent. Now you look at what Dumbledore has done. He's put Harry with an abusive family and kept him there knowing full well how bad it was (that or all of the guards throughout the series are stupidly terrible at their jobs), he's also straight up ignored most the problems.

This issue is fine until you try to change Harry's character and keep the main story the same. The line you have to skirt is you can't have Harry figure out about Dumbledore's actions, I previously mentioned self-aware Harry as an cause this is because in many of the stories that Harry is smarter/cleverer/more independent, it becomes increasingly more difficult to justify Harry not figuring it out. Again the issue is, if Harry figures it out he has a direct reason to oppose Dumbledore, and Dumbledore can quickly become the biggest villain. You can't change Dumbledore's character too much either, because then a lot of his actions don't make sense and the story completely changes. As said earlier, he's responsible for practically everything that happens to Harry. The only ways out are to make the story vastly different, or to completely overhaul another character.

This lucky character is Voldemort. Now if you know me at all, you'll know I take issue with Voldemort. He is hands down the worst written character in Harry Potter, there is one other character that comes close and that's it. However from a fanfic writing perspective, this is great. The biggest way to fix the issue is to have Voldemort be a big enough bad guy that Harry works with Dumbledore anyway. This does still come with the risk of bashing Dumbledore just not as much. There is a lot of issues I could talk on with Voldemort, but this comment is long enough as is.

I do however find it relevant to put my opinion on Dumbledore's character. I love Dumbledore. But no matter what I can't read Dumbledore in non-manipulative manner. This is what makes Dumbledore such a good character in my opinion. The story is him versus Voldemort, I find that Dumbledore doesn't truly care about Harry as a person but as a piece in his game against Voldemort. Dumbledore isn't a good guy. He's aligned with the Protagonist, yes. But he's not a good person. Dumbledore is also not a bad guy. Dumbledore does what he believes is for the Greater Good, and he's actively doing everything he can to defeat Voldemort.

On the topic of bashing itself. I find that most bashing for Dumbledore is revealing manipulations and Harry opposing him because of it. The only books I've read that were labeled bashing and actually bashed to the point I though the label justified was Ron/Weasley bashing. I don't actively read books made to bash characters mind you so I may be off, but this is my anecdotal experience with people labeling. I don't think just making a character not on our protagonists side or even making them an antagonist counts as bashing and that what I used as my definition throughout this +essay+ comment. So it is worth noting we might differ on opinion at this core of the argument.
