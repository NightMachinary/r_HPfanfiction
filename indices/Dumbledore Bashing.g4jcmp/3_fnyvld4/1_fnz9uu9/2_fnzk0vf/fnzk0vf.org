Perhaps Surrey is warmer in November than here but if a 15 mo is left on my porch in the dead of the night, I'm calling the please-men for child endangerment. Of course nothing would come of it. I'm hoping the blanket was temperature charmed at least. Thank goodness Harry didn't wriggle/roll/crawl off the stoop. Besides, I agree with Professor McGonagall, a letter is not nearly enough.
