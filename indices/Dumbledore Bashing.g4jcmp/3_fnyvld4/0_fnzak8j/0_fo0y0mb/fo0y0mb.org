The question with second year is: Why weren't the aurors informed or the school locked down... Another fanfiction took that turn when harry reported killing the basilisk (can't remember the name...) because a whole generation could have been wiped out. Another thing is the dementor in book 3, I have read one where Lupin didnt take the train... "Well you could use this plot device to save Sirius but I clearly dont do anything myself"

No actions against the bullying, secret passages arent blocked after the resurrection...

Additions of plot devices like the fidelius or the unbreakable oath could have stopped dangerous teachers like Lockhart and Crouch as well...

Either Dumbledore is completely incompetent, overworked (but finds the time to build an obstacle course with the teachers) or evil.
