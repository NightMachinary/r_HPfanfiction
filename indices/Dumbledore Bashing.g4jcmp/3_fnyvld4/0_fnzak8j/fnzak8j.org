I agree, I find no explanation for the stone other than it was a bait, both to "test" Harry (debatable) and make Voldemort play his hand. I mean, most of the obstacle was outright silly, and clearly a series of tests rather actual protection. One fic even had the whole thing mocked by Nicolas simply making another Stone, another by him having multiple.

Second and Third years are much easier to justify as Dumbledore simply not being capable of solving the problems.

Fourth Year has making me believe Barty Crouch Jr. was a Mystique-level impersonator because he fooled close friends for a /year,/ there was no way he knew how to act or answer every question like Moody, did he use Legilimency, a Pensieve, how did Dumbledore never suspected? What about the Goblet? Was it tempered before? After?

Fifth Year forward is a downward spiral, with Harry being repeatedly screwed over and Dumbledore being unable and to Harry, unwilling to help him, even going as far as compounding his suffering with more isolation and lack of information.
