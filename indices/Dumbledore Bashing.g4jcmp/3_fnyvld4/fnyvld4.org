He's a well written character with depth, strengths and weaknesses, and fanfiction authors tend to write shallow characters.

But the biggest problem to me is to explain his actions in the books. How is he not evil, manipulative, or massively incompetent? From the first book he makes questionable decisions. Leaving Harry on a doorstep in a November night without even trying to communicate with the Dursleys? Good story, terrible decision. How about leaving Harry with a cursed scar, saying "scars can be useful"? Good story foreshadowing, another terrible decision. Leaving Harry in a situation he /knows/ will be difficult? Good story, etc.

If it's deliberate, then he's evil or manipulative, if not, then he's incompetent. How is the "obstacle course" in "Philosopher's Stone" a good idea? One fanfic questioned why he didn't just throw the stone in a drawer and slap a fidelius on it. The real explanation is that he's written to make a good story.
