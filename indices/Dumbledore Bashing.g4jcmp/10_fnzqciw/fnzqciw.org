I'm a Dumbledore basher. I've never posted a fic, but I've vented about him a lot. If you want a viewpoint from my side of the fence I'm willing to share. My main issue with him is near and dear to my heart. He forces Harry to live in an abusive environment.

Petunia aiming a skillet at a kid's head is canon and abusive. Vernon throwing Harry into a cupboard is canon and abusive as is that cupboard being the kid's bedroom. Letting a child use another child for a punching bag is abusive to both children.

Perhaps Dumbledore didn't know prior to Harry going to Hogwarts, I can understand that. Having never been unloved by adult family members, why would he assume Harry would be unloved by family? However, a student pleading to not go home after not seeing said family since September needs to be looked into, I don't care how amazing magic is, a child should get homesick. I know the school corporation I work for is not the only one that trains staff to watch for abuse and Harry gave Dumbledore a huge red flag right there that needed to be looked into.

Some people argue about Harry needing the blood wards. No, the blood wards were the best protection, but not the only option. Thank goodness Harry could dodge so well. Had Petunia's skillet connected, Harry could have gotten brain damage or worse. Harry repeatedly called Hogwarts home over Privet Drive, I'm surprised the wards worked at all.

This is one of my complaints and only my opinion of course, I don't speak for all Dumbledore bashers.
