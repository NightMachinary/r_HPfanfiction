As a rule, if you say something shouldn't happen ever then you're not thinking hard enough. For example, would you prefer he be tortured? Murdered? Physically and emotionally abused by a death eater? For pretty much any circumstance, you cannot say it's NEVER the right choice. That kind of thinking falls apart to any sort of logical critique.
