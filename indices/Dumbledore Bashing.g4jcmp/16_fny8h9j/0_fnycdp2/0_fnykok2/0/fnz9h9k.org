We never have any canon evidence Harry would be attacked until after Voldemort's return, most DEs were inactive or imprisoned, Voldemor implies some of them were okay with it remaining that way(they were rich and the system favored them).

This Blood Ward nonsense was a plot device invented because JKR realized keeping Harry with the Dursleys was criminal, and so needed a good reason for it, it's never explained how it worked, when it didn't it was left vague so it could cover any holes on the plot due to it.

The only reason he was attacked the moment the wards fell down was that Voldemort was back and waiting for it, other times Harry left the house, wandered around and nothing happened, or rather even under said shielding the Dementors reached him, so the protection was limited by the house, meaning if a DE was really raring to kill him all they would have to do was ambush him somewhere. It's not like this protection shielded him from all the crap thrown at him over the years, only against Voldemort directly touching him, something that happened /once/ before he found a way around it.

If you really wanted Harry safe, then Grimmauld Place under the Fidelius was the best one, or Hogwarts with its protections and Dumbledore himself, along with all the teachers there.
