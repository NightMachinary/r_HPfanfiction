Considering this is a series for kids and teens, there are plenty of plot holes present to allow for the young reader to relate to the characters, and the characterization of most adults in authority suffers for it.

I find that fics that make me like Dumbledore are ones that either don't go too deep into his character, and thus somewhat dodge some plot holes related to him, or the ones where he is shown to have significantly less political power the we are made to think, and thus bears less responsibility for Harry's pain.

The fic the put me on track to no longer straight up hate the character, and made me start to enjoy deeper characterizations of him was (Umbrus Shade, The Incredibly Annoyed Ravenclaw). It's a SI in a canon-compliant universe (initially) that eventually forges a nice mentor relationship with Dumbledore, to the point he starts learning his maneurisms. I love Dumbledore here, highly recommend this fic. Worth to mention that there is no pairing and it takes a while for Dumbledore to become truly relevant.
