I read the first few chapters , and I gotta say, the comments by people between them are more entertaining than the story itself.

Like, first chapter, and our dear /Shade Umbrus/ (since Shade is his first name, not his surname) calls a random person on the street an NPC.

But apart from the blatant superiority complex, it has some of the best magical theory segments I've seen yet.
