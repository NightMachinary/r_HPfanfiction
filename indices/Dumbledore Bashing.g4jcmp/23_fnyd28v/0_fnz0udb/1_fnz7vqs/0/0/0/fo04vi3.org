I'm on chapter 6, and although the strange pretentiousness sometimes grates, and I definitely have a sense of foreboding of all the "positive: It's a shade SI. negative: It's a shade SI" and "how long until the pianos start falling" comments, I kinda like it so far.

For now, he's definitely no gary stu, and actually has some problems with magic. I like the way transfiguration is explained, and how it subverts most of the usual magical theory tropes (the bad, definitely, but /also/ some the good).
