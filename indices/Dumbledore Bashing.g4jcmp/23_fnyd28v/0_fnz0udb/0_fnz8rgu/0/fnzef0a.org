Hang on, I just read the first few lines, and his hogwarts letter starts with "Mr. Umbrus".

So his name isn't Umbrus Shade, it's /Shade Umbrus/.

So not only does he have the dumbest name on the face of the planet, it's /also/ arranged in the worst possible way.

Like, I don't know about you, but if I'd introduced myself to my classmates as /Shade/, I'd have probably been drowned or something.

Christ.

Apart from the name and the arrogance, the magical theory is pretty good.
