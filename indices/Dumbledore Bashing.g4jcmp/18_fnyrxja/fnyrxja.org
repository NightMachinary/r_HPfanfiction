I think the reason he is bashed so much is because he has disappointed much some people that were fooled by his grand father persona that does not play leader in a war. And also because he is the perfect illustration of the famous saying the road to hell is paved of good intentions. His plan is basically so much convoluted and encompasses all aspects from the moment the killing curse failed in its original target, it is simply the work of a redoubtable chess master. And of course the circumstances of the prophecy speaking in a job interview that was not conducted in his office when the war was being in the critical phase of threatening to be lost by the light side that is too much coincidental, there is simply too much to not consider a much more ambitious plan with a organised leaking of a self fulfilling not genuine prophecy. Too much coincidence, and as some people like to say those types of coincidences don't exists ( L.J Gibbs NCIS rules). And of course Dumbledore knows much about psychology and its influence, Harry placement with the Dursleys is in this light very much a part of the plan. His plan would have failed if Harry was raised differently by Longbottom, Tonks or some other family that were not with links to the Dark Lord in last resort. If Harry case was examined by a court, he would have never be sent to the Dursleys for a simply reason they are muggles, the mother of the godmother would have precedence over the muggle aunt, idem for a cousin of the Godfather ( Yes I received the memo of Rowling changing Harry Grandparents to some not much know characters, worse she does not tell us the family of the great mother (Euphemia) , they could have been considered for custody over Muggles by the Ministry that is clear as day. ). The Ministry would have never considered muggles for custody because their blood link is irrelevant.
