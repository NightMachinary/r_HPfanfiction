In OotP, Mrs. Figg tells Harry that she deliberately made his experiences at her house lousy because she suspected his relatives would find a different babysitter if he was enjoying himself. Considering she was Dumbledore's eyes and ears in the area, specifically placed there to watch over Harry, I find it profoundly unlikely that he didn't know about this.

Now, to directly quote the man from OotP, c37: "You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years." "...you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well."

So, he admits knowing that Harry would be mistreated, and even has the gall to say that his plan was working well.
