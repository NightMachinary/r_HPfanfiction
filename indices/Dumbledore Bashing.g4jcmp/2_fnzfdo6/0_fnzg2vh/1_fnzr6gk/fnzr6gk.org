I think it's crazy to say he didn't know how the Dursley's treated him. A lot has already been mentioned but here are a few more things that anyone with reasonable intelligence like Dumbledore would draw conclusions from and investigate if he cared. -Multiple letters had to be sent...at some point a human being at the school would see it was addressed to the 'cupboard under the stairs' and share it -Hagrid would have reported back to Dumbledore after meeting the people who raised Harry...seeing they took him to an island to avoid Hogwarts...seeing the shoddy clothes Harry wore and how they spoke to him. -After second year Molly Weasely would have told Dumbledore what her children had shared. That his things were locked away...that there were bars on his windows...that they weren't giving him food.

Whatever his reasons for doing it the way he allowed Harry to be treated by others was cruel and he was aware of the cruelty. If Dumledore didn't know it's because he chose not to. The summer after fourth year and the fifth year term was essentially a series of decisions made by Dumbledore that were cruel and caused Harry to suffer. He knowingly did all those things...that is not supposition.
