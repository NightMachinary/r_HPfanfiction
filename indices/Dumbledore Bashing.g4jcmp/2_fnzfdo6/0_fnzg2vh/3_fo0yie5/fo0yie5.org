Here's my trouble with the abuse line. We know Neville was hung out a window to make his magic show up. Is this perfectly acceptable in the wizarding world? Do wizards not care as much about physical violence because they can just magic up a cure? That somewhat seems to be case. So the Snape abusing people line always makes me question that. "Yeah but that's still no excuse," I agree to our standards it's a pretty shitty thing, I don't know if it's shitty to their own standards.

However that being said abusing Harry is different because Harry isn't living in a situation where his pain/abuse can just be magicked away by some cure, he's living with muggles. Harry is living in a situation where he should be judged by muggle means, and through our muggle means it's horrendous. And at least McGonagall and Dumbles knew about it. Reminder: Mr. H. Potter Cupboard under the stairs. That letter was addressed to Harry by McGonagall. Sure they could have just magicked the address on a couple thousand Harry letters and never took the time to see what address it was, but that seems rather far-fetched.
