Dumbledore knew that Petunia despised magic and that she despised magical people. Harry didn't tell him they were abusive, but he's a legilimens and should've been able to see that. Furthermore, Dumbledore refused to allow Harry to reside elsewhere, when really he should have absolutely no say in this, even as his magical guardian, supposedly, and Vernon and Petunia, as his non-magical, summer time guardians, should be the ones to have a say in it instead. They most likely would have readily agreed to have him out of their house, and Harry would have been glad to spend all summer with the Weasleys. Dumbledore knew this as well, and still, didn't allow Harry to do so. He may have seemed like he was doing things the best he knew how but he's been known (by Grindelwald) to do things "for the greater good" when they are, in fact, not always for the good of everyone. It's possible that Harry's death was the only way to kill Moldyshorts, but this isn't proven or expanded upon in cannon.
