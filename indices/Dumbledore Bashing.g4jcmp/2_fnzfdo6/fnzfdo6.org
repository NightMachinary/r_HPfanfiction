We know, canonically, that Dumbledore was aware that Harry was being cruelly mistreated by the Dursleys and did exactly nothing about it. Heck, based on his comments towards the end of OotP, everything was going according to plan. That makes him complicit in over a decade of child abuse - someone that does that shouldn't be allowed any position of authority over children.

But wait, it gets worse! He employed a teacher that chronically bullied and belittled his students while administering blatantly unfair "discipline" and shielding student bullies in his House from accountability. He endangered the entire population of Hogwarts by hiding the Philosopher's Stone there, then compounded this by basically pointing scores of inquisitive teenagers at the third-floor corridor (because that warning would only motivate /more/ students to check it out), and further by going "Oh, a troll in the dungeon? I'd better send the students back to the common rooms with no adults guarding them en route. It's not like one House is /in/ the dungeons or anything." After /that/ idiocy, he placed a magical artifact that he himself openly admits is super-dangerous in a completely unsecured classroom accessible to anybody. Welcome to Hogwarts School of Bullying and Child Endangerment!

Overall, his actions make no consistent sense given his canonical capability and motivation. Supposedly he wants Harry safe, and yet sends one of the least stealthy or combat-capable Order members to retrieve baby Harry. He doesn't train Harry or arrange any training to give him even a semblance of a chance, seemingly to allow him a normal childhood, but leaves him with relatives that he /knows/ are hateful and abusive.

Looking at all of his actions and inactions, unless he was insane or senile, Dumbledore was actively grooming Harry into a child martyr: Durskaban taught Harry that he had no intrinsic value as a person, that he was only worth what he could do for others. Being allowed a small number of friends but no true family gave Harry just enough to die for without giving him enough to /live/ for.
