Canon Dumbledore is an asshole.

A 'well-meaning' asshole, but an asshole none the less.

Throughout the series, he never gave a straight answer to a direct question. Not once.

The basic lesson of the Harry Potter series is that Adults are Fucking Useless and cannot be depended upon.

I mean, look at the adults in the story.

Snape is an ass to Harry because Harry's father was mean to him in school.

McGonagall had too many jobs to do any of them well, and her advice to Harry when being targeted and tortured? "Keep your head down." What was she doing in the House of the Brave, again?

Hell, probably the least asshole adult in the story was made out to be a moron. Arthur Weasley, a good father, a good man, but couldn't grasp the point of a rubber duck? That's canon. (and before you realized he allowed his wife to publically humiliate his kids in school)

What was wrong with the staff of what was supposedly the world's best school of magic that it took a 12-year-old girl with a year and change of magical education to realize that Slytherin's beast was a basilisk?

But back to Dumbledore and his 'plan'. He gave the kids a trio of Deux ex Machina without the instructions.

What if Hermione had decided that a book of fairy tales wasn't worth hauling around in her beaded bag that evidently held everything in the universe other than food?

What if Ron had never run away in a snit and the Put-Outer was never needed?

What if Harry's dispair had never reached the point where the tried to put the snitch in his mouth?

And most importantly, what if something Dumbledore never planned for, that being Harry disarming Draco had never happened, and Harry never became the master of a wand he had, to that point and beyond, never touched?

All of Dumbledore's plans were unnecessary and served no purpose. Harry won because he disarmed Draco and for no other reason.

So, yeah, Canon Dumbledore is an asshole. Possibly well-meaning, but still an asshole.
