Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina by Karmic Acumen: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/2/]])

It's an older Black Family-centric fic that centers around Regulus trying to clear Sirius's name a few years before canon starts (Harry is 7). It's definitely a fix-it, I don't remember much of the details since it's been so long. Arcturus is the Black Family patriarch and comes into play a bit later and he's great.
