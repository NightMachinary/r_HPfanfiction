my faves are linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]; [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]])

Edit: The first one is a war story with a pretty fucked up Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna entering a parallel dimension which has a perfect ending.

The second one has Milo, a DnD character, somehow getting to Hogwarts which changes things a lot, has interesting comparisons between different systems of magic and later on a muggle police officer as a deuteragonist.
