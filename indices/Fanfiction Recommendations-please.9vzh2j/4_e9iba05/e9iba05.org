A little late to the party but these are some of my favorites.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/][The Aurors]] and its sequel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12778140/][Hollow Ash]] are two amazing fics starring a OC named Theia who is a trainee auror under Harry.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5240131/][Painted Black]] follows an OC named Ara who is the youngest of three daughters of Bellatrix LeStrange, sadly its likely forever incomplete.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/][Latest Anguis in Herba]] is a sort of prequel to a criminally underrated trilogy starring 4 Slytherin OC's during HBP, DH, and after the war loosely following the book but mostly doing their own thing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3964606][Alexandra Quick]] This series gets posted on this sub all the time so you probably know about it but if you don't it takes place in America and follows an OC called Alexandra Quick in an american wizarding school.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11269078][To Be A Slytherin]] is a long fic (1.1m words) but its 100% worth reading imo. It follows an OC named Lorena who is the sister of Harry and gets sorted in Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4828161][Our Little Secret]] is probably the best Rose/Scorpius fic there is imo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5220153][The Marauders]] is in my opinion the best fic about the Marauders school years that is at the end of fifth year right now with 359k words that the author last updated in May. Here's the story summary copy and pasted /"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs: Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers left behind a legacy that every teacher remembers. They keep it a secret so future Magical Mischief-Makers can't follow in Mischief-Making footsteps. This is the story they don't want you to know, all seven years of it. Don't forget to hide the evidence, the spell's simple: Mischief Managed./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202704][Raindrops]] is a pretty good James/Lily fanfic with a side of Sirius/OC.
