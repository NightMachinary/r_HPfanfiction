Incredible dissertation here. Lily has always been one of my favorite characters because of how she is, as you put it, the “quintessential Gryffindor”. Persistent in the face of fear, slightly rash and self-righteous, but always standing up for the right thing. Fanfiction that portrays her as anything but does a disservice to her.
