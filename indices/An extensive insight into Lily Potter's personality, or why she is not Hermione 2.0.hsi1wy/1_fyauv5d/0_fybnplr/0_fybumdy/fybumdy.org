I think it's because she's constantly portrayed as this perfect wife-mother-goddess figure. We only see tiny snippets of her, but they all portray her in an overwhelmingly positive light. Part of it is probably people not wanting to speak ill of the dead, but a lot of Lily's character seems two dimensional as a result.

If she ever has any fault at all, it's that she has a bit of a temper, but somehow she always turns out to be defending someone in need or standing up to some injustice. Probably the only canon-compliant fault is that she's unforgiving - she cut out Snape after he called her a mudblood once accidentally in the heat of the moment. But even that is excusable, given that there was a war going on so those kinds of insults had wider reaching consequences than childish bullying, and then she died within 5 years, so the two never had an opportunity to reconcile. I don't read a lot of marauder-era fics, but that's the impression that I get.
