I agree with you completely. I think it partly arises from the fact that no one wants to speak ill of dead and the fact that she is the all good protaganist's mother and he's always told he's like his parents and they were the quintessential ‘light wizards and witches'.

My point is though, a lot of bashing fics show here as ‘forgetting a son' and ‘chasing fame'. While I can accepting chasing fame to an extent, forgetting or being much much more preferential to a particular son kinda puts me off a bit.
