Oh interesting. I've seen similar complaints about the "forgetting a son" thing in regards to Lupin/Tonks-bashing fics, and I kind of agree with that. They both ran out to fight in the final battle, but they had a brand new baby at home - one of them should have stayed!!!

It's maybe less applicable to James/Lily (and I guess also Frank/Alice), because both witches were heavily pregnant by the time the prophesy became known, and they both did go into hiding. I do think it's insane that they decided to have a baby so young, and in the middle of a war, with them both being active fighters though.
