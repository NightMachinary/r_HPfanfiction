There's a time travel Hermione/Lily story where they swap bodies in their 6th/7th years. Hermione spends her time trying to ensure Harry happens by having "Lily" fall for James (but really it's Hermione being nostalgic for Harry and kind of amused by the Marauders not being jaded men); Lily spend her time in the future creeped out at the idea of having a son she died for and really put off by Harry's friends and what they get up to.

Turns out Lily had a secret life at Hogwarts where she and her friend were planning to overthrow the government or something... Story hasn't developed much further than that. Best parts were when the two girls get to speak to each other finally through a dreamscape/mirrors and they completely piss each other off. Hate each other's guts.
