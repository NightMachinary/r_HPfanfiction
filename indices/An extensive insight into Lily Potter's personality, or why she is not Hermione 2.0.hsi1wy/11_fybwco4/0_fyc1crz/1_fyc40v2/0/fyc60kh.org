  I've seen certain other people share their sob theories about Snape being so impoverished that he couldn't afford shampoo to wash his hair

That's so silly, you missed book 5, page 61, line 3 about Hogwarts bathrooms rejecting Ginny and Ron because they were poor. This is why they always had greasy hair. Also, it's because of /potions fumes/, because Slughorn was as ill-tended as Sna-

Oh wait.

On this line of thought, the constant posts on Tumblr about how Snape wasn't really ugly, Harry is just prejudiced. I try not to judge artists, but when I look at a fanart and think 'Regulus Black' only for it to turn out to be Snape, I get really uneasy. He was ugly, why can't you accept this? It's like 'now I've made Snape look as nice as possible, he must be pretty'. It's also really hypocritical when they say 'Lily only went to James for his good looks' in the same post. Damn, pick a side, and don't manage to sound so hypocritical.

  Yes indeed. I've the same people who've shared their boo-hoo theories about Snape compare James to Voldemort

I've long since learned that there really is no need to dignify such assessments with a reply. In light of the recent protests against police brutality, I swear I've seen over three posts a day about how James only fought for the Order because he was always a bully, and he just saw it as means to let out his aggression on someone, like brutal US cops. This makes you go speechless, and not because it's a good argument, this constant vilification, which also goes hand-in-hand with 'James was really dumb at school, he cheated from Lupin' and 'he wasn't actually good at Quidditch'.

  The only one to blame for Snape being in that situation, is Snape himself.

I do think he is to blame here, but I wouldn't let off Sirius this easily, it was a really stupid thing, what he did, even if it was most likely not attempted murder. But Snape does get the lion's share. Oh God, you've reminded me of this argument that Snape seeing Pomfrey down there actually meant Lupin was /restrained/ in chains...in addition to being inside a whomping willow and a shack in Hogsmeade? It's also bizarre because it makes Lupin sound as if he were a zoo animal, or that Dumbledore would treat him that way.
