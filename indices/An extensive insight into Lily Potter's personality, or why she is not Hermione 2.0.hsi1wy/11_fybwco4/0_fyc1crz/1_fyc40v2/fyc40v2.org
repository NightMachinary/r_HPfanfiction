  Snape had grey underpants, which I took to mean worn out or washed too many times (like when you wash really old pieces, they lose colour), and I guess it translated directly into poor in my mind

I've seen certain other people share their sob theories about Snape being so impoverished that he couldn't afford shampoo to wash his hair, and that's why it was greasy all the time. It never made any sense to me, because Hogwarts provides all the toiletry stuff to students, with prefects getting a rather great bathroom.

Snape has a terrible sense of hygiene, even as a professor. You can only get greasy hair (which is sweat+dust) when you don't wash your hair.

  Snape good, James bad, please remember this

Yes indeed. I've the same people who've shared their boo-hoo theories about Snape compare James to Voldemort. It's insane how utterly ludicrous they are. I sometimes think that James is one of the most hated characters by the fandom, rivaling even Umbridge. These same people go to any extent to justify Snape's actions during his teens and adulthood - it's uncanny how much their twisted justifications resemble real life journalists trying to whitewash real life terrorists and criminals.

In all the books, jinxing/hexing/cursing another student will get you punished. I thought that would be obvious, but Snape stans will be Snapestans, I suppose.

From your Lily is naive/gullible and trusting point, it could also be assumed that Lily only heard of the Marauders' fights with Snape and co from Snape, who could have presented those fights to her in such a way that Lily would believe Snape's version over anyone else's, because Snape is her friend. Snape displays that same attitude decades later in PoA, when he is whinging to Dumbledore about the Willow incident.

  The idea that he was blameless and Sirius was a cold-blooded murderer (especially after he saw Pomfrey leading him down, literally staff, and why is he out stalking Lupin, it wasn't from a window because somebody must've seen it by chance before), is ridiculous.

The only one to blame for Snape being in that situation, is Snape himself. It's not as if Sirius cast an imperius curse or something along those lines on Snape and forced him to go looking for Lupin. Snape had seen the school nurse lead Lupin away from school on several occasions , he definitely knew what that meant, and he knew what he was getting into when he went down the Willow.
