  What does that line have anything to do with Snape's financial background?
#+end_quote

I'm not arguing here, because I just realised that it's not really backed up by facts, but if you have to know my train of thought about this, then here goes. Snape had grey underpants, which I took to mean worn out or washed too many times (like when you wash really old pieces, they lose colour), and I guess it translated directly into poor in my mind, because in my language it's kind of like that. So after that, I guess my brain carried on and said this stuff is taboo (and it is, you just never mention this stuff, at all, you'll get sneered at), so Lily was obviously commenting on him 'washing it' when she very well knows it's likely clean. Yeah, I think I stretched it a bit, and it's a bit flimsy, so I'll give you that.

  Generally speaking, everyone in the books hexes other people time and time again. None of them ever get accused of using Dark magic.

Except for Sirius and James obviously. Snape good, James bad, please remember this. I've never seen hexes portrayed as anything bad in the narrative until Rowling seemed to want to cement the fandom's hatred of James (and it worked magnificently), by saying 'look, he cast an ILLEGAL hex' and it sort of carried from there. Obviously, we must conveniently brush aside sectumsempra because Snape good. Hermione is Voldemort's apprentice for cursing Marietta, obviously. Harry was just too oblivious to notice it, and it wasn't relevant to the plot, just like Voldemort having tea with Umbridge wasn't. We don't even know if it was in retaliation to something Bertram Aubrey did, or he was being a jerk. We collectively jumped onto the 'James bullied Bertram Aubrey' train because of that.

Yeah, I put that up as an explanation for her being defensive that night, she most likely has been told herself after having theories. She would've had suspicions, especially with poor Sev niggling her about them ('why are you so obsessed with them?'), even if she wanted to ignore it and not try to pry into Lupin's private business. It makes for a nice bonding point between Lily and Lupin, both being outcasts. Here's how I've been looking at it: Remus Lupin being a werewolf is kind of an open secret, or something like a private joke in the school because most brush it aside as ludicrous and take it lightly as Lupin having a rabbit. However, there are some fanatics who subscribe to this theory, and Snape was one of them. So Snape thought he could finally prove it and be labelled a hero for expelling all of them, but James thankfully botched his plan. The idea that he was blameless and Sirius was a cold-blooded murderer (especially after he saw Pomfrey leading him down, literally staff, and why is he out stalking Lupin, it wasn't from a window because somebody must've seen it by chance before), is ridiculous.

  Overall, I agree with nearly everything you've written here, apart from the likeness to Petunia
#+end_quote

I don't think the train ride is entirely indicative of it, because I've mentioned other stuff, but I've neglected the amount of times Petunia also bursts into tears. Anyway, to each their own, but I think some stuff from being raised by the same parents does carry on, like the nicknames thing, or (pure headcanon now), their mum was a very orderly lady, and they both liked a neat and clean state of their house, things like that.
