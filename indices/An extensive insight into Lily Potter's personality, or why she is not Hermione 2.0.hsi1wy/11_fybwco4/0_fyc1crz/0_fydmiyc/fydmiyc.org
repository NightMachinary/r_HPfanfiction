  Snape had grey underpants, which I took to mean worn out or washed too many times (like when you wash really old pieces, they lose colour), and I guess it translated directly into poor in my mind, because in my language it's kind of like that. So after that, I guess my brain carried on and said this stuff is taboo (and it is, you just never mention this stuff, at all, you'll get sneered at), so Lily was obviously commenting on him 'washing it' when she very well knows it's likely clean.

I took it as a very basic teenage comment about someone being gross and wearing dirty pants, and it also being a clear reminder that he's the one with his pants on show to the world. Especially as Snape is repeatedly described as greasy even as an adult, I'd imagine he had a reputation at school for being a bit unclean and this kind of comment just shows that shes now happy to make a comment like that to his face in public when she would have defended him before.
