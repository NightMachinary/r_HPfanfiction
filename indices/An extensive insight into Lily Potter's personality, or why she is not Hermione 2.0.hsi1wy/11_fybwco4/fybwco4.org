  She doesn't lose her grip this time, she's as cool as a cucumber. She knows he's poor, she must know he hates that nickname, and she uses the two things to wound him most. He's called her a derogatory slur, and she just fired off with an insult about his class, and she's turned what he hates the most on him.

What does that line have anything to do with Snape's financial background?

  She also thinks that illegal hexes are nothing on dark magic

Generally speaking, everyone in the books hexes other people time and time again. None of them ever get accused of using Dark magic. This is one of those instances where JKR would have been better off keeping silent, but instead she went ahead and categorised all hexes and curses as dark magic.

Guess that makes Hermione a budding Dark witch at 11, when she uses the Body-Bind *Curse* on Neville. /Gasps/. Another spell that is taught to first years (in their very first term) is the Leg-locker *Curse*. But nope, all curses are dark magic. smh

We do see a few truly dark spells, like Sectumsempra and the curse that attacks Dumbledore's arm, or the one that hits Hermione in the battle at the end of OotP. They have pretty big differences from the regular hexes and curses that Harry and his peers normally use.

  Okay, so Lily has been fed some version of the truth. Maybe Bertha Jorkins was still around, and she spread it? Or more likely, James and co. told her about it, and she believed the truth that they came up with. But there's the possibility that she also knows part of the truth and she's covering up for Snape by telling him that she doesn't know what's down there. However, that makes her come across as really bad here, because Snape is obviously going through a bit of a crisis

Honestly, Lily would probably have thought that Lupin was in a similar enough boat as she was, and is probably just covering for him. This was during the First War, when muggleborns and those who stood up for muggleborns were abducted, tortured and killed. Werewolves are almost universally hated throughout society, but Lily, as a muggleborn, probably wouldn't fall in that same category, if only because she can relate somewhat to the hate. She's also known Lupin for five years, and can clearly see he's not a bloodthirsty monster as werewolves are widely known as. Lupin might be mischievous and probably gets into a lot of trouble along with his friends, but he's no monster.

And considering the kind of company Snape keeps, it's easy enough to determine what his opinions on werewolves were, and what he'd have done had he gotten proof that Lupin was a werewolf.

Overall, I agree with nearly everything you've written here, apart from the likeness to Petunia. Younger siblings do try to imitate their elder siblings' mannerisms, and the time when you described Lily as similar to Petunia on the train, she's had a pretty bad day and is probably just pissed.
