But you can be smart and academically gifted and still not completely thorough. If anything, there are definitely a clear subset of bright people who don't do more than necessary. So I think saying Lily wouldn't have been as thorough as Hermione isn't a comment on her ability or intelligence, just that she isn't a near-obsessive perfectionist the way Hermione is - she might have been happy with an O rather than disappointed not to get full marks.
