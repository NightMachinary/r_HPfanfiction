Remus called Hermione "the brightest witch of her age" (and not at all "that he's ever met ðŸ˜‚) in a moment of stress as an icebreaker after she just revealed he was a werewolf to Harry and Ron. As OP has stated, no one else in canon ever called Hermione the brightest witch of her age. She's occasionally called brilliant (and scary) by either Harry or Ron, but that doesn't mean much outside of the context of that scene.
