I don't think that's fair, tho. Nowhere is it stated that Lily was less academically gifted. Only that she's way more likeable and less bossy compared to Hermione. Also, she /supposedly/ hung around very smart people. Even if James, Sirius were less academically inclined, canon shows then they were smart and inventive.

I think if you need to compare anyone (loosely) to Hermione, it'd probably Remus.
