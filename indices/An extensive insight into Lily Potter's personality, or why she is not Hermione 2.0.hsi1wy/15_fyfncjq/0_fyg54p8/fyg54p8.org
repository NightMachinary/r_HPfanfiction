So nope, Lily was likely just scared, or if you want to go the more unconventional route (and in the eyes of the fandom, blasphemous), Lily was concerned with keeping up appearances and trying to stay the popular girl by not uttering The Name. Although part of me doubts that. Unless you're right and Dumbledore is trying to get the people who annoy him dead.

But thank you, I really appreciate nice feedback like yours, especially because I haven't thought about Lily before in such depth, and I was scared to post this <3
