The only thing I would counter is Lily being afraid of saying Voldemort. If I'm not mistaken, it was strongly implied there was a taboo curse on Voldemort's name during his first war as well. So Lily might have an excellent reason for calling him "You-Know-Who" that isn't based on fear.

Otherwise, I thought this was an excellent and very thorough analysis! I really appreciate all the quotes you hunted down, it makes it very comprehensible and easy to understand where you're coming from, and I easily agree with almost all of it.
