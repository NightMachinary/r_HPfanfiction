Smart!Powerful!Harry

Harems: though sadly there aren't enough good ones that don't follow the marriage contract or veela formula (het only PLEASE!) These can be girl centric...but I haven't enjoyed maybe 1 of those. (Hermione/Many)

SMUT... I'm a master of Smut in my own writing, but when I read it I have HIGH standards because of this. I hate lemons written by people who have never had a threesome. (I'm an ex-swinger, so I write what I know) [edit: for those who always ask [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eginnymylove][http://www.fanfiction.net/~ginnymylove]] ]

To add to all of the above: unusual het pairings, although at this point there really aren't any "unusual" ones left beyond Milicent or unknown-insert-other-house-here like Romilda Vane or Su Li.
