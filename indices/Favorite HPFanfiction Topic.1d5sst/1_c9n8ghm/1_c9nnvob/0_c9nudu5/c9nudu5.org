I enjoy Dark!Harry too, but there is one common theme in many of these that really annoys me.

Too often, the Dark Arts are treated as if it is simply a collection of powerful aggressive spells which Light!Harry is too wimpy to use.

I think canon makes it pretty clear that spells are called "Dark" because they require extremely powerful negative emotions of hatred and anger to work. Few of these fics really make Harry as evil/vindictive as he'd need to be in order to master the Dark Arts, since the authors still want him to be somewhat likable to the reader.
