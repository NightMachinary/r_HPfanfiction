I only ever read marauder themed stories. I think I was too old when I got into the books. I have no interest in the younger generations. GIve me a bit of remus lupin, and i'm all over it. Went through a severus period for a while too. But that's just cause there is more written about him.

The only reason I ever read anything with 'the golden trio' in it is if it ties in with the marauders era. But it bums me out that so many of the stories are time travel, creepy/pervy, unrealistic Characterisations or awful OC mary Sue BS.

I don't really mind Slash, I had to learn to love it at least a bit because there isn't a lot on offer RL wise that isn't some rehashed wornout time travel fic.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/866426/Children-of-the-Shadows][Children of the Shadows]] writes some great ones if any one is interested. She was the the first slash auther I ever read, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390076/1/Dating-Remus-Lupin][Dating Remus Lupin]]. Drool.... I just love how well written is is, and how alive the characters are in it. despite the slash, I fell in love with them all, she also doesn't wormtail bash, but includes him in the stories in a manner that shows the friendships as they were.

BTW dating remus lupin, slash not included is still a bit AU.

I do know some good RL het stories, but they're few and far between. If any one could offer any, or would like to know what ones i've come across let me know!

there doesn't seem to be a lot of slash fans in here at all, Makes me feel like a perv....
