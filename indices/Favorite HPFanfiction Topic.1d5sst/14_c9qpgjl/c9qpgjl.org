People may not even be posting in here, but i like books with a smarter Harry doing different triwizard tasks. Stuff like the lie I've lived by jbern, temporal beacon, even the sorting hat's stand (even with some of the familiar silliness, the last task he got to before the "rewrite" was the best I've ever read. I like his take on occlumency as well.)
