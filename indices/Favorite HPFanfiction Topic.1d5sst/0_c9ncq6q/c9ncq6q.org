- Any sort of AU where Harry is smarter and more independent, particularly if the author can justify this somewhat believably instead of the usual "Cedric/Sirius died because of me, I need to train up so no one else does".

- Fics that do good world-building. Expanding on Canon lore, pulling in real world mythology, etc. A lot of Powerful!Harry fics do this really badly, giving him a bunch of cliche powers (Phoenix Animagus, Heir of Gryffindor/Ravenclaw, Wandless Magic Prodigy, etc.), often in a single scene (Gringotts inheritance ritual, or a visit from a Mysterious Stranger OC)

- Auror!Harry. I've always been a big fan of the hardboiled PI genre, and this is a great way to do it in the HP world. Peggy Sues where an older Harry goes back can have some of the same appeal, but it always creeps me out a bit that he is an older guy going to school with a bunch of kids, especially if the story has any romance...
