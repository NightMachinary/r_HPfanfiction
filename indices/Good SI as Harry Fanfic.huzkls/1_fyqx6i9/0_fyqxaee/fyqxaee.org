#+begin_quote
  When someone dies, they lose their memory and are reborn as someone else. That's how it should be."Should" is the key word.No one wants to be reborn as Harry Potter. No one wants to keep their memories while being reborn as Harry Potter. I repeat: NO ONE WANTS TO BE HARRY- Oh forget it, I'm going into Slytherin.
