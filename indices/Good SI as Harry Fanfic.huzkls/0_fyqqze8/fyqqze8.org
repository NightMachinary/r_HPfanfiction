I don't read other fanfiction, but it seems SI is a way less common in the HP-world than there. Usually, when asked about SI we point out to linkffn(13041698), which is really nice, but I cannot recall anything else ATM. Perhaps, kind of, linkffn(2053712), but that's a bit strange story, I am still not sure what to think about it.
