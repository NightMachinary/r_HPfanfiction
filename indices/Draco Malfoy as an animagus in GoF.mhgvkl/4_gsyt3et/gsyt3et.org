The whole animagus concept is really weird. We know from as early as chapter 4 in PS that people can at least be partially transfigured (Hagrid giving Dudley a pig's tail). Then we discover he isn't supposed to do magic and then later that he was expelled quite early in his schooling, and his whole thing gives us the impression he is quite childish, naive and not really academic or especially well-learned. Then, in HBP, Professor Slughorn shows up, literally, as an armchair that he transfigured himself into. That obviously means he can /Un/transfigure himself from that state. That begs the question of why such prodigies of Transfiguration such as James, Sirius and Professor McGonagall would even bother with becoming animagi if they can simply transfigure themselves into animals and just as easily untransfigure themselves.
