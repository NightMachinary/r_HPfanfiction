Interesting theory, however:

In the same book, we both learn from Professor Mcgonagall that transforming a person into an animal is possible. (Same scene, when she sees it she tells moody that they do not use transfiguration as a punishment.

Also in the same book, a bit later, we see Krum using partial self transfiguration to obtain the head of a Shark in order to solve the second task. In the book it states that he did the transfiguration badly and that he only transfigured his head.

Both scenes together make me believe that human to animal transfiguration is possible if you are not an animagus. It also makes me believe that it has to be very difficult as Krum only manages to do it badly. Further I would assume it to be difficult to reverse if you are not experienced in the field, which makes it even more dangerous.

And finally as Mcgonagall mentions that it is not used as punishment at Hogwarts, I kinda feel like we can assume that it is uses as such in other schools or situations which means it is most likely not a comfortable transfiguration to go through, especially if it is forced on you.

All of that makes it very different form an animagus transformation.

Also in GoF Draco is a bit young to be an animagus as it takes a lot of work to become one. I mean we hear that it takes james and sirius quite a while to accomplish it and we do not hear about any other animagi below the age of 17, meaning that it is unlikely that draco would have accomplished it before the start of his 4th year.

But as always this is just my interpretation of the situation so feel free to comment/correct me if I made a mistake.
