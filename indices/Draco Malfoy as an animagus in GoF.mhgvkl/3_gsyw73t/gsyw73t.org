It's a fun idea, but almost definitely not canon.

  I don't think we've ever seen someone transform into an animal that isn't an animagus.

Krum partially turned into a shark. Canary Creams turned several people into birds. Percy hit Thicknesse with a spell that "seemed to be turning [Thicknesse] into some form of sea urchin" (though that could just be describing the effects of a jinx, and not a literal and complete transfiguration). And Hermione turned into a catgirl, but that probably shouldn't count.

As for why you would become an animagus instead of just transfiguring yourself, in GoF, Hermione said

  “If only we'd done human Transfiguration already! But I don't think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing.”

And then in sixth year, they're only changing the color of their eyebrows by the time they reach the Christmas break. So I think it's safe to say that safely transfiguring a human into an animal is probably really hard. The animagus process, on the other hand, is actually pretty easy, though it is time-consuming (according to Pottermore-canon, at least).

But even if we ignore Pottermore and assume that the animagus transformation is a difficult exercise in transfiguration, there may still be reasons to do it.

- The animagus transformation might be harder to learn, but easier to do.
- A more specific possibility for the above, an animagus transformation might be "automatically complete," whereas normal transfiguration may require you to be able to completely visualize the animal, making it a lot easier to mess up.
- An animagus might automatically get certain instincts associated with the animal, such as how to move in their new body, whereas someone who transfigures themselves into an animal might have to figure it all out for themselves. This would be especially important for any animals that fly, swim, or otherwise travel in ways humans are not used to, or otherwise have limb configurations unfamiliar to humans (and I think that covers almost every animal).
- An animagus can probably transform without a wand.
- It may be harder to detect an animagus than it is to detect a transformed human.
- Since your animagus form is related to your personality, becoming an animagus may be a form of self-discovery.
- It's a good way to prove how good you are at transfiguration.

I have seen it speculated that it may be easier to "keep your mind" and not "be lost in the animal" or something as an animagus. However, I do not think this is likely to be the case, since Slughorn turned himself into a chair and back without issue. Surely, being stuck as an inanimate object is much more likely and more dangerous than being stuck as an animal.
