Okay so these are headcanon but I think they're reasonable. The animagus transformation is a wandless self transfiguration where the person is able to change states on their own. The animagus transformation also keeps the human mind while transformed. Regular Human transfiguration on the other hand requires a wand so the transfigured individual can't easily revert since they can't wield their wand. Also I believe the animal instincts overpower the human mind to some extent with regular human transfiguration.
