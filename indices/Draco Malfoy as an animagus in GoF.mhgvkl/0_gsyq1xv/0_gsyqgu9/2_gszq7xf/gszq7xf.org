In the Tales of Beedle the Bard there was little footnotes throughout. Supposedly written in by Dumbledore. The ones on the Babbity Rabbity story say that an animagus can change into an animal and retain their human mind, so are able to change themselves back. If someone is only transfigured, they just have an animal mind and rely on someone else to change them back.
