  How much stress does it take to snap a persons grasp on the world? For Harry James Potter it only took losing his parents, ten years of abuse at his relatives hands and four years of wishy washy treatment by the magical world. The latest fiasco is the straw to break his back so he decides to end it only to fail due to love of another. With her beside him, his word WILL be law HPxLL
