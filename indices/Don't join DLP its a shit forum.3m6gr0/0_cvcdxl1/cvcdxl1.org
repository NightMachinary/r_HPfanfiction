When you enter a room with a group of people who all know one another, but who you do not know yourself do you:

A. Observe and learn how the communication works between the members of the group, learn and then approach.

B. Start talking loudly, butting in and being an overall obnoxious ass?

Consider this and you'll soon find out why you were banned.
