Do you ever read a fic that you like so much and is so good that you can't bear to read any others in that trope because they pale in comparison? That's what this fic is. I can't read other Harry is Salazar fanfics because this is so wonderfully detailed and real. The best thing is that he has to catch up on history. And not all “ancient” magic is all-powerful. I loved how baffled he was with expansion charms. He reacted exactly how I would expect a Slytherin 900 years out of time would react
