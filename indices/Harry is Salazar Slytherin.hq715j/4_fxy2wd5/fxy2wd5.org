Not exactly the same, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10487644/1/Courage-and-Cunning][Courage and Cunning]], by preciousann, an immortal Salazar Slytherin goes to save the Potters that fateful Halloween night, fed up with his disgraceful heir. He sends the real Potters to another country (telling them not to return until he gives the all clear), then he polyjuices as baby Harry, and waits. But something goes wrong when Voldemort curses him. He gets stuck in the form of infant Harry and loses all of his memories for ten years, growing up with the Dursleys as in canon (while the real Potters are living across the globe, clueless). Only when he gets his Hogwarts letter do his memories return. For a variety of reasons, he remains "Harry" and goes to Hogwarts.
