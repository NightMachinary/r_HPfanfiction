I don't have any recommendations that exactly fit your request, but I've been enjoying Legacy linkffn(13255912) (where Harry is Salazar and has always known that) and Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance linkffn(10991501) (where Salazar is reincarnated as Hermione). I also second the recommendation of Ouroboros linkao3(Ouroboros by NovusArs) which is really fantastically well done and updates once a month.

Edit: There's also linkao3(Of a Linear Circle) where Harry is not Salazar Slytherin, but something spoilery does happen before his 5th year that links them together.
