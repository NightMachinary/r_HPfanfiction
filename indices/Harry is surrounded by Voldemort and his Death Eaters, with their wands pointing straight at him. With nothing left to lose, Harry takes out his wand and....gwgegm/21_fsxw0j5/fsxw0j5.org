Later in the story, Voldemort learns that someone is a spy and is trying to figure out who it is through interrogation (Ã  la Catch 22):

'You're a sneaky son of a bitch, aren't you? Nobody asked you for clarification and you're giving me clarification. I was making a statement, not asking for clarification. You are a sneaky son of a bitch, aren't you?' Voldemort sneered, hoping to get a confession out of the man in front of him.

'No, my lord.' the death eater said loyally. He was still wearing his mask for some reason.

'No? Are you calling Lord Voldemort a liar?' Voldemort asked angrily

'Oh, no, my Lord.' the death eater assured him.

'Then you're a sneaky son of a bitch, aren't you?'

'No, my lord.' Voldemort's eyes flared a blood red.

'Are you a sneak son of a bitch?' Voldemort asked once more through gritted teeth, hoping the death eater would just confess.

'No, my lord.' the death eater repeated, shaking his head.

'Goddammit, you are trying to pick a fight with me?! For two knuts I would crucio you until you go mad!' shrieked Voldemort, slamming his hand down on the table.

'Do it! Do it!' cried Lucius.

'Lucius you stupid son of a bitch. Didn't I tell you to keep your weak, cowardly, stupid mouth shut?'

'Yes, my lord. I'm sorry, my lord.'

'Then suppose you do it.'

'I was only trying to learn, my lord. The only way a person can learn is by trying.'

'Who says so?' Voldemort asked irritably. He would find whoever said so and murder them when he was finished with this circus of an interrogation.

'Everybody says so, my lord. Even Bellatrix says so.'

'Do you say so?' Voldemort asked, glancing at his most trusted lieutenant.

'Yes, sir,' said Bellatrix, 'But everybody says so.'

'Well, Lucius, suppose you try keeping that stupid mouth of yours shut, and maybe that's the way you'll learn how. Now, where were we? Read me back the last line.' Voldemort said, turning his focus back to the death eater across from him

' "Read me back the last line," ' read Lucius, who was taking notes on the interrogation

'Not my last line, stupid!' Voldemort shouted. 'Somebody else's.'

' "Read me back the last line," ' Lucius read back

'That's my last line again!' shrieked Voldemort, turning on Lucius, his eyes smoldering with anger.

'Oh, no, my Lord,' corrected Lucius. 'That's my last line. I read it to you just a moment ago. Don't you remember? It was only a moment ago.'
