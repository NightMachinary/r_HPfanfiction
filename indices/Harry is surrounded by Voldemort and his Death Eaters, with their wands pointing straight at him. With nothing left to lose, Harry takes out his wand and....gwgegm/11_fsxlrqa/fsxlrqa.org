Thats like the one fanfic that has Harry realizing that when he takes off his glasses, no one recognizes him -- the Superman Effect.

There's a scene where some aurors, grizzled veterans of the force with mustaches and beards, are sent to the school in newby robes and are bullied by fourteen -year-old Slytherins because they haven't been sorted and obviously will all end up in Hufflepuff. They have to pretend to cry so they don't break cover.
