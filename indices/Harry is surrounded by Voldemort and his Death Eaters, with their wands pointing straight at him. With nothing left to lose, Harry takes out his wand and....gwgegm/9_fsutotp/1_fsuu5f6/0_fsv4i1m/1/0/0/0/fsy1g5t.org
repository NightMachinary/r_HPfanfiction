That's just sad. I honestly can't understand what these people are trying to achieve. Using euphemisms or ignoring it won't change history.

I don't know much about youtube's policies but some time ago they demonetized several history-themed channels. We are talking about people who are doing documentaries in their free time with their own money. And they put a lot of effort in them and were unbiased. And youtube just screwed them over because apparently, we can't talk about Hitler and Stalin anymore.
