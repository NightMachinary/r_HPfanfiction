/later on in the story/

Lucius Malfoy and a group of Death Eaters approaches a swinging arm that blocks their path. The small stand has a sign saying "Lord Voldemort Thruway - 10 Sickles." The light was flashing red.

Malfoy grimaced at the sign. He muttered, "What'll that asshole think of next?" Louder he shouted, "Anyone got any Sickles?"

The crowd with him grumbled in disagreement, which didn't improve his mood.

"Somebody's got to go back and get a shitload of Sickles!"
