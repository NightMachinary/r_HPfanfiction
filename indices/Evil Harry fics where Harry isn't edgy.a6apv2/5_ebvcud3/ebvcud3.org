linkffn(Harry Potter - The Curse of Undeath)

Harry finds a journal of some Warhammer Fantasy lich, and figures that if hes probably going to get killed by Voldemort at some point, he might as well choose the not quite dead route.

No betrayals, no light bashing, just a stressed boy that finds a how to necromancy guide and decides that it can't hurt.
