Tarkin, nowadays.

Refined, cultured, aloof and professional. Nary a word nor a button out of place, soft-spoken and eloquent in his minimalism. Respected by his men, his peers and his enemies.

Can damn a billion souls to be consumed in unimaginable fire with a soft smile on his face.

You know, Disney Evil.
