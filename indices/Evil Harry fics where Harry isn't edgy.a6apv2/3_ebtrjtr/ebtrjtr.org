Can you give a definition of your "disney evil"?

Also, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die./]] I wouldn't call that story's Harry evil, but it's literally the only ruthless-Harry story I've found so far in which he's not also a sadist (if you discount dark magic addicttion) or a conceited brat.
