Found the story i was thinking of. It's a one-shot/drabble in a collection called Harry Potter and the OneShot Factory by MathiasGranger. It's story/chapter 9 called Potter Granger Manifesto. As I said earlier Hermione implanted into the author Joanne Murray (who is the daughter of squibs) and wrote 4 muggle books that more or less accurately written about the first four years of Harry and Hermione's school life. Hermione brings the author to Joanne to complain about the less than accurate version of the 5th, 6th, and soon to be 7th years.
