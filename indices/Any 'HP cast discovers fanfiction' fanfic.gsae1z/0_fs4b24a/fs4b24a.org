Some of these might not be exactly on point but they are similar to the request.

In Pumpkin Pies: One Shot Collections by NightWing201 (which only has one story) Hermione writes Hunger games fanfiction and is upset when someone hides it from her.

There's another story I'm trying to find in my collection, that basically has Hermione providing A JKR-like author (might even be her) via dreams the story of Harry's adventures. However, she gets upset when the author starts to make changes especially in terms of relationships ie putting Harry with Ginny and Hermione with Ron. So she sends the writer a port key that brings her to a tent where Harry and Hermione are so she can "set the writer straight".
