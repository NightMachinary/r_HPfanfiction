11 years old Harry would be easy to convince that all muggles hate magic (I mean he has the example at homes. History books have chapters about it), and people like the Weasley threatens the secrecy, and the safety of wizards.

Muggle-borns (don't use mudblood yet), are also a threat to this safety, since their parents and immediate family knows about Magic, and would hate it, and hate magics. Look at your Aunt Petunia, your Uncle Vernon. They loved Dudley but not you, while they raised you. It's not your they didn't love. It's the magic. See how muggle treat people with magic.

Your parents ? They were good people, that's true. Their heart was in the right place. I don't want to kill that many people. It never been the goal. But they threaten our safety. It's sad, and I really hate having to do it, but

Your scar ? Oh, but I didn't want to kill you. You were just a baby, and would have been raised by Sirius Black if he hadn't been caught. By someone who would want to protect us. That spell wasn't meant for you. But for Snape apparated away at the last minute. He wanted to kill you. It's him I wanted to kill, so you would be safe.

You know I'm right. You're a wizard that grew up among muggles who knew about magic, unlike muggle-borns. You saw for yourself how they are. Don't you want people to be safe? Don't you want to save the wizarding world, with me ?

But to do that, Harry, I need your help. Give me the stone, so I can continue to fight for our safety.
