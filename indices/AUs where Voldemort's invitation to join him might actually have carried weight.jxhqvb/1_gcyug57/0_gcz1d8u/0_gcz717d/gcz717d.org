I remember reading quite a while ago of that mostly happening, Voldemort had Harry in ropes in the final chamber in philosophers stone and legilemensed (unsure of spelling) him, learnt that Harry was a horcrux then kidnapped him and took him to this remote island. I ended up losing it at that point and can't remember the name but I'll attempt to find it again.
