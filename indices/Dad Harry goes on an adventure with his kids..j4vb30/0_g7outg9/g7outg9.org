I wrote one a while ago where Harry and Hermione from a parallel universe took it on themselves to find and fix Harrys from other universes who got crapped on and made mistakes that endangered their timelines. Your idea actually dovetails nicely with that, like Harry and the kids accidentally travel and meet a different Harry for the first time and that's how they come across Harrys who need help in the first place.

Plot bunny added to the list. Can't promise anything, and definitely not soon, but it's on the list now. :)
