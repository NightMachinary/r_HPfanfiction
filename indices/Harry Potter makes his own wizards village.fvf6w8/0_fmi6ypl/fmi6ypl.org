The only one I know the name of is Partially Kissed Hero. Harry hires some dwarves to build him a fortified town/compound thing entirely designed around defense against Voldemort and Dark Creatures. I enjoyed that part of the fic, but the fic undeniably has... issues....

There was also a fic where someone started buying like warehouses(?) I think and turning them into warded and self contained wizarding hamlets. In another someone ( for some reason I want to say Petunia, Snape, and Lucius) bought up all of Spinners End and turned it into a wizarding neighborhood. Can't remember what fics those two were from though.
