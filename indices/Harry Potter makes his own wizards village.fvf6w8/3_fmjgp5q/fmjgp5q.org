Harry starts making a small town like Hogsmeade on the mainland during the Cupboard series as Diricawl Academy sets up on Potter Island, but the war kicks up before it really gets built and we never see much of it. Linkffn(United We Stand by Stargon1), but the series starts with linkffn(The Cupboard Under The Stairs by Stargon1).

I'm also recalling a fic where Harry, Neville, and several others construct essentially their own Manor towns in expanded trunks, all linked together. Can't remember the name.

And of course Harry follows wizarding tradition and makes his own island country in the short, linkffn(On An Island In The Sun by Rorshach's Blot).

There are also The Harem Wars (Radaslab and Vince McGill) and Rocking The Boat by DerLaCroix that have Harry retreating to private islands/ family manor towns, but that's not quite the same as /making/ his own.
