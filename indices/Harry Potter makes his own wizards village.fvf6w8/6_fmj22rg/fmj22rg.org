Oh that's actually something I'm trying to write! It's a fem!Harry fic. She is kinda Dark, I guess? Still works with Dumbledore against Voldemort, but their relationship is less of a mentor-student and more of a fragile allience, especially as time goes on and their ideologies differ more and more. I think Dumbledore will both respect her and fear her potential because she reminds him of how he and Gellert used to be, but will try his best to be a good role model because he learned from his mistakes in how he dealed with Riddle. At one point she will start creating her own safe haven for magicals that is completely seperate from the muggle world, which will be a major factor in the story as the second war starts.

It's still in its "a word file of prompts that takes place in the same AU" stages though, so I don't think I'll be able to get to actually writing it soon.
