Ugh. You know what the bane of these stories is? The inevitable, dying-of-boredom "Chapter of describing everything." Reading one of these stories now, which is otherwise quite entertaiing, but this chapter has me actually making excuses for things like checking my email for other story updates, wandering into the kitchen for a snack, etc. They are excruciating.

In fact, it was one of these chapters that caused me to completely abandon Core Threads. To be fair, I'd already had a great deal of niggling dislike for this story because the author for some reason thought it was "cute" for an 11-year old girl (AND HER YOUNGER SISTER) to constantly make sexual innuendos, with the lame excuse that the 11-year-old thought it gave her control to be "outrageous." (That's not cute, just sick.) But the overall story was interesting enough until it came to a screeching halt with boring detail after tedious description about the mechanics of building the damn thing. That's not a story.

In this current story, we'll see if taking a break and copious skimming will get me to back to the story before I just stop caring. The fact that I'm 35 chapters into this thing and STILL considering abandoning it, I think indicates how dreary and tiresome this trope is.
