I can't remember what fic it is, but I read a fic that started with Harry surviving the killing curse a second time, living with some other people, going to Hogsmeade before first year, and muggles teaching him how to do magic before he learns of wands.

IIRC, he couldn't use a wand for a long time because of the way he learned to do magic.

Hopefully someone recognizes those details.
