I remember reading once something where Herpo the Foul was a blind beggar that relied on his pet snake to guide him. He meets pre-Hogwarts Harry and makes him his apprentice after Harry performs some accidental magic to escape Dudley and his gang. If someone remembers it, please post the name. Thanks!

With that being said, I can't help myself, but wand magic is real magic in the HP universe.
