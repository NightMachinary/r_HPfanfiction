I see. I suppose I just got to stuck on the "real magic" part. Nevertheless, I will not disagree that a wizard casting wandless magic at the same level as an average wizard does using a wand is a testament of their skill. But then their powers would increase several times if they used an innovation in their world. It's just like the equivalent of getting your information from newspapers or sending letters in our world, instead of using the internet.
