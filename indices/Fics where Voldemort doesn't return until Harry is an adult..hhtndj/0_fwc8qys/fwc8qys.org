Such fics are indeed too rare, and they actually avoid all kinds of nasty issues like:

- Ridiculous overpowered teenagers
- Ridiculous skill progression
- Ridiculous child politicians
- Dumbledore sacrificing children\\
- Child soldiers or children forced to become killers
- Minors in sexual relationships or 'true love' under 16

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), Voldemort returns in 2005, and most story takes place after 2008. It reaches 2024, but remains unfinished in its last story arc. But this fic is a rather extreme AU and things are quite different here.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), Harry and co face off Voldemort in 1999, with a powerful and competent Dumbledore leading them. It's still not exactly what you are looking for, and it's another extreme AU.
