"Beyond the curtain" by Bobika, linkffn(13047893) is one of my favorite adult Harry vs Voldemort stories. It's a little different from the usual in that it imagines a world where Voldemort won the battle of Hogwarts, and it builds up a completely different but believable world. It's still a WIP though.
