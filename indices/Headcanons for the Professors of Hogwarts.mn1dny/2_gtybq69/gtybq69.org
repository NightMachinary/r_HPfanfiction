Minerva and Hagrid were in the same year. 3 years below Tom Riddle.

No one is entirely sure how old Flitwick is. Must be the goblin in him. Obviously he's At Least 15 years older than Snape but could be ages with Minerva for all we know....

Burbage is now the youngest member of staff. She was only supposed to be temporary while Quirrel was on sabbatical but agreed to a second year when he applied for the dark arts position. Was offered a permanent contract in 1992.

Out of all the teachers Flich hates Sprout the most. She's always tracking dirt into the castle. He thinks it's a pity she's not a student he can put in detention. Mrs Norris is no help against her. She seems to actually like the woman for some reason. He doesn't know that Sprout grows catnip for her especially.
