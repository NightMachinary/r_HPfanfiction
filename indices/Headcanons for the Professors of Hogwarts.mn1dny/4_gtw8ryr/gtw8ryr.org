Snape and McGonagall have tea every Friday evening. It started off with Minerva physically dragging Snape to her office but eventually he made it on his own.

Snape and Minerva are lowkey best friends but you won't hear them ever say a nice thing about each other, though they bond over their students and quidditch

Trelawney has some sort of thing for Snape and makes passes at him when she gets drunk

Pomfrey and McGonagall make sure Snape takes care of himself.

Snape isn't afraid of Voldemort or Dumbledore, but he is bloody TERRIFIED of an angry Minerva

The Heads of Houses do bet on which Quidditch team is going to win...sometimes they even bet on other houses, but all behind Dumbledore's back

Filius gets along with everyone, he's the glue of the staff

Hooch really doesn't give a SHIT about anything

Every once in a while, when the students are really awful, the staff (minus Dumbledore and Trelawney) will spend the night getting drunk and playing games (chess, cards, etc.)

Everyone lowkey dislikes Dumbledore and talks shit behind his back occasionally

Everyone stays away from Pince

Snape is the baby of the staff even after he'd been teaching there for over a decade, and he goes to Dumbledore to complain, who only twinkles and offers him a lemon drop

Dumbledore's lemon drops have calming draught and just a little versitaserum

The staff has an ongoing bet each year of how each DADA teacher's term will end

Everyone knows of Sinistra's and Snape's on-and-off affairs which is just sex but no one dares acknowledge it...outright
