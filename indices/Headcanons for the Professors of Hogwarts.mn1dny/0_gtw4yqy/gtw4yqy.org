Hooch is unusual in that she only works part time and doesn't live at Hogwarts, she just teaches flying lessons for first years in the first term and comes in to referee Quidditch matches. She used to fly professionally and has enough saved up from her successful career that she doesn't actually need a year round job.

The staff routinely bet on the outcome of the Quidditch cup, which McGonagall takes very seriously.

Trelawney is so rarely seen the house elves sometimes don't even set out enough plates for her to eat at the staff table.
