McGonagall and Snape are best friends and only communicate in sarcastic quips and snarky insults.

Sinistra hates Trewlaney.

Flitwick is a dote and good friends with Minerva and Snape, but not on the same banter level. He is the amiable glue that keeps the staffroom together, able to liaise between different cliques.

Sprout is exactly as the films, badass weird and goes drinking with Hagrid. (Remus stuck with these two when he was at Hogwarts)

No one likes Dumbledore.

Sinistra and Vector are very good friends but the kind of polite, business friends who just talk about work. (Firenze stuck with these two)

Burbage always feels a bit left out (in my head she's very muggle so doesn't fit into the wizarding world as much). Generally stands at the edge and makes polite conversation with who'sever beside her.

Pomfrey is a stubborn fireball who sticks with Snape and Minerva whenever she has time to go to a meeting. Promfrey hated Gilderoy with a passion and Minerva more than once had to physically stop the woman from murdering him.

Sinistra is a lightweight. Flitwick is not.

Trelawney never shows up to anything. When she does she sticks with Burbage.

Hooch has little to no interest in any staff thing and makes excuses to miss them. She is a fierce, ruthless woman who takes absolutely no bullshit from anyone. Very frank and to the point. It's my own personal headcanon that her and McGonagall are married and spend their evenings drinking sherry and making very nuanced sporting puns. I don't care if it's not canon, I like it.
