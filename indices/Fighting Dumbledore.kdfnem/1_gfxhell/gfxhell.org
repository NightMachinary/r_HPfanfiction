I mean, you kind of answered your own question here. Fear. People don't go "Aaah! It's a lion, it has big teeth and is really fast and dangerous!" then run towards it. There's a reason military bootcamps have to literally deconstruct and retrain people to charge into danger instead of away from it. :D

Also, most people seem to like Dumbledore or not see him as dangerous, so why would they attack him? That's a bit Minority Effect, to kill people for something they might possibly do in the future.
