As fusions go this could be fun. I would swap out Daphne for Tonks as the Black Widow , as she has a better-matching background and an actual personality. Also Widow pulled off some nifty disguising in Winter Soldier that makes more sense if it's Tonks.

Also, not sure about Sirius being Yin Sen; he'd make a better match for Hawkeye, and Ron could be Rhodey.
