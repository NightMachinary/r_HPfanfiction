It's worth mentioning that /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ by /Less Wrong/ is probably the most well known fic to directly make this comparison (only one I've heard of, but I don't read much Indy!Harry).

It's a very polarizing read, people tend to either really love it or really hate it. Regardless, it does fit the bill of unnaturally smart children, if nothing else.
