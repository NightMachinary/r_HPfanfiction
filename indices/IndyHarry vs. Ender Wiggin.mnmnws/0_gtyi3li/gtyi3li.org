Indy!Harry is more like Bean/Achilles, more often than not.

Comes from a broken background. Desires to never be in that broken state again, and strives against returning with everything he has.

Good Indy!Harry comes off like Bean--accomplishing more and setting the world straight.

Bad Indy!Harry comes off like Achilles--turning against those who "helped" him, and self-centeredly attempting conquest.

edit: I want to add--because this is a fun topic and I've been thinking about it all day--that the trope!Harry that I would say Ender is closest to is probably MarySue!Harry. Ender is beset and pushed to his limits, but he is also shown to have almost no weakness. He is up to and better than any challenge.

As much as the books feature him as the main character, the events sort of happen around him, and what's interesting about the stories are the other characters, the settings, and the exploration of ideas.
