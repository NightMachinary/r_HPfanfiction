I'm glad you like the topic! I've been mulling it for days but don't know the tropes firsthand so you have way better input. I guess with the Bean comparison then I'd say that it sounds like his background has more in common with Bean but his present is more Ender in terms of being the chosen one and how that's portrayed? Never thought of the Achilles comparison at all. I'm drawn to Bean and Ender for him because they're very well done depictions of gifted children.

I think we see some flaws of Ender in terms of his obsessiveness with the computer game and his inability to form real connections with his peers even though that's largely manufactured by the staff. It's interesting though, I usually hate flawless characters but adore Ender. OSC just really made him work for me.
