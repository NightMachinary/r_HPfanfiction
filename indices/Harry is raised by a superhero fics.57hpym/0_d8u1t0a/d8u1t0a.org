[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/][Child of the Storm]] A HP/Marvel/DC/Dresden Files cross. Thor is cast down to Midgard, has his memories/abilities suppressed and is reborn as James Potter. Comes back into Harry's life during PoA as I recall. So not technically raised by superheroes initially but from that point forward. 800k+ words, no slash.
