Wtf? Nevermind the fact that she would have been 17/18 during their first year (graduated 1991), just no.

I like my age gaps, but 60/16 is a bit much, even before throwing in the 'in the body of an 11 year old' piece. I see no situation where any part of this is okay. The 16/17 year old having sex with a first year? The adult in a child's body having sex with a teenager?

Let's... just not.
