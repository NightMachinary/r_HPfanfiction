I didn't interprete it like that. Voldemort killed his prior love, Bellatrix, in cold blood. Odds are, he'd do the same to Tonks, should he tire of her or otherwise think her death would benefit him.

So, I think the relationship was seen by the duped characters as something good, not to the readers though.
