He was Voldemort, shagging young women was the least of his crimes.

He killed scores (50 muggles along with Vernon and Dudley, Sirius, Remus, Peter, McGonagall, Dumbledore, the Malfoys, Percy Weasley, and all of his old Death Eaters) before his 2nd year was over. Then he fooled all the light siders (Harry, Hermione, the Tonks, the Longbottoms, remaining Weasleys, the Boneses) in participating in his genocide against Muggles. I mean this Voldemort was far more dangerous and scarier than the canon one.
