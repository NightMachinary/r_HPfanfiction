The Confectionary Chronicles features Hermione's sister as a solid part of her backstory and she's referenced/talked about often, though she's not actually ever really 'in' the story. It's a supernatural cross-over, but you don't need to know anything about the other show to follow along (I haven't seen a single episode).
