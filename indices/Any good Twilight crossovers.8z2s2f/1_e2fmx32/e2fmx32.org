Interestingly enough, that's my next project planned! I was afraid no one would want to read it because Twilight is a dying fandom. But most of them are pretty terrible: either Bella is actually Bella Potter or everyone escapes the Wizarding World after the second war. Those last ones are usually Harry/Edward slash fics.

Anywho. I'll look around for you!
