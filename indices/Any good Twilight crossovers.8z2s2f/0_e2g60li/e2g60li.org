im enjoying linkffn(12777708), but its very heavy on the angsty woe-is-me harry, which i can see putting people off. as a positive its being actively updated, though.

theres also linkffn(8750155). leah imprints on harry. its not as well written as chrysochlorous but its fairly light hearted and amusing
