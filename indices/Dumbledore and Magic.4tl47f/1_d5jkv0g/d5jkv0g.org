Magical exhaustion is... unsubtle. And it's been done to death. I like the concept that casting doesn't cost you anything, it changes the nature of duels. Instead of being a war of attrition it becomes something like a chess game. Look at how Albus and Tom counter each other in their duel in book 5.

If you take the time to design a rock-paper-scissors type magic system you can write interesting combat where the reader understand the rules.

Just because casting doesn't tire you, doesn't mean that fighting doesn't. Running, dodging, injuries, adrenaline, all these things can offer everything Magical Exhaustion does with none of the draw backs. If Harry is duelling for his life, he should be getting his hair a little mussed.
