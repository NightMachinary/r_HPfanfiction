I gave the headcanon and first law some light skimming, and I agree with what was said about, hard magic and light magic(I think I prefer the hard magic). I think I'm going to still keep magical exhaustion in there, because I don't building a million houses by magic in one day is feasible, but I won't mention it, like it will be indistinguishable from mundane tiredness and simply 'power'.
