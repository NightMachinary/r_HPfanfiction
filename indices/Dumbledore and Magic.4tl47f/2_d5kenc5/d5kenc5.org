  Magic-wise, I'm thinking of a system where magic is exhaustive, unlike the limitless canon approach. On top of that, by nature with most things, some wizards are stronger than others. I think that's more canon aligned as with Voldemort and Dumbledore.

It depends on how much you care about canon-consistency, really.

In canon, what drives this "strength"? Both Voldemort and Dumbledore weren't just "strong", they were also geniuses with extraordinary drive to change the world to be more to their liking and unshakable confidence in their ability to do so, who also worked hard to get where they were. Conversely, the weakest wizards in canon (early Neville, Crabbe, Goyle, Lockhart) were lacking in either confidence or intelligence or had magic very closely aligned with their personality. Everybody else was somewhere in between, but nobody really stood out of the pattern: no wizards with low intelligence or weak emotional disposition who are nonetheless very powerful, for example, nor anyone brilliant and confident but weak. In fact, it's worth remembering that most of Neville's dramatic improvement in OotP happens /before/ he gets a new wand, from working hard and building up his confidence in DA.

So, non-magical traits (general intelligence, confidence, will, and personality, and just plain hard work) already explain so much of canon variation in "strength" of wizards, there isn't really much room for an arbitrary "strength" metric on top of that.

Canon Harry has a surfeit of will, his "proudly wearing his emotions on his sleeve", and his drive to protect all serve to empower his signature spell --- the Patronus --- and he is significantly above average in general magical ability, as a result of his above-average intellect, strong will (which hurts him as often as it helps), and no small amount of hard work --- even if he doesn't enjoy it. However, an AU Harry who could benefit from being mentored by Dumbledore --- a Dumbledore-grade genius /and/ a hard worker capable of mastering magic that only Dumbledore could teach --- would be a Harry in Name Only, IMO.

If it's a Naruto-style AU where everybody has an arbitrarily "chakra capacity" mostly set at birth that determines their power, all bets are off, of course.
