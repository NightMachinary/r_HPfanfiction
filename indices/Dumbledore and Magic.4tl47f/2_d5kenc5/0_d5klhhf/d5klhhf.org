I'd disagree with you there, on the point of canon wizards following mental strength = magical strength. The most standout for me is Hermione, clearly she's showcased as the most intelligent witch of her year, possibly moreso, and yet we don't see her as a 'mini-Dumbledore'.

On the point of Voldemort and Dumbledore I'd also disagree, yes they were intelligent and knew far more magic than most people, but one line has always stuck in my head from the ministry battle, it was when one of Dumbledore's spells crackled with power, which reinforced my idea that some people have more 'power' than others, though you can dispute how Dumbledore achieved his power, but I inferred from the narrative that he was always powerful, even in his youth.
