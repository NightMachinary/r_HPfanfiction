  I'd disagree with you there, on the point of canon wizards following mental strength = magical strength. The most standout for me is Hermione, clearly she's showcased as the most intelligent witch of her year, possibly moreso, and yet we don't see her as a 'mini-Dumbledore'.

For all my well-known pro-Hermione bias, I would never claim that she is anywhere in Dumbledore's league in terms of intellect. Dumbledore was a twice-in-a-century genius. Being smarter than anyone else in her Hogwarts class of about 40 would put Hermione around 99Â±1th percentile in general intelligence. Using the conservative (and nonsensical) figure of 3,000 wizards and witches living in Britain, that would mean that about 60 of them about as smart as her, and using the more sensible figure of 15,000, that's about 300. Certainly not a mini-Dumbledore.

Next comes personality and will. Hermione has the drive to make the world a better place --- whether the world wants it or not --- and confidence in her ability to do things she puts her mind to, and, indeed, when she opens a textbook and executes the instructions, before she even boards Hogwarts Express, the Universe obeys. Once she gets there, she is invariably the first in her year to learn a new spell when it's taught to everyone, as well as new magical techniques such as nonverbal casting and apparation. So, yes, she probably is the most powerful magical in her year in general-purpose magic.

But, the notable exception --- the Patronus Charm --- is also instructive: we don't know how long she would have taken to learn it had she joined Harry in his lessons with Remus, but facing down an actual Dementor, a socially conscious worrier like Hermione would falter: how can she ever be unconditionally happy in a world where House-Elves are enslaved and mistreated, where money and blood are worth more than truth, and where nobody ever gets an early start on their homework unless you nag them? Whereas Harry, who is braver and not as thoughtful can put these concerns out of his mind and /just feel/ the joy needed to sustain a powerful Patronus.

So, she actually fits the pattern perfectly.

  On the point of Voldemort and Dumbledore I'd also disagree, yes they were intelligent and knew far more magic than most people, but one line has always stuck in my head from the ministry battle, it was when one of Dumbledore's spells crackled with power, which reinforced my idea that some people have more 'power' than others,

To be precise, some /spells/ have more power than others, or at least have more impressive visual and auditory effects. :P

  though you can dispute how Dumbledore achieved his power, but I inferred from the narrative that he was always powerful, even in his youth.

He was a genius who came to Hogwarts with the will to change the world for the Greater Good. His OWLs Transfiguration examiner claimed to see him do things with his wand that she's never seen before (IIRC). That sounds like skill and finesse to me, not sheer scale.
