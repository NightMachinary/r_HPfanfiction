I've read that before. Yes, like that, but I don't want to completely copy it. I think I can add a bunch of ideas to a soul bond time travel fic. Like for instance, in that fic, they don't tell Dumbledore and he is kinda manipulative, in my fic they do tell him, and he provides ideas to make things somewhat easier although things don't always happen the same way, and Harry and Ginny do outright change some things.
