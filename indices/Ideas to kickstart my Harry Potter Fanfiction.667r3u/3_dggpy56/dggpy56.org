Well the Bond is there because the fact they were married before they went through time and it is trying to keep them together. I had planned on changing the dates of different events in the story from what they were originally, and also outright having some events like who comes out of the Triwizard cup different, I wanted the characters to not only use their past knowledge but their own inherent skills to solve problems. At the beginning most events will be the same, except Harry will get away from the Dursleys and Sirius will be freed some point before they start Hogwarts. Oh and I actually like the idea of Harry and Ginny going to Hogwarts together, but am not quite sure how I am going to manage that.
