I'd like to introduce you to the only good Ron/Lavender story ever written. [[https://windschildfanfictionwriter.tumblr.com/post/182811252478/nice-things][It's short, but sweet]]

She's also very nicely written in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725072/1/Harry-and-Luna-Against-the-High-Inquisitor][Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor]], though she's more of a background character here.
