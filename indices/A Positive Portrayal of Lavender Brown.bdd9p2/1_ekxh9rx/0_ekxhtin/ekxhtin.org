iirc, one of the stories revolves around Harry hunting down the last Death Eater and he has to investigate a werewolf village. Lavender shows up (survived Greyback, but heavily affected by attack) and helps Harry, goes through a serious act. Don't want to spoil too much but it's definitely one of the more heroic portrayals of her while maintaining true to her character

Pretty sure it is "Hunters and Prey"
