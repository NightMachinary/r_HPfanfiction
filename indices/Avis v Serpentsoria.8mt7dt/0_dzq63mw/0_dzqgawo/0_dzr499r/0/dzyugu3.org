  True, but on the old Pottermore spell-simulation thingie that predated Wonderbook had a Serpensortia page, where if you "failed" to cast the spell, the AI-assistant would tell you "Louder... looks like no snake heard you". The specific reference is on the Wiki page for Serpensortia, if you want to have details.

Was something like that on Pottermore? I know it was on the HP movie page. But movies. Wiki links to the movie page too.
