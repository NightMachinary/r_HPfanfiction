True, but on the old /Pottermore/ spell-simulation thingie that predated /Wonderbook/ had a /Serpensortia/ page, where if you "failed" to cast the spell, the AI-assistant would tell you "Louder... looks like no snake heard you". The specific reference is on the Wiki page for /Serpensortia/, if you want to have details.

As for why one would make that assumption, well, mostly because it's weird there'd be an easy second-year-spell to create a sapient being out of nothing. Birds are one thing (and on top of their nonsapience, there /Wonderbook/ tells us they aren't /quite/ real birds in behavior and appearance, more like broad simulations), but Draco's snake could speak and be reasoned with...
