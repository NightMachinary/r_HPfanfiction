From anywhere nearby. The closest wild snake, boom, here it comes. I saw an amusing theory somewhere that the reason there are so few snakes in the British Isles is that before the Ministry put an end to it, wizards drove most of them to extinction because they kept using /Serpensortia/ in duels and the snakes rarely survived the duels. (This is all based on something that used to be on /Pottermore/, per the Wiki.)

Alternatively, there's also the theory that dark families /keep/ some venomous snakes in their home which are preemptively marked with a Dark Mark-like spell so that they can be summoned anywhere by a member of the family. That one's a little more far-fetched, though.
