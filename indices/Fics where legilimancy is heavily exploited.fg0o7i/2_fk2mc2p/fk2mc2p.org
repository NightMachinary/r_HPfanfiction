I just read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind Hunting]], and if you're okay with a drawn out, slightly incoherent story, it has exactly what you're looking for and one of the absolute coolest interpretations of legilimency in the whole of HP fanfiction (IMO). If you're just looking for that I would say to just read the first half, as the second half focuses more on metamorph and martial arts magic. It's one of those â€˜Harry discovers magic before hogwarts' fics but it takes it in an absolutely off the wall direction that I think is worth at least checking out.
