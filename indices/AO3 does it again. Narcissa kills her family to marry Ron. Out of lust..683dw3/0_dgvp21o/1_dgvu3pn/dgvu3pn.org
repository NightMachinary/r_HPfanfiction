I didn't see anyone being downvoted for rec'ing that Lucius/Hermione rapey story a while back... Can't recall what it was called, but I think Lucius 'saved' her from Dolohov or something.

But this is not the first time that someone has complained about this story (I could swear that it was on FFNet before?). Funny how double standards work, isn't it?
