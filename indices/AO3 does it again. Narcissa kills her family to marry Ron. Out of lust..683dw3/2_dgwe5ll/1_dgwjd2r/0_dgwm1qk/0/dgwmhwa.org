I'm really not sure how I should react to this comment. Bashing is awful writing. Full Stop. There is no good way of bashing. Bashfics are the sewage of writing and it baffles me time and time again that people would like them.

What I meant with "rough diamond" is that Ron is about as socially refined as your stereotypical country kid, but he's generally a good guy and in any good fic that may define his charm.
