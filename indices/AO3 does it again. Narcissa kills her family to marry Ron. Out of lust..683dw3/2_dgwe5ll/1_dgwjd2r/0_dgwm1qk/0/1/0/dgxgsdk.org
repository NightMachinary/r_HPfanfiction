How about how Harry is so emotionally volatile that he shoves everyone away? Or how his shortsighted thinking gets people hurt or, in some cases, killed? How about his naivety? His lack of skill and know how? His self-righteous Messiah complex? His insensitivity to those who don't pander to him? Why don't you see these traits in fanfiction?

Joke. I doubt she's been slipping Arthur a love potion every day for the past twenty-some years. Arthur is very skilled at his job but as Percy says, he has no ambition. Ron didn't ditch Harry. Harry told him to go both times. He told Ron to leave during the horcrux hunt, and he pushed Ron away during fourth year. It wasn't Ron's responsibility to apologize, yet he did anyway. Wizards don't take medicine and Fred and George aren't incompetent enough to use something deadly on people. They try their own things out on themselves and reimburse those they have test their products.
