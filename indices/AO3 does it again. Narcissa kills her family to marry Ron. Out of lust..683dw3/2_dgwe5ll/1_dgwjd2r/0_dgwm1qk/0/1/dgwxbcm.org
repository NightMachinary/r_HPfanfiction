It really depends on the execution (no pun intended). If I depict the flaws of a character with a critical eye many people call that bashing.

For example, like I said, I don't like the Weasleys. The only one I like is Charly. Percy is somewhat alright. He went against his family and Dumbledore but by doing so he sided with the ministry, which is not better. But I can really relate to his need of getting away from Dumbledore because Dumbledore is at least guilty of endangerment in several hundred cases as well as accessory of child abuse and torture (sending Harry to the Dursleys). You really should not blindly follow that guy.

Now, if I were to ever publish a story they would not be depicted kindly but I wouldn't make stuff up either. Molly is admitting to and joking about using rape drugs. Arthur is completely incompetent in his profession. Ron ditched Harry more than once. The twins tested their products on kids. While harmless to themselves they did not take into account that the kids could have anything from an allergy to taking medicine which could lead to strange and lethal results.

No adult Weasley reported the abuse Harry went through. They kept sending him food and broke him out from behind barred windows. They saw the rags. They knew.

And if Molly is ok with using rape drugs on Arthur and is joking about that to her children who is to say that she did not dose Harry? The monster in the chest sounds awfully like the effects of a love and/or jealousy potion. All Harry needs in a nudge in the right direction (sounds familiar?) That can be part of the story without turning her into "evil potion queen Molly" who doses everyone with everything under the sun.

Tl;dr: You can write good Weasley Bashing while still having them be their canon selves.
