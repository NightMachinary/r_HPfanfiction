I agree with most of what you said about the Weasley's, and there's definitely a lot of truth there (can't speak on the issue of Molly and love potions, it's been too long since I read the books) but I disagree on what you said about Ron. The only times he ever ditched Harry in times of need where during the triwizard cup, which was admittedly a dick move, and during the horcrux hunt, while he was being influenced by an evil artifact that had been consistently shown to bring out the worst in people, and as soon as he was out of its influence he tried to get back but couldn't because of various events.

I still think they're important things to remember about a family that's usually either vilified or put on a pedastal (can you name any other characters that the fandom does that to?), even though they have flaws and strengths just as everyone else.
