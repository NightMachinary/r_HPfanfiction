sigh... You know, I had a 10 paragraph argument typed out, but I'll just not gonna bother. Its just not a good argument to use real life standards on a universe with its own standards, including that the universe is specifically designed to tell a story. If everybody in HP would have reacted like responsible humans, guess what? There would be no Harry Potter. The story would have never been printed.
