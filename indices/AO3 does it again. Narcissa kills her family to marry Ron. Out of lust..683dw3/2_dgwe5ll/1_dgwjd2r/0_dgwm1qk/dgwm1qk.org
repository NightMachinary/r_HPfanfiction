And that's were all the abusive Ron stories come from. Now, don't get me wrong, I like Weasley bashing but the whole "Maybe I can make him a better person" thing while he is abusing said female (be it Hermione, Luna or whoever else) is simply ridiculous. There are far better ways to bash Ron without going that far from canon.
