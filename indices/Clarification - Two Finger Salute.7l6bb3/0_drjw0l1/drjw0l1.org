When a UK person gives the 2-fingered salute, they are not using both middle fingers, but rather the index and middle fingers like you're giving the peace sign, but with the knuckles of the fingers facing the person being saluted. The story goes that in the Middle Ages, the French would cut those particular fingers off of captured archers, making them unable to use their English longbows. The English bowmen developed the gesture as a "fuck you, I still have my fingers and I'm going to shoot you" thing.

Now, you haven't provided any context for this occurrence in the fic so I can't say whether it was OOC or not, but in my own personal life, I've certainly flipped the bird to friends and even my husband as a joke. It's not always a serious fuck off--context definitely matters.
