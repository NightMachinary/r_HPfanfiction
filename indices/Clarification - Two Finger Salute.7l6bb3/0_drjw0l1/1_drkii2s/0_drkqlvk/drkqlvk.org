Up yours, fuck you--kind of all of a piece. My BFF and I learned about it in high school when she had her British pen pal visit over the summer. We participated in a knowledge exchange and demonstrated the bird and the double bird. We also learned that "bum" meant something very different! It went something like this:

Brit: Plays joke on American friend.

American friend: "You dirty bum!"

Brit: "Oi! You wot, mate?"
