Not in the same vein of the stories you mentioned, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10621071][Switchverse series by corvidae9]] does meet the 'muggleborn Hermione ends up in Slytherin' bit. It's a crackish/humorous sorting AU that starts with linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/704082]]) where the twins pranked the sorting hat and caused him to 'missort' almost everyone from Harry's year, resulting in them being friends with really different set of people from canon yet still quite in-character

EDIT: Wrong link!! The first one should be Switch linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10621071]])
