Probably because Tolkien did "Elf Friend" for LotR that indicated someone who had a close kinship with the various nations of elves and was considered by the elves to be a paragon of their people and a good ambassador. It was a lot more complicated than that, basically you had to do something pretty badass to become an elf friend (Like oh, I don't know, DESTROYING THE ONE RING) and it was more of a title of kinship than any power granting role.

Sadly, the kiddies just watched the movies and thought it was a cool title, and since goblins are totally misunderstood, a goblin friend could be someone who is chummy with the goblins and someone who the goblins will help protect (despite the fact that said "goblin friend" never does anything badass for the goblins). It's a stupid cliche. I can see the goblins being powerful allies if you did the right things for them, but you have to DO things for them first. Other wise they are liable to stab you in the back.
