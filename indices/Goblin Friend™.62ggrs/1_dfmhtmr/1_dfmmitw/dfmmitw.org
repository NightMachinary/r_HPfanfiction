Whoa, thanks! This sounds more credible than my assumption. Tolkien's lore is unparalleled, and young authors probably want to channel that broad worldbuilding aspect. They don't really put in the work towards it, though, so their lacklustre attempt at communicating goblin culture just make their story incomplete and their plots contrived.

I honestly thought the trope came from some specific pre-HPB edge fic. I am not disappointed to be proven wrong.
