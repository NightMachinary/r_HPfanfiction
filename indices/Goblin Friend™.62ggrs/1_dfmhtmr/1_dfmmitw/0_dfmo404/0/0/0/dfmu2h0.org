It's about perspective, too. It sounds like you're having a blast over there. I'd love to have half as much fun writing as you seem to. My natural seat-of-pants technique doesn't quite mesh with my desire of some semblance of structure, so it's difficult for me to put pen to paper successfully nowadays. Also, whoa. With your job in consideration, you've likely got patience down. That's, like, half the battle. Kudos.
