Oh, I don't want to emulate Tolkiens style by any means, I've developed my own over a few years of practice. That said, Tolkien is considered the father of High Fantasy and is the grandfather of fantasy RPGs and tabletop gaming. He's sort of the Michelangelo of writing. He's so accomplished and awesome that every baby writer wants to someday create a work as enduring and awesome as he did.

So of course, I write comedy HP fanfiction that features Meme Lord gnomes and Danger Noodle Basilisk.

(Also I'd rather be a really good teacher since that's my day job)
