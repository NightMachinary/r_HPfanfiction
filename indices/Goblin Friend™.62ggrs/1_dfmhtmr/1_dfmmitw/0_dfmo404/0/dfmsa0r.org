Passion is a language that can't really be taught. It applies to all art forms. Writing is very versatile, and the problem is that people say, "I want to be the next Tolkien." Instead, they should strive to reach their own full potential. It might take some emulation as a diving board of sorts to find your niche, but limiting yourself to someone else's success cheapens your own achievement. Right at this moment, you're 100% accomplished as you can be if you're dedicated to your craft. You're the bomb. â˜†
