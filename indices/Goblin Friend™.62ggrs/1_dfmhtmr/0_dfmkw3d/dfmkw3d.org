Which kind of devalues the title itself, I will say. In Tolkien's story, only three of the protagonists' parties' characters from Hobbit and/or Lord of the Rings had that title, two of them for their deeds towards pretty much everyone (Frodo and Bilbo) which pretty much means that the titled could as well have been “The Hero of Middle Earth”, and one because he went back-to-back to hell and back with one of the elves (Gimli) and did it not for any gain but for the person themselves. In the case of the last one there is also the additional bit about dwarves fighting for each other because they are all dwarves, all family, all one, and thus Gimli treating Legolas the same can and probably should be seen as something very darn important.

People shouldn't copy-cat things from other lores without any knowledge whatsoever of those lores. The friendship of Gimli and Legolas was beautiful to the point where I cried, and the “goblin friend” thing is just sad nonsense.
