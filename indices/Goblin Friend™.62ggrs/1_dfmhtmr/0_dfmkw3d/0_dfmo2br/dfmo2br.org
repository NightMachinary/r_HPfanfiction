Gimli basically single handedly renewed the kinship between elves and dwarves through his various actions, such as his chivalry towards Galadriel and his brotherhood with Legolas. That's pretty damn badass considering it was a centuries or millennia old grudge that was mended. As for Bilbo and Frodo, Savior of Middle Earth is a pretty good summary of what they accomplished. In both cases, the title of elf friend denoted someone who had done a truly valuable act for the elves and demonstrated that they were worthy of trust and respect.

An edgy teen managing to be polite and observe a few traditions does not come close. Maybe if Harry somehow negotiated wand rights, saved the lives and livelihoods of goblins by preventing a disaster at Gringotts, restored some ancient goblin heirloom, or mended the friendship between wizards and goblins. Those are the sort of deeds that would deserve a title similar to "elf friend."
