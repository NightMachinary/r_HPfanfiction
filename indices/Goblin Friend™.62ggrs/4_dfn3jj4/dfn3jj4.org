Yeah, its pretty stupid. Especially when being polite means using some phrase like "May your enemies die by your blade and your gold flow like their blood off your sword". Thats Eyeroll-Central right there.

If you have to make Harry their friend I can only see that happening over 2 ways. Either he's actually making them a huge profit, right off the bat with close to no action by them, or you expand on Goblin culture /a lot/ and then explain why he's now at least not disliked by Goblins.
