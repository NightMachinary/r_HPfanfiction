Unfortunately, Hagrid doesn't get much serious consideration outside of obsession with deadly animals and laughable teaching skills.

Never mind that he negotiated with /giants/ on behalf of the entire Order, shrugged off dozens of Auror spells, and survived a stint in Azkaban like it was nothing. On top of all that, he was trusted by Dumbledore himself to carry the Boy Who Lived out of the burning wreckage in Godric's Hollow. Poor underrated Hagrid.
