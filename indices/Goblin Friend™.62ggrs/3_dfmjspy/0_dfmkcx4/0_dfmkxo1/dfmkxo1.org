No kidding. Hagrid's a beast. Half of one, if you wish to be technical.

On a kind-of-not-really related sidenote: I was kind of annoyed by the bar scene in Fantastic Beasts. If you haven't seen the movie or didn't pay attention to the background, there is a giant sitting and drinking and reading. You know, non-threatening stuff that damn near /completely invalidates/ Hagrid's mission to Continental Europe to negotiate with them and how /dangerous it was/.
