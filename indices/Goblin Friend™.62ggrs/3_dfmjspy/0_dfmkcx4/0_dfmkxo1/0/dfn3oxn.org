It may be a bit too kind to assume Rowling does worldbuilding so well, but actually good worlds do not have whats called a "monoculture". Monocultures are when some species with the necessary brainpower to form cultures, acts exactly the same around the globe for some reason.

Giants have the brainpower to form a culture. They have enough of it to be bargained with, after all. So its likely that american giants have differences in their culture compared with european giants.

Given what we see in FB, those differences are massive. It seems that giants in America are civil and harmless when not provoked - maybe they're even well educated.
