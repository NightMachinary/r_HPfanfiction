If you actually expand on Goblin culture, to a degree where we can follow the thought process of Harry becoming their friend, I'm not against it. Hell, if your worldbuilding is up to snuff, I'm all for it.

But most authors use them as Deus-Ex-Machinas Deluxe and once Harry utters the words "May your gold flow freely yadda yadda blablabla..." they suddenly fall head over heels to grant him every wish. And its no longer a "Different Take". It hasn't been for a good decade now. Its a very old trope that hasn't aged well.

Plus, the boni Harry gets from being their friend make little sense most of the time. Its product of some heavy mental gymnastics that Goblins would oversee the succession of Houses (if they're even included). If that exists its one of the core principles of wizardkind in Britain. They wouldn't give that to a species they have a long history of bloody wars with. Some fics make the Goblins out to be some sort of office for the Ministry, dealing with stuff like marriage and guardianships. My suspension of disbelief can really only do so much...

Also:

1. Rape is a thing

2. They would, but that in and of itself does nothing.

3. Why wouldn't they just treat him as a good customer? A customer that looses his value once he looses his gold.

I'm not saying don't do it, I'm just saying that to make something original and interesting, the trope has to be averted at all cost.
