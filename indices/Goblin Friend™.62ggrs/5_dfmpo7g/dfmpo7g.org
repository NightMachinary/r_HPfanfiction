I don't get why folks dislike it so much. Its a "different take" on Goblins and isn't that what Fan Fiction is? Changing and exploring the universe of a story or tale? If you don't like it that's cool, don't read it.

Now... that little rant out of the way....

I always assumed the idea of Goblin Friend.... might of come from a combination of 3 things:

1. Flitwick is part Goblin, which implies that Wizards/Witches CAN be friends, if not lovers, with Goblins.

2. Harry (and friends) treat Dobby (and other house elves) different and much better than 99% of the wizarding world it seems. So why wouldn't they take similar attitudes towards Goblins?

3. Goblins value gold and hate that Wizards look down on them. Would it be a surprise that someone who is rich, can make them richer, and treats them as equals (aka HP) might.. just might... have a higher status within their culture (maybe even friend?).

Throw in the idea that it would be neat for Harry to somehow be aligned with the Goblin side of the wizarding world over actual wizards and it makes things... interesting. Plus it allows exploration of the Goblin world which is limited in canon. Plus it gives Harry a power play position or fall back support structure if needed. And it provides easy transition into various other tropes, and directions with regards to financial, political, or military power.

I was ALSO going to bring up Tolkien lore but someone else beat me to it.... poo.
