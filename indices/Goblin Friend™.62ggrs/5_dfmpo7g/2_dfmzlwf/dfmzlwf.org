My problem with it, in addition to what [[/u/ehhui][u/ehhui]] said, is that their culture is rarely explored, the goblins are just too damn affable almost bending over backwards to help, and frankly they end up just being a bandaid over Harry's problems.

I've never seen one that explored it all the well, or added any real twists. Well, super AU Pheonix Trilogy by Darth Marrs had one where goblins are only male, and basically buy muggleborn girls to breed with.
