Goblins are doublecrossing creatures that see the value in their own handiwork more than they do their relationship with wizards.

They're conniving, but don't get me wrong - I don't think it's necessarily without reason. Just look at the way they're regarded by wizarding society. The fountain in the ministry atrium demonstrates the popular view towards magical creatures pretty succinctly. The tensions between wizard and goblin span centuries. There's prejudice aplenty on both sides. A single culturally ignorant muggleborn witch or wizard isn't going to endear goblins to them with shallow niceties.

That's what most of these fics feature, in my experience. People just use the goblins as a catch-all tool to make Harry look more accepting of those different from him and reveal to him through blood magic seventeen and a half dormant seats on the Wizengamot to be made active once he wears his magically invisible heir ring that, when worn, strips him of any and all compulsions and provides master-level occlumency barriers. Oh, and they use them to help throw a middle finger to The Man.

If you can actually link me to a story that develops goblin culture well, /pls omg/. I will definitely not be disappointed to be proven wrong.
