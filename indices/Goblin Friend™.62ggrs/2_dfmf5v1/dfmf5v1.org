I have no goddamn idea, and this trope nearly always makes me turn off what I'm reading, because it's fucking ridiculous. Leaving aside the fact that Rowling never went into the structure of Goblin society or whatever, the only even mildly fleshed-out representation of a Goblin in canon is Griphook, and he's a twat.

The whole idea that the protagonist (usually an either eleven-year-old or fifteen-year-old Harry) on the way to getting his independence from a certain lemon-drop addicted 'meddling old coot' can ingratiate himself with an entire fucking species by being sort-of-polite is so stupid I can't even see the thought process behind it.

I /despise/ this trope, and much prefer stories that make Goblins total bastards (if they /have/ to include them at all) because then they can have an interesting interaction with the protagonist, rather than being downgraded to some magical blood-testing, horcrux-removing, old-coot-defeating, seriously-misunderstood gang of helpers for Harry's fucking shopping list to independence.
