You feel /very/ strongly about this! Thank you for the laugh. I find it hilarious how far writers are willing to bend ass backwards to elevate Harry in the most unrealistic ways... well, relatively unrealistic. It's not at all creative and invalidates any of Harry's success since all he does in most fics of this nature is /remember Griphook's name/. I'm sure he's not the first to acknowledge goblins, unless there's some lowkey mass compulsion enacted Many Moons Ago by some enterprising, war-weary wizard who decided that any fraternization between goblins and humans should be short to avoid impolitic exacerbation of a small matter, like the ownership of a sword or something equally silly.

Every non-goblin sentient being is /persona non grata/ in Gringotts. Goblin Friendâ„¢ is the non-goblin sentient being who doesn't heed the warning at the door, named thus because they so kindly extend their necks for goblin sword practice. Headcanon cemented.
