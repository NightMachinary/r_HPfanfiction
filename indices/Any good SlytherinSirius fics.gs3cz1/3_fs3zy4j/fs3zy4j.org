Touch of Grey: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22408996/chapters/53539420]]

A grownup Harry Potter falls into an alternate universe. He helps Dumbledore defeat Voldemort, and finds himself teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts to his parents and a Slytherin Sirius Black, whose magic strangely seems suited to his own.

Getting through the year may prove tougher than defeating the Dark Lord.
