Depends on whether you mean Sirius in Slytherin, or Sirius acting like a Slytherin. For the later I recommend Siriusly Senor Firsty and it's sequel Siriusly Silly Plan. Both can be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/161/Odd-Ideas][here]] as part of Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas.

Sirius finds himself back at 11 and set's out to fix the future... and prank everyone.
