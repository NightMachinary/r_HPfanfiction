There's a tag for this on AO3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Slytherin%20Sirius%20Black]]

One of the best things about this is the use of knowledge management and controlled vocabulary to combine like tags in the freeform category ([[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query%5Bname%5D=slytherin+sirius&query%5Btype%5D=Freeform]]) into a single preferred term "Slytherin Sirius Black".

Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendations because I can't say I've read any in this category, although I am interested in different Sortings from canon.
