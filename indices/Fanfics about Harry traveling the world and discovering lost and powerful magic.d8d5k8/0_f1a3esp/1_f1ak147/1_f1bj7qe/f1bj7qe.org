I'm anti-recommending this, and not just to be contrary. It's written in a weird almost stream-of-consciousness style with way more inner thoughts than action, and even less dialogue (some chapters literally don't have a single line). In the first chapter Harry (Harriet) spends paragraphs musing about ancient cities and Voldemort, and then abruptly she's clawing her way out of a grave with no scene transition or anything. It doesn't get much better after that.
