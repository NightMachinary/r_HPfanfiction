linkffn(Make A Wish) is probably the best known fic of its sort. Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) and especially its sequel both meet as well; and for a little genderbent dimension crossing curse-breaker Harry discovering lost magic, but a bit less travel (he goes back and forth to a ruined city in northern Italy), there's linkffn(The Archaeologist).
