I like lots of non canon ships.

Hermione / Snape - seriously some of the best writing in the fandom and often angsty meaty fun stories.

Hermione / Draco - more fun and just opposites attracting.

Non romantic Snape / Harry, mentor fics rewrite canon in so many ways.

Harry / Draco - there always seemed a touch of something more in their obsession with each other, but these are very hit and miss.
