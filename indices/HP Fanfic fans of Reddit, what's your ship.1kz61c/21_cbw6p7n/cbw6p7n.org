I love Lupin/Tonks fics, which I suspect is because I have pink hair and a mad crush on David Thewlis... Dramione is always fun but I hate that they always portray Ron as a bumbling idiot. I love Ron, and he isn't clever enough to be with Hermione but some of them are so OOC... I don't get Hermione/Snape, does anyone have any good recs?
