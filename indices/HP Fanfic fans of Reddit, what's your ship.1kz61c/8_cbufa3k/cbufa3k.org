My main ship is Harry/Hermione. I also love Dumbledore/McGonagall.

Snape/Hermione is a guilty pleasure of mine. Snape is really the only person outside of Harry that I'll ship Hermione with. I just haven't found anything that I think can work. I'm not saying I won't ever ship her with someone else. A few weeks ago, I read a really good Harry/Pansy story and I never really even thought about shipping Harry with anybody else really until that.
