HG/SS was the first ship I ever read when I first stumbled on fanfic thanks to Mugglenet. I waslooking for theories of Snape as a good guy. He was a vampire, and Hermione becomes bound to him and they save Harry. Very AU and OOC.

Turns out I was right and Snape was a good guy (yay!) and the pairing is still hot to read ;)
