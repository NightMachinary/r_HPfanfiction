Amidst the normal calls for Dramione (who I read the most because there are most stories for them), I have some very "unpopular" favorite parings. They all revolve around Hermione, since I find her pretty awesome.

Hermione X Sirius

Hermione X Lupin

Hermione X George (Will NOT substitute Fred, personal preference).
