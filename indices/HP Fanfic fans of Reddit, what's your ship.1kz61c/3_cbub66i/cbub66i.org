Harry/Pansy

The possibility for stories with these two are endless, but what usually happens is they change Pansy too much. I've read one of the more popular fics where she was acting stupid for Draco and was really smart, wearing a glamour to look ugly when she was really beautiful, hated Slytherin, etc.

I want to make one where she still has all her flaws. Ugly, selfish, bully, all that stuff gosh darn it!
