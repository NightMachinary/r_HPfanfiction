Canon. I'm very boring. I'll go for anything that seems mildly likely in an AU situation, like Harry/Susan where Harry is a Hufflepuff, but pairings that seem kind of incompatible (like Harry/Narcissa) kind of weird me out. Same goes for slash for characters that are obviously not gay. And Harry/Hermione makes me gag and hit the back button.
