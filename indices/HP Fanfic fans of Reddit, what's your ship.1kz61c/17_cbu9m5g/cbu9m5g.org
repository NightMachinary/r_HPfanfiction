SS/HP or AD/HP (A sore lacking of these), though with Harry as an adult. (I love the age difference, just not where one character is underage.)

AD/Any male character, too- Oftentimes in fic, if Albus' sexuality is brought up at all, it's either as incidental or as a negative thing (eg, he kept Snape out of Azkaban because the two are boinking. I've had a few good fics utterly ruined for me because of this sort of Dumbedore bashing.)
