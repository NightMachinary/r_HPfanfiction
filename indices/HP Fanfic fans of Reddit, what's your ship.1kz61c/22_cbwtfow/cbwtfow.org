I'm one of those people that finds a ship and reads the hell out of it until he hates it. I started with canon ships and eventually just got sick of Ginny. Fell in love with the idea of her using love potions, although I prefer it not to be Ron bashing. I never seem to get sick of HHr stories though. Right now I'm reading through every novel length Harry/Tonks story I can find.

When it comes to slash, I don't know. I can't really read it unless it's very pg13. Any explicitness just kind of turns me off of a story. Although when it is slash, I prefer Harry/Draco with a Snape mentor.

One guilty pleasure of mine is Harry/Bellatrix. I have no clue why, it just intrigues me.
