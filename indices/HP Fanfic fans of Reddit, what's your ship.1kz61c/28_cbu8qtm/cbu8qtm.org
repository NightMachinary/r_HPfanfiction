*Tomione.* Hands down.

I'm currently reading "precious mudblood" for the third time. There simply aren't enough dark LV/HG fics out there...sigh..[[http://members.adultfanfiction.net/profile.php?no=1296886882&view=story&zone=hp]]

EDIT: Since you like Dramione, I should mention there is some light Dramione in the story.
