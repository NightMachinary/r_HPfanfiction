I think I'd throw myself through the Veil of Death, first, to see if it dropped me elsewhere in the multiverse.

You know, after getting a bigger-on-the-inside wand holster that's a Horcrux of mine, under a fidelius on it's location of “on my left forearm”, in the hopes that whatever I put inside it (the hogwarts library, the library of congress, the matrix weapon room, all the food/drink/seeds ever, a house elf or three) will actually come with me; and that I won't wake up, buck naked (sans the Hollows) on a beach of an uninhabited world.
