Despite the downvotes I agree with [[/u/aldonius][u/aldonius]] that you should check out HPMOR. At worst you'll hate it. It won't melt your brain or anything like that. Its Harry is very annoying but definitely convincingly smart, and he gets somewhat less annoying (most of the time) after the first 1/4 or so of the book.
