It's not like HPMOR /at all,/ but linkffn(Victoria Potter) is really how a rational premise would play out without devolving into crack.

There are somewhat rational adjustments to canon, but they're really subtle and make the world a little tighter than in canon. And there's a great humanistic element under it all as well.
