Well, its more of a glorified story time with [[/u/ruljinn]] than anything I'm developing a system for. The friend's that have me running it while our D&D DM is hiding in Ireland aren't much interested in rules so much.

I explained it to them as a Possession Sue game, where their goal is to have Harry survive to graduation. They lose if Harry dies, or if either Tom or Albus discover that they're outsiders possessing students.
