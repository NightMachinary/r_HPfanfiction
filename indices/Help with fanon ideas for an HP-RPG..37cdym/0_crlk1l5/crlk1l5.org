I ran a HP RPG with GURPS quite a while ago.

Your post is awfully vague, to be honest. I could give you some advice if I get some questions first. One of my questions would, of course, be: What system are you using and are you sure it handles the magic system well? What kind of story will your players go through and in what era?

And for a general tip: Have the HP wiki handy when you GM.
