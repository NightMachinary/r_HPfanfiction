The Freeform system really depends on the GM. He has to judge wether or not the failure is actually that bad. For example, take the Wingardium Leviosa class. I'd say that the worst case scenario there would be Finnigan burning his feather. "No, and" situation could also include that Flitwick sees you fooling around, your peers laugh at you for pronouncing it stupid, you sting yourself in the eye,...

The first system really does add a lot of random chance. But note that there is actually just one time when a spell that is known to the player actually fails. The other times its just weak. A method would be to add success margins on the general roll that can manipulate the 1d4 rolls. For example, a success margin of 3 on the general skillroll gives you a +1 for a 1d4 roll of choice.
