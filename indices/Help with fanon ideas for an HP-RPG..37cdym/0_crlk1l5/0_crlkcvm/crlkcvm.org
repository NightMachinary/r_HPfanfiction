The vagueness is because I hadn't really figured out a system. I wasn't sure it was worth having a system to arbitrate what is really a ridiculously goofy magic system. If you can think of a system that can handle it I'll look into it. Any advice you can offer would be appreciated.

They're playing through Harry's school years, but aren't allowed to play as Harry. Harry is the game's living breathing maguffin. If the players get into combat and it's do or die, chances are they lose. I'm thinking of it more as writing a piece of fanfiction where my main characters are self aware and able to decide things for themselves. I just tell them what happens based on how they decide to go about things.

Story wise they're all going to be playing self inserts of a sort. I'm aiming for "hilarity ensues" as a general state of being for the game. It isn't meant to be terribly serious, but I want it to be consistent. They have to try and manipulate Harry, and the general Hogwarts population, etc into not dying. IFF there were a person playing Harry, their mission would be to die in the most hilarious and believable ways possible.

I'm not sure if I expect them to survive the train ride to first year without having things go wrong.
