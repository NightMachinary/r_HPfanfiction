Maybe. But that means that Blaise gets no input on his future just because his family name is Zabini. Given what we've seen is possible with HP's magic system... perhaps all the sorting conversations and announcements happen near simultaneously from the Hat's perspective. Or the Hat is simply a prop/distraction to get the firsties to focus their sorting while the castle rummages about in their head.

Fortunately my players seem to be fine with taking multiple days to get on the bloody Hogwarts Express... so I don't need an answer to anything all that fast.
