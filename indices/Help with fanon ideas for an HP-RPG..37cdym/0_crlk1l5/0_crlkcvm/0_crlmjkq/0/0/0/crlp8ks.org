  Will the Sorting Hat see the original characters mind or the players mind when sorting?
#+end_quote

I haven't figured that out for sure yet...

I figure that the sorting hat has a magical NDA, but might play malevolent genie as a form of protest against demons/outsiders/etc possessing students in it's school. Sorting students in unexpected ways as a means of drawing attention to them.

At the same time it's a game, and I want them to have fun, so I want them to have some control over their character's sorting...
