Fortunately character creation is simplified by the fact that they're playing themselves. They're replacing canon character's minds with their own and then running with it.

Example, two of them are going to play Susan Bones and Hannah Abbott. They know everything that they (players) know, but only get vague impressions of what Susan and Hannah knew. The challenge is to have no one twig to the fact that they've pod people'd the characters.

So in your example, the Draco copy wouldn't be a Copy, it would be one of them puppetting Draco's body around... but your caveat still stands. Draco being friends with Harry will generally be investigated by Lucius and, by the transitive properties of gossip, trigger the "they lose if Voldemort finds out about them" loss condition.
