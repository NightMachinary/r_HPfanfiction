For systems there are three possibilities in my mind:

1. GURPS - Its incredibly vast and can simulate anything with dicerolls if you want. It can also just provide some general guidelines for your game. However, knowing the system as GM is necessary to make it flexible. I'd mainly suggest this because of the fair and interesting Character Creation system. Start with [[http://www.warehouse23.com/products/SJG31-0004][GURPS Lite]] to run your game.

2. Fate - More lightweight than GURPS and unable to reach its complexity. But thats probably what you want anyway. I had some decent games with it, but as always with these things: The lighter the rules, the more disciplined the players need to be. Use [[http://www.faterpg.com/][FateCore]]

3. Freeform Universal - the RPG system in the Superlightweight-class. The whole system has 23 pages of introduction. You could literally let your players read the rules and create their characters while preparing dinner. If you're searching for a mere framework for free roleplaying in order to keep some sort of ruleset, this is the system for you. Due to its light rules it also handles magic systems very well. Look ate the *pdf* [[https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1382/92/1382929649988.pdf][here]]

A fun little thing I can think of is to let them create their characters before entering Hogwarts and then go through the sorting process on the site [[https://www.pottermore.com/en/sorting-hat][Pottermore]] while pretending to be their character. Its some initial adding of character depth and gets them in the mood.

Another thing I did was to give them one special ability at a low level. One chose to be a metamorphmagus who was unable to change more than one thing on his body at one time. Another was a natural Legilimens, another came from a "Ancient and Noble House" (hence being quite good at speech related skills) and the fourth decided to have a knack for DADA. You could tell them to choose one ability (or for hilarity, disadvantage) that would make the whole thing more interesting. Having a allergy to floo powder that lets one tung swell turned out to be the funniest thing ever.

Also set limiters for their character creation. Obviously one can't play a Draco Malfoy copy /and/ look out for Harry.

I'd make them enter the fray as some sort of "Weasley replacement" in the train to Hogwarts. I think the first conversation with Harry would be a good place to start.
