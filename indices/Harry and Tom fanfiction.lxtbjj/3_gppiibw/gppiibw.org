[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4728995/chapters/10806773][Gilgamesh]] is probably the closest thing I know of (the story is completed, but it has incomplete sequel).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10241474/1/In-Wonderland][In Wonderland]], but here Harry comes back earlier and raises Tom (sadly neither is completed).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15873207/chapters/36982095][Ink]] (completed) is not a time travel, but it has great dynamic between Harry and Diary Tom (this is somewhat similar to another Fictionist's story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932144/1/Solace-in-Shadows][Solace in Shadows]], which I also recommend).
