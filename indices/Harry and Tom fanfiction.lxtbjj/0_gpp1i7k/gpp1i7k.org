Can you link your story? I don't know it but it sounds interesting!

I'm actually reading one right that's REALLY good but it is Fem!Harry so I'm not sure if you're in that. I really love it though because Harry gets thrown back in time and is appropriately terrified of Tom and treated like an outcast by the rest of Hogwarts for being so strange. Tom's characterization is done really well imo, hes young enough that he still has the potential to change but still Tom Riddle enough to be angry and hateful and want Harry dead just for being an inconvenience to him. She's the only one who knows what he is truly like inside and isn't fooled by the fake persona he puts on for everyone else, which is one of the reasons he starts to like her and wants to be her friend but she (true to what Harry tormented by Voldemort her whole life) wants nothing to do with him so he (true to his scheming and cunning ways) has to come up with plans to get keep her in his company while also not making it seem like he wants to be in her company. It's really funny too!
