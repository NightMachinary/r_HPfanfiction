linkao3(Harry Potter and the forsaken's ascension) the title is kind of pretentious lol. It's the first in the Ashes of Chaos series and IMO it's the better written but unfinished version of Prince of Slytherin. That being said, those two along with Sarcasm and Slytherin linkao3(Harry potter and the den of snakes) are the holy trinity of WBWL â€˜Harry goes into Slytherin' series.

Antithesis is by far the best but it doesn't count because it's so out of the league of those three.
