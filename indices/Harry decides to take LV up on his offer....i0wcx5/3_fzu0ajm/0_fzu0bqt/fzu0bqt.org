  Departing from 'Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos', what would happen if Harry had taken Lady Voldemort on her offer in the mirror chamber? It's not like there was anything for him in the outside world. Might as well get some tutelage from the Greatest Dark Witch Since Morgana and some sweet revenge.
