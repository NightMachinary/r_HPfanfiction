I had one where Tom Riddle creates reliquaries into which he can move his soul. If his soul is in his body when he's killed, he's dead. If it's in a reliquary when the reliquary is destroyed, he's dead. But he can move his soul between bodies and reliquaries, providing a smaller measure of durability against death than a horcrux. The benefit is that he isn't burning his brains to extend his life (as personal experience with his first horcrux, as examined under the influence of the Diadem of Ravenclaw, showed).
