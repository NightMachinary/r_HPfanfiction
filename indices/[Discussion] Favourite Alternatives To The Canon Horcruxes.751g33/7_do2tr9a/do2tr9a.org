[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] often uses different implementations of Horcruxes:

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), [[/spoiler][Death Eaters themselves were his Horcruxes, and he could make almost an infinite amount of them]]

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), [[/spoiler][He could also make many of them, hidden all over the world and protected by extremely lethal traps]]

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), [[/spoiler][he made a comprise and used one ordinary rock as one of his Horcruxes, and threw it to the bottom of the Atlantic]]

In ALL 3 instances, canon Horcrux hunt would have absolutely failed.
