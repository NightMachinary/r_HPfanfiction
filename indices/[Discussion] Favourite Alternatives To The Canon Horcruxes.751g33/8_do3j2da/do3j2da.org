I actually liked the Horcruxes from HPMoR - Voldemort has [[#s][perfected the Horcrux ritual. Each one binds his soul the living, but doesn't require him to split the soul. So he's got thousands of them around, some hidden very well. He even put one on the Voyager before it launched.]]. It basically made it so Voldemort actually /cannot/ be killed. Gotta find another way to deal with him.

I also think the Dark Mark is pretty great. One of the things it does is puts some more reasoning behind putting permanent obvious marks that can't really be hidden on your followers.
