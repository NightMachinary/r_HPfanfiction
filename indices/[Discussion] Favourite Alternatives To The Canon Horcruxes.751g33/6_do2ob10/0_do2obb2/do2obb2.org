  The Lernaean Hydra has many heads, and it seems as if you will never cut them all away. It's near immortal - as if it will never die.With the death of Lucius Malfoy, the wizarding war is tipped into motion, but Harry Potter doesn't feel prepared to approach it.

  The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. Slytherin!Harry, platonic H&Hr duo, assorted ships. No Lord Potter, no creature inheritance, no OP!Harry - AU plots (no Riddle diary, no Department of Mysteries, alternate prophecies, no Horcruxes). Character-focused and plot-heavy. Cross-posted (with extra content) to Ao3.
