linkffn(To Play the Devil)

[[/s][I don't think its normally used to execute people, but they had to use it for Tom and Harry but it is actually a portal (Its been a while, but Tom and Harry may have done some ritual on it to make it not kill them? I don't remember), leading to the sequel linkffn(Traveller by The Wayland Smith)]]

They only use it at the very end of the fic though and its not at all the focus of the plot so idk.
