I'm pretty sure it's just because women in France (and most of the rest of the world, probably) started shaving body hair later than Americans did. So there probably was a time a few decades ago when most American women were shaving (and American pop culture was pushing that idea), but most French women hadn't started shaving yet. And the stereotype just never disappeared after it became untrue.
