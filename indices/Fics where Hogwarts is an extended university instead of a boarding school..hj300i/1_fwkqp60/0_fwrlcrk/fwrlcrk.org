Muggleborns could definitely be at a very significant disadvantage. At the very least, the culture shock would be much more intense.

As far as the actual magical education goes though.... it depends. In an AU like this, you could pretty easily say that wizards are simply not developed enough both magically and mentally to start learning and casting magic until a certain age, so wizard-born kids actually aren't all that ahead of muggle-borns.
