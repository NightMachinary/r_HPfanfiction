Even if they don't get to actually cast spells until they're adults (an incredible idea to play with by the way) just the fact that purebloods/half-bloods grow up knowing about the magical world and seeing their parents cast spells/make potions etc. gives them an advantage over Muggleborns, IMHO. Like how kids who grow up in literate households have an advantage over those who don't even if they're not expressly drilled in academics. Although, if they aren't studying magical theory, what ARE pureblood kids doing during their childhoods? Even if they study the same subjects as Muggle kids, or the equivalent, they still do grow up knowing about magic if not able to cast spells.

If magical kids just sit around having years of constant summer vacation, then it could be a huge culture shock when they go to school though. It could be that the work ethic of Muggleborn students counters the pureblood advantage of growing up in the magical world. That would be hilarious - pureblood kids being these hippy-dippy artistic types with no sense of economics or scheduling since magic makes it so they don't need to worry about scarce resources and they have like two decades of free-range roaming and playing.
