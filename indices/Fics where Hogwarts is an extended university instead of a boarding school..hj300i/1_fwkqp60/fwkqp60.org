Muggleborns would be at an incredible disadvantage is my first thought, although a fic where they are, in fact, really well-equipped thanks to modern-day educations being so much better than what they would get in medieval times and applying all sorts of Muggle skillsets to magic would be interesting.

Edit: Added to this is if Muggleborns enter the world as adults, a lot of them wouldn't even tell their parents. So Petunia and Lily would have grown up together, Petunia might not have become so crazy bitter and jealous, and maybe not so obsessed with 'normality'. So maybe Harry has a less abusive childhood.
