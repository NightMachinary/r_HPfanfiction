I outlined a fun fic where Hogsmeade is a college town with Hogwarts University at its center (although Hohwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry still exists, HogsU came much later), and Harry is a transfiguration prodigy and is the first person to unlock multiple animagus forms (and published a paper so now anybody can do it) and is researching self induced human transfiguration (kind of like Krum's shark transfiguration in GOF, or the T-1000 from Terminator 2 if you take it to the extreme). SIHT (humorously pronounced "SHIT") was used extensively in his bid to defeat Voldemort, so seats in his lectures are extremely sought after, and he has to weed out all the people there just to gawk at him.

His ultimate goal is to unlock the secret to magical creature transfiguration, so he frequently goes on archeological expeditions to track down myths and urban legends about people (past or current) with the abilities of magical creatures or magical animagus forms.

He has a lovable, misfit band of research assistants including Charlie Weasley, Luna Lovegood, Rolf Scamander, a druid, and a native american (who was previously the apprentice of a shaman in a tribe with spirit animals).

It was going to take a shot at explaining the phylogenetics of magical creatures when they came upon a "Jouney to the Center of the Earth" style hidden population of exclusively magic creatures where there was enough biodiversity and isolation to establish an evolutionary tree (although since magic is involved it would be closer to a web, looking more like the evolution of bacteria who have horizontal gene transfer).

I never got much past the outline, but it was a fun idea.
