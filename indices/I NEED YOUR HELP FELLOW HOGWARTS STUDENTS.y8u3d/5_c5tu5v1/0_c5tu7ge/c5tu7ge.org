Just realized - these were characters I came up with for a story I never wrote, which took place around our time, i.e. ~2012ish. So obviously none of the original classmates of Harry Potter would still be around (meaning the twins aren't the beaters). Just kick them off the team if that's a conflict! Gage won't be too sad.

Edit: Also, if you need any more OC's I have more you can borrow. Thorne's best friend Quinn Mason, Gage's girlfriend Amita Khan and her best friend Ruby Harwick. Thorne's love interest Winnie Snow, her best friend Olivia Parker. Winnie and Olivia's friend Howell Crane and his boyfriend Aubrey Harrow. Hit me up for the bios, or just borrow the names if you like.
