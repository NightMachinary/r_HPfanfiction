Looks like you might need a few guys.

*Gage Throckmorton*. I'm a Gryffindor seventh year. My mother was born to a minor branch of a prominent pureblood family (you might know my very distant cousin, Theodore Nott), and my dad, who was born to a muggle and a squib and was raised completely muggle, wooed her in secret before they were able to elope. I grew up in Hogsmeade, where my mother and father operate their own small apothecary. I am a dab hand at herbology, but too many of my chores as a child revolved around working in the garden for me to really like it. I'm no genius, but get decent grades. My real talent is on the pitch, where I am a starting beater for my fifth year running.

It's worth noting that I am about 6'6" and weigh around 235 lbs, almost all muscle. I have sandy blond hair and warm brown eyes, and freckles. People would be intimidated by my size but my friends tell me I'm too much of a teddy bear to scare anybody. My buddy Thorne, who is my fellow beater, calls me GG for Gentle Giant (and because my name is Gage).

*Thorne Blackwood*. I'm also a Gryffindor seventh year. As Gage said, I'm a beater for Gryffindor, and have been for the last four years. I am what you might call a pureblood, since my parents and all four of my grandparents are magical - but my maternal grandfather was muggleborn, and I have several muggle and squib relatives and cousins who I see over holidays. My parents are divorced, and I live with my mum but spend a couple weeks each summer at my dad's. My mum works in the ministry on the Committee on Experimental Charms. She's always coming home with crazy enchanted objects and new spells she's testing out. Our home tends to be a bit chaotic. One time when I was eight she accidentally turned my skin purple for nearly a week before she worked out how to switch me back. Dad calls himself a "researcher", but he's pretty much a freelance article writer for academic journals who lives off of his inheritance. It's a trial to get him out of his study when I visit.

I have a slight obsession with muggle classic rock music, and have been working for the last year or two on adapting muggle technology to magic so I can play music on something more updated than a gramophone. I have a soul connection with Eric Clapton and want to learn to play guitar. My favorite classes are Charms, naturally, and DADA. I am tall, but not as tall as Gage - about 6'1". I have dark hair, almost black, and slate blue-gray eyes.
