Marise Caufield (Or whatever last name you want).

*Background:* I was born on July 28th. I'm in the same year as that Potter kid. Related to the Lestranges and thereby the Blacks and Malfoys. My mother is the sister of Rudolphus Lestrange. Obviously, I'm in Slytherin because it's the greatest House ever. Also, I'm a Pureblood, as if you had to ask.

*Attitude and Thoughts:* I'd hate to be in Hufflepuff, how embarrassing. Divination is complete shit. I would like to be an Auror. I don't entirely buy into the whole Death Eater thing. Obviously, us Purebloods are meant to be on top, but killing off our race isn't going to do anything. Let's be sensible, people. Since I want to be an Auror, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Charms are some classes I must suffer through. I adore Potions though, isn't Professor Snape the sexiest? He has that whole brooding thing about him. Sigh.

*Appearance:* Fair-skinned with dark, mahogany hair and clever green eyes. This makes me look like one hot chick in my green Slytherin tie. About five foot six, so pretty much average height, though a little on the tall side. Stylish, but not overtly concerned with it.

Ashleigh Carlisle

*Appearance:* Blonde and curvy, with blue eyes and a pouty lip. Smiles a lot. Very bubbly and happy.

*Background:* Father killed by Voldemort recently (if applicable to your story). She's a Hufflepuff and loves it. Her favorite class is Care of Magical Creatures because she has lots of fun with the animals. Especially the unicorns! She's a bit on the dumb side, but will always make comments that make someone laugh. This can hurt her feelings sometimes, of course, but she always picks herself up and goes on her way. She doesn't take herself too seriously. She's in school to find a husband, preferably a rich one, but could also become a vet for magical animals if need be. Two years behind Harry and Co.

*Famous Quotes by Ashleigh:* "This is really good! What's in pumpkin juice?"

"The Golden Trio? Sounds like a band of superheroes!"

"God, that Harry Potter is so handsome, I wouldn't even mind if he wasn't rich!" Brief pause "But he is, so it's okay."
