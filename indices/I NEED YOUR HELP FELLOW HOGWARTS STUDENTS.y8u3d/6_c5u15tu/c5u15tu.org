Morgan & Gavin Nisse.

Twins in Fred & George's year (their birthday was the day of the apparition test, Gavin passed first time, Morgan splinched her left arm)

Their father is a squib who works in the Muggle PM's office and Mother is a Witch who works at the MoM, they were brought up in a 'half and half' environment and can blend in equally well with the wizarding community or as Muggles.

Morgan excels at potions and non-verbal spells. Her favourite Professor is Snape. She's a Slytherin. She wants to be a healer.

Gavin is a Ravenclaw. His favourite teacher is Professor Flitwick and he does well at charms and wants to make Quidditch brooms when he leaves Hogwarts.

The twins get on ok - but aren't particulalry close.

If they had still been at Hogwarts during the battle - Gavin would have stayed... Morgan would have tried to make him leave - Gavin hopes she would have been the Slytherin who stayed, but isn't sure.
