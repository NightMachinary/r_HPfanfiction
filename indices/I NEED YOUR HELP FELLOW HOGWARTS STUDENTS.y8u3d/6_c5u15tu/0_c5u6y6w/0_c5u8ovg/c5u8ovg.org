Not a problem - it'll be nice for them to get out of my head for a while!! Gavin really does have faith that Morgan is a good person - but sometimes, just sometimes, she lets him down. On other occaisions, she lives up to his faith - but mainly because deep down, she loves him really (he is her brother after all), although she's often too embarrassed to admit it!
