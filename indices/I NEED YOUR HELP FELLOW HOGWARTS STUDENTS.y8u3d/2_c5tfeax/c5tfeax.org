Hi, my name is Sarah Kettleburn. I'm in Ginny's year, but I was sorted into Hufflepuff. My birthday is on May 20th.

My mum breeds Kneazles and Crups and my dad works at the Ministry of Magic, at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. My granddad is Silvanus Kettleburn; he used to teach Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts before retiring in 1993.

My pet is a gorgeous grey-white speckled Kneazle. Her name is Victoria. She loves to follow me around the castle and helps the house elves keep the mice population under control.

I have a few favourite subjects: Of course I love Care of Magical Creatures, although I'm not a big fan of the way Hagrid teaches it. I'm also pretty good at Herbology, and I'm reserve keeper for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team.
