Not sure if you still need it but-

Robin Tallo is a 14 year old girl in Slytherin. She's a pureblood and her mother is Japanese while her father was white and English (however he died when she was five years old while working at an Gringotts in America). As a result she knows both Japanese and English and visits her family members living in Japan every summer. Her mother works in the Ministry of Magic as a member Magical Law Enforcement Squad, dealing with day to day offenses. She's an only child born on June 11th.

Her favorite subject at school is Transfiguration, even if rest of her house dislikes McGonagall. Her worst subject is definitely Herbology. She's not that keen on Quidditch and will occasionally borrow one of Hogwart's broomsticks for a ride by herself but prefers to spend time alone reading in the school library, especially the Restricted Section.

She's very friendly by nature, even if she is a bit awkward and loves to spend time with her friends in the common room when she's not studying. However, she can also be very cold to someone if she doesn't like a person. She generally thinks before she acts or speaks but sometimes her temper gets the best of her and she does something that she later regrets.

She's an average height for her age, about 5'3 and has slightly slanted brown eyes that she inherited from her mother. Her black hair is a mass of curls (that she got from her dad) which frame her slightly tan face that she gets from lying out in the sun, reading.
