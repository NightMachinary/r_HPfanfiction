Michele Montenegro. She's in Ravenclaw. Her birthday is February 9. Her family moved to England from Italy in the 1970s and she's the first kid to attend Hogwarts. She's a Metamorphagus and her favorite subject (besides Transfiguration, obviously) is DADA. She wanted to try out for Quidditch but her dad thought it would interfere with her studies. She has a wicked competitive streak that takes Gobstones to a whole new level.
