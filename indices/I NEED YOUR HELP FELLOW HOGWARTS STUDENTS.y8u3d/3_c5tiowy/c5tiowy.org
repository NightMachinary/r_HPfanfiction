A couple that I've created but never likely to actually use in my own fics beyond background characters, so feel free to do as you please with them.

*Maxine Davis*, Slytherin, born 6th of May, pureblood. I'd planned to write her post-books so you can stick her in any year that suits your fic. Average student, decent grades, mousy brain hair, brown eyes, 5'6". Excellent flyer but terrible at Quidditch (can't hit/throw/catch a ball to save her life). It doesn't stop her trying out for the house team every. single. year.

*Bonnie Cadwyn Carew*, Ravenclaw, born 14th of November 1983 (puts her three years below Harry & Co.), half-blood. 5'3", average weight, pale skin, ginger-brown hair, green eyes. Father (Welsh) is a muggle, mother (English) died in '87 from illness. She has a non-magical sister, Valerie, who's five years older than her and extremely jealous and angry about Bonnie being magic when she isn't. Bonnie is a loner with no friends for the first couple of years, but from about third year she starts helping the younger kids with homework and eventually gets a reputation as the go-to girl for tutoring, which she starts charging for to earn some extra money. She has a long-held grudge against Dennis Creevey after he messed up a second-year potion that resulted in turning Bonnie's skin fluorescent orange. She excels at Charms and Ancient Runes, and plans to become a private tutor after finishing her education, whilst also experimenting with Charms and studying ancient languages in her spare time. She dies at the age of 120 without marrying or having any children of her own, but capable of remembering the name of every child she had taught in the last century.

OWL Grades: Ancient Runes - O; Arithmancy - E; Astronomy - A; Charms - O; Defence Against the Dark Arts - E; Herbology - O; History of Magic - A; Potions - O; Transfiguration - E

NEWT Grades: Ancient Runes - O; Charms - O; Defence Against the Dark Arts - E; Herbology - E; Potions - E

Sorry if I got a bit carried away; I created this character years ago and have never had an opportunity to use her. I've planned out her whole life but she's not the kind of character that's interesting enough to centre a whole story around. Anyway, good luck with your fic!
