  Nothing worse than a Dumbledore who is suddenly confronted with an incredibly powerful Harry Potter and doesn't react to it

Harry (or others) could always come clean with Dumbledore. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), shows that working together with him made things a lot easier.

I now absolutely hate 'Maintaining the Time Line' fics. There was zero need to rehash the Graveyard Resurrection Scheme, since time travelers knew Voldemort was hiding in Little Hangleton prior to that and he was weak in his homunculus form!
