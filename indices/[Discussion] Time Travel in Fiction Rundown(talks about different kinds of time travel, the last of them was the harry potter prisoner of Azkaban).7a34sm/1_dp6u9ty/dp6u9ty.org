Most fanfiction definitely goes with the Do-Over timetravel, simply because its such a enormously effective tool to write fix-fics. The second most used is probably the Back to the Future type of timetravel.

Funnily enough, one of the least used timetravel methods in the Harry Potter fanfiction is the actual timetravel introduced in Harry Potter. Hell, not even the franchise itself stays true to it /cough/ Cursed Child /cough/.

I'm not sure if I agree with him that HP's timetravel is my favorite. I'm more a fan of the Do-Over timetravel. I'm just not a fan of the "fix everything" approach with a horribly overpowered character. I like fics that actually think through the consequences of the character's actions and how they influence other characters. Nothing worse than a Dumbledore who is suddenly confronted with an incredibly powerful Harry Potter and doesn't react to it.
