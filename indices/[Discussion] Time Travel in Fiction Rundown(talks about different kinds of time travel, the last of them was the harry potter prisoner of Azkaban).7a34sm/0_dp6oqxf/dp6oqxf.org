So what do you think most fanfiction belong? Do-over fanfiction seems popular, but it seems when time travel makes it AU, then we have a different universe.

This fanfic is interesting because Harry and Hermione change the past and it changes the future . What other time travel fanfic do you recommend for which type of time travel?
