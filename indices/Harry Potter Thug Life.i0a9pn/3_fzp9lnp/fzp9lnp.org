Sorry (OK, not too sorry) about making it Hermione-centric, but Hermione should be a daughter of a mob boss.

--------------

"House of Minions, here I come," Hermione thought to herself as she sat down on the small chair. All that was left was to think the right thoughts at the right time.

/Think: herbology, make friends, community, acceptance, love people just the way they are. Visualise: sunny meadows, smiling faces, friends, birthday party, doing homework in a group. Think: herbology, make friends, community, acceptance, love people just the way they.../

The hat came down on her bushy-haired head.

"Nice try, young lady, but you are a thousand years too young to deceive me. You may want to look up 'Occlumency', by the way. It'll help you where you're going..."

"Wait!"

"Why wait? It's the easiest Sorting in years."

"You want to send me to Slytherin, don't you?"

"You don't agree?"

Hermione thought quickly. "Look, both you and I know where I come from. You also know I'm a Muggleborn. For me to go to Slytherin is the /bravest/ thing I could possibly do!"

There was a long silence. Hermione wondered if the Sorting Hat couldn't handle contradictions, like a sci-fi robot.

"Just put me in Ravenclaw and be done with it. You know I'm smart enough," she offered.

"You know, I don't only sort based on what people want. I also sort based on what people need. Maybe you'll pick up some courage and decency after seven years in GRYFFINDOR!"

"Honestly, Harry, if you want to rise through the ranks, you've got to understand that rules are there for a reason. People who violate rules and procedures end up in imprisoned or killed---or, worse, tortured to death."

"Draco, Draco, haven't you heard that snitches get stitches?" She nodded to Ron, who delivered another kick to the tied-up Slytherin's stomach. "Was it worth the hundred and fifty House Points, Draco?"

Draco somehow found the strength to look up at her. "Granger, when my father... Ah!" He reeled as Hermione shot a carefully measured stinging hex at his eye.

"Still planning to tattle, Draco? Sounds like someone didn't learn his lesson." She crouched next to him to grasp his chin with her free hand. "Did you know that with the dose of the Forgetfulness Potion that you have in you right now, you won't remember our faces or this conversation---it'll all be a blur---but you'll remember the pain and the fear? Oh yes, you will... Magic really is amazing, isn't it, Draco? Sometimes, I wonder if it's wasted on Purebloods."

Draco whimpered.
