Didn't really mean anything by it, friend. I can only tell you that, while I never "put on a mask", I definitely didn't go out of my way to announce my family's financial status to the masses. It leaves a mark on you, like it or not, and as I have imagined my McGonagall growing up in a poor, rough neighborhood, I can't help but think that she would carry a mark of her own.
