Having also come from a poor background myself, going to a private school on a bursary and being Glaswegian, I can tell you I have never felt the necessity of a mask to the extent you describe. Now, i didnt grow up in the rough areas, but i know people who did. Acting stern and posh will only alienate you, nobody will take you seriously. acting like where you come from is beneath you is going to cause problems.
