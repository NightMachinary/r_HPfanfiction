I think there's a few different types and tolerances people have for it.

There's giving an OC sibling / offspring to a major character we canonically know didn't have any. Like giving Harry a sibling or Sirius a daughter who is friends with the trio. Usually these have that "what if Sirius had a daughter..." premise where they re-write the story to fit around the OC. People enjoy that stuff and it can be written well, although others might dismiss it as Mary Sue or Self-Insert fantasy. Some of it do it well and the OC fits in well with the universe. Others, not so well. I read one story (and this was well before the Pottermore stuff on Remus came out) that gave him an older brother and it worked well because the brother had feelings of resentment towards Remus over causing their family so much stress growing up and how they always had to move around to protect him. But they managed to overcome it and become closer as the story progressed.

Then there's giving siblings / offspring to characters who we know little about their home life. For all we know, Kingsley Shacklebolt might have had a wife and kids that's not mentioned in the books or Hannah Abbott might have had a brother in another year.

I write a lot of stories with minor characters so I do the latter quite frequently. It doesn't make sense that everyone in Harry's year is an only child so I'll give characters like Hannah Abbott or Terry Boot siblings. I write next-gen so it's pretty acceptable to give canon characters offspring there. I've done Harry-has-a-sister too and most people who read it are reading it because they enjoy the trope although I get the occasional nasty anon who just writes "MARY SUE" with nothing else. Considering I've put a lot of effort into my character and making sure she's realistic I would have liked to known why they felt that why. So I just dismiss them as one of those people who think all female OCs related to canon characters are Mary Sues.

As for siblings/offspring born in the story, I'm sure it can work. Teddy Lupin was born in the course of the HP stories. I imagine the pregnancy would be a plot point or there would be some reasoning behind it. Otherwise, it's just random to suddenly have, say, Narcissa get pregnant and have another child, but the pregnancy and child have no effect on the story.
