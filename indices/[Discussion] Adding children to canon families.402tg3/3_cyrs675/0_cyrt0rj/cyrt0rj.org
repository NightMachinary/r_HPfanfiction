Oh, I /hate/ that kind of 'review'! 'MARY SUE' and nothing else doesn't help you improve, since there is no actual criticism attached. Not that that kind of person is at all concerned with helping - just whatever jollies they get from feeling superior, I guess. And they probably have no idea what they're talking about, since being a female OC does not automatically equal Mary Sue.

That's an excellent point - I actually did read a fic once (non-HP) where there was the MC, the MC's Love Interest, the Sidekick, and the Antagonist, all doing the Plot, right? Well, about halfway through the story, Love Interest got pregnant, and /immediately/ the Plot ceased to exist. Even the Antagonist completely forgot that he hates these people and started helping out with baby preparations.... I had to wonder if the fic got abandoned and then picked up by someone else, it was /that/ jarring. Definitely an example for me to keep in mind to avoid!
