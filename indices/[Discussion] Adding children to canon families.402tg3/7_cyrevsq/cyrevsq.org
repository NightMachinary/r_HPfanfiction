Only do this if it is INTEGRAL to the story. Do NOT add new siblings (older, younger or babies) unless there is a specific reason to do so. Even then, that person had better be super important to the story, and then you'll probably get accused of making a Mary Sue or direct Self-Insert.

If it is a mostly unknown character like Slyth or Puff then you have a chance, but a main character who's story we already know?... just no...

btw I despise the "wrong boy who lived" fics where Harry has a sibling... The only time I see Harry having siblings work is when he travels to an AU, or its an AU where James and Lily lived. Even Hermione doesn't need siblings (but it might work only because her family is completely off screen for most of the series, but why didn't they get mentioned when her parents were sent to Australia?)
