All very good points, especially about nothing being 'always.' :) There are 'usually's, though, like usually stories where Harry wrongfully goes to Azkaban are not very good. Out of curiosity, since we seem to be the only two talking about this right now, have you ever read a story with an OC sibling you liked (the story, not just the character)? I can't think of one I liked, and I've been wracking my brain.
