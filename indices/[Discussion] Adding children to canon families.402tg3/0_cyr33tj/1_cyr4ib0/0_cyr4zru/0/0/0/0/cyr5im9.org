HAHA... yeah... I wrote it as a joke at first.

I was in a brainstorming thread on spacebattles and asked if anyone had ever read a story where one of the many precognitive bad guys did what you'd expect them to and got ahold of an SI early.

No said they had, so I started writing an outline of what I thought it'd look like... and then I kept having ideas and the outline became a few chapters... and then... and then... ~180K words later I'm almost to thanksgiving of season 3.
