Well... my SI main character I was talking about in my "I'm a new writer" story has long since stopped being me and developed attachments to other characters. I'm rather fond of twisted logic involved in the fact that he legit considers Faith Lehane his sister because Drusilla made them both the way they are (Vampire in his case, and Slayer in hers.)

In a similar vein, there's a story out there somewhere that has Tom Riddle get loose from the diary a few years early and kidnaps Harry to study him and winds up adopting an older brother role in Harry's life... but I can't recall anything else other than liking the story and it ending unfinished far too early.

Aside from those... I actually never got into the Wrong BWL or etc genre and can't really recall reading any stories where there was an extra sibling that was... relevant.
