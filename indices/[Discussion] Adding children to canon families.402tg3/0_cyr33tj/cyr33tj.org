To respond in general:

Nothing is *always* anything in fanfiction.

But having a character be related to X might not be /necessary/ in your specific story (I don't know which story or character we're referring to.)

It also depends on the context. A story who's opening premise is something akin to: "what would happen if so and so had a sibling?" obviously needs that additional character to exist.

Whether that story will then be any good depends on the author's ability to make it work but that's a separate issue.

It's like... SI's. Stories with SI's are usually bad. But that's not because an SI exists in the story, it's just a bad story for the same reasons any other story would be bad and happens to contain an SI. I suspect the number of extant SI fics that are bad is a side effect of the reason I'm writing an SI story- It's easier for a new writer, so you get a lot of goofy first timer mistakes, rather than anything inherent in the genre. SI's, after all, are just pre-cogs with bizarre attachments to random people.
