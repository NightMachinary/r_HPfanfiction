Oh, I see. I understand why SI's are usually bad, too, then, keeping many fanfic writers in mind.

But I find it fascinating, the way writers imprint themselves into the story. Some try not to do it at all, and come up with stories that have nothing to do with them at all, and then there are writers who use their own self-image when creating characters and have their book filled with different versions of themself. I've never read any papers or books about the way writers affect stories and vice versa, as in: what came first: the writer or the story? But I'd love to read about it.
