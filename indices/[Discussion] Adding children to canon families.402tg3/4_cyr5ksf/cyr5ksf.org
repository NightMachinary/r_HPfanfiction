Hmm ... well, my viewpoint of it is that for as long as it's done well, “sure, why not”.

Because really, any character like that is basically an OC, no different than any other OC really, and what matters is that the character is interesting and not pointless and the story is actually well written.

I do remember reading a fairly good story centred around Draco and an OC who was basically his squib younger sister, hidden by the family from the world. And there is also a story (“Biting the Hand That Feeds You”, by Andrew Joshua Talon) in which most Death Eaters have squib children that they “disposed of”, and it results in something utterly hilarious (the story is generally made of crack, to be honest, highlights including “the Godfather”, “the Loremaster”, and “businessman Draco”).
