Yeah, I don't think it's really necessary, either. It might make for an interesting subplot, but like I said, I don't think I have the skill to do it right anyway.

I don't know about them being 'healed' or not, because they just...never talked about it again, and they've had separate bedrooms ever since. I can see where that might not be considered healthy, but I also don't think that succeeding in having another baby would magically fix everything, either, you know? All the old issues would still be there, and the strain of a new pregnancy would probably just make things worse, and since there don't seem to be any therapists in the wizarding world....

I guess that's part of why I even considered it - it would make for great drama, if handled correctly.
