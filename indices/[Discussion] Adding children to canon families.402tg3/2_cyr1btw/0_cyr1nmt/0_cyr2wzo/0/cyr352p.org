Ah, I see. No, actually I gave a canon couple a miscarriage in their backstory, after which they stopped trying to have more children, leaving only canon offspring. There were other things in the review, but that particular part of the review suggested that I have them have another child in-story, presumably as a means of healing, although they didn't specify why they thought it would be a good idea. I doubt I have the skill to pull that off well, but it made me curious about the general attitudes toward that kind of thing.
