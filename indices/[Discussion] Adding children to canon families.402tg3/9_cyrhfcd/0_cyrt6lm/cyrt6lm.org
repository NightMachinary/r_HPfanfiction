Ah, I see. I pretty much exclusively write (and read) AUs, because for me, that's the fun of fanfic. For canon, I just re-read the books, because they're beautiful as they are (with the exception of the epilogue, which accounts for my usually reading AUs even when they're set post-canon). I just love 'what if' scenarios, so you wouldn't have clicked on my story in the first place. To each their own. :) Thank you for your opinion, it's good to see all the sides!
