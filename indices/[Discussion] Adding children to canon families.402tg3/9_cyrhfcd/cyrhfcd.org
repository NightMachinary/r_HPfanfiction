I mean, to me, as soon as you add a non-canon sibling, your story is AU. Harry does not have a sibling in canon. If you give him one, we have entered an alternate universe. Which isn't good or bad on its own, just a reality. So then it comes down to what you prefer to read. Me, I don't like AUs. I have only the smallest passing interest in them. For me, it doesn't matter how well written it may be, if it strays outside of canon, I'm probably going to hit the back button because I'm much more interested in seeing how people write inside the world we've been given. That's just my personal preference as a reader, though. I'm sure it is possible to do it well, but what I've seen of these AUs, it does usually feel tacked on, or self-insert.
