Meh, canon is broken constantly, be it subtly or massively. If it benefits the story, then I see nothing wrong with it, that includes creating more siblings or other family members.

I read one fic in which Harry had a little sister, and they grew up together at the Dursleys. I remember I didn't really like the direction in which the story was headed, but I really like Harry as a big brother. His protective tendencies are heartwarming to read when done right. And that story also had them teaming up to do sneaky shit and get Harry to Hogwarts, and they had a catchprase like "We're Potters, and we ..." can't remember. Maybe one of you could tell me which fic I'm talking about: it was a Harry/Ginny pairing fic, if I recall correctly, the little sister was called Emma and she was a metamorphmagus.

Anyway, to answer your question: I don't mind. It could spice up the plot if done right.
