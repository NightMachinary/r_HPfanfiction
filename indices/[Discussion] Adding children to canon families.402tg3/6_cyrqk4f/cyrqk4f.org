I feel like if nothing states that a canon child is an only child, then it should be fine to add children to them. Usually when I thought of it, I wouldn't give a canon child offspring unless they were really minor and Harry didn't know. For all we know, someone more minor like Madame Malkin could have a sibling or even an offsping we don't know about.

I wouldn't do stuff like give Harry a non-canon sibling since that would be too AU for my liking, however some characters can be given OC siblings and not contradict book canon at all due to the way its done. Characters like Madame Malkin might have a son/daughter that Harry just never met in canon. Even with some more relevant characters, who is to say Fudge or Scrimgeour never had siblings/offspring? Theoretically, nothing denies that it happened and could have reasonably happened at some point.

The only time I make characters related to canon characters is if the canon character wasn't that important, if I'm writing a sorting scene of a non-Harry generation so I just need a few OCs related to a canon character. Even if its just being in the same family as some wizard from a chocolate frog card not even from the books, but only if the OCs are really minor to the point of apathy. I just go to wikia, go the the frog cards, pick a person, then use their surname even if the OCs are just minor characters (its more about laziness for me in THAT case). Then I'd just make up like 30 other names unrelated to cannon. For example in one of my ideas, I made one of the OCs being sorted be from the Lestrange family. Now nothing says that Rabastan and Rodolphus never had another brother/sister, so I made the OC's father be an OC brother to Rodolphus/Rabastan. If I didn't make that distinction, readers might assume the OC was the child of either Rodolphus or Rabastan (which since the OC was born in 1987 would literally be impossible since those two would be in Azkaban) whereas I added a third brother to avert that.

My personal advice: if you are going to make an OC be the child/sibling/niece/nephew/descendant of a canon character, just have a way to explain it which doesn't wreck canon. As long as the OC doesn't make the canon character act too OOC (unless its an AU in which case it would be somewhat expected) then its fine. Someone like Bellatrix isn't going to have a kid born between 1982-1994 because she's in Azkaban and never had kids in canon according to HBP. Someone more minor like Madame Malkins or Madame Rosmerta, or one of the people in Harry's year we didn't really meet like Sally-Anne Perks? They could have had family that we never knew about because Harry didn't know. Someone like Dolohov? Maybe he had a son/daughter before he got arrested.
