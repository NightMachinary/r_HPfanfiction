I tried to read They Shook Hands, and I remember Draco's older brother being the first turn-off for me. I agree, he's very unnecessary, and I felt like he messed with an otherwise interesting dynamic, although that wasn't what ultimately made me quit the series. I have never read the Innocent series, although I've seen it recced before.

That's very true - James and Lily always struck me as the kind who would have wanted at least two kids, if not three or four.

I didn't give anyone a sibling or offspring, but apparently some people really want Draco to have a sibling? The review suggested giving Lucius & Narcissa a second child (makes some sense in context). It was a very intelligent, very well thought out review that asked several excellent questions, so it seemed wise to at least mull the idea over.
