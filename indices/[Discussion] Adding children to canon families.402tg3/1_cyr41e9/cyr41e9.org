In the Innocent series by Marauderlover7, Draco has an older brother whose presence drastically alters Draco's personality and upbringing. I don't think Draco's (extremely well written!) plot would be able to unfold the way it does without having a brother.

To contrast, Draco also has an older brother in the They Shook Hands series who feels extremely unnecessary. Having him there doesn't really damage the fic though, it's just odd.

As to the second half of your question, I think it depends on the fic. I've seen several stories where Lily and James live and go on to have more children after Harry. It makes sense in the course of the story because if they hadn't died, why wouldn't they have gone on to have more kids?

Out of curiosity, to whom did you give a sibling or offspring?
