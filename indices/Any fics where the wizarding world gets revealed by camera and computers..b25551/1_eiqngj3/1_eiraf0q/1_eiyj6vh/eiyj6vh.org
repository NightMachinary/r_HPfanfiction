Just got through most of it. Wow it's a doozy.

The main problem with the fic is (particularly early on) the author likes to do 'artifact' chapters. Such as 'here is the text of the news article' or 'here is a report to hq'. They work fine from time to time in stories, but this one overdoes it. A lot of them could have simply been a paragraph or two.

Doesn't really fit the feel of what this thread is asking, IMO. I mean it meets the letter of the request, but wizards go "yep, revealing is inevitable" and come out willingly.

On that note, the fic seems to do a large bit of author appeal for a deference to authority. I found the religious plotline a bit unbelievable in a world headed for nuclear war. And then the loyalty oath thing. Or even how the death eaters are competent enough to transform themselves into an international terrorist organization.

Plus I have never really been a fan of 'real people as chatacters' too much vHgage.
