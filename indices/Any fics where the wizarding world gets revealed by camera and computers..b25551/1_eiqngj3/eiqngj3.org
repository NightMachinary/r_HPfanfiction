[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7258617/1/][Escalation]] features dumbledore vs a computer.

The MLP crossover fanfiction Magic School Days (on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490541/1/Magic-School-Days][Fanfiction.net]] and [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/371039/magic-school-days][FIMfiction.net]]) has a subplot about Muggles finding out about Wizards because their chat room logs were not being erased. Super cracky, I stopped reading it when the Dumbledore bashing devolved into other characters bashing his knees in with a baseball bat.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/15463549][Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach]] Harry's flight at the beginning of the fifth movie gets recorded in a SuperBowl commercial. I found it a bit dry though.
