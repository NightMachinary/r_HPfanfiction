I just gave [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406279/if-wishes-were-ponies][/If Wishes were Ponies/]] a try, but am giving up on it after reading 55 chapters. I don't recommend it.

After chapter 30 or so, the story devolved into nothing but Harry and the Cutie Mark Crusaders talking nonchalantly about doing crazy things and everyone being really impressed at them. Then they get superpower-like transformations without having to work for them, and they cast various spells imported from Equestria that impress everyone because they are so much better than wizard's spells.

It starts feeling unreal because every non-main character always acts like everything the main characters do is a brand new work of genius. With the number of times the main characters showed off, I would expect that at least once, the wizards would be able to be unimpressed at what they did, saying “oh, we know some magic to do that too, we just don't do it [because it's illegal in this country / because of the side effects / because it harms our culture]”. The author dumbs down all other characters and societies just to make the main characters look better.

In between the chapters about Harry, there were indeed some interesting chapters that explored how the Equestrians go about revealing themselves to the British government, starting with chapters 37--44. Though that storyline started off as decent sci-fi, it was eventually infected with the same problem, showing nothing but British government officials being amazed at the skills of the aliens.
