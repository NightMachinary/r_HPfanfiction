There's also "If Wishes Were Ponies" on fimfiction. [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406279/102/if-wishes-were-ponies/]]. I skipped to chapter 13 because I'm not deeply familiar with MLP but there is a lot of world building, politics, etc. Right now the world leaders and important government officials are aware of magic, and have told everyone else (Civilians) that they have met "aliens" so anything magical is passed off as alien technology to keep the SOS. There's a lot of politics and deeper worldbuilding. Updates Mondays and Thursdays around 2-4 pm EST.
