I mean, considering how there is one wizard for approximately 10000 muggles, any photo/video captures on accidental magic sightings like say, sudden apparition are counted off as freak accidents or worse video edits/troll posts. Again considering the ratio, it's not like one village without electricity would be glaringly striking on a satellite map. So unless there are some extremely curious detectives who purposesly wanted to reveal wizarding world, the statue of secrecy would be pretty safe.

I mean, think of the numbers. The world population is like around 7.5 billion. Wizard population would roughly be 750000 if we go by same ratio. It's like population of /one small city/ scattered across the /entire/ globe. The difference is quite unnoticeable. Heck, even the population of London itself is roughly 10 times higher than the entire wizarding world population
