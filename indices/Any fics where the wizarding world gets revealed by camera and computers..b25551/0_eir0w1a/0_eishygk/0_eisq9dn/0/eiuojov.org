I sure hope no more Grindlewalds crop up, and drop massive magical banners from the sky with moving pictures in fabric that cover entire biuldings and fade away after a while; or no dragons or obscurials go on rampages in cities; or no death cults go on killing sprees; or no giant fiendfire constructs get barely contained...

That'd be â€˜Bad', in a world where everyone has an Iphone in their pocket that can stream live video or instant messaging to the anyone, cloud save images to other devices as soon as they're taken, and keep a detailed record of exactly how much time you spend and where you're spending it and what you're doing...

Who said anything about it being accidental magic that gave it away? It just takes one determined wizard armed with transfiguration and charms in a major city in the year 2020.
