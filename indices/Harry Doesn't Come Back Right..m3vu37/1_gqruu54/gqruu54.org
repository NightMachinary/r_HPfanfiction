The deathly hallows when combined open a gateway past death, to the great eons beyond the edge of existence. Something beyond death, beyond time comes through, hence the title master of death- and settles into Harry's body. By infinitely incalculable coincidence, because of prophecy, who killed him, what killed him, and how he died, voldemort is the one that has his soul consumed and because of death being timless, the elder being merges with Harry the first time he died, at Godrics hollow. In a convoluted time paradox this is what causes voldemorts killing curse to rebound, and is the power he knows not, rewriting history to have been so since the beginning, even though it had not happened yet.

Harry grows up as the mortal soul and mind inhabiting the shell of a manifest elder god. He is immortal, can perceive up to eleven dimensions, drive people insane with a whisper, shred thier mind like tissue, and unfold himself into a non euclidian form made of tentacles, teeth, eyes, and things best left unsaid. The funny thing is he doesn't know it, neither does anyone else. So he grows up slowly realizing something is apocalyptically wrong with him, a freak on a super paranormal level as he figures out these abilities, accidentally picks up or starts a cult, learns even dark creatures fear or are in awe of him and winds up in situations where they help him, follow his orders, and treat him like a lord but can't exactly explain why, assassination attempts by various religious groups, and convenient yet convoluted accidents that are usually terrifying and mind scaring happening to people that inevitably get in his way. The church hates him, dementors want to be him, he's a myth in occult circles, a legend in others.

I leave a writer to decide what elder god he now has the body of, Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Hastur, etc... Going for a supernatural horror but dark comedy vibe.
