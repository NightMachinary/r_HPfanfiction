#+begin_quote
  Cordelia is the Master of Death and has been for quite some time. The only problem is that she doesn't particularly enjoy being an Eldritch Abomination. What's a girl to do when you have no interest in the role forced upon you? Run like hell perhaps. And hope to Merlin and God and all else that's holy that maybe, just maybe, one day you might get lucky...and find a way out.
