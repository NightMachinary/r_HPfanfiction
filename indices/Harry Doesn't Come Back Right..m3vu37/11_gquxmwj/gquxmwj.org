When I read the title, idk i just thought more like his morals got skewed because if he can come back anyone could! right? I just imagining like, a Soulless!Sam Winchester type of thing.

Also, the example you're thinking of his great, and i think there's so many possibilities with it! Like, would rigor mortis still settle in? or would his heart continue to just, not pump?

But a prompt i really like is that, he's come back once, yet there's something off about him. No one can really say what it is, yet people feel his stares boring holes into the back of their heads and those people, who may or may not have done something heinous in the war, feel a brush with something cold and sinister.

Another thing they've figured out is that he's apparently immune to the killing curse, having found that particular fact after a nasty skirmish with remaining sympathizers to the Dark Lord.

He's put on the front lines of the Aurors, whether he wants to or not, and these disputes start gradually happening more. After about five Avada's, his friends have noticed something weird about Harry, yet they still can't pinpoint the exact thing, and it's gotten more frequent.

Ginny first noticed it after he put on a smile for George on the first year anniversary of Fred's death. But that smile, it was too wide, and his cheeks shouldn't be able to stretch that wide. She knew it was a fake one, but it was too wide, showing too many teeth.

She informed the others about it, and isn't surprised when Hermione comes forward and admits she started to get suspicious couple of months ago but didn't want to voice it in case she was wrong.

Harry chooses that moment to walk into the room smile still too wide. And Hermione knows Harry's hearing is perfectly good, and if he were anywhere close to the room, he would have heard their (rather loud) conversation-as they hadn't figured to put up a privacy charm-yet he just stands there, not having moved from his spot. After what seems like an eternity, Harry drops the smile and beckons them to come and rejoin the festivities. They comply, and he turns around and walks away, and Ginny, Hermione, and Ron steal glances at each other, because it would be impossible to miss the way the skin under is eyes didn't flatten out, and still stayed bunched up, as if he were still smiling.
