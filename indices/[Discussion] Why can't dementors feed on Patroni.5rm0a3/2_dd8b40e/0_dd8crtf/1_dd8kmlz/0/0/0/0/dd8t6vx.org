To be fair, the books do describe the patroni as both capable of attacking the dementors physically and willing to do it. Harry's first corporeal patronus, the one during the lake episode in Prisoner of Azkaban, was described as chasing the dementors and (more or less) trying to gore them. While I'm sure such a thing is not something that would kill them, it's probably unpleasant enough for them that they do not want to get close to patroni for what's really no gain.
