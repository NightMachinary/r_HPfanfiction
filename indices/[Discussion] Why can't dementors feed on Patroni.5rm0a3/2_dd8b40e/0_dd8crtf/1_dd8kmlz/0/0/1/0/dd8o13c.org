So you still don't get what I meant, then.

Something that the stuff I wrote relies on is dementors needing to actually siphon good memories to be able to sate themselves with them. As such, just being in the presence of something made of good memories wouldn't help them get sated. A patronus is either something that is made using good memories but not made of them, in which case there would be no memories for the dementors to feed on, or it is something made of good memories in which case siphoning those would harm it and it is canon that dementors cannot harm a patronus; both possibilities have it impossible for the dementors to siphon good memories out of a patronus, which means that if any of those is true the dementors could try to feed on it but wouldn't be able to get anything out of doing that.
