But Dementors don't feed on memories. They feed on hope, happiness and the will to survive. They hurt humans because with positive emotions gone we're left with negative ones. They can't hurt Patronuses because Patronuses cannot feel despair, not (to our knowledge) because they can't siphon positive emotions from them.

Like I said with vampires, vampires can hurt their victims because blood loss affects humans. Vampires cannot hurt a cup of blood because it's a cup, but that doesn't mean they can't drink out of the cup and be satisfied.
