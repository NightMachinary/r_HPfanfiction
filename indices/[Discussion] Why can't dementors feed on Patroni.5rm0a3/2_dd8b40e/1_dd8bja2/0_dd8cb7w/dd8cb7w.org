I personally like to think that they passively suck the happy memories, feed on them, and cause everyone around them to relive their worst; but the Patronus has no... nutritional value? Basically, they can't eat it, so they flee from it.

Imagine if someone was about to force feed you with melted plastic or, let's say, coal. I'd nope out and run, wouldn't you?
