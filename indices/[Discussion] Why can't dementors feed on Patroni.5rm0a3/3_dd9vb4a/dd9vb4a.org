I honestly don't think Dementor actually need any kind of "food" , or any kind of susteinance.

They are magical creatures ,or better yet natural magical constructs since they are not actually alive.

Canonically their quantity is proportional to the ammount of despair in the general population, it stands to reason that they cause despair because they are basically the physical manifestation of a meme (in the scientific sense).

Patroni repel them because since their existence is dependent on despair and patroni are concentated anti-despair if dementors stay too close they may disappear.

These are my hypothesies.
