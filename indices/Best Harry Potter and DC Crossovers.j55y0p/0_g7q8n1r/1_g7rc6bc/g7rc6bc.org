For the second one, I think a big part is the power differential between magic users in DC vs Harry Potter, and how prevalent magic is in DC. You have roughly 100 gods or god-like magic users that are active participants in DC. There are over 100 million Atlanteans almost all of whom are capable of using some sorcery, and the number of fully qualified ones is higher than most estimates of the wizarding world population. Then you have the Homo Magi, who should be at least as numerous as wizards, and who max out at theoretically able to destroy the Earth. The existence of Homo Magi, and magic in general, is also publicly known. Pre-52 there was even another subrace that only had illusion magic, and you could learn magic by brute force even if you didn't have any inborn capability.

Then there's demons, angels, loaners, djinn...

And a typical witch/wizard is basically helpless when you take their wand away. Unlike the vast majority of the DC types.

If you're going to have them stick around in a noticeably heroic fashion, then it might not seem all that believable without giving Harry or whoever a powerup. Giving them a family connection has the added advantage of making them easier to integrate.
