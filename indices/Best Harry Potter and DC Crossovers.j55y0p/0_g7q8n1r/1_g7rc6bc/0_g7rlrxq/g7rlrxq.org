The things you mention are exactly what makes it an interesting crossover, in my view.

With a lot of crossovers there's often perceived to be a massive power differential in favour of Harry Potter. I think having the Harry Potter character be the underdog in the pure power stakes is a nice change of pace from settings like a song of ice and fire which frequently involve either boring curb-stomps or inexplicable de-powering.

Not only that, but so what if the Harry Potter characters in the crossover are weaker than Doctor Fate, or the Spectre, or Darkseid? Most characters in DC are weaker than those big hitters, that's why the comics they're in feel like they have stakes. DC might be a universe of Gods and Demons of unfathomable power, but it's also home to the likes of Green Arrow, the entire Bat Family (not going to mention Batman himself, as he has plot armour up the wazoo, but Nightwing is an example), and plenty of non-powered baddies. Why does Harry have to be able to mix it up with the big-leagues to make the crossover worth doing?

Finally, having a crippling weakness (the wand) is hardly an unusual thing in DC. Superman's weaknesses are well known, but even Zatanna can be rendered pretty much harmless with a single silencing charm. Pretty much everyone has a weakness that can be exploited by a skilled and prepared wizard. Sure, if Harry got stuck in a cage match with many DC heroes and villains, he'd be in trouble, but a cage match isn't all that interesting as a story.

I don't disagree with you. The things you mention /are/ factors, and I don't doubt they are a dominant reason for the general lack of HP/DC crossovers. I just feel like there's a whole ocean of possibility out there in DC, with so many different heroes and villains, there's an uncountable number of stories that could be told. It seems unfortunate to throw that all away because of the perception that Harry 'needs' to be able to stand up against Superman or Shazam in a toe-to-toe fight for the story to be worth telling.
