That's fair. I'm not saying they need to go heads up against Captain Marvel or be able to teabag Trigon. They do however, need to be able to survive the story without it seeming ridiculous.

If you get noticed for doing heroic/villainous stuff as a magic user, then you start attracting hostile supernatural types. Canon trainee wizard Harry (or basically any other Hogwarts student) doesn't have the magical chops to hang in the kiddie pool, gets rendered completely helpless without a wand, and doesn't exactly have a wealth of useful skills outside of their magic. Hermione as research assistant for some DC magical in a Carnacki type story is workable, but that's going to be a quick trip.

Even /Kicking Gotham/ gave Harry a large skill and experience upgrade from canon due to being a 10 year auror, along with equipment upgrades. And that was to make it through something both low level and beneath the public eye.

Raised by Batman type stories give Harry a lot of skills, and he just happens to have magic. Keeps Hogwarts usable, and gives him DC enemies he can believably handle. They work well, but a lot of people don't feel like it's still Harry in those cases.

Even some of the more popular fanon upgrades from non-crossover stuff, or having them /Bungle in the Jungle/, is probably enough to hit respectable potential sidekick/teen hero level of ability.

Although now I want a BintJ type story where Harry and Bill interact with Congorilla, Jungle Girl, or some other appropriate D listers.
