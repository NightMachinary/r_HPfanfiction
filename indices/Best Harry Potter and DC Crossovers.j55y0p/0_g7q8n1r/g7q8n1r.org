Sadly, in my experience, HP/DC stories fall into one of the following categories:

- Blood Brandy Vegas Challenge. These are usually 1-3 chapters long, and typically only include the lol-so-random drunken awakening scene, plus loads of exposition about how hot the woman/women in question are, and why they're now totally in a binding and inescapable marriage. Strangely, everyone seems to be fine with this.
- Harry is Superman's/Batman's/The Joker's/etc son. These are usually mostly canon-re-treads with large amounts of wizard bashing, intermixed with fluffy family stuff. Harry usually gets given some superpower or other which gets more play than the actual magic.
- Megamatt.

It's gotten to the point where I'm not sure people even think of writing anything that's not one of those when they decide to do something HP/DC.
