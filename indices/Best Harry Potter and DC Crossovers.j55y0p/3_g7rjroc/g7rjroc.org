[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-32735/Datatroll+Four+people+with+horrible+luck+Vegas+WTF.htm][Four people with horrible luck + Vegas = WTF!?]] HP/DC/BtVS crossover. Yes it's a Bloody Brandy, but it actually makes sense. Then turns into an entertaining and well paced story. I have no idea why the rating was set as high as it was though.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Spirit of Revenge)

linkffn(Happily Ever After? by muggledad)

linkffn(Per Volar Su Nata) Abandoned but interesting marriage contract fic.

linkffn(Harry's Raven) I thought the Harry/Raven paring was adorable, even if the story does show the writer's admitted inexperience.
