Absolutely LOVE this one!!!! There are quite a few spelling errors throughout the story, but if you can ignore them then the concept is just BRILLIANT

It's about Post-War Hermione who is healing from the losses of the war and PTSD, being flung back in time to just after the Department of Mysteries fiasco, and forced to essentially relive the entire war again.

What I loved the most about it is that how realistic it feels because Hermione is NOT the same after she goes back. Much as she tries to stick to her timeline, she can't think like she used to because she's a seasoned war hero. Worst part is how she has to see and interact with people she knows die and she can't exactly warn them.
