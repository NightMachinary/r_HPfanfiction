Seconding this one! The first act is very cinematic, the second act is just delightful as we follow along with Teddy's wild ride, and the third act has some fascinating worldbuilding. I fell in love with Teddy immediately, and the background OCs really leap off the page too.

There's a very fun [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15589665/chapters/36194733][“sequel”]] as well that basically just takes the idea of Delphi from Cursed Child (but none of the characterization) and runs with it to create an even more hilariously disastrous AU of Into the Arena in which both Teddy and Delphi were raised by Harry. I haven't read CC and don't intend to, but I love this one too. Highly recommend.

ETA: I'd also add that this author's most popular fic is another excellent time travel story.
