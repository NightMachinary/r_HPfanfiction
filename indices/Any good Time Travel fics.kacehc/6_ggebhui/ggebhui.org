Well you can try the story HP: Dolen Amser by Jonn Wolfe. It's a Harry/Tonks story where via spell interaction Harry ends up going back in time to his first year but the original Harry is still there. So this older Harry is not allowed (swears on his Magic) to change the time line because of dangers of creating a paradox. Of course, that is easier said then done.
