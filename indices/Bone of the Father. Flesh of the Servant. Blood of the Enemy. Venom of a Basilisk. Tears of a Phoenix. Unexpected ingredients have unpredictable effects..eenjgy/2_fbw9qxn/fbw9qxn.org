I remember reading a drabble, probably on DLP, in which Harry dies and Dobby sets out to perform the ritual to bring him back. However, Dobby's interpretation of the instructions is very unorthodox. Also, the whole thing is narrated in House-Elf pidgin. It was glorious, but I haven't been able to find it since.
