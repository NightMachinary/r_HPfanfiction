Peter was shaking like crazy as he prepared the ingredients for the resurrection potion. Sure the final three were later but the majority of it was prep work.

Did that stop Lord shits-his-pants from tossing out torture curses like candy? Of fucking course it didn't, who gives a bleeding shit if the person prepping the most important potion ever can't hold his hand steady?

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The potion was supposed to be a solid and smooth slate grey at this point. Peter figured a somewhat thick and lumpy blueish grey was close enough. He wasn't drinking it after all.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

After tossing in Harry's blood he knew he had forgotten something. Damn Basilisk venom and Phoenix tears in the boy were throwing his potion totally off. Well some mugwort and essence of flobberworm would settle it down for long enough to finish.

Once again, he wasn't drinking the potion so not his problem.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

He had gotten a cut-off-your-hand gag from Zonkos shop earlier. Sure it hadn't technically been flesh willing given but surely it had been close enough.

Nothing a little moonstone powder amd Honeybee pollen wouldn't cover a bit of, sorta.

Seriously he could not care less as he was not drinking this abomination of a potion.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Peter looked at what the fuck ever had come out of the cauldron and figured good enough. Sure he looked like a retarded snake person, the ritual hadn't really gone into detail what the physical looks would be like so that was an easy sell.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Peter stared as the snake faced badtard kept dying and coming back to life over and over. Seriously he was suffocating to death every minute or so only to draw a breath and come back to life.

Maybe binding yourself to a physical container was not his best idea.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Peter enjoyed the warm tropical sun. Sure he had tossed snake face into an abandoned crypt and closed the door. Still the tucker wouldn't stop dying and coming back. It was annoying and he wasn't getting free anytime this century.

So once again, not his problem.
