Sex under a love potion is sex under the influence of an intoxicant that makes it impossible to give meaningful consent while under it. But that doesn't make it necessarily rape every time, regardless of context. A married couple could consensually take love potions keyed to each other in order to enhance their enjoyment of sex, and there'd be no moral problem with that.
