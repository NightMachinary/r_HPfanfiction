I personally think that it's just that children born under love potions don't have happy childhoods due to the whole, y'know, rape aspect of their parents' relationship. I think these kids just grow up with absent/neglectful parents and develop some sort of attachment disorder, a common symptom of which is to “not feel love” (they can, of course, if they get therapy). Attachment disorder is seen in children from orphanages, which is another point towards Tom having it. I was watching a documentary about orphans and my mind burst with all sorts of headcanons, mostly this one lol
