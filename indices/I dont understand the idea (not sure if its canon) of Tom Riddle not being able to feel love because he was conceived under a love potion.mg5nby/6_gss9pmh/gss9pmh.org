I can somewhat reach towards a semi-logical conclusion. Well I say logical, it only checks out if you look at it from this particular angle. Love is more or less evolution's way of making sure humans reproduce, but outside of that is often detrimental to making logical decisions. A magical child conceived under the effects of a love potion /could/ theoretically evolve away from love, if your fanon universe uses genetic magical traits like family magic.

However, that in itself wouldn't really change anything for Voldemort, considering he didn't really go for love in canon anyway. He still has the rest of his emotions. There's a sizable amount of real life people who genuinely can't feel love, and their lives are pretty much normal.
