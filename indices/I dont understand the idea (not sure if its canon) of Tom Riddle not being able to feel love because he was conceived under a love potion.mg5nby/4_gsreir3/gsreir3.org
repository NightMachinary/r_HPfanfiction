I would imagine that Tom Riddle wouldn't be the first or the last child conceived with the help of a love potione. Love potions are nothing new in wizarding world,right?

I think he had a horrible childhood living in constant fear of Nazi bomb and plane attacks in an orphanage in the middle of war stricken England. Being ostracised for being different, bullied and possibly abused as well, until his magic started fighting back. Orphanages are not a good place to live in, especially in that time.

Finally escaping to Hogwarts, but still having to return to the horrible orphanage during summers.

I think he started losing his sanity and becoming paranoid and too sadistic was after his first horcrux and killing his father after being cruelly rejected by him.

After splitting his soul even more,he became obsessed with control,fear and power. Well spoken and charismatic with grand plans Tom , not so dissimilar to young Dumbledore, slowly becoming Voldemort. I commend him for managing to gain such following. It takes a lot of cunning for a poor half-blood orphan to have rich purebloods kneeling at his feet.

I believe love potion might have been a predisposition for his actions, but not an important factor of his path. He was insane. There are many functioning psychopaths or sociopaths in the world l think it is safe to say most of them are not evil dark Lords

He craved power which he did not have as a child. In the end, that same power lust brought his own demise.
