You are correct, but wars don't just happen all of a sudden. There was time of the Great Depression , poverty, crime, disease, lack of food. Not too long after Spanish flu outbreak that killed millions. Both ww1 and ww2 and the time in between were not pleasant times.

When we learn of history, we learn of only major battles and attacks. In reality, it must have been much more dangerous and risky to walk the streets there.

It is all just theory and speculation. It seems a little silly to even discuss a fictional character like that, but it is interesting to connect Tom Riddle with actual facts.
