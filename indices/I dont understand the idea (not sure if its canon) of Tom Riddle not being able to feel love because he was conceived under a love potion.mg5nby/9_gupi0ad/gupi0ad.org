The love potion theory, and the idea that Voldemort absolutely /cannot/ feel love, comes from an interview JK Rowling did: [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript/]]. There are suggestions that what she said was misinterpreted, and what she meant wasn't that the reason he can't love is because he was conceived under a love potion. Rather, she was saying that he grew up without love so he didn't know what it was, which goes more to your second question.

I'm not aware of JKR ever confirming that Tom Riddle was a psychopath. That one is more of a fan theory, as far as I know. I think there are studies that show that children raised in the kind of environment he was presumably raised in, without love and likely without much touch/interaction when he was an infant, are more likely to have mental health issues later in life. In addition, as people have mentioned, the in-breading in his family (which is canon) supports the idea that there might be something genetically abnormal about him. Psychopathy has been thought to come from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and it seems like TMR would have had the "perfect" background to create a psychopath.

In addition, the book does have a conversation between the orphanage matron and Dumbledore where its clear she think there's something wrong with TMR and has tried to get psychiatrists in to diagnose him. I think many people took that along with his subsequent behavior, at least as portrayed through Dumbledore's memories (being very charming when he wants to be which implies he might not feel emotions but knows how to mimic them, inclination to violence, feeling that he is special, etc.), to mean the illness Ms. Cole thinks he has and which he does actually have is psychopathy.
