  But if Merope lived, and Tom Riddle grew up with a mother that loved him, he'd still be anti-social, have impaired empathy or remorse, be mean and extremely egotistical, because love potions or not - Voldemort was written as a psychopath

Dissagre, i think he was write as sociopath someone who is the way he is cause of society, Tom was narcist cause he was totaly alone in the world and that make him belive than that only happen cause he is better than the other , the people are like this when don't had something act like they don't need it, her mother die and the only possible reasonn than this could happen for him was her was weak cause was impossible for him think than someone really don't want him

  Being the child of a single squib mother & Muggle father he'd probably still have a chip on his shoulder about blood purity.

Her mother wasn't a squib , her father only call that like this cause she was untalented. And i think Merope would made her better to his son not being like his father
