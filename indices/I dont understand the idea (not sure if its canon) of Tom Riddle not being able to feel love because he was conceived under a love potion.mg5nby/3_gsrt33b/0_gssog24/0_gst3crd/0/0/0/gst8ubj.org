But if Merope lived, and Tom Riddle grew up with a mother that loved him, he'd still be anti-social, have impaired empathy or remorse, be mean and extremely egotistical, because love potions or not - Voldemort was written as a psychopath.

Being the child of a single squib mother & Muggle father he'd probably still have a chip on his shoulder about blood purity.

He'd still want to gamble everything and everyone to win at live because he'd think he's be entitled to it.

Merope was not in a position to provide for Tom properly, which is something that reflects in his upbringing and how he's view his mother.

For Tom Riddle to not escalate he'd need a sound and economically stable home where there'd be time for him and where Tom could be steered into a socially acceptable "boys will be boys" egotistical anti social behaviour.

I'd see a Tom from a good home become a ruthless CEO that'd have no problems with heavy exploitation of its employees. I'd see him become one of those BDSM club goers with no regards for SSC and torturing a sub to death and throw money at it with an "oopsie-daisy".

Or maybe just become a horrid spouse to some poor sod that made the mistake of marrying him.

Sure, nurture can do a lot, but some nature remains.
