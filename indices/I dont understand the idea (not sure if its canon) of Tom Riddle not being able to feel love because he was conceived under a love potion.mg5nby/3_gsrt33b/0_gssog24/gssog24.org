A bad childhood and perhaps internalised hatred for a certain group of people (such as women) can lead to serial killers, yes. Insert the Yorkshire Ripper, or countless others.

But not every kid that has an unhappy childhood turns out to be a genocidal maniac with zero interest in whether they'll burn the world down in their quest to make sure that everyone knows that they should indeed be revered like a god, rather than be written off as someone with a bad case of megalomania.

For there to be something inherently wrong with Riddle from the start would make it a whole lot more palatable.

Even in canon (or book 6, really) we see breadcrumbs of why Voldemort turned out as evil as he did, except, there is no story about downtrodden Tom Riddle's woes in a time where most people had to buckle up and deal with it.

Tom Riddle started killing human beings (Myrtle, his father and uncle) before be was out of school.

Even most of the fanfics where Harry turns evil because of the abuse against him are badly done because we don't see the slippery slope of morals, the escalation, and every step that turns Harry into a monster. (Except for Tiro's nightmare man, that was sublime).

The point is, lame or not, "just born that way" is more palatable than an abused kid in an orphanage that might not have been stellar at empathy and sharing things, and a lack of intervention from Albus "setting dressers on fire is a solid teaching/parenting tool" Dumbledore.
