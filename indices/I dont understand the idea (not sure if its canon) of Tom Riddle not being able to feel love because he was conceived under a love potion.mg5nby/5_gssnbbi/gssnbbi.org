Personally, I didn't find his childhood all that bad. Yes, he grew up in an orphanage. But based on the (admittedly brief flashback) it was a fairly nice one. The administrators gave a damn and the kids didn't need for anything. Hell, they had field trips to the beach.

Tom was the one that decided to kill small animals and do untold things to other kids that scarred them them life.

Tom was a bad egg. He inherited the asshole gene from both sides of the family.
