  I mean, if the story has a Harry that's less heroic and somewhat more egoistic than the average person, going to Voldemort and saying "I'm your second last Horcrux" is a pretty good way to live safely and comfortably all your life.

Someone wrote a story where Voldemort figured out that Harry was his last Horcrux and when he surrendered himself in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort just stunned him and took him to the Chamber of Secrets. He kept him alive but as a prisoner and a torture subject. Not quite the same situation as what you suggested, but imo it would be closer to Voldemort's reaction if he did figure it out.
