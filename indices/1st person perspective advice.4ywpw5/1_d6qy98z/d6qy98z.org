I tend not to like this perspective either. It's hard to set new plot hooks from such a limited POV without resorting to stock phrases such as 'an unreadable look,' thus making conflict far more difficult to portray than the 'standard' third-person limited.

That being said, I can count several first-person /original/ fiction stories among my favourites. I'm rereading one right now, /Robinson Crusoe/, that does a masterful job at telling an engaging story. So here are some quick and dirty tips from someone who has never written one in his life:

- Decide immediately what tense you're going to use: past or present. Past is probably easier for authors experimenting with the genre for the first time.

- Showing, not telling is /even more important/ than the other types of POVs. Practise using /concise/ but vivid imagery to describe settings, characters, and especially moods so that the reader isn't separated from the action/emotion and is therefore better able to identify with your protagonist.

- Get a beta reader who is going to be on the lookout for narrator omniscience. Or, if you don't feel comfortable having someone else go through this experiment with a fine-toothed comb, then as you edit, constantly ask yourself: 'How does the protagonist /know/ this?'

- Make your narrative voice match your protagonists speaking style. If they're naturally verbose and chatty, then feel free to use flowing descriptors. Don't mix and match. For example, how weird would it be for Hemingway-esque narration to accompany Faulkner-like dialogue?

Hope this helps. Great topic and good luck!
