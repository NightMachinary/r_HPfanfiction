I haven't written much first person, but as a reader I've found it really seperates the good and average writers. Personally I feel like if done right, a first person story could almost be better than any third person narration story, yet its a lot easier to screw up. Third person seems to be a lot more forgiving.

You have to really get into the character in first person. Its really good for stories where the main character will have a lot of internal dialogue and their thoughts are key to the story. Since it is seeing from a single perspective, you will have to do all your other character development through dialogue. This is harder to do, but when done properly comes across as more natural.

Like I said, I haven't done a lot of first person writing myself but this is what I've noticed about it. I think that a lot of people use first person for self insert style stories which tend to be lower quality and that's what gives it a somewhat bad reputation.
