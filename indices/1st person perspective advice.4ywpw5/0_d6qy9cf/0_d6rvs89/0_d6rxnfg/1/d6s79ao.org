Ah -- well that's a bit of a different beast. I'm not familiar with Adrian Mole, unfortunately, and I'm trying to think of other good epistolary novels, because there definitely are some, and some that I've read in HP fanfiction. People like to cite Per Solum Lucana (super-long Harry/Draco fic) since that has a ton of letter-writing between the main characters, but I actually didn't like that one (mostly due to other aspects of the author's writing style -- it was too stiff and disconnected, the dialogue felt unnatural, things like that IIRC).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary]] was a great one, but that does (in a way) feature dialogue between Ginny and Tom Riddle.

Other good epistolary works (non-HP): Dracula, The Diary of Anne Frank, The Martian, and possibly my favorite -- Cloud Atlas. Cloud Atlas contains multiple good contemporary examples; it's a set of six stories that all relate to each other in small ways. Two of them are epistolary format -- The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing and Letters from Zedelghem. The latter really tugged at my heartstrings, but I enjoyed both of them. In Letters, the character had a casual eloquence that occasionally surfaced when he was particularly heartfelt about a topic (e.g. his music).

For an epistolary novel to work, I think you again need to have great understanding and command of your viewpoint character(s). A large problem I see with this kind of writing is that authors forget their character's inner voice, which is what really needs to shine, especially in a letter or diary. There are probably going to be some tangents. The sentences may not be complete. Maybe your character injects some nuance into his/her writing by assigning everyone they write about a nickname, or adopting an amusing penname of their own (e.g. Draco Malfoy, King of Slytherin).

Often, characters just sound completely flat though. And any long-time journaler (er, well, this one at least!) will attest that their diaries don't read like a newspaper article or a course essay, and while it's easy to think, "Well of course not," it's easy to forget once you start writing. A diary is the exact place for your character to unleash all those thoughts they wouldn't otherwise give voice to, and I think it's important to remember that. There's all manner of emotions to explore and express, and furthermore -- I think it's important to remember that people don't usually write when all they have to say is, "I went to class. I had beef stew for lunch. Potions was funny since Longbottom blew up another cauldron." They tend to write about something in particular that happened to them (an event that took place or some emotional upheaval, etc.) or which they can't dismiss from their heads (getting over the death of someone, trying to figure out why they like somebody's company).

Ok, that was basically a book unto itself. Sorry for the ramble, and if it was disjointed.
