Agreed on all points. First person stories tend to be either truly spectacular marvels or horrible flops, and there's almost no middle ground. That, I think makes it quite a bit more difficult than third person, where, as you said, it's more forgiving, so there's a lot more leeway for average (+/- a couple standard deviations) stories to still be fairly well-received.

And I especially agree about the dialogue. One thing I've noticed in a lot of the very best first-person POV stories is that they're dialogue-heavy, another skill that can be a challenge for writers.
