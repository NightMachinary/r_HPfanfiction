For original novels I prefer first person because it really gets me into the head of the character- for some reason the minutiae of someone's life is infinitely more interesting to me if read in first person.

For fanfics, I mostly don't like it at all. I feel like the character already has a voice and if it doesn't match very closely to canon I'm much less forgiving than if the fic was in third person. For self inserts or OCs it can be fine though.
