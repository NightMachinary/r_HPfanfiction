I am currently writing a fic in 1st person, after thinking about why my 3rd person fic didn't quite work and experimenting inspired by another 1st person fanfic I've read. First I didn't like them so much either - the canon is written in third person too! yadda yadda but when I got over my prejudice I really started loving it. It's perfect for unreliable narrators like children, teenagers and the mentally ill, in my opinion, but that's probably because it's my share of characters - with others it will also work very well if you really want to add a more personal, emotional touch to the characters we know from canon. I had a bit of a problem first with the question "who is the reader? Who are the characters telling this to?" but then I realized that no-one buys that JK Rowling could have known what was in Harry's head either if she was just a supposed "witness of the events". Overall I love first person fics if the pov fits the story and adds to it. You know, maybe you feel that your story is made for that perspective, then you should write it in it and it will only improve that way. What is an extra of first person viewpoint in my opinion is also that the reader can really be the characters or feel as if the characters are talking to them, or choose that the monologue is meant for another character. With third person there's no such thing.

About the tone of voice having to be right: I find that a bit odd seeing as we just don't know what the internal monologue is for the characters from canon, besides Harry's (so with first person perspective Harry fics I can understand it, then again, maybe he has changed, although the reason for it should then be explained). I respect it, but I think it's all subjective. Humor fics are always nice, I'd be interested in the fic when it's finished. With a diary, you already have a good explanation of why the fic is in first person perspective in the first place, but then there needs to be given a reason why the character has kept one and it should be in character for the character to keep one (unless there is an outside influence)
