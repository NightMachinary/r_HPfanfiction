I think 1st person is the most engaging when used properly. Jbern's "The Lie I've Lived" is a good example of this. I think it's best used when the fiction revolves heavily around the main character. It can really give the story good pacing; the reader can get a feel for what the mc's thoughts are during dialogue and duels without interrupting the flow with a separate narrator. 1st person seems to offer a more personal approach, like a tale told by the campfire. Jbern also uses 2nd person which seems a bit outlandish("Bungle In The Jungle") but it works well in my opinion.
