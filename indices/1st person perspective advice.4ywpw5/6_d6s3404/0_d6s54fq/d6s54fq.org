I think "Catcher in the Rye" is 1st person and may owe some of its popularity to it. Seems more psychological reading a character's thought/intent directly rather than having it described 3rd hand all the time. May be the difference between empathy and sympathy. I could be completely full of shit of course. Just a general impression after reading so much of this hp fan fiction. I guess the most important thing you need in first person is an interesting main character.
