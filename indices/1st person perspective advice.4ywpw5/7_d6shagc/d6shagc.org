There's a 'Secret Diary of Adrian Mole' style story called linkffn(Six Feet of Ginger Idiot), which is a really good Romione Sixth-year fic. I don't normally read romance, but it's got a lot of humour and the perspective it's written from (and some of the phrasing) just made me think of a particular 13 3/4 year old.

Might be worth checking out, at least a little bit.
