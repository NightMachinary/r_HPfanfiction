Maybe a story in the same universe, but set in early 2020s. Not Cursed Child. An entirely different plot, an entirely different enemy, maybe threat of muggles discovering the magicals due to technological advances. Witch hunting beginning again. Muggleborns stuck in the middle. A hero rises, either an intelligent muggleborn technomage (child of Elon Musk or something) who does powerful magic to hide the magical world again, or a muggleborn who is able to convince both sides to coexist.
