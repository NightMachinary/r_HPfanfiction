I mean the Alexandra quick stories only share the Harry Potter type magic in them so that could sort of be something. But that's the only way I could see the HP world be rewritten. Not focusing on Harry and co. Like a previous person said, a mystery where you know the ending isn't as good. I doubt anyone here will ever be able to read HP or any book and enjoy it as much as the first time because not knowing what's gonna happen makes the story better.
