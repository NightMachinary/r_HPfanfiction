I think the general consensus would be that it should not from the wider fandom. Sure, there are alot of fix-it and re-do fics out there, but the fact that there are provides support to the general popularity of the overall story, even if others disagree on what they wish was different.

To give my personal reason, I think its worth pointing out that the seven books as a whole were written by a single author with a vision for her world. Not to say that the world is entirely consistent (in fact its often not and hence the immense issues people still poke at), but rather that what JKR wanted was what was on the pages. Her message, her morals, her ideals formed the backbone of the world as she wrote to reach a cohesive ending.

The triumph of good over evil. The virtue of innocence. The disdain of classicism.

Her work is as much a work of fiction as it is her take on our world. And this is why so many fics feel wrong to readers, and why many people long for writing that "feels like" canon writing. Its not just the Wizarding World and its peoples; it was Rowling's voice. And rebooting the series by another author, or worse by committee, would inherently give voice to different ideals.

Not to mention its rather foolish to re-do the series when at their core, stripping away the magic and HP stuff, the seven books are each boarding school mystery novels. If you already know the mystery, it sort of sucks the life from the story.
