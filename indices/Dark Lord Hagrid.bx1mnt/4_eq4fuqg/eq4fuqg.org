Hmm...I think I read a one-shot once where Hagrid killed Harry by slipping him poison during one of their teas. He started off good, but turned to Voldemort when the latter promised to further the rights of non-humans (since Voldemort does employ werewolves/giants/etc in canon).

I think it was on AO3, but I can't find it...
