The figure looked towards the last standing ruins of the ministry. Small shadows cowered in between with nowhere left to run, surrounded as they were by tooth and claw and fire-breath. His enormous shadow stole the light and grew, of man shape maybe, but far greater. Eyes as black beatles gleamed with cruel desire from between the dark mass of hair. With one hand he stroked the shell of the enormous blast-ended skrewt, with the other he held a once pink umbrella, now a deep red, as if stained with blood.

"if ye won't love my beautiful beasties-" Hagrid growled menacingly, "i will MAKE ye love them."

He heaved his tiny umbrella high and pointed it towards the last bastion. Thousand of beastly eyes in all sizes followed it, as if hypnotized. The air was dreadfully tense. All was silent for that one moment. Then, hagrid pressed the button with his thumb, the umbrella shot open and all monsters stormed forward to the awaiting feast. The screams began.

"the world, canne sustain humans, see. Tha's just not balanced. So now, there'll be only creatures. Only us."

He mounted his dragon, Norberta, who had grown bigger than all other things in the sky on a diet of wizard flesh.

"and now it is balanced. As all things shouda been."

And there were no more screams.
