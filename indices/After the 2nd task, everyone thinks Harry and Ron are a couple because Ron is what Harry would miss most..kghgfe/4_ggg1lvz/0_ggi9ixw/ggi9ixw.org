I can't see that destroying their friendship. Everything they've been through? Esp with Ron being a dick earlier in the year. I mean, Harry survived second year when everyone thought he was the heir of Slytherin, and fourth year when half the school hates him. He's hardly going to bother with that. & I imagine Ron would be uncomfortable, but I can't see their friendship ending over it lol
