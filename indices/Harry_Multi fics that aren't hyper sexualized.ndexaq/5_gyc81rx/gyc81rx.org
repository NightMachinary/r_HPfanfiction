I get why most people don't like the multi trope. It's unrealistic, and usually a smutfest, and let's face it, its usually written by horny teenagers, and often devoud of anything resembling character progression.

I find, that if you give each person a role to play, a job to do within the plot, you give yourself a better chance of fleshing them out, to a degree. Have them help advancing the plot. Don't just have them them in the story like some kind of vessel for Harry's... release.

Another thing I do in my fic, is I gave every woman I paired with Harry 'a moment' with him, to better understand them, and their motivations, dreams and desires. I suppose each woman fills a certain trope.

And I kind of hoped to have each woman represent a facet of Harry's personality, that he might have repressed to a degree, because of the role he took for himself. And the way he was raised. Kind of like Captain Malcolm Reynolds of the Firefly, in fact.

For example, Narcissa, while a little warmer now, compared with how she was with Lucius, is still a Slytherin through and through, a manipulative b$%ch. She's very intelligent and cunning, and willing to do some... questionable things to get her way, which is the reason why she's Harry's proxy for the Black seat on the Wizengamot.

Bellatrix, while not a completely insane, sadistic murderer anymore, doesn't give a shit about Harry's quest. The only reason she even bothers with it, is because she's utterly in love with Harry, and she loves her sisters, and niece. Getting rid of Riddle is the only thing that will keep her precious people safe. And she's out for revenge, so you better believe she's going to cut loose against her former colleagues!

I felt Tonks's silly, mischievous and playful character would help Harry cope with everything, and draw out his own silly self. That being said, she's not just comic relief, but an actual character, who has recently lost her husband to a Dementor attack. Harry's heart will help her heal, butshe has yet to deal with Remus' death.

Andromeda is a gentle and kind woman, who cares very deeply for people, and has a strong conscience. She lost her husband, but fell for Harry when she saw his true self, and how good he was for her sisters. And he brought them back to her. Harry's also going to have the Black name stand for something better. Despite her kindness, she's still a Black, so you best understand her claws are sharp!

Being a Veela, Fleur understands the loneliness that comes with being TBWL. Most people only see the Veela, while most only see The Boy Who Lived. Of course, Harry being immune to the Allure, makes him irresistible to /Her/ Fleur's Veela, whom she considers to be a separate being, living inside her.

Minerva represents Harry's strict and disciplined side. I have yet to give McG her proper time in the sun. Sure she and Harry have had a moment, but this latest chapter I'm writing should flesh her out a bit more. I wonder how people will react to a completely ruthless Minerva?

And lastly, we have ... well she's a bit of a blank page as of yet. She's very well known in HP, but she's practically an OC, so. I'll flesh her out and It'll happen in this chapter.

While doing this, I still tried to not completely disregard the canon personality of the women involved. The chapter I'm writing now also adresses why the group was drawn together in the first place.

Whew, that was a bit more than I meant to do, but I found I wanted to outline how I tried to tackle the multi trope.

No idea if I succeeded, though.
