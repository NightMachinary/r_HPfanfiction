they totally have! I have two pansexual harem fics with Hermione as the mc on the go and one of them has a young, prickly, asexual Severus in it (time travel is a beautiful thing); but I haven't tried with Harry because I didn't want to write Harry orgies, but this idea is really lovely, so I'm going to have a crack at it. Now that I know that at least one panromantic person would read it I have extra encouragement!

They are quite difficult to write outside of hormones because ensemble fics always have so many dynamics running at the same time, but that's also the Beauty of them!

The only fic I can really think of right now that has that kind of thing is the creature fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/485605/chapters/845701][There be Dragons, Harry]]. It's an epically ever-moving-many-threads-complex-worldbuilding-and-weird-creature-stuff fic, and it's m/m/m/m... I can't remember what number they're up to now, and it has a fair amount of smut, but I feel like you can easily skip it and lose none of the stody, and it does have some lovely cuddly moments as well, it's just buried in there somewhere.

Other than that, I can't seem to be able to find the cute triad fics I know I've read, so I'm really sorry!
