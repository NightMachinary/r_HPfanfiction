I write under gladheonsleeps on both ffnet and ao3, but neither of the fics I mentioned are anywhere neat ready for publishing yet. As I said they're pretty hard to write, so it's slow going.

There is a fairly light-on-lemons James/Lily/Regulus fic though. They aren't ace or demi, but I didn't go in for gratuitous descriptions in scenes, just sort of referred to the fact that they did it, so you might like the vibe, hopefully? I went big for atmosphere and sweetness on that one linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14263605/chapters/32896794]])
