I'm promoting myself here, I hope you don't mind. My story doesn't have any lemons in it. I really wanted to try and focus on the characters and their interactions and development as individuals. Some people say a harem (I hate that word) fics are pointless without lemons, but I vehemently disagree.

Too many Harry/multi stories feature a group of women who are carbon copies of each others, I tried to avoid that. Each and every woman, while somehow 'compelled' to seek Harry out, has her own reason for doing so. Also, I did not want to let the plot descend into cheap porn. There is some sensuality, and scenes where the reader knows what will and what did happen.

A point. While Harry finds himself in a relationship with quite a few women, the story is not centered around him 'gathering' a bunch of lovers. It is more of a byproduct of my Harry simply being who he is, and doing what he does. The characters feelings are integral to the conclusion of the story, however.
