Have you read /Homunculus to the Life/? I don't normally go for triads or polyships, mostly because I rarely find stories that I actually enjoy. I liked this one. It's Ron/Harry/Hermione, post-war. While short and full of angst, given the premise, I liked the rather deft and careful way the author approached their relationship (and that it ended on a more optimistic note). There was some intimacy, iirc, but it wasn't smut. linkao3(27889183)
