I was using /Natural Reader/ for a long time. The BIG thing, especially for HP fanfics was that you can /customize/ the pronunciation. It would even output mp3 files that I could load on my phone (easy on android) and then I didn't have to worry about pronunciation.

I stopped when my work commute dropped to like 5 minutes, but now that it's back up I've been thinking about using it again.

Edit to say: the [[https://www.naturalreaders.com/index.html][personal version]] is free but you only have one voice.
