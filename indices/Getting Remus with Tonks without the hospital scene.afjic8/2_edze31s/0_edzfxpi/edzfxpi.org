Yes,that bit with animagus might work. I'm not sure about setting him up with a werewolf, though. It' seems that you might be right about him not being, well, particularly fond of them.But maybe I'm wrong. The wierd thing is that it took me quite some time to realize how that scene looked from outsider's perspective. Everyone thinks everything is so simple, but I just don't think it is, and the timing couldn't have been worse. And even all Remus Tonks fics I've read or tried to read are the same- get together in OOTP, then he suddenly changes his mind, then the final hospital scene. So I started wondering what would make him start a relationship in the first place. But I'm no closer to finding an answer than I was before ,lol.
