In my fic, I have him turn her down by telling her he's not looking for a relationship, so she assures him that all she wants is a no-strings-attached one-night-stand, and then another one after that... Which is deceptive. Their relationship seems unhealthy to me. That pregnancy was obviously unplanned. I wonder if Tonks lied about being on birth control. I think Harry should have been more sympathetic about Remus maybe trying to escape from an abusive relationship, but of course Harry was just a teenager who didn't know the whole story.
