You know, I had some,erm, dark thoughts about that pregnancy, but I knew this fandom would burn me alive if I said anything. It might be unfair to Tonks,but the way she behaves doesn't portray her in a very positive light. There are maybe three scenes where they are shown together, and in all of them Tonks is perfectly happy while Remus is depressed. Guess What I thought when I reread them? It was like'oh she must think she got what she wanted'. That's not very kind of me and that's definitely not what JK intended. In your opinion, what would make Remus willingly enter a relationship? Btw, what is your fic about?
