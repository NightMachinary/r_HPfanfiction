Go ahead, share your dark thoughts. It's winter, a bonfire would be nice. People bash the other characters all the time. Tonks should have a turn.

My fic Humansplaining is mostly canon-compatible, although I've pushed back the formation of the second incarnation of the Order to 1993. Canon doesn't tell us exactly when Dumbledore started it back up. Tonks meets Remus before Snape outs him as a werewolf, so he's still in the closet, even to most of his fellow Order members. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828709/chapters/34317807]])

It's hard for me to imagine Remus having some happily-ever-after ending with his true love. I wrote a canon-compatible fic about the aftermath of the First Wizarding War, when Remus was one of the few survivors of the Order. He doesn't even let himself have friends, much less a girlfriend. Warning, this is pretty dark. I have ideas to do a whole Employee of the Month series about his twelve years of poverty, hopelessness, and loneliness between the wars, although no one is demanding that. My readers are demanding updates to my cheerful time-travel fixit instead. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255]])

I have a story in which he and a muggle woman are thrown together by circumstance during the First Wizarding War. A different fanfic writer would give them a happy ending after this, but not me. This is a work in progress, but will eventually explain why his friends thought he was the spy in the Order, thus didn't tell him the plan to switch secret-keepers. In this one, when asked why he doesn't have a werewolf girlfriend, he's disgusted at the idea. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14939201/chapters/34612796]])

If you want to see Remus happy, I have this silly little one-joke time travel story: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828663]])

I know, we just want Remus to be happy, but fate (meaning Rowling) seemed to create him just to suffer.
