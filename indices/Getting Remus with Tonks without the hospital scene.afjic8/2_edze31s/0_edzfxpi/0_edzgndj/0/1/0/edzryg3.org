You are just as cruel as Rowling. It's strange that even though I want him to be happy and therefore I happily ignore the ending of DH, I can't think of a way to make it happen. I remember thinking that he might have had friends during those 12 years, but he apparently doesn't think so. Maybe he thought that other marauders were the exception and there's no way someone else could befriend him. As for Tonks, Rowling loves the idea that opposites attract, and even though it's true, I got a bit bored with it. It also seems that in Remus's case only a woman who is inexperienced and naive could be with him. To me that sounds like a recipee for disaster. I wish there was some hurt comfort story about him and someone else, bonded by similar experiences or something. But I should stop imagining things lol. But I know that there are such examples in reality.Also, I generally might enjoy a story where a younger woman falls in love with an older man, but those two are so different. Well, and I'm not a fan of forceful characters, so Tonks, especially in most fics, is a bit too much for me. Thanks for the links. So you aren't a fan of happy endings? Well, you've chosen a perfect character then. Doom and gloom. I hope you won't get depressed after writing about his 12 years of solitude. This title already sounds gloomy.
