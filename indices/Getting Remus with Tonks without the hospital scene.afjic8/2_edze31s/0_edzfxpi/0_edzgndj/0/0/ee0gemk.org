It takes two people to make a baby. Unless you're suggesting Tonks raped Remus, there are a few very easy steps he could have taken to not have a child if he didn't want one. I didn't really get a harassing vibe from Tonks either, but I can see how one might.

That's not to say I thought their relationship was healthy, as it clearly wasn't, I just hate the stupid sexist idea of women trapping men with children as if having a child is their choice alone.
