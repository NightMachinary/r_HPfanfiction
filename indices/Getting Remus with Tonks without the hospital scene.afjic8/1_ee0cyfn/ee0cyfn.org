I actually think that the heart of what Tonks is expressing in the hospital scene is okay and might work under less manipulative circumstances. Meaning, if she'd continued to say those same things (she'd obviously said them before Harry was around to witness it) but didn't do it in semi-public in the immediate aftermath of Dumbledore's death, it could have worked eventually. Once upon a time he was convinced to have friends; why not a romantic partner? The thing is, it would be more grind than grand gesture. Tonks leads toward grand gestures, but I'm betting she wouldn't have been the only person chosen for the auror program in umpteen years if she wasn't capable of the grind, too.

External factors would speed it up though, and there's an obvious one who was gone by that point in canon. Having Sirius survive a bit longer would have been helpful because Sirius was living proof that someone could choose to take the package deal that is Remus' goodness and badness, at least in a platonic-love sense. And if Sirius says “go be with my baby cousin” that carries a lot more weight than it would coming from someone who wasn't perfectly well acquainted with Remus' wolf side.
