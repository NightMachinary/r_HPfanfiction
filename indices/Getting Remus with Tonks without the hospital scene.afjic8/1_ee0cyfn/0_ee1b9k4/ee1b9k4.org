I agree that this might have worked under different circumstances, though I personally think she should have done something to prove she is capable of dealing with his condition and that she knows what might happen, otherwise she just seems naive. I also wondered about him having friends and thus thought he could have a romantic partner. But a romantic partner would have to deal with his condition far more closely, like looking after him after full moons and facing the stigma it carries, so he must have been affraid of this.
