My favorite fic so far!

Sirius escapes and kidnaps Harry years before hogwarts. Lupin joins the search effort for his best friend's son, and Auror trainee Tonks' first job is the hunt for Sirius Black. They spend over a year searching together, during half of which Lupin actively sabotages the search after he found out the truth about Wormtail.
