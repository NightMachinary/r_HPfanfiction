One might try to set him up with a fellow werewolf. It's not canon, but in my fanfics, I've made his self-loathing include being disgusted by other werewolves, so he couldn't be attracted to one. The poor guy basically exists just to suffer. If you leave that bit out, though, he might think that he's good enough to date a werewolf, since werewolves are all trash like him so it doesn't matter anyway.
