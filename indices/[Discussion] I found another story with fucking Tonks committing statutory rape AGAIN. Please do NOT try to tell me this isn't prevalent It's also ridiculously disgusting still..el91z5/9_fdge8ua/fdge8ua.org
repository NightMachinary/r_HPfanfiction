I wonder if you wouldn't find as many stories with Harry and another female character. When it's older younger paring, there can be issues. Someone chose a bad age range. And the answer to why it's Tonks is easy. Tonks is older and she has cool powers. It's generally the main reason people are interested in her, maybe even the only one sometimes. But I doubt you wouldn't find a similar story with Harry Fleur. It can be hard to remember that in fanfiction there are no rules and authors can write about anything they like.
