  My admittedly baseless and uncharitable opinion is: People hate Tonks because she proves Lupin is straight thus sinking people's wolfstar ships. Ofc she also proves he's a family abandoning coward later on but nobody seems to mind that.

I mean, in canon Tonks only starts dating Remus /after/ Sirius dies, so I don't think it really sinks anything. I've seen a bunch of fics (though you're right they're in the minority) that have Tonks help Remus move on from Sirius's death and his depression over Sirius being one of the issues she was crying about in HBP. Or Teddy Lupin finding out Sirius & his dad had a thing before Sirius died and his father got married.
