Might be a touch of the ol' wish fulfillment at play. From my personal experience fics shipping those two usually has a powerful and mature Harry, usually around fifth year. Plus a lot of fanfics follow the canon with minor tweeks, and Tonks has like 6 years on Harry so...

What I have yet to see is a deaged Tonks/Harry fic. I mean just shuffle her birth around so she's born shortly after or before Harry. It's not that hard, and it's not like the plot breaks in half if you do.
