There has always been a double standard when it comes to romances in age-difference body swapping and such.

For some reason, if you say, swap the body of a 30 year old and a 15 year old, depicting the older-in-younger-body dealing with sex and sexuality (and possibly continuing relationships with older people, or starting relationships with others in their body's age range) produces a visceral reaction.

While the 15 year old in a 30 year old body dealing with their body's sexuality is not viewed anywhere near as poorly, and sometimes even as comedic.

You get this a lot in HP fanfic, particularly around time travel (person going back to their younger body) or with Metamorphs. Tonks gets in with a lot of these subsequent fics.

I don't think that is what Barefoot did, but to your question on why it comes up a lot, that is part of it.

(I understand where this comes from in the visual medium: Backstory is easy to ignore, and if you just look at the visuals of '30 year old in 15 year old body having sex with 30 year old partner' or '15 year old in 30 year old body having sex with 15 year old partner' is going to be a visual depiction of basically child abuse, while a visual depiction of '15 year old in 30 year old body having sex with a 30 year old partner' or '30 year old in 15 year old body having sex with a 15 year old partner' is going to visual depiction of something not at all out of the ordinary. I do not understand why this standard extends to written word, although I would say it is a lot weaker there than it is in the visual mediums).

Fantasy (magic) and Sci-Fi tend to remove stories enough from real-world situations that it can be used to avoid... uncomfortable issues. For example, you are going to get strangeness if you write in elves that live for a thousand years and don't leave adolescence till they are over 100. But the 'this isn't really related to our reality, so you can't hold our moral standards to it' can generally be used when you break from the situation that much.

This usually ends up in HPFanfiction as "Going back in time kinda merged you with your younger self, so it isn't too creepy to be participating in teenage romances". I would say in most cases, the author would prefer to just not deal with the issue.
