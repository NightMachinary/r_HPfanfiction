There's a super old set of stories called Switchverse, [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/tag/switchverse]], which wasn't completed but is fun nonetheless. The basic plot line is that Fred and George spill some sort of confusion potion on the sorting hat before Harry's year starts, so everyone in the class ends up in the wrong house (Harry and Draco are Hufflepuffs, Ron and Pansy Ravenclaws, etc). I remember it being a very fun read.
