You know, I am in the minority here in that I wasn't crazy about this story. I read it years ago and never felt convinced that Hermione had a good reason to take the path she did. Everyone seemed OOC, in part because I wasn't sold on the plot point. Still, it has high kudos/reviews so maybe I'm wrong.
