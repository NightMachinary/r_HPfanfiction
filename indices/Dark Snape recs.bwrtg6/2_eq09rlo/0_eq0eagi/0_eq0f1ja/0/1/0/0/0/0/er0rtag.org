I do believe that in a reality where Severus survives the wars, he is finally able to move on from Lily -- his vow to protect Harry to make up for his choices actively interferes with his ability to move on. Thus, while I agree to some extent that nobody would surpass Lily in his eyes, I only think this lasts during his spy work. She'll always remain dear to him, but no longer at the expense of anyone else.
