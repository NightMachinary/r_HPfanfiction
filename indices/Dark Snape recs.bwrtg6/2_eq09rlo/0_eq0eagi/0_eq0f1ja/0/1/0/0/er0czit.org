My thoughts on viable partners for Severus boils down to three people:

- Hermione Granger -- postwar to avoid student/teacher, or with teenage!Severus (time travel or de-aging). Both studious and socially awkward, able to bond over their love of advanced magical theory, ultimately becoming friends and eventually something more.
- Lily Evans -- They have a long history as very close friends. They /know/ each other like nobody else, and I can see it go two ways: sibling love (they met when they were 9 years old) or something that eventually develops into romantic love. Canon makes Severus out as loving Lily, but is unclear on whether it was reciprocated or not (my headcanon is that the spark to ignite something was there, but unexplored). JKR has later on implied that had Severus not done the decisions he did in canon, Lily would never have dated James, and if Severus got a second choice, he'd choose Lily over the Death Eaters each time (this is probably what inspired the remarkably common LESS Peggy Sue plot). Make of that what you want...
- Narcissa Black -- The only female person close in age to Severus that he seems to give the time of day during the 90s. She went to him, of all people, to ask to protect Draco, so I assume they were at least friendly to each other. In a reality where Lucius is an abusive husband, I can see Narcissa go to Severus for help and Severus being able to sympathize with his experience with Eileen, with them eventually becoming more than friends in the fallout. I haven't actually read any good NBSS, but it's really the only other major female I can see him with enough to be able to dream up a reality for myself.

Obviously, there's also OCs -- but I can't really comment on them since they can be made out to be whatever the author wants (but I have issue with one particular OC, a 3rd Evans sibling -- to me, these fics usually end up feeling as if Severus' mindset is "ok, I can't have Lily, so let's pick a consolation prize", it does not make for a healthy relationship). Besides that, I've seen the occasional NTSS and one LBSS of all things (and several slash pairings, but I don't read slash), but nothing that has interested me. While I have pondered the implications of GWSS, I've never been able to see it go any further than a temporary fling postwar (similar to Ginny/Dean in canon), because I can't see them put up with each other's personalities longterm. And Severus would only look at Ginny at all because she's a redhead (even if my inner image of her is nothing like Lily -- different hair colors), and Ginny at Severus due to morbid curiousity. Hence why I was curious about GWSS fics to see how it works, maybe they can change my view of things. Thanks for the links!
