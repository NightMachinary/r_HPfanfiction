I think any woman besides Lily would be a consolation prize for Snape. It's pretty tragic, but he did devote his life to redeeming her death. Even HG can't really replace LE. There is a SSNB fic rec'ed above.

I like the pairing because Ginny was possessed and influenced by Tom Riddle her first year at Hogwarts. It's frustrating that Rowling never explored this and the effect it had on Ginny. I think it probably made a huge impression on her mind and development. She's basically a good person who was lured to the dark side, like Snape was, but for different reasons. Yes, I do bring up the red hair, but really, Lily's personality also seemed similar to Ginny's in that she was fiery, intelligent, and strong. So the similarities are more than skin deep.
