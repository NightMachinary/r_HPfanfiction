It's called Severus Snape and the Art of War. It's a time travel story and it's on both AO3 and FFN. First 20 chapters or so are meh, but it gets a lot better along the way. A LOT happens and the main storyline is still consistent.

By the way, I'm the author so I'm totally shamelessly promoting myself here.
