Hm it seems your vote was canceled out lol. I guess people in this subreddit have strong feelings about certain characters or pairings. Thanks anyway.

To me Lily/Snape would be almost sad and tragic because of canon, but I'd love to take a look at any you'd recommend. I want to read darkfics, Snape doesn't have to be dark. Thank you!!! :)
