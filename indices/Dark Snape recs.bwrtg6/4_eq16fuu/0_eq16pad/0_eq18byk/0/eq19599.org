That kind of surprises me...between Ginny getting possessed by Tom and getting close to the "dark side," and her resemblance to Lily, I would expect more of that pairing. Especially since Snape/Hermione is possibly the #1 het pairing.

She's not really a fleshed out character though. I prefer her in fanfiction.
