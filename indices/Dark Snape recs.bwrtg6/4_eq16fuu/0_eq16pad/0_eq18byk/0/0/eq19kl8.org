Yes, these are all good points! I'll admit, I wasn't looking for a Snape/Ginny when I picked it up, I just wanted to check out her other work, and I found the pairing really surprising... but wow, I really liked it! And the rest of her plot as well, it was great. I believe she said one of the reasons she wanted to do it was because Hermione is overused and Ginny and Snape are not typically paired together, and this is a good point. Hermione is paired with everyone and their mother. xD
