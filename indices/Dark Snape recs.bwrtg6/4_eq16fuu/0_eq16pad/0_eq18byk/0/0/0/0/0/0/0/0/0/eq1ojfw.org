I'm not sure why the pairing first fascinated me. Maybe because Lupin was so persistent in book 3 to strike a friendship with Snape, and their personalities are quite opposite. Although in some ways the same...since Lupin is also a Dark Creature.

If you're curious, the very first fic to get me hooked was the Wicked Game Series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10957044/chapters/24388608]]

No longer canon compliant, but still really great.

Short, intense fics Learning to Read the Signs and its sequel Apt Pupil are also great: [[http://www.masterandthewolf.com/masterandthewolf/stories/learningtoreadthesigns.html]] [[http://www.masterandthewolf.com/masterandthewolf/stories/aptpupil.html]]

I do like canon pairings, especially Romione. :)
