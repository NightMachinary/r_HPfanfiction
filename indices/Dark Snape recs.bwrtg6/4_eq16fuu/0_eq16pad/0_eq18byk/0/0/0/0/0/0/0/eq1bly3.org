Actually, my very first HP fanfic was Snarry. My mind was blown, I remember feeling shocked that fanfics could be better than published works. I go through phases where I prefer slash or het. Snape/Lupin was my favorite back when it was a rare pair and there were only like 10 fics lol. The internet favored Sirius/Lupin. I wondered what changed that.
