IIRC, there's some Ginny/Draco but emotional Ginny/Snape relationship in [[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/ginnysdarkside/SDIWIWIS.html][Some Days I Wish I Were in Slytherin]] by Ginnysdarkside. I liked that this fic was so out there - it's set in China.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7170435/1/Bound-to-Him][Bound to Him]] by georgesgurl117 is Hermione/Snape with a dark/disturbing premise. It was a bit too much for me, but might meet your criteria. linkffn(7170435)

Also, Puzzle has already been recommended, but I'll add that I'm a big fan of that one!
