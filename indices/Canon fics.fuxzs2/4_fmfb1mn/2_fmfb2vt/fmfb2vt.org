  Moving to Beverly Hills was certainly an adventure like one of those in books Lilette Chase read. Now that she's here, she befriends three girls, but it's obvious they're hiding something. Something bigger than she could imagine. And then she has to find out who her father is. Yup, it certainly does sound like an adventure!
