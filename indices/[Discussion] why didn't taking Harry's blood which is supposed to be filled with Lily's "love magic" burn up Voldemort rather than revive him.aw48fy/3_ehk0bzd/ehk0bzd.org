I'm fairly certain I've read multiple fics that did exactly this as a way to off Voldemort.

From a canon perspective, I'd say that his blood wasn't filled with love magic at all. I'd say that the protective magic was tied to the bloodline and using the magic made him part of that bloodline and thus immune to protection. We never really get a description of how the protection Lilly used actually works in canon. If we look at Harry's sacrifice in DH that also imbued a protection to the defenders of Hogwarts there was nothing tied to blood at all.
