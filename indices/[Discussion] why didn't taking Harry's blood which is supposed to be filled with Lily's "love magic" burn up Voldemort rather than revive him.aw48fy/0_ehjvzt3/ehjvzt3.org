The reason if you really want to call it that, is magic.

The ritual's, which had vague descriptions, only written purpose was to revive him and increase the threat level in the story. So we can assume that somehow /using magic/ the ritual bypassed the love magic and neutralized it.

After all, it would be fairly silly although humorous to read about Pettigrew colossally fucking up and having voldemort getting shafted by his own doing during the climax.
