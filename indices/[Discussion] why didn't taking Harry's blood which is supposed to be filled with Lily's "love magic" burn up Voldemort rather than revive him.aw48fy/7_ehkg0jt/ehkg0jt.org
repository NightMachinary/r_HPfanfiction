‘Cus taking on the blood took on the protection, tricking the magic into thinking voldie was harry too, and nullifying the whole thing. That's what voldie was going for; what he didn't know, however, was that he was tying harry to life with his new body as much as he was himself. Two bodies of the same blood for one soul. That way, when harrys body was killed, he could yet survive, and his soul was protected the crux.

That is, his soul was bound to the earth by voldies body, and it wasn't forced to go On to the afterlife, ‘cus the crux could go in his place.

Maybe it also helped that he was the master of the Wand, and maybe it helped that he was the MoD, or that he had Pheonix tiers in his blood, or voldies crux's were all gone but one. Or Maybe he just had Plot Armor. I prefer the first explanation though, and that dumbles planned it all, and it worked even after his death...
