No one seems to have touched on this, so here's my theory. The ritual clearly dictated which ingredients and also in which fashion. Servant's flesh was 'willingly' given and father's bone was 'unknowningly' taken. The enemy's blood is forcibly taken, this means it signifies overcoming/conquering the enemy magic. Remember that in magic, the intent matters. Thus, I think, the ritual was designed to overcome the harmful properties of the enemy magic/blood and subvert those to be conducive to its original purpose. Many writers have explored this scenario where Harry willingly gives it up to mess with the ritual.
