I've been wondering about the new Azkaban. They'd need prison reform after the second wizarding war---the dementors were ineffective, inhumane, and ultimately disloyal. So what happens next? Is there a Grindelwald-style end for the living death eaters, locked in solitude until they die of old age? Or some more progressive reform-based system? Privatization, so the wealthy make more money off the incarcerated, like in the US? Legilimency-based prison so they experience decades of punishment in the span of a week and then are meant to be productive members of society again?

Sooooo many options...
