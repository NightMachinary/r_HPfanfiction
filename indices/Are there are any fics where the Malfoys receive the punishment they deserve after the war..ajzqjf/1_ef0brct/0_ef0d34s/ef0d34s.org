Under normal circumstances, Draco should have served jail time for his crimes, especially considering that contrary to his claims, there was a way out for him, as the Order of the Phoenix offered him and his family protection.

But we're talking about a post-war society here, where reconciliation usually takes priority over criminal justice. In most post-war situations, even people who did way worse things than Draco did managed to escape justice and sometimes even managed to hold on to positions of power.
