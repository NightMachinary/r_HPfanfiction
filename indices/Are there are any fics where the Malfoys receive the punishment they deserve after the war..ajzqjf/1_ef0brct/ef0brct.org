It is sometimes mentioned in the background, but as far as I am aware, there isn't a single story where the war is sufficiently dealt with other than extreme cases like "Marriage Law Revolution" where Harry and Hermione go full "French Revolution" on Magical Britain and later Europe. But the action there is a reaction to a marriage law, not the war itself. Nothing which has a thorough examination of the war, the people who collaborated and certainly nothing which is done by the ministry and not some vigilante business by Harry.

There aren't many people around who think that Malfoy deserves actual prison time for his terrorist attacks, much less capital punishment. And speaking from personal experience, advocating that gets you a lot of downvotes. People are willing to throw Umbridge and Lucius into prison, but other than that the popular sentiment is rehabilitation, not prison or the chopping block/veil/hangman's rope. Because clearly, not wanting to commit war crimes, attempted murder and various acts of terrorism makes it okay...
