This reminds me of Longshot and Shatterstar (X-Factor). In Harry Potter terms it'd be something like...

James (Longshot) is a corrupted clone of Harry (hence the different eye colour) who's sent back in time where he eventually meets and falls in love with Lily (Dazzler) and thereby fathers his own father.

Of course, the straight Harry is his own father idea makes the POA scene foreshadowing.
