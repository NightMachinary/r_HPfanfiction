I don't know exactly either and I'm not sure if you have watched the series or not.

So I don't want to spoil things and thus my answer might raise more questions then answers - but to me Dark felt like a proper time-travel story, well though out from the beginning to the end, and every point (like someone becoming their own grandmother) comes from this plan. They haven't just thrown around a buntch of ideas every season to get the proper amount of episodes out, and so "stealing a plot point" seems a bit too strong. "influenced" could work, but as I havent watched futurama it is hard to tell if that is true.

Also futurama was not the first story where someone became their own ancestor. 2014 film Predestination features a similar concept, which was based on a novel from 1958.

Similar concepts are listed on the "See also" section of the novel I mentioned before (including the futurama episode): [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Zombies#See_also]]
