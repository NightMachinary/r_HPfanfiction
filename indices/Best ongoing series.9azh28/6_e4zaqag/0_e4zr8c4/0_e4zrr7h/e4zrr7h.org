Not a tumblr thing, pretty sure not using capitalization has been around for a long, long time (ee cummings, bell hooks).

As for her titles, I'm pretty sure they're lyrics to songs that have inspired each fic, so they don't need to be capitalized. Either way, it's not something I care about, or really mind. I'd much rather read an excellent, unique fic that doesn't have a capitalized title than a mediocre fic that's been done millions of times before and happens to have a title that's capitalized.
