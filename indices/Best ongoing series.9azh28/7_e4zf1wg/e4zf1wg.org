The Innocent series by MarauderLover7. Don't let the OPs username fool you, it's not some sappy ode to Sirius and Remus, although they feature prominently in the story. While long at times, I love the story and am invested in a few of the characters and how things are going to turn out for them. Basic plot without spoiling: Sirius decides to escape years before canon, and "kidnaps" Harry. The story has definitely slowed down but currently on the fourth installment, Intensity. Seems like we've gotten bi-weekly updates lately, but you have plenty to catch up on before you get to worrying about update rate. And I'd be willing to bet it doesn't appear like it's going to break your "no Draco/Snape/Voldemort slash" requirements
