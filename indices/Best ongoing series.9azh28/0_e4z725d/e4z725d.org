Lets see:

linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic): a decent Harry/Fleur from a new author who has a lot of support over on DLP. Doesn't portray infidelity as somehow acceptable, which is frankly staggering in the fandom.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): possibly the best world-building besides PotDK and the Skitterleap (my opinion) and the ultimate sub-version of the fandoms cliches.

linkffn(The Mind Arts): one of my top five displays of mind magic already, though with nearly three months of no updates I am beginning to see a direct parallel with Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived (almost the exact same stop point to).

linkffn(Victoria Potter): a revamp of the Alexandra Potter Series from the wordsmith that is taure. Just finished first year yesterday, but still not much in the way of overall plot.

linkffn(Grow Young With Me): possibly the best Harry/OC fic out there, and the author's tumblr shows she is still cracking away.

linkffn(Black Luminary): a pretty good world-building fic, though I am still working my way through this one myself.
