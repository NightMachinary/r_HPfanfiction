I would say it's a series and then a collected edition is collected edition. Like with comics. You may have a comic that's one story, but it's still released as a series of floppies. Is TV series not a series until it has multiple seasons?

And "multiple fics" reasoning is still flawed because it's split differently depending on the author. Some put every year in different fics, for example, some still have fully featured years, but all in one fic.
