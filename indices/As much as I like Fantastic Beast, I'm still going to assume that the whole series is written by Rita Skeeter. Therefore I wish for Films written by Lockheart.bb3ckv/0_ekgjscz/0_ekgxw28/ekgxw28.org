Not really the detective stuff. Heck I really added the last part as an afterthought... It's more of people WB wanted to add Dumbledore so I mentioned it. Like something familiar will make things more okay, which I believe is the biggest failing of Fantastic Beast. It tries to Hard to marry the series to HP by shoving a familiar character. Instead of the usual, It in the same world, let people speculate how it ties in.

Actually, I never liked Dumbledore in general. I prefer the world and culture and the parallels it has to our real world. I just think that part as after credits like marvel does.
