Adding Dumbledore was definitely a grab for the fans of HP who want to see who he was when he was younger. And yeah world and culture are very fun to explore with. Things like the American revolution and even darker shit like colonialism and it's fall over the last 100-150 years would be really interesting to see paralleled in the wizarding world.
