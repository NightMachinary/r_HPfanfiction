Yeah. I read the story of Ilvermory in Pottermore and wondered why it wasn't made into a movie instead. It has magic, love story adventure and furthermore a story of an abused girl who grew up into a hero. It was realeased after FB and I'm still wondering why not a good feminist story but realized that it's a colonized America and Isolt was stated to seven some tribes, so a white woman helping tribes of natives Americans would look bad so studios wouldn't want to be racist or something.
