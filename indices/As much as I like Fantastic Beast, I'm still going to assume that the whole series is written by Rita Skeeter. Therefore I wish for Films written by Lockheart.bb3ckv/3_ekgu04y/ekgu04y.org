Regarding the two Fantastic Beasts films, I think WB and JK Rowling went about it the wrong way. I mean, it's cool we're getting films that exist within the Wizarding World, but in my opinion, the Dumbledore/Grindelwald storyline should've been its own separate trilogy, and in between the release of the three films, do a standalone Fantastic Beasts film, and perhaps another film (that Rowling could create on her own) that further involves exploring the Wizarding World or aspects of it.

I only saw the first Fantastic Beasts movie, and I didn't like it all that much. It felt like two different storylines Rowling forced into one. She tried to make up for it by showing the Obscurial when Jacob saw it in Newt's briefcase but the marriage of it and Newt's escaped creatures wasn't harmonious. And then there's everything in Crimes of Grindelwald that mucked up canon even more after The Cursed Child debacle. It'll be interesting to see what the audience reception is of the third Fantastic Beasts movie. Since the second film is a hard-sell, I wonder what the turnout will be for Fantastic Beasts 3.
