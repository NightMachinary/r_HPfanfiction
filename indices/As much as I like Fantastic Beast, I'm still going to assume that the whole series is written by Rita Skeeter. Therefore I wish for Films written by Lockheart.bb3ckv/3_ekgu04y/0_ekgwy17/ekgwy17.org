True.. I was expecting exploratory of the world or mythos. But I do like the added beast and creatures, I just think they should have cut the Grindelwald part because he's not plot relevant. Like any character fits... In fact you can remove him freely and he obscurial the beasts and the oppressive nature of Salem people work well.. there's absolutely no need for an overt antagonist.

It's not a typical heroes journey. Infact it is the opposite of the prophesied journey of Harry. But they kinda semi forced it into a Harry mold when Newt clearly embodies a different view on masculinity. The emphasis is not heroism and bravery but empathy and fear. It's a good film to analyse but it feels that it tries too hard. Hence the Rite Skeeter view.

Like the premise of magical beast are free they have to get it. They encounter an obscurial along he way, Newt attempts to save the person since he failed to save the girl. It's a good contrast of the light side and the dark side of creatures and the idea that are they also beasts to be put down. The fact that newt "failed" to save the obscurial makes the story tragic and still meaningful without the Grindelwald sub plot. It all stands on it's own

gellert and the rest are unnecessary. I feel they tried to do so much that they failed to deliver. If they cut out the Grindelwald plot line, they could have gone to character development more. They could have reference the events in the next film which gives a kinda plot twist, it was Grindelwald's plan all along, you foiled thus you made a great enemy. If they really wanna tie it in.
