  None of the Muggle ideas utilised by wizards are really all that important to wizarding society.

I'd say that they must be important enough if they have no problem taking inspiration from Muggle creations. The camera, radio, Express, etc were deemed important enough for wizards to make use of on a regular basis, and they were all created after the Statute was signed.

EDIT: Adding onto this, the Hogwarts Express was established pre-1830s, eight centuries after Hogwarts students had been Flooing, Apparating, Portkeying, or using Muggle transport to get to Hogwarts, and thirteen decades after the Statute was signed. The fact that the Minister at the time went to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic_operation_to_acquire_the_Hogwarts_Express][such lengths to acquire the Express]] despite the fact that several purebloods resented the idea, I'm going to say that the Express is pretty important. The usual magical solutions failed or were inconvenient (missed Portkeys and Portkey-sickness), so they turned to Muggle inventions, found a solution and modified them. The Hogwarts Express is a relatively new tradition, sure, but still a tradition.
