This is a pretty weak argument, I think.

1. As far as we know, all the "Muggle" objects that wizards use are enchanted objects - they replicate the effect of a Muggle technology using magic, rather than literally using Muggle tech. So all their existence means is that Muggles have ideas that wizards sometimes like the look of. It doesn't say anything about the relative strength or utility of magic vs. technology as a medium for bringing those ideas to life.

2. None of the Muggle ideas utilised by wizards are really all that important to wizarding society. E.g. the sole purpose of the Hogwarts Express seems to be to provide the students with an opportunity to socialise. There are so many ways students could get to Hogwarts more efficiently using magical transport (e.g. Floo to Hogsmeade) yet they /choose/ the more inefficient method.
