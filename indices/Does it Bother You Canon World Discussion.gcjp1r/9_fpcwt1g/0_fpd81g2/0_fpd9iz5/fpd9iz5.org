I said a /bit/ more, because at least they acknowledge that magic has benefits whenever they mix magic and technology.

Here's my opinion on Mugglewank:

If you're gonna have the Muggles win or call a stalemate against the wizards, at least /try/ to make it realistic. Get the government to hire Squibs and wizards loyal to their cause and protect against magic. Have some scientist create a device that protects against mind-control. Have them use some secret MIB-like organization to Obliviate wizards with a 'flashy-thing' and restore memories that the wizards Obliviated/False Memory Charmed from Muggles that saw too much. Have them play 'Crouching moron, hidden badass' for /decades/ to lull wizards into even further complacency. Hell, even have aliens that like Muggles more than wizards come into play to help them out. /Anything/ but this "Gunz and nukez so wizards lose lol" rubbish. That would be a pyrrhic victory /at best/ on the Muggles' part.
