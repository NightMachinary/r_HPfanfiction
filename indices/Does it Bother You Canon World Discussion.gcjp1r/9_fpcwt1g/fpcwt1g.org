What bothers me more is that even in Wizardwank/"Wizards are better" fics, they still use (modified) Muggle inventions (Hogwarts Express, wireless, cameras, lifts, etc) and then turn around and say "Magic is better than technology" and "Technology can't override magic". You think the wizard world is better? Fine, that's alright. But if so, you need to /prove/ it, and not just lip-service it. Replace the Hogwarts Express with a Portkey station or something. Make the wireless something that can be tuned-in via wands. Replace the Knight Bus with interconnected Vanishing Cabinets that get you where you need to go.

For the record, I don't like Mugglewank either, but at least those fics are a bit more balanced. It's jarring to read some pureblood say that Muggles are useless, and then play a record on a gramophone.
