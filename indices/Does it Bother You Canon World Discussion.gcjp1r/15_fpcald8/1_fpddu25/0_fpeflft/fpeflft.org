OP asked what bothers me the most about canon. That Does. Okay, so, who all was killed to create each Crux in canon? The Diary would be myrtel warren. The ring, Tom Riddle Sr. The Cup, Hepzibah Smith. The Locket, some no name muggle tramp (okay). The Snake, Unknown. The Skull (by that I mean Harry Potter, except for the odd fact that Harry is the only horcrux with a Mark showing it's creation. Even the Snake, the other living one, doesn't have a mark.), presumably Lily Potter's death?

It's too broken up. Who the heck cares about the random muggle tramp? What stake does Voldemort have in Lily's death (snape asking her to be spared)? There's no Canon statement for weather the Cup or the Locket was made first, they switch depending on who you listen too. Notably the Wiki and Pottermore disagreeing there. -And no, Nagini was made Before Harry, in canon-. Strike that, apparently quite a few sources are wrong. You're right on the tramp, aswell, I'll correct that.

X---x---x----

-Sorry for all the Wrong, Wrong, Wrong with my earlier statements. I'm not going to take them down, because I'm a strong believer in archiving everything, even mistakes, but it's since been clearly stated with quotes from the books what is right. I'm undoubtedly a billion words into the Fanfiction, so what is Canon and what is Fanon, I can never remember, and having the major sources disagree is no help at all.
