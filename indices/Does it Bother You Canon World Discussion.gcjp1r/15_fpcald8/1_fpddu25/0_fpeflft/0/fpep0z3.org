  And no, Nagini was made Before Harry, in canon.

Nope:

  "'However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the intention of killing you.

  'He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcux with your death.

  'As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcux.'"

Half-Blood Prince, page 506

Presumably, the old muggle man was Frank Bryce, whom Voldemort murdered in the first chapter of Goblet of Fire, but it doesn't actually matter either way. Also, the Horcux in Harry's scar wasn't created deliberately and /wasn't fueled by a murder:/

  "'Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building.'"

  "'You were the seventh Horcux, Harry, the Horcux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived.'"
