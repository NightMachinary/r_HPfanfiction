She and the Baron both died in Albania: he murdered her, then killed himself.

  "'Then my mother fell ill - fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.

  Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.

  'He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.'

  'The /Baron?/ You mean-?'

  'The Bloody Baron, yes,' said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. 'When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence . . . as he should,' sure added bitterly.

  'And . . . and the diadem?'

  'It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.'

  'A hollow tree?' repeated Harry. 'What tree? Where was this?'

  'A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother's reach.'"
