Yeah I don't get it. Is the “skull” supposed to be Harry? Because that wasn't even an intentional horcrux. And the snake is last in canon. I don't think it was ever confirmed who the victim was, but I always assumed it was Bertha Jorkins, not “Mrs Bones”?

I've never liked this “mathematical” way of determining the “size” of Voldemort's soul either. With canon magic it would never be that concrete, and I see no reason to assume it works like that.
