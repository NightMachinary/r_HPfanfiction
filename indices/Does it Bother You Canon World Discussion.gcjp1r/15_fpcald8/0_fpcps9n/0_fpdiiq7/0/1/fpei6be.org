Everything below my note of “Fanon;” is Fanon. Headcanon. Would you like me to put in a dividing line, so that's easier to see? The Canon order is all over the place.

Sometimes it's Diary, Ring, Cup, Locket, Diadem, Snake, Harry.

Sometimes it's Diary, Ring, Locket, Cup, Diadem, Snake, Harry.

It's also sometimes Diary, Locket, Cup, Diadem, Ring, Snake, Harry.

Or Diary, Cup, Locket, Diadem, Ring, Snake, Harry.

And now I'm hearing back that apparently it's also, somewhere, Diary, Ring, Locket, Cum, Diadem, Harry, Sanke; but I don't where, I haven't seen that corroborated yet.

What I mean is, the Canon is All Over The Place. Do you want me to trust JKR's original statement, Pottermore, Wikipedia, the HP specific Wiki, JKR's more recent statements, Wizardingworld.com, or The-Leaky-Cauldron.org? Because NONE OF THEM AGREE!!!
