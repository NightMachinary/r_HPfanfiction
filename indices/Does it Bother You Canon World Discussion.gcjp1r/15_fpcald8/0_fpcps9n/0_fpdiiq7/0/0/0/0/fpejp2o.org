  "Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy's shell."

  "They moved Voldemort's body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Collin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him."

He was hit by his own killing curse. His body was fully intact, just like everybody else killed by the same curse. His body dissolving into ash was added into the movie to make it more cinematic and dramatic.

  I won't stop Believing It, because it's MY Headcanon, I can believe whatever I want; but I'll stop trying to argue it to you.

I don't care if it's your headcanon. I mean, I think it's dumb, don't get me wrong, but I don't /care./ I will, however, if you state it as a fact in a thread meant for discussing canon, call you out on the fact that it /isn't/ canon and has /no basis/ in canon.
