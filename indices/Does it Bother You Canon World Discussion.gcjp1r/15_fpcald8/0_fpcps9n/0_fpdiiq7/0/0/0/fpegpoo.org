I did use the worst examples from ‘reputable' sources. Pottermore IS reputable, right? Why do The-Leaky-Cauldron.org and Wizardingworld.com disagree on the order of the Crux's creation?

As for the 1/2 spit, thing. Well, how did Voldemort Die, at the end of Deathly Hollows? If you can answer me this, without saying “because Magic”, I'll drop the “he dissolved because nothing was tethering him to life anymore” argument. I won't stop Believing It, because it's my Headcanon, I can believe whatever I want; but I'll stop trying to argue it to you.
