Yeah, this guy is pretty much just wrong about everything. I'm actually wondering if it's based off some post canon announcements, because I honestly can't think of where else some of these ideas could be coming from, especially the thing about horcruxes forcing the user to give up some abstract part of themselves to make one.

And don't even get me started on the whole thing about Voldemort's soul splitting in perfect halves each time! Just the idea that Voldemort and Nagini each have /exactly/ 0.78125% of his original soul is so weirdly specific and utterly baseless in the actual canon that it's probably my least favourite piece of fanon in /any/ fandom.
