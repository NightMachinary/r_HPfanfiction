The Canon order and origin of the Horcrux's. I Hate It. I like my headcanon one more(tho' I would, wouldn't I?). There's no rhyme or reason for them being in the order they are, in canon, and three of the origins for the objects are stupid. The Locket was created by killing “a muggle tramp” according to JKR. The Diadem was in Albania of all places, despite Ravenclaw's daughter living around England her whole life, and her being the one who hid it, and the one who told Riddle where to find it; and The Snake used to be a Human? What? Why!?

X---x---x----

Canon; The Diary, (The Cup, The Locket), The Snake, The Ring, The Diadem, The Skull. In That Order. Depending on who you ask, sometimes it's The Locket and /then/ The Cup. Also, sometimes The Ring is the 2nd one created, and sometimes it's the 5th. And sometimes The Diadem is the 4th, and sometimes it's the 6th. I've not seen it as the 5th, yet, though...

Fanon; The Diary, The Ring, The Diadem, The Cup, The Locket, The Skull, The Snake. Or, another way, Love, Family, Acceptance, Beauty, Sanity, Corporeality, Cunning.

A girl that loved him and his ability to Love for 1/2 of his soul in the Diary, his father and any blood Family through the ability to have children for 1/4 in the Ring, his old orphanage matron and Acceptance by society for 1/8 in the Diadem, the last of the Hufflepuff line and his beautiful face for 1/16 in the Cup, an unknown human sacrifice as well as his Sanity for 1/32 in the Locket, the (death) of his prophesied defeater and his Corporeality for 1/64 in the Skull (although the Cloak got in the way of that ‘death'), and Mrs. Bones, and the last major opposition to him in the DMLE and his Cunning for 1/128 in the Snake.

(Interestingly, the Diary also latches onto ginny's love for harry. Then there's dumble's wanting to use the Ring to see his sister again, and the Locket drives you slowly insane.)

No Wonder he just evaporated with only 1/128th of a soul, once the tethers were gone. Nobody killed him, in the end. The snake died, and he went /poof/ and lost the little anti-tug-of-war with harry, and just /dissolved away/ without anyone doing anything to him.
