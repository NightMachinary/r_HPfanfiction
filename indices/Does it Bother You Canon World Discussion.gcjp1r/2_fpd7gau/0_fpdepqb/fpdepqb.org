Love Potions are sketchy as f**k! I simply deny most of it in my head, like them being so easy to get and used in a joking manner. Otherwise the whole world is ruined for me. I do like Tom Riddle being conceived through a love potion, but I like thinking the whole concept to be more like Dark Magic, of course the Gaunts would use it (and against a Muggle specially). I can not reconcile love potions being used by Hogwart's students with no consequences.
