They are basically a light-version of the Imperius Curse, just focused on a single task... and that is to love the person that they are keyed to.\\
Pretty cruel in my opinion. To love somebody you don't, and that guy/girl may take advantage of your state and basically rape you knowingly or unknowingly - and the potion will force you to feel nice just as the Imperius Curse makes the victim feel nice.

Slightly Off-topic: Yeah, the world of Harry Potter is the paradise of every sick fcuk out there. Let's be honest, the Death Eaters are the best example to show how flawed the Ministry of Magic and its whole system is. They fill a quarter of the Wizgamot and probably raped muggles as a ritual for their dark mark.
