Obliviate and Love Potions. The Harry Potter universe is a rapist's dream world and besides Voldy's backstory, this is never adressed. And even then, Merope is portrayed to be as much of a victim as Tom Riddle Senior. Hogwarts teaches how to brew Amortentia, the Twins are selling love potions that last 24 hours, Molly tells stories of how she used them to Hermione and Ginny like it's completely normal... This really bothers me.
