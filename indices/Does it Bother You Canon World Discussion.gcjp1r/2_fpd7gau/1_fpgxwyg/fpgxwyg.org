yeah, it's sickening. and don't forget polyjuice, which a second year can brew. it might be not your mind, but it's still your body.

wish it was used less in the books and it was taken as crime or at least dark, we could still have Romilda plot. she could just get expelled or something. actually, would be nice if some student got expelled in the series and it was for that. everyone's always talking about it but no one actually got expelled. besides Hagrid.
