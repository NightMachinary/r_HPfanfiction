I agree with this point. And honestly, it's not just mothers who would sacrifice their lives. What about spouses dying for each other? Or siblings? Or even close friends? I doubt Voldemort was the first ever wizard to say, “Step aside, I'm going to kill your loved one but I don't need to kill you.” Heck, even 13 year old Ron was willing to protect Harry with his life in PoA.
