He doesn't need to know the intricate details of exactly how electricity work, but should at least have rudimentary understanding of it similar to the average person ("some kind of energy that make things work" would suffice) and how it is harnessed (e.g. what an outlet is used for). He doesn't even know that much, though, and would probably be actively dangerous in a Muggle home unsupervised -- he knows just enough about Muggle devices to be able to mess things up badly, but not enough to know how to use things safely.
