I probably could to a Muggle, but I don't think I could to a Wizard.

I mean, I can read electrical diagrams and work with it, and stuff, but I can't explain it to a 5 year old, and I feel like trying to introduce a Wizard that's never known it, to it, would be kindof like that.

I'd probably end up going into a discussion about how it's “kind of like water” if I had to try. You can understand that a cup holds so much water, that this hose only lets you put so much through, so fast. “Electricity” works a “light” kind of how “water” turns a water wheel. It goes on through, and runs back into the “steam”. But it doesn't just Go Away, it continues. That's why there are two wires to a light. One for electricity In, the other Out. Does that make any sense?

Also, No, that's not how it works, Not Really. But it “kind of” makes sense to a 5 year old. Enough to understand that touching either wire will shock the heck out of you.
