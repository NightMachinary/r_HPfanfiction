A toilet isn't an artifact. Neither is a bathtub. Those are two things that Arthur mentions when he talks about his work in disenchantment.

His job has absolutely nothing to do with muggles.

His job is all about magical law enforcement and disenchanting things that muggles use, neither of which require any knowledge about muggles.

Arthur does not need to know how a car works. If a car starts flying and having a life of its own, it's Arthur's job to confiscate the car and disenchant it. That is it.

And Arthur is excellent at enchantment. That's why he's working where he is.
