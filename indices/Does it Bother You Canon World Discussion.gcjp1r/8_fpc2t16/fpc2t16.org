That Arthur Weasley is supposed to be an expert on Muggles but he is almost completely clueless about actual Muggle culture and is so bigoted he treats everything they say and do as "quaint" and/or "clever." Yeah, it's played for laughs in the movies, but even in the books he can't say (much less explain) electricity.
