I agree wholeheartedly with the curriculum basis. The whole story is from Harry's POV so we should know more about what the curriculum actually is; especially as a Muggle-raised kid! I would think there would have been a few points of â€˜oh, this is how wizards live.' At the end of HP, I felt like he knew like 10 spells and that's just sad. One of main pet peeves is that it felt to me that Harry was just so indifferent about learning magic.
