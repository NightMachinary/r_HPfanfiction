What bothers me a lot is the curriculum and its applications outside of school. I mean, we know that a lot of objects seems to be enchanted. There are protections around Hogwarts (I don't remember if the terms "wards" is canon). But where do they learn to do that in school?

Because if we observe canon, we have:

> Transfiguration which change the nature of things but doesn't particularly add any magical proprieties to it (apart failed transfiguration?).

> Herbology (so environment discovery and care, technically),

> Astronomy (which seems to be only about enjoying the night sky? While I understand the poetry of it, it doesn't seem to impact anything magical. Apart Divination?),

> History of Magic (so culture and learning of the past of the community. No magic involved),

> Potions (so mostly for "human" change? Maybe some potions can help with enchantment? Didn't see it in canon, I think?),

> Defense against the Dark Arts (which is for battle and pest control, for what we saw of it),

> Magical Creatures (also environment discovery and care),

> Arithmancy (I know that fanon like to improve it, but in canon, it is used for sorely for Divination. Why isn't it part of Divination, anyways, if it's its only use?)

> Divination (quite a controversy in it in canon, whether it can be real for anyone who doesn't have an affinity for it. But we have Astronomy and Arithmancy which seems to strengthen it, so it may be much more important than it seems, if it were for a decent teacher??)

> Muggle Studies (so discovery of another culture and maybe ways to adapt to it? Doesn't have many information on it, in canon)

> Ancient Runes (same as Arithmancy. This is what fanon use for enchantment. But then, in canon, this is just an ancient langage. As in Latin or Ancient Greek for us. Which is why an old children' book could be written in it and not be a magical item.)

> Charms (now that the most polyvalent one in canon. What is precisely Charms? Is it all the everyday magic? Is it also where they learn to enchant things? (after all, Animation charms on things are part of the exams) But if EVERYTHING is Charms, why not more hours of it? Is it that simple to learn??)

Anyways, I would have like more consistencies and precisions on every topics. Is enchantment Charms on objects? Even everlasting ones? What exacting is a Curse Breaker such as Bill? What skills does he need? I don't know, I just feel that it can be much more precise and thus immersive (well, fanfiction exists for a reason).
