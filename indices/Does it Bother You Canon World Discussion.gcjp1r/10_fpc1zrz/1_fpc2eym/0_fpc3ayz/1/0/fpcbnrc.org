Rowling does have her inconsistencies, but I feel like you are automatically taking "everything I haven't thought about/don't agree with/don't understand" as a "JK inconsistency" which is rather uncharitable. Especially considering that the arguments you're bringing up are themselves inconsistent - you can't claim that "the muggles forgot about the magicals" when there are known mixed muggle and magical communities and literally every year there are muggles that have magical kids and are inducted into [the knowledge of] the magical world that way.
