In the wiki about the SOS, it states that the PM is to keep magic a secret. After reading a bit more on it, it seems canon that the muggle and magical government are entirely separate. From the wording of the entry, it doesn't look like the PM is always informed either.

Also, if the SOS was implemented then the muggles forgot about the magicals. You can definitely secede if no one knows who you are and cannot enforce their laws upon you.

P.S. King Arthur was real in Harry Potter per Pottermore.

I don't know. It really is all just more JK inconsistency
