Sirius' case is not that simple. He 'confessed' to causing the death of the Potters, albeit he was hysterical at the time. There were multiple witnesses who 'saw' him blow up a street, causing the death of 13 people. So yes, they needed Pettigrew to provide evidence to counter those witnesses and his own out of context confession.
