Goblet of Fire, chapter 27 (Padfoot Returns):

  “All these absences of Barty Crouch's ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn't bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. ... It's not like Crouch. If he's ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I'll eat Buckbeak.”

  “D'you know Crouch, then?” said Harry.

  Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer.

  “Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban --- without a trial.”

  “What?” said Ron and Hermione together.

  “You're kidding!” said Harry.

  “No, I'm not,” said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. “Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?”

  And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against /suspects/.
