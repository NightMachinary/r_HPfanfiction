  The Glorious Revolution happened in 1688, the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy 1689. Coincidence? I don't think so!

That's been a headcanon of mine for a while now. They withdrew then, but others like those in Germany started to withdraw during the reformation. The French I don't quite know. But definitely after the Avignon papacy was ended. I just like the idea of the French wizards taking the "real historical center of Avignon and leaving the muggles with a scaled down and less impressive version.
