The Glorious Revolution happened in 1688, the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy 1689. Coincidence? I don't think so!

Also, when in the course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, then the new regime continues with using the old law unless some specifics acts are rejected. The same applies to the Magical government splitting into a separate unit from the Muggle one (considering they are actually separate which at least mostly seems to be the case).

Therefore, all previous English laws should be valid in the Magical UK as well.

Therefore, specifically, the Magna Charta (including the right of everybody to “the lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land”) and the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, should be part of the law of the Magical UK.

Moreover, every civilized nation (including all of Europe since the Ancient Rome, specifically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence][Wikipedia]] claims it was introduced to the Roman Law by the emperor [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninus_Pius][Antoninus Pius]] in the second century AD) holds that “/Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat/” (“Proof lies on him who asserts, not on him who denies.”), meaning in our case that the Ministry (through DMLE I guess) has to prove Sirius Black's guilt, never he would have to prove his innocence (also, prove of negation is impossible).

Therefore, never in the course of events, Albus Dumbledore (among other positions, Chief Warlock, which I assume to be the highest officer of the law in the Magical UK) needed Peter Pettigrew to be caught to prove Sirius' innocence. He could just anytime it pleased him come to the nearest Auror or any other appropriate Ministry official and ask (as Chief Warlock) for the protocols of the trial with Sirius Black. When they couldn't be found, Sirius Black would be immediately free, no other questions asked.

What the hell he was thinking?!
