  I don't think they consider themselves a department of the Muggle government

They were. But then the Monarchy wouldn't help during the witch burnings. So they hid themselves. So they most likely still are a part of the government. Hell, the Minister of Magic talks to the Prime Minister regularly. Not to mention that some sort of cooperation is required from the muggle side. The Obliviators are efficient, but I can't see them obliviating half the countryside when a wizard gets arrested while drunk and shouting all sorts of stuff. Rumors spread fast. And then there's the fact that the vast majority of the magical population don't exist on the muggle side. Or how muggleborn and half-bloods disappear for chunks of the year starting at 11 and potentially disappear forever at 17.

The magical side is the worst nightmare of bureaucrats.
