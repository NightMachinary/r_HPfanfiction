quidditch. omg, I hate that. not only is it a very boring plot, the actual sport is bad, because it really only matters who catches the snitch anyway. there would be so much... soooo much time to add some actual magic in the books if just quidditch wouldn't exist. more lessons, more adventures... I think I only remember a single charms lesson from book one. JK loved quidditch and it shows as many points in the story were made around it. from cursed brooms to rouge bludgers. but really, I could live without it.

more school related plots, yeah, Voldy is important but the whole series didn't read much "school". what is actually taught in arithmancy and what kind of student Harry actually is, because he looks like a slacker to me. but then he makes an E in potions. and pretty much aces DADA.

house rivalry.

using wands/spells just like guns with no real magical stuff to happen. so you have practical spells, like reparo or alohomora, but when they duel it's boring. the only duel that was magical was Dumbles vs Voldy. any other duel is just sparks that either hit or miss, then sparks sending back, the AK is just a light that kills instantly. sorry, but crucio is pretty exciting in comparison with others. I wish every duel was like Dumbles/Voldy.

a lot of stupid mistakes and decisions. and while I'm able to stomach the ones made by children, the escape of wormtail was the stupidest and most preventable thing. at least Snape was unconscious. oh, maybe he needed to be so it could happen. but shouldn't Lupin actually realize, oh, Snape just said I forgot my potion. and it's full moon. heeeey, maybe I should stay in the shack just in case ya'll.

the existence of Dumbledore as mentor. so... wouldn't it be kinda more exciting if the kids actually found every secret by themselves? this series didn't need an all knowing mentor. and anyway, he didn't share his secrets at all. the only thing Harry needed him for was for the pensieve memories. at least he didn't have to have god-like properties. it irks me too much that he was able to see through the invisibility cloak, while it was supposed to be an ultra cool cloak from Death.

I hate how everyone always turns their back on Harry. especially Ron (4th book) and Seamus (5th book), but he was hated by the whole school in more than one book. it just gets to the point of "eh, this again"
