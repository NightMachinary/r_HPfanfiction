Merlin, imagine if we had dueling instead and Harry would be in Gryffindor dueling team. would make so much more sense that he is good at spells. he didn't need quidditch at all, except escaping the dragon in the triwizard on a broom, and he was good on the broom even on his first day anyway. would also be nice if flying was a recurring lesson through the series and not being only one lesson. looks like no one rides broom except quidditch players. and I think even in canon the class is only for first years?
