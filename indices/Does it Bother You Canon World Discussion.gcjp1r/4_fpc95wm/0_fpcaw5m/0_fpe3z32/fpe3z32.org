Perhaps the traits are common enough that roughly one in four people will fit. We know quite few characters who could have gone either way, but it doesn't seem like everyone has a choice.

Considering that they're 11, there's far fewer hat stalls than their should be - my guess would be that the hat stalls are far less to do with someone who is hard to sort, but actually involve someone who doesn't fancy the hat's top choice. The hat could simply stop offering choices if it became too imbalanced. Before the hat, the founders chose from the cohort who they wanted to teach, but it's implied they never send a student away.

Simple human psychology explains why people would merge their behaviour towards their identified group. So my thought is that many end up acting like their house, because they are in it. If it doesn't happen that way, it's not as though there's an exit-test.
