How sorting works. There is no way the houses can all be evenly divided. There could easily be a year where there is twice as much Gryffindors as Slytherin. In real British boarding schools, I'm pretty sure houses are evenly split to avoid this, but that doesn't apply when it's a hat deciding. Imbalanced housing would make things unfair when it comes to points.

And what magic tells the Goblet peoples names and makes it official to the point that they can sign a contract? If Harry decided to go by Harrison Brown all his life, then would the contract not count? If it's based on some magical birth certificate then that brings an issue since Harry's would say Harry James Potter not just Harry Potter. And what if some other Wizard was named Harry Potter?

What if Harry decided to change his name, thus erasing "Harry Potter" from the Goblets "mind".

Same thing also applies to the map, which also doesn't use middle names if people put their names into some magic system which makes it "official".

Seriously how do names work?
