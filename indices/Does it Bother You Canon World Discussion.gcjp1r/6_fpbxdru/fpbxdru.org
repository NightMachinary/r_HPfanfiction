In that vein, supposedly Hogsmeade is the only purely magical settlement in the UK but typical wizards literally don't know what muggles look like? (The outfit of that guy at the quidditch world cup)

Also, there are "magical" and "muggle" ways to do things, yet magic isn't allowed until you're 17? So 15 year old boys buy sets of razors and shaving cream etc but then two years later they can just do a quick depilatory charm? Why would you forbid all the obvious convenience of magic for so long?

What are wizards doing about the threat of obliviate crime? I feel like in a world where you can be obliviated by anybody an enormous part of your life would have to be leaving yourself reminders.

Why do people have jobs? It takes ten minutes to make a house, you can enter any grocery store, duplicate the food, and apparate out. There's no scarcity in the wizarding world, so why do people ever do anything they don't enjoy?
