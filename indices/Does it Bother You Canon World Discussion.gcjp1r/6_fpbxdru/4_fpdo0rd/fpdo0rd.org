I believe that a lot wizards are out of touch with the muggle world even if they live in a muggle community. For example, the Weasleys live in a muggle village but they're never really shown interacting with the muggle community. They can Apparate or Floo directly to Diagon Alley/St. Mungo/Hogsmeade.

Also why are muggle children not allowed to drive a car even though cars are so convenient and pretty much most people own one? The magic can be quite dangerous even for adults so you would definitely not want it in the hands of inexperienced children.

I think that Obliviation is a threat since Tom Riddle uses it on several occasions to cover his tracks. Also Lockhart is using it to steal credit for other people's actions. How the Ministry or even the average Wizard handle this threat is not discussed in the books.

Finally, a reasonably competent Wizard could probably live decently as a Muggle. But in the books, most of the magical stores sell things such as wands, potion ingredients, magical artifacts, things that most people would not be able to create. Also don't forget that conjuring spells are NEWT level Transfigurations.
