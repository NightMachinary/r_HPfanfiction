  supposedly Hogsmeade is the only purely magical settlement in the UK but typical wizards literally don't know what muggles look like? (The outfit of that guy at the quidditch world cup)
#+end_quote

Remember that even counts Diagon Alley as "not purely magical". From this we can hypothesize if it has contact with or is hidden within a muggle settlement it doesn't count. But Diagon Alley is still extremely isolated. Most wizards don't go there through muggle London. They apparate or use the floo. I believe most wizard settlements function like this.

  So 15 year old boys buy sets of razors and shaving cream etc but then two years later they can just do a quick depilatory charm? Why would you forbid all the obvious convenience of magic for so long?
#+end_quote

I don't think they buy shaving cream or Gillette razors. I would say they have old fashioned razors and potions/lotions for shaving. And why wouldn't they forbid you from using magic? If an adult wizard can end up with an heavy animal on top of him because he mispronounced a spell, teenage boys would be ripping their faces off while trying to shave with a wand.

  What are wizards doing about the threat of obliviate crime? I feel like in a world where you can be obliviated by anybody an enormous part of your life would have to be leaving yourself reminders.
#+end_quote

I would argue that Obliviate is not Wingardium Leviosa. So it is not an everyday threat. And even if it was, there is a very simple explanation for why people don't leave reminders or whatever. People are stupid in general. By your logic why would anyone believe that a Nigerian prince left them money? Why would people give their credit card information to people they don't know? Don't they know there are scammers out there? Real life makes no sense!

  Why do people have jobs? It takes ten minutes to make a house, you can enter any grocery store, duplicate the food, and apparate out. There's no scarcity in the wizarding world, so why do people ever do anything they don't enjoy?
#+end_quote

As far as I know it works only on simple stuff. And even then you have to be competent. You can't just duplicate a functioning race broom for example. The wood is no problem but what makes it fly can't be duplicated. Resources are plenty but craftsmanship is still valuable. There are still stuff that need to be done manually by people. And for those things there is an economy. And things fall into order around that. I don't recall anything about there being shops for mundane stuff like cabbages in the entire seven books. Which leads me to assume anything bought or sold has /some/ quality that makes it valuable.
