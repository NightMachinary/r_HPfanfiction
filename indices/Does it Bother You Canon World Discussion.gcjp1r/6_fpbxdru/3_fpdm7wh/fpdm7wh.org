  In that vein, supposedly Hogsmeade is the only purely magical settlement in the UK but typical wizards literally don't know what muggles look like? (The outfit of that guy at the quidditch world cup)

In fairness, it seems like most Wizards live in semi-seclusion, based on the fact that the Weasleys, Lovegoods, and Malfoys, three families in /vastly/ different economic positions, all have houses either on the outskirts of or entirely outside muggle towns.

As for currency, while most competent witches and wizards wouldn't need it to live day to day, it makes sense that there would be certain specialist items or services that you'd have to pay for if you couldn't make/perform them yourself.
