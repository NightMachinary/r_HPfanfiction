Everything is contradictory in the Potter Universe. I love the Harry Potter universe but I feel like Rowling just didn't care to give much thought on how her world worked.

Say that they couldn't detect underage magic from households with adult magic users it doesn't discount why magicals are so confused by muggles if there aren't any magical only cities.

300 years passed since the separation so why isn't the population much larger? Even if you take into account the Blood War (Grindelwald's war didn't have much of an impact in Britain) then the population should still be much larger than it is.

If they can set a taboo on certain words then why not on the unforgivable incantations?
