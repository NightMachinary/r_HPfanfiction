Why not? I don't doubt that wizards have excellent ways to grow crops and raise animals with herbology being a core class. Even before the statute, wizards enjoyed far better lifespans and quality of life. I doubt that would have held if wizards had relied predominantly on inconsistent muggle food distribution pre-statute. It took technology for muggles to catch up to a higher quality of life (and even now, muggle lifespans are still dozens of years shorter). What reason would wizards have to switch to relying on muggles?

And if the Weasleys are any indication, they have magic farms with chickens to lay eggs.
