Yup. Phoenix trilogy along with Post Tenebras Lux and Sin & Vice are my go to SSHG fics.

I LOVE how grangerous filled so much of what Hermione and Severus were doing for the war effort while Harry was busy being moody and lovesick (can you tell I'm a bit biased?). So much of it has become my headcanon. I'm a little iffier on how she dealt with Sympathetic magic in the last one, and I always feel magical creature animagi go a bit too far, but she does it well enough and the rest of the story is so good that I'm willing to give her a pass on both counts.
