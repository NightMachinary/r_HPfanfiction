I enjoyed this one because it takes a while to figure out what exactly is going on, and I love the concept of the Dowry boxes. It's a part of a series of "books", the second of which is WIP, appears abandoned. Marriage law. linkffn(3553046).

I can't find this on FF.N, but Like the Muggles Do is pretty hilarious fic that I think shows how Hermione and Snape could come to work together. [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=9540&i=1]]

This one is a Hermione/Snape, Harry/Draco fic, I think it showed up in the Harry wiki list. Basically it's SuperInteresting!Hermione and Harry who are special virgins and consequently get awesome powers because of it. Linkffn(4776976)

linkffn(2267793) I like how complicated this fic is, particularly the subplot with Draco. Not all choices are easy or right.
