Not a huge fan of this pairing, but linkffn(Rebuilding) must be mentioned if only because of the number of reviews, and Colubrina being amazing. It starts out pretty much purely Hermione/Draco but ends up following a lot of Harry and Hermione's year for the two years following the war. Theo's arc is especially well done in my opinion. It's not completed yet, but it updates almost every day and Colubrina is pretty good about finishing her fics.

Edit: I completely missed linkffn(Green Girl by Colubrina) which is probably my favorite Slytherin AU ever. Hermione is sorted into Slytherin and they accept her right away, deciding that house trumps blood. Hermione supports Draco through all his feuds with Harry and Ron and we get to see the Slytherin side to the initiation of the taunts, which actually manages to not make the Slytherins seem evil, while still keeping it similar to what we see in canon. Hermione's relationship to Snape as a mentor/father figure is absolutely perfect, there's a scene in sixth year between them that I have reread countless times. Hermione doesn't let anyone get away with harming Draco for very long, and this fic features the most Slytherin way of taking down Voldemort that I have ever read.
