#+begin_quote
  A man who looked very much like Draco Malfoy walked into Hermione's office, brandishing a piece of parchment and a pitch-perfect insult. That would have been right before she grabbed him by the front of his robes and dragged him inside, silently thanking her husband, the inventors of Polyjuice potion, and anyone else who might have had a hand in making her secret fantasy come to life for Valentine's Day. That also would have been one hour and fifteen minutes ago.7,000 words. Draco/Hermione, background Ron/Hermione. NC-17. Explicit infidelity. Written for dysfuncentine, a comm that deliberately wanted dysfunctional relationships for Valentine's Day. Keep that in mind when reading. ;) February 2011.
