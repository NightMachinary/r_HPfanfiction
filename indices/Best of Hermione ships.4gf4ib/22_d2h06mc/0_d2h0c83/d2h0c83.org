linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258)

Fairly long, with a pretty slow build that makes the pairing very believable. There's time travel in this, and it's handled in a way I haven't really seen before and though was really cool. The characters are pretty interesting. It's decently well written, and definitely enjoyable to read.
