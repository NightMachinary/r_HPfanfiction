linkffn(6662663) is a lovely take on DH + the beginnings of the epilogue - while the dialogue is awkward at times, early on, the author seems to have found their groove rather quickly, and it's the first R/Hr and first HP fanfiction I read, so I'll always cherish that.

linkffn(7671626) is another AU take on DH - while the canon deviates rather significantly at some points, it's nothing super insane, and in that, this story finds its greatest footing.

linkffn(10948460) is a Shell Cottage/post-Manor outtake, and these kinds of stories are some of my absolute favorites. This one in particular is nice because it's not too rushed, just a conversation that hints at something greater.
