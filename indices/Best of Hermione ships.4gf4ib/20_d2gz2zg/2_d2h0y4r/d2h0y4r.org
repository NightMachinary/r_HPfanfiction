linkffn(Stop All the Clocks by theelderwand1) and its sequel linkffn(Children's Cusade by theelderwand1). Takes place after Harry is killed in the forest by Bellatrix Lestrange. I have some problems with the former, but Children's Crusade is very, very good.

linkffn(What if the Boy Hadn't Lived?). Same premise as the above, but with different execution.

linkffn(Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live by OtterAndTerrier) has some brilliant fucked-up-ness.

linkffn(Apple Crumble, Apple Cart) has some great writing and good drama, though I felt that Hermione's bitchiness is this fic was overdone.

linkffn(After the End) is a classic that can fit under either the Harry/Ginny or the Ron/Hermione category as both pairings are equally important. This fic has some of the best writing I've ever read.
