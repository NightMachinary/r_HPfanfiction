I wasn't sure if I should add this story here - the story is still in progress, and while there are hints to R/Hr, the author hasn't decided yet which way the story is going to go, romance-wise. Should I have waited for Best of Ron?

I like Slytherin!Ron. He's not portrayed as a jerk who likes to pick on muggleborns and halfbloods. I like how he interacts with his siblings. And throwing in the seer!ability adds something new to the mix. The writing is also pretty good - it's not stilted.
