As far as I'm concerned Colubrina is queen of this pairing.

linkffn(Pygmalion by Colubrina) AU where Tom Riddle disappeared in the middle of his seventh year and reappeared in the middle of Hermione's seventh year. He restarts his quest to gain followers with many of our favorite characters.

linkffn(A Big Ball of Wibbly-Wobbly by Colubrina) no mentions of Doctor Who, despite what the title would lead you to believe. Completely in character Hermione and Voldemort, who somehow still manage to fall for each other.
