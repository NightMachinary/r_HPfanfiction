linkffn(Tied for Last)

Has exactly the sort of messed up relationship you would expect with this pairing, but the author acknowledges that and it doesn't feel as if it's being presented as healthy. Additionally, it deals with the time travel issue in definitely one of the better ways I've seen. It gets weird toward the end, but I think it sticks the landing. The majority of the fic is beautifully written, with characters that really come to life.
