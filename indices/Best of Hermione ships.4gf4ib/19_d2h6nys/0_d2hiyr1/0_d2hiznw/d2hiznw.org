  The summer following fifth year brings some unexpected changes to Hermione's life. Embarking on a new path to a new future and her desire to rescue Harry, whether he wants to be rescued or not (from his apparent and unpleasant destiny) her life changes in ways she had never expected; with people she had never imagined. (Mary-Sue) Hermione/multi. femslash and extreme naughtiness.
