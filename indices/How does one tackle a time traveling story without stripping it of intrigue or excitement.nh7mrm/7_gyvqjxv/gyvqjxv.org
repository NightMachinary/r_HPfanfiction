Things being changed as a butterfly affect, due to Harry or whoever going back in time, when they change the past.

Harry doesn't remember every single thing that happened at Hogwarts. It's very unrealistic to have the time traveler remember every specific thing that had happened.

How does he interact with the characters from the past? Does he become a different person, (changed name/changed look) or has he taken over the Harry Potter from the past?

If he's older, and ends up in a younger version of his past self, it'll be difficult for him to get to accept and know Hermione and Ron, he'll realize just how young they are, wanting to keep them safe for as long as possible, etc.

Does he tell anyone? If so, who? And how much does he share with people, if he does share anything with others?

How much does he try to change? Or does he try to ignore it? If he tries to ignore it, things should change anyway, just because he's there.

Things not always working out for Harry, just because he knows things. Again, the Butterfly Affect should be in play here, where unexpected changes happens because Harry time traveled.
