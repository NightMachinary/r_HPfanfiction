Well I think part of it is sticking to the established laws of time travel in harry potter, which is that it all already happened before you went back because its a sort of loop I guess. So if it hasn't happened yet, then it wont happen at all, as thats kind of how its works. Maybe your way of making it interesting is by having one of the characters create a new form of time travel that works a different way then the time turners. They its experimental and the reader has to spend the story trying to understand how it works and the new laws of this form of time travel, while also trying to accomplish the goals that you listed above?
