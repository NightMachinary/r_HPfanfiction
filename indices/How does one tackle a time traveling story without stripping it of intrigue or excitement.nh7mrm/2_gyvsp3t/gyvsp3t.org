The previous comments already gave good advices, but another solution (that seems to be less popular than the one previously told) is to create a Time Traveler antagonist. The motivations of this antagonist don't really matter (a Death Eater who want Voldemort to win, a previous friend of Harry who think he is a worse threat than Voldemort . . .), the important thing is that this person has similar informations than Harry, and can also work into modifying the timeline (to his advantage) :

- Harry wants to expose Quirell at the start of the year? Quirell either fail to show up at the start of the year, or doesn't have Voldemort with him.
- Warning about the Basilisk? The Chamber is sealed by a passoword, or the Basilisk has been moved, or maybe even already killed.
- Try to exonerate Sirius? Impossible without Pettigrew, and Scabber has dissapeared/ been stolen right before the start of the year.

With this new scenario, Harry would have to identify his time traveling opponent, and keep trying to modify (or at least maintain) the timeline while blocking his enemy's attempt to do the same.
