A lot of rehashes ignore just how incredibly fucking difficult keeping the timeline preserved would actually be.

Aside from the fact that the time traveller is half a decade or more older than they were, they'll never remember everything and they can't be everywhere, so if they make a tiny change (eg. Harry stops to pick up Susan Bones' books and says something suspicious because he's an adult trying to pretend to be a child, so she contacts her aunt about him) that can spiral out massively. All it takes is one tiny stepping-on-a-butterfly mistake to change things.

Like, if nothing else, imagine how hard it would be not to treat the people around you like you do in the future? How often you'd have to resist the urge to reference something that hadn't happened yet, or make an old in-joke the other person hasn't heard yet?

So, yeah. If I was gonna write a time-travel canon-rehash, that's how I'd make it interesting. The action wouldn't be the rehashed events, it'd be the efforts the time-traveller goes to to make sure those events still happened.
