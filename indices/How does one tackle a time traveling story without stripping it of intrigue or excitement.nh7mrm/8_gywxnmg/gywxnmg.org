The very fact of going back and fixing everything should automatically create intrigue, as the only things any time-traveller would have would be knowledge of a future that no longer exists and whatever skills they had before taking the trip. Depending on when the trip back in time happens will help determine a lot of the story.

For example, you have Harry going back in time the moment Voldemort hits him with the AK in the forest (which is a setup I've seen before), compared to a 100 year old Harry purposefully going back in time. Both would have very different skill sets and 'future knowledge' they could apply.

Obviously the difficulty with doing this is it essentially means writing the story from scratch, which is probably why many time travel stories rely on the 'not changing too much to preserve future knowledge' trope so much.
