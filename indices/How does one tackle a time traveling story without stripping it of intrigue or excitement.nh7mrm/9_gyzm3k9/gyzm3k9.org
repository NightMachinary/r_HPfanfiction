Fundamentally, you produce intrigue and excitement in a time-traveling story the same way you produce intrigue and excitement in any other kind of story: careful and judicious control of the author-to-reader flow of information and the management of stakes.

For some reason, time-travel fanfiction authors seem to nigh-unanimously forget that dramatic irony even exists, which is particularly egregious considering just how conducive time-travel is to creating dramatic irony (eg, in a Peggy Sue fic: choosing to be the time traveler a different character who won't be privy to a/some critical piece(s) of plot-relevant information, choosing a point in the story f/ which the time traveler travels back f/ where they weren't privy to a/some critical piece(s) of plot-relevant information, &c). Crucially, I think trying to produce dramatic irony can serve as a gateway to being more adept at choosing certain pieces of information to hide f/ the reader and characters for dramatic and plot-driving effect.

Managing stakes is comparatively simple: (1) no easy wins and (2) the more significant the obstacle, the more important it is for the crucial step that allows for defeating the obstacle to be entangled w/ a character's personal growth.

Of/c, the undergirding backdrop that affects all of this in a time-travel story is the choice of time-travel mechanics. Whatever set of mechanics you choose to use, make sure to comprehensively chart out to/from when, to/from where, and to/from which timelines^{⟨if you're using a set of mechanics that involves multiple timelines⟩} all people/objects/information move according to your set of time-travel mechanics. This should include any relevant emotions-based and/or esoteric mechanics---soft magic is no excuse for sloppy or inconsistent worldbuilding. If nothing else, don't use the basic Peggy Sue formula. Just don't do it. At best, it let's an alternate universe fic masquerade as being less divergent f/ canon than it actually is. The vast, vast majority of the time, all it does is let the protagonist repeat their life on easy mode.
