Exactly, what's the point of going back in time if you're not going to change anything? I'd rather read a unique storyline where things change and thus Voldemort's plans change accordingly so they can't predict what's coming because then I, the reader, can't predict what's coming either. Reading about them following the motions of canon up through Voldemort's resurrection just isn't very appealing for me, but I've read fics that do that. There's some intrigue in how the time traveler keeps or reveals their secrets, but that's not always enough to keep me interested.
