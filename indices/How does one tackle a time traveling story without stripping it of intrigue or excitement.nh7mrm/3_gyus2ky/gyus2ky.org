For me, one of the most boring elements of time-travel fix-its is when the characters stick as close to the original timeline as possible and it's just a regurgitation of canon with kids acting like all knowing adults. If you know the events that are going to happen and when, it's a pretty boring read. If you really want to keep the major “bad” events the same, you could change things up by Harry bring in a different House and exploring his experience through the lens of a non-Gryffindor with different friends.

To create excitement and intrigue, I'd rather you do change things - like expose Quirrel early, or do something about the basilisk, or exonerate Sirius early as a jumping off point and then explore the ramifications of those actions and how it changes the events going forward. Then the intrigue and excitement is there because I don't know what's going to happen and now there's a unique story to read.

I personally hate time travel fix-its where they do things like leave Sirius in Azkaban to “preserve the timeline” - it's just cruel and too much of an “I'm the all-knowing time traveler so I get to make all the decisions in everyone's lives” attitude.
