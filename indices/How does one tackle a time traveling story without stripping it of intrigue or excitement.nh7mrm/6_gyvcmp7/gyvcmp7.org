Well maybe instead of Harry trying to fix things, we could have Harry trying NOT to fix things.

Imagine a grown up Harry, married with kids, a happy family, a successful career, money stability, and everything is going well... UNTIL it's not. Now some people can call him selfish but what if he just wanted his future not to change ? What if he changed something and his wife and kids disappeared ? This Harry (chief Auror etc... knows that time is dangerous) would try really hard to keep things the way they were ( maybe he'd chicken out and actually save Sirius, Remus, Tonks etc.. I don't know it depends on how you want to write it )

But keeping things the way they were is much more harder than trying to change them because :

After more than 30 years, he honestly doesn't remember all the details and every single little thing could make a difference (butterfly effect). If he unintentionally did something wrong and HE IS bound to because a 40 year old man isn't the same as an 11 kid, it could range from an overpowered thing to him not asking about something because he already knew it. Anyway too many things can happen.

So yeah if you want some intrigue but at the same time struggle to stray away from Canon this would be interesting. But to be honest you're bound to add some unexpected twist anyway.
