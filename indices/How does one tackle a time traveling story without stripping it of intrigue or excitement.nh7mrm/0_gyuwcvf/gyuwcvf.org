To maintain intrigue and excitement, I think you have to chose what the intrigue and excitement of your story is.

Is Harry trying to fix everything that went wrong for him, then he better have a realistic plan. And that plan better fail, and spectacularly.

Is Harry accidentally in the past or not trying to change anything too far ahead. Instead just trying to fix things as they come? Okay well he's a different person now, he will be making minor changes every day and they will snowball larger. Eventually his foreknowledge will be worth only a bit, and a new Harry with new allies and new enemies will have to face somewhat new issues.

Obv these arnt universal solutions, but realise that excitement usually comes from rising stakes. Intrigue comes from the main character not knowing the answers, or sometimes from the reader not knowing the answers.
