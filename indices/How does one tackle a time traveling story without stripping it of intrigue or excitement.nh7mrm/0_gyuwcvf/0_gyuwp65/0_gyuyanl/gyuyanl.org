This is purely off the cuff, so don't judge it harshly.

Harry has a want and a need. Evil Harry wants to work for or with Voldemort. He needs(a win, allies, to feel comfortable in who he is, to feel in control).

So make Harry want impossible, he tries to help Voldemort, but every time he gets a chance he fails it, or doesn't realize it's his chance. And these mess ups are making his timeline knowledge for frayed. Now Voldemort thinks Harry knows too much. He's still trying to do bad things, but hes losing more and more control. But hes also realizes that he's been sort of falling into allies or followers. Or something else has been changing in his life. Enough that he realizes that he can be happier being his own dark lord, not beholden to Voldy.

Or maybe something completely opposite, he gets what he wants but lost what he needed. He's now Voldys man, but has noone, has no control. Something to that effect.

Hope this helps.
