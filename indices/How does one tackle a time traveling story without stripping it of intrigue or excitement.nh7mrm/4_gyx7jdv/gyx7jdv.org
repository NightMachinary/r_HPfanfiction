You make it so either nobody believes him (because bro you're 11 years old stfu) or you change the timeline- minor changes, such as Quirell isn't the DADA teacher, or he isn't Voldemort's host; Snape actually is a quintuple agent, and is actually helping Voldemort; Sirius, with his time in Azkaban, became crazy enough that he actually *does* want to kill Harry; etc.

If you tweak even just a few elements of canon, you could get a wonderful time travel story.
