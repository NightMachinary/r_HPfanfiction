Harry would be really good at that job. He has natural empathy, cares about people deeply, is very strict against wrongdoers and has a great sense of fairness. All of which are crucial when dealing with kids. He wouldn't let them walk all over him but would reach out to them and allow them to have the childhood he never had. It clicks. I agree.

Also JKR was stupid when she created the wizarding world, it just doesn't work. You can't have a functioning modern society without some form of pre-school. By 11 most kids are pretty formed already. If they were purely home-schooled, they would be totally unsuited for a school environment by the time they go to Hogwarts. Who would have taught them to operate in a regulated and hierarchical structure like Hogwarts is? Especially with magic, when your ails and wants can be fixed with a wave of your parent's wands?
