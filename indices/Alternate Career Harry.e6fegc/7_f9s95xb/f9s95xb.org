There were some fine examples of strange jobs for Harry after Hogwarts, though most of them were for comedic purposes: school bus driver, PI, wandcrafter etc.

Some of the things I think Harry would be suited for are definitely: a pre-school teacher or working with young kids (due to his upbringing); a journalist would fit his personality better in some ways than being an auror (and he would have that being better than Rita thing going on for him, motivation+++); I can see him being a stay-at-home-parent (same reason as the pre-school teacher); he could probably be a Gordon Ramsay-like potioneer (chef) if he had proper mentoring (he was stellar in Slughorn class with good directions from a book, imagine what he could do with proper guidance)...

Those are just off the top of my head. I'm sure we could find dozens more that would suit Harry if we really thought about it well enough.
