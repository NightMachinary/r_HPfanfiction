There are a lot of magical phenomena (that are either rare to just straight impossible) that happen to/around Harry that he could very much want to get to the bottom of.

• He reflected the Killing Curse at one, thus proving the Killing Curse is not unblockable. He could research ways to block it with the Unspeakables.

• Priori Incantatum, though not unexplained he way want to further delve into the thing that very much saved his ass from Voldemort multiple times.

• He came back from the dead! Don't wanna look any further into that?

• Hell, he may have been over Sirius's death but researching the Veil would still be in character. There's so much for Unspeakable Harry to do.
