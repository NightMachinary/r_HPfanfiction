I think Hermione has the better academic understanding of magic but sometimes lacks the intuitive or creative approach that might be necessary for that kind of work.

Harry has the opposite problem of seemingly having an intuitive feel for powerful or unusual magic but no real interest in the theoretical side of things.

If Harry got more serious about it or Hermione through her adventures got better at thinking outside the box then either of them would probably be great unspeakables.
