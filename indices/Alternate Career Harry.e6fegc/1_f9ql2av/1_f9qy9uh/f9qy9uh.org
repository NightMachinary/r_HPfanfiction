I read an unspeakable Harry one, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was (and I'm not sure if I finished it). Basically, he picked the DoM because he could hide there easier (and had his pick of departments at the ministry).

I remember him feeling out of place because he had like, zero qualifications for the job... but he ended up being valuable because of his, like, situational awareness. Imagine a bunch of single-minded fanon Ravenclaws poking at things that go boom, and put harry in there to go "uhh, that's about 2sec away from going boom".
