To be real though, when you really look into it there isn't that much on how the Wizarding World actually functions (the sort of stuff you'd want JK Rowling to tweet out after the fact instead of how wizards and witches shit on the floor before toilets).

Where do they get food? What jobs are their besides the Ministry and Gringotts? Snape is a Potions Master, did he learn that at Hogwarts or is there some form of higher education? Same for every other professor, where did they master their crafts?
