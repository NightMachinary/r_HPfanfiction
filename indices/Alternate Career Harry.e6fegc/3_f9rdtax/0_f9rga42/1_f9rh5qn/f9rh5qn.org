For the master thing, apparently there's a UK-US Disconnect, where a master is often just a high level teacher. Just as a Chemistry Teacher might also be called the Chemistry Master, so to is the Potions Master just the guy who teaches potions at Hogwarts.

American fans don't have this background and assume there must be some higher level of credentialing, and there might be, but N.E.W.T.s actually seem to be standard post secondary education with O.W.L.s constituting the general.
