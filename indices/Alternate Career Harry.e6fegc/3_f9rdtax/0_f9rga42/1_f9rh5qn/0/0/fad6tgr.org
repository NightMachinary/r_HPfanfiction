There are 40 people in Harry's year. Wizards live an average of 137.75 years according to JKR. That means in Magical Britain there are 5510 witches and wizards approximately. Assuming that because of the war Harry's cohort was especially small and the following years were a baby boom to balance it, and assuming that some significant segment of the population doesn't go to Hogwarts you get a year size of maybe 100... 150 tops. We're talking a maximum population of 20,000 or so Wizards.

Given the size of each class it might not even be feasible for a university as we understand it to operate. You can take fairly high level positions like Auror and Healer and Curse Breaker with just N.E.W.T.s after all so the economic incentive is weaker. Either apprenticeships are more common or what post Hogwarts education does exist is international and draws on the worldwide Wizarding population rather than just Britain's. (The world supposedly only has 7 proper wizarding schools anyway.)
