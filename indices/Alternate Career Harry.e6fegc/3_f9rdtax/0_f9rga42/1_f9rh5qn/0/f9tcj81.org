I don't know if that was true in the 90s, but it's not now. We would call the person in charge of the chemistry department 'the head of Chemistry'.

I, as a British reader, also expect that there is a higher level of education, because the basic schooling system lines up completely with a secondary school (years 1-5, with O.W.L. exams are analogous to years 7-11, with GCSE exams at the end), and sixth form (years 6-7 with N.E.W.T.s is like years 12-13 with A levels). Quite often, sixth forms are linked with a secondary school, and are usually on the same site.

Obviously in the real world, the next thing after sixth form is university, so I want to believe that there's some kind of magical equivalent, or at least another way of getting a magical degree level qualification.
