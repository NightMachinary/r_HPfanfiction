I get the idea of the person who teaches getting a title as soon as they start teaching a subject, but does that mean they don't qualify to at all (beyond NEWTS). It's the same premise of only being a Professor should you get a teaching position. I assumed that such a qualification may be an optional part of applying for a job at Hogwarts (hence: Lockhart and Umbridge) but can you imagine? Do they just base it on life experience?
