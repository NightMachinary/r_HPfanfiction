After the shit he's been put through my headcanon is that Harry probably would want nothing to do with the ministry and would do some sort of freelance work.

That poses a problem as Rowling only elaborates on a handful of careers, mostly in the ministry. The other implied jobs are small times merchants teachers, or specialists for Gringotts, and these seem to have a lower status than a Ministry job, judging by the disappointment when Tom Riddle went into the private sector.
