After the battle Harry just felt numb. Sure he smiled in the victory talks, cried during the memorials and went through the motions but it was just that.

Ginny could tell he wasn't truly there for her. She had a huge row over his lack of feelings anymore. Hermione had rattled on about shell shock and ptsd or something. All Harry knew was he felt numb to everything.

~~~~~~~~~~

It was during a visit to Hagrid where Harry felt awake again for the first time. The kind soul of Hagrid had seen the darkened eyes of Harry and tried to cheer him up the only way he knew how.

Harry rode Buckbeak over the forest feeling somewhat awake again. Not truly alive but mostly awake. It wasn't until he swooped down into the forest and accidentally ran into an acromantula that he woke up fully.

The short battle had lite the fire behind his eyes for the first time in what felt like years.

"Se√±or, we have found someone who will handle the lethifold problem for us! His rates are highly reasonable and can be here soon."

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Harry swung the Sword of Gryffindor from Buckbeaks back as they charged into the lethifold swarm. Patronus bursting from his left hand wand, sword in the other and sticking charm holding him in place. Buckbeak and Harry bellowed their war cries as they stormed forward.

Harry Potter had found his true lifes calling. Breaking the ranks of dark creatures throughout the world. Protecting those who cannot fend for themselves. If the occasional aspiring Dark Lord happened to be in his way they didn't stay that way for long.
