In the latest story from Annerb's Armistice series, Harry chooses to work as an Unspeakable instead of an Auror. Don't know if he'll last there. I've written him as a builder and Ive read a couple where is a treasure hunter/curse breaker. THat certainly fits his criteria of needing/wanting adventure and avoiding a boring job
