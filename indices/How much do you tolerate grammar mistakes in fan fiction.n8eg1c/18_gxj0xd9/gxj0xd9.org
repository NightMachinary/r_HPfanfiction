I was only about a B level in terms of grammar in high school(my biggest problem is punctuation) and if I can tell at a glance that the grammar is terrible then I'm not reading. If they constantly misspell things and it sounds like a toddler's speech when spoke out loud, I'm not reading. If they don't use actual paragraphs and the text is in one big block, I'm not reading.
