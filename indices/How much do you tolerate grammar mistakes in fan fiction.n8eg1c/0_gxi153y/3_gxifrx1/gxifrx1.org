I want to speak to the large vocabulary thing, because this is often overlooked, and there is a way to do it right. If you want to show off your vocab as a writer, excellent. I love learning new words and playing with them. The best place to use them, however, is outside of dialogue. Use them to describe the scene, the battle, whatever. Your characters can be intelligent without using big words that distract from the story. Intelligent characters can still very much just say “bloody hell” and “Harry, you dolt” when things go wrong without transforming into morons.
