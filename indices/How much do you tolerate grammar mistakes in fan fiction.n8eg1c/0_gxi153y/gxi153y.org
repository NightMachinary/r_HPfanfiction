I used to fairly laid back, because we are amateurs, and doing this for fun. And of course, English isn't everyone's first language.

However, after I began writing my own story, and trying extremely hard to get things right, and taking care with my prose, I've gotten much less tolerant. I'm kind of sad, because it has led me to dropping very interesting stories, because of lousy grammar/prose.

I find it's the simple things that annoy me the most. There/their/they're. Your/you're. The wrong use of apostrophe in general.

And using laying, instead of lying, irks me to no end. If Harry's laying on the bed, I'm expecting some eggs!

Tense hopping is a major problem for me. Take care of your s's and d's! Reading a story which keeps switching from past tense to present, drives me up the walls.

Overuse of the ellipsis. There's an author whose constant/compulsive use of the ellipsis is infuriating. They use it like six times in every paragraph. It makes the characters sound like invalids who cannot form a coherent thoughts.

And finally, using words incorrectly. Essentially, not knowing what a word means, and shoving it into a sentence, trying to make a character sound intelligent and well read, and wielding a large vocabulary, by having them use complex words. It almost always fails, and looks even worse when the words aren't correct.
