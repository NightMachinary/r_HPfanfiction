Yes, I wholeheartedly agree on everything you said. While I don't expect for perfect English, I do expect authors to at least use the free version of Grammarly (or some other grammar checker) for missed punctuation and other minor grammar errors. Having a peer-editor would also be beneficial.

Never thought I would hate seeing misplacement of commas.

I also hate when authors don't use a thesaurus and use the same adjective for everything.
