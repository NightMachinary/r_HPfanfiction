Yeah, I have the same problem, but it's perfectly ok to have errors while you're still in the creative process. I do the same thing when I'm writing my papers for school and stuff. I frankly don't know how some people write papers the night before it's due because it takes me 1-2 days of re-reading it to catch all my mistakes before submission.
