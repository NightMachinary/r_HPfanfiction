Spell check in Microsoft word. Like how do these authors ignore the red and blue squiggly lines when they write?

Anytime I see them while I'm writing my own fic (currently writing as we speak) it's like an instant target that I can't pull my eyes away from. I can't move on until I have fixed that spelling and grammar.
