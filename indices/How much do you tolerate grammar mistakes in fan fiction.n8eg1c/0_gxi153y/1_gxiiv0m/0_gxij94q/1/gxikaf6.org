Luckily for myself though, I happen to know a professional creative writer who agreed to beta my story for me. Honestly, my writing really is not bad for someone who never has done creative writing before, but after he got through the first bit of the first chapter, and I made the changes he suggested, it really does read so much better.

It was really humbling realizing that, simultaneously, I was better at creative writing than I thought I would be AND worse than I thought I would be. Quite the conundrum.
