I guess having a professional helping out, allows you to actually know what it is you're doing. I don't know most of the technical terms, or any of that. I mean, I'm good at grammar, but mostly, I just write in a manner that I find pleasing and I pay special attention to rhythm and flow. I hate stilted prose.
