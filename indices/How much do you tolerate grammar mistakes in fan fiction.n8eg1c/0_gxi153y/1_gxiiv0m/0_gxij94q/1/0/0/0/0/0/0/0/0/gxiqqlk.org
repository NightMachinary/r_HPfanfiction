To preface, I'm going fairly AU here, because I'm trying to avoid all the things that fanfiction and canon has beaten to death. As such, Harry's parents were not the good guys. They were both death eaters (won't say how that happened, you'll have to read). They were conspiring to overthrow voldemort and take his place, and were caught for it. When caught and they were killed, they managed to neuter voldemort by using blood magic to seal a large portion of voldemorts power causing him to go into hiding.

The story begins in year 4, with a harry potter that is deeply unpopular in both sides of the political isle. Hated by many for having death eater parents, and hated by death eater families for them trying to mutiny against voldemort. Voldemort wants harry dead due to his parents mutiny, but also needs to take him alive as Harry's blood is the key to reversing the seal on voldemorts magic.

The story will span years 4-6 at Hogwarts and then will move into an open warfare period which will be the final portion of the book. Unlike canon and fanon, Slytherin isn't the only house with death eater families, they are spread out fairly evenly between all houses (always found it odd that canon/fanon made only slytherins death eaters) and all 4 houses also have non death eater families. Harry was sorted into Slytherin and has a very unique mentor.

Harry will be paired with daphne greengrass, and it will be a semi-slow burn. Harry will be very, very intelligent, and also gifted (I have an interesting take on how he is gifted!), but he will /not/ be phenominal cosmic power harry.

Edit:: There will be /no/ horcruxes or prophesies. Voldemort is not immortal, and as such, he will be smarter and more dangerous as he won't be as complacent as an immortal voldemort
