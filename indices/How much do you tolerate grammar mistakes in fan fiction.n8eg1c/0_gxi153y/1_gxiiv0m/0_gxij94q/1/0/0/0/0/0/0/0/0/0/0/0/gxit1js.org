I might. Usually however, I'm too vanilla to read stories where Harry & Co, or his parents are Death Eaters. I just have a problem with wrapping my head around it. Dark/Evil Harry is another thing I simply can't do.

Mind you, I'm absolutely not saying the stories are bad, it's just that they are not a part of my preferences.

Anyway, I hope your writing goes well!
