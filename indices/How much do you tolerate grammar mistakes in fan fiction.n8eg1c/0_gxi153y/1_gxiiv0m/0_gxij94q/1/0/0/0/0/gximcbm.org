Oh yeah I had to Google some of the terms his correction notes in word used and ended up having a small English self study session haha. I am lucky to have a professional writer for a beta for sure. The only downside to it is that the beta process will take longer, as he is doing this for me for free, and as such, I have to work around his schedule for when he has time to go through my work. I'm deffinetly not complaining though, having quality help like that is not common and will make my story so much better
