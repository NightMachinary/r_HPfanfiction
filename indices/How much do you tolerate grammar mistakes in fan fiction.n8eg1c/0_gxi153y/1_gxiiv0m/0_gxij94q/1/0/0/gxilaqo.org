Oh I read a lot. A lot of my mistakes we're switching between passive voice and active voice, using both blonde and blond, which, while technically correct in both cases, blond should be used over blonde in more currant literature.

My other problem was setting up for description without getting descriptive in some cases. An example of what I mean would be I could say a character grimmaced, but I would fail to show how that grimmaced look would look. Things like that.

Most of my mistakes were little intricacies that an experienced writer would know and an inexperienced writer would not know. And making those corrections honestly didn't have me editing the story very much at all, but it really did improve the quality of the the material in question. Edit: and they were all corrections that a program like word would absolutely not catch for you so they are mistakes that would be easy to make for someone who doesn't write for a living.
