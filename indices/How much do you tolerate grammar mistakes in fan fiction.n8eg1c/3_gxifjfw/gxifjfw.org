(I'm lumping together spelling and grammar, since usually an issue with one comes with the other tagging along)

Ehhh I'm not sure where on the spectrum I fall. I filter for English-only fics so I do expect them to be written in English with an understanding of English spelling and grammar (even if there's regional differences, those are fine!). An individual error is one thing, consistent errors is another.

I will leave a story if they consistently spell canon names wrong - Alistair, Delores, Lilly, Severous, and Luscious are examples I've run into often enough over the years to remember. Same goes for other canon terms - grab your book or find a copy online to see how it was spelled, look it up on the wiki even.

Editing is a thing, having another person help edit helps a ton. If I'm actually noticing the grammar issues, that means I'm being mentally pulled out of what I'm reading, so if it happens often then I'm not having a good time.
