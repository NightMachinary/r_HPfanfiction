It depends on the story itself. I once finished a story where the author mixed up "its" and "it's" 90% of the time because the plot was entertaining. Helps to skim too.

Fanfic has made me a lot more tolerant of grammar and spelling mistakes when I was such a grammar nazi before. "As long as the message is conveyed and it's not distracting enough" became my policy.

As a an ESL speaker, I learned English from reading/writing long before listening/speaking so the types of errors I see are not obvious to a lot of native speakers.
