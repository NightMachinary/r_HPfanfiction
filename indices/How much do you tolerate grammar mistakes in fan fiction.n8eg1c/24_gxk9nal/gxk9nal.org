For me capitalization isnt a big deal, alot of typos (especially with names) is a deal breaker, but the biggest deal breaker for me is mainly when dialogue is written poorly, characters speaking in a way that nobody ever speaks, for example, a character that never abreviates things like; i am/i'm, i have/i've etc.
