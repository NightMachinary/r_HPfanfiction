Personally, there's some things that annoy me situationally that I can ignore if the story is engaging enough. How much minor to moderate spelling and grammar errors irritate me is pretty dependent on whether the story catches my attention and is formatted in a fashion that doesn't cause me to immediately rage quit from it.
