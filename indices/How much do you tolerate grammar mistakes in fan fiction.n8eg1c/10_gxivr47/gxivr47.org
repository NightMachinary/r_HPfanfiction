Honestly I'm much more intolerant if it seems the errors stem from sloppy writing and not reading things through than actual mistakes.

Things such as leaving letters out, missing punctuation or a lack of capitalisation drive me up the wall. I also tend to drop fics written in a way that makes it seem translated - the pacing, word order and even expressions tend to be understandable yet very jarring or irksome to read.
