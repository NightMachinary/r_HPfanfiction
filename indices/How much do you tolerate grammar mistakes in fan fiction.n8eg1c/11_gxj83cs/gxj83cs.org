Im fairly laid back, because we're not professional writers at all.

However, I do have a limit.

Using words incorrectly, consistently spelling words wrong, lots of punctuation and grammar mistakes, and capitalization of random words. And when I say this, I mean that it happens many, many, MANY times over the chapter.

It's understandable if English isn't the author's first language, I just can't read the story without wanting to copy it onto a google doc and fix all the grammar mistakes.
