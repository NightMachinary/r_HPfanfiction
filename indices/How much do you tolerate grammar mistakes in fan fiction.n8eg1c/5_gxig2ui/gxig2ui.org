Just wanted to add that if there are glaringly obvious grammatical mistakes in the summary alone, this does not bode well for the story (based on experience). I automatically skip these stories, unfortunately.

There were only 2 stories I've ever read that had really good grammar in the story, but fell short in the summary. A weird experience, to be honest.
