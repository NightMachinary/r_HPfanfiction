I find that it can occasionally be distracting, partly because when I encounter it I feel the need to correct it like I'm an English teacher or something. Though the funny thing is, I'm more likely to drop a story when the dialogue uses ' ' as opposed to " ". I can't really explain why, other than I'm just really pedantic over which style of speech mark is used.
