Depends on the mistakes. Genuine mistakes between two words that could be a simple mistake (in fact just saw this morning using exuberant instead of exorbitant) or the occasional error, fine, no big deal. Willing to deal with more if the story itself is good.

If the story is good, I am willing to even let slide the occasional more egregious error. There was a story I was enjoying despite the constant incorrect use of listing of subjects in a sentence. For instance, they kept saying things like "I and Neville went to ..." or "I, Hermione and Ron ducked ....". These hurt my brain reading but the story was good enough that I just mentally forced myself to read it correctly.

I also do this when people keep switching tenses. That one really annoys me. I dislike present tense to begin with ("Harry goes to the door. He opens it to find Hermione standing there where she then ..."). It just feels wrong narratives speaking. But it is worse when they swap between present and past within the same paragraph. Had one story I gave up on because it was constantly doing this. "Harry goes into the room. He saw Ron sitting there and played some Chess with him. Harry gets up to talk to to Hermione ...." it was unreadable.
