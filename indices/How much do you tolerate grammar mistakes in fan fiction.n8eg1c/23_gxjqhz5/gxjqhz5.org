The inability to punctuate dialogue properly - using /either system/, I'm not fussy (lol) - drives me up the wall. It's three very basic rules for 95% of cases and like... I want to say that half of the thousand+ stories I have saved in calibre managed to fuck it up.

And that's sad.

But the sadder part is that my copies of Harry Potter did it wrong too, and are a bastardised conglomeration of British (single quote) and American (punctuation inside) that you'll only find in these books. Go Canada! (Or Scholastic, maybe - they /did/ fix it in later books and swapped to fully American style.)
