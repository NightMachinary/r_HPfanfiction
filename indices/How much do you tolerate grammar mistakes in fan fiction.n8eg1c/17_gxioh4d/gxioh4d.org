Not too much. To date, the fic with the most grammar/spelling mistakes that I've been able to tolerate is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25467943?view_full_work=true][Pride of a Graveyard Flower]]. The plot is just too interesting to drop.

And even then, it's mostly gotten a lot better after the first few chapters (the author apparently re-edited a lot).

I used to tolerate a lot, especially because the PJO fandom at its height had SO MUCH terrible writing but some fanfic plots that were actually hella intriguing, and I was younger so fanfics in general seemed cool enough for me to ignore that part of it. But now I'm older, and can't deal with it at all.
