I think it depends on the mistake. For instance, I can barely use a comma and regularly engage in run-on sentences, so I don't judge that too harshly. On the other hand, things like using the wrong your, the wrong their, etc are too fundamentally incorrect for me to be able to read without it bothering me. I think the worst is replacing words with their homophones though, those keep me up at night...
