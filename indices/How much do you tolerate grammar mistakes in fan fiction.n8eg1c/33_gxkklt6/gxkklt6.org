I'm pretty pedantic about spotting errors, which means that they tend to stand out to me in a way that disrupts the flow of my reading. However, if it's not too bad - if I don't have to regularly stop and decipher what it was actually saying - and the plot is good, I often go through and do a full proofread of the story (if the author wants that kind of thing, which many of them seem to). I have several stories I'm following that way, including one where I'm an official beta reader, and I'm one of the maintainers for the Nightmares of Futures Past eBook.

So, it's not really a hard and fast rule about which types of errors I allow; it's "How much does this interfere with my reading experience?"
