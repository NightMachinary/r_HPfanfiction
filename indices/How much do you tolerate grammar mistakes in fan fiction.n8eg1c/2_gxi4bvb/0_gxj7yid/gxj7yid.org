Bad formatting is my biggest fan fiction pet peeve.

I'm pretty farsighted, so my eyesight for reading isn't amazing. If a story is formatted in a way that there are huge blocks of text or, even worse, no paragraphs at all, I just can't stick with it. It's practically physically painful trying to read it.
