I don't mind a few minor mistakes, or even the occasional big one. No matter how much you proofread, you're probably going to miss a few things.

But there are some that will make me drop a fic instantly once I realize they will be recurring problems. The main ones are:

- Giant blocks of text that should be broken into multiple paragraphs, especially when there's more than one speaker in a paragraph.
- Mixing tenses.
- Complete disregard for periods, commas, and other punctuation.
