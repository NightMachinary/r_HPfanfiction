Yeah, I hate the tense changing one, but the othera I'll tolerate. There was this one fantastic story which had one major problem. The author had an extremely lacking sense of comma usage. Like I said, it was great, but it really highlighted why commas are so necessary in English. I would see sentences which made no sense and then I'd have to backtrack and try to add commas to sorta straighten out the sentence.
