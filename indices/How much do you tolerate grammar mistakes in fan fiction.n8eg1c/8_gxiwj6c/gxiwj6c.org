I would like to second practically everything everyone else has said. However, if a fic has fine grammar but stilted dialogue, I immediately peace out. Something like:

« Hi Hermione, how are you? »

« I'm good Harry, how are you? »

« Good. Do you want to go to the library? »

« I would love to go to the library. »

And henceforth. Idk dialogue is big for me, especially when it sucks the life out of any characters and flattens their repertoire
