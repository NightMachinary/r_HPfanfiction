It depends on what I'm reading, really. If I'm reading a crack fic, humor or just a general feel good type of thing then it doesn't bother me when there are 2-3 mistakes per chapter (when a chapter is between 7-10k that is). But if it's a fic that is novel-like (that being good plot, range of emotions, good side characters, multiple arcs) then it really throws me off. I can tolerate a couple mistakes here and there throughout the whole thing, maybe 5 to 10? Around that number, but that is only if the mistakes are obviously just that - a mistake. By that I mean if the author has consistently spelled a word correctly but then you come by it again and it's misspelled. It's fine, it happens. Especially when they don't have a beta reader/editor.

But if the author keeps messing up the same word over and over again then, I'm sorry, but I'm dipping. The worst is when they have multiple words that they fuck up constantly.
