There's one I absolutely hate, can make me leave a fic in seconds. Not being able to write a fucking name right.

We all know of Luscious the fabulous death eater, but there are many more! Hermonie the greedy is a strong contender for dumber misnamed character, but one recently came to my attention and pissed me off a lot. Kreature the beast, you have 3 seconds to guess what the fuck is a Kreature.

That's right, Kreacher. How many times have I read an author not check the fucking name and write it Kreature? Too many. It pisses me off. It takes literally 30 seconds to check the writing on google, and you'll save hundreds of people a headache, so why are there still Kreatures out there? It makes me mad! Fucking crazy!
