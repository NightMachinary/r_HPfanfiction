It honestly kills me when a writer does not put the correct tense for third person or for first person. It's grammatically incorrect, I cannot read this because it's wrong.

Like it infuriates me because if you're a natural English speaker you know what this is. You know how English words are spoken and what their meanings are. It's also really annoying because even if you don't really know how it should be formatted it's such an easy and quick Google search or even a YouTube video, it's like I don't understand why people don't realize the difference between first person and third person.

Not only that but most people learned this in school, so like I don't understand how people can't remember this as well.

I don't know, sorry for my rant but it just bugs the hell out of me.

I can understand minor spelling mistakes or maybe a , wasn't supposed to be where it was put or whatever, but to have the narration of the story so wrong that you can barely read it and is illegible is just ridiculous to me.

I also find it as lazy writing, I mean like come on, you couldn't even be bothered to understand what past and present tense means. I just don't get it.

I hope I didn't offend too many people with this rant, but I just can't take it anymore!
