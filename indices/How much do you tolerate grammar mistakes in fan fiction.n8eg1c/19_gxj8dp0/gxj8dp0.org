I tolerate wrong homophones and incorrect use of apostrophes more often than foreign expressions (little Harry lives in Surrey, England, not Louisiana, USA, so he doesn't take out the trash) and overall textual mistakes e.g. forgetting quotation marks, lines from different characters in the same paragraph and excessive use of elipses.

Elipses annoy me so much because people replace full stops with them... Sometimes even commas... Or any other punctuation that isn't an interrogation or an exclamation point... It takes conviction away from everything the characters say... Just write like a normal person... This irritates me even more when the line is supposed to be delivered with assertion...

Anyway, everything sort of irks me, but I think structural mistakes are more off-putting than bad grammar.
