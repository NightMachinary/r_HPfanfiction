  In a world where there are no such threats as dark lords or pompous wizards rising to power anymore, Harry's life becomes a senseless mess that drags on without anything meaningful. To suppress this ache for adventure, he decides to find himself a roommate. It's only a pleasant surprise when after a tiring search he finally gets in contact with Draco Malfoy - a peculiar young boy whom he had met two times before. The first time at that specific clothing shop in Diagon and the second during the Yule Ball of 1994. The first time Harry had learned that Draco is much smarter than he shows, the second that he is much sneakier than he shows (and also looks stunning in blue) and the third that there is so much more to learn about Draco Malfoy that such brief encounters simply can't give him any justice. So with that thought in mind, Harry starts of an adventure unlike any other - a journey for a roommate, a friend and someone who might as well become his love.
