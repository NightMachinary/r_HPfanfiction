The number of obsessed wizards could be very high tbf lol. Also keep in mind that it's a lot easier for wizards to get to the quidditch world cup than it is for us to get to the FIFA world cup.

Tbh I don't believe there is any possible way for magic to be kept secret if there is 180 million magicals in the world + non-human magical beings.

And if there are 1.8 million in the isles alone, that has /huge/ implications for the number of people working in the Ministry or going to Hogwarts or Diagon Alley or whatever. Just doesn't add up.
