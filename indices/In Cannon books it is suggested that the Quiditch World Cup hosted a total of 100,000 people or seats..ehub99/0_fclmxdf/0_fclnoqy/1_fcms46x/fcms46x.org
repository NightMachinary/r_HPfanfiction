Given instantaneous, possibly FTL travel is practically free (portkeys) and magic can solve a lot of problems without money, I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that construction, logistics and administrative costs aren't that high and hence ticket prices wouldn't be exorbitant as well. The only reason to price QWC tickets expensively would be to earn money.

Also, could there be smaller wizarding private schools throughout the UK? Or even like neighbourhood or community schools? Hogwarts would only be the most prominent one.
