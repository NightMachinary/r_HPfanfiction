I think the "Reality" of it is that there are multiple schools and the potters set the will to allow harry to go to Hogwarts while Dumbledore wanted to protect him. rich people also go to Hogwarts and muggleborns get in on some sort of government subside.

But then you look at pottermore and what I said is false... so who ,knows.
