I thought it was stated in the books that parents have the option to send their child to whatever school they wanted but most British parents sent their kids to Hogwarts which means that all the kids at Hogwarts represent all of the 11-17 year olds in Britain. (GOF?)

Is well known that JKR isn't a numbers person ðŸ˜‚

My head canon is that Hogwarts was much larger than we ever see in canon because we only see what's important to the immediate story of Harry. So there were more students and more teachers than the books show.
