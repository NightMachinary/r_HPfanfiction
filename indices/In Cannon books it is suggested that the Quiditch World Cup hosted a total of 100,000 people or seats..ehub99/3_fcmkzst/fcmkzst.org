I have no clue where your getting your numbers (since there is not a stadium in the world that can hold a million people let alone three)but attendance at a single event is a stadium capacity issue not a population issue.

The largest single attendance at an event is probably the indy 500 which has like 250k seats. By your logic since Indianapolis can host the biggest attendance the that would mean it is the biggest city in America and it would mean America would have the highest population in the world.

There's plenty of college stadiums like Alabama and clemson that could fit their city's population in their stadium multiple times over.

Let's do a real world example. The Los Angeles rams averaged 25 thousand in attendance with a city population of 4 million. Green bay averaged 75 thousand. Using that ratio, green bay must have a population of 12 million. (It's actual population is 100 thousand btw)
