It's an interesting comparison but the strength of it suffers when you consider 3 other aspects.

1. While soccer is certainly the world's most popular sport, as far as we know quidditch is the ONLY major sport in the wizarding world. As such, quidditch is arguably more popular than soccer by a large margin on a per capita basis.

2. Wizards/witches can travel instantly via apparition and portkeys and the floo network and so on... Which means it's far easier for wizarding kind to attend the world cup of quidditch than muggles to attend the world cup of soccer.

3. Wizarding population is not going to be spread in the same manor across the globe as muggles for multiple reasons, including the forementioned instant travel ability.

All these things lead to the implication that the wizarding world IS smaller than your estimates you can up with. No other sport competition in terms of popularity. Much easier travel, regardless of money. And a population spread that really plays no role in the matter.
