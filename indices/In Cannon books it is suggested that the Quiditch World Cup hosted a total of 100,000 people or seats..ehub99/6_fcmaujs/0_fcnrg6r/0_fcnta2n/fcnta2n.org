Yes there are other sports but Quadpot is a realatively minor sport compared to quidditch from what is known about it really only being well known in the U.S. And Dueling is well known world-wide but also is quite different being it's primary one on one and fairly limited in scope. The point remains that the Wizarding world's sporting variety in terms of sports with vast global reach seems significantly more limited and really only Quidditch could be considered a world-wide major sport.
