I believe the term you're looking for is 'genderbender' but i might be wrong. Searching for fem!Harry will just give you all the fics with Harry being born female.

Anyway, here you go:

linkffn(9928419) unfinished IIRC, also heavy on the Lady Black stuff but otherwise enjoyable.

linkffn(11862560) Probably the best fic that considers the psychological impacts of a gender switch on an abused child. It can drag on occasionally and the linguistic stuff can get annoying but if you want a story about character development, Voldemort being an actual person instead of a caricature of evil and a well thought out wizarding society, this is definitely the right fic.

I also found this list on ff.net | I haven't read most of the stuff listed so you'll have to wade through it yourself: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-and-the-genderbender/107439/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]]
