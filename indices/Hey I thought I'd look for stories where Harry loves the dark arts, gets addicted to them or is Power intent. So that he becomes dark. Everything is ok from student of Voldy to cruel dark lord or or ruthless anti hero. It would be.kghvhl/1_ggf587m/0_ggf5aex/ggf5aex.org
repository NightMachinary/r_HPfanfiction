#+begin_quote
  Ten years after Voldemort's death, Harry and Ginny's marriage hits the rocks. When he's kicked out of the house one night, he decides to stay at the old Black home at Grimmauld Place, now part of a museum about the war years. Harry's always had some personal problems -- like having the remnants of Voldemort's horcruxes stuck in his head -- but that night, everything seems to catch up with him, and it sends him down a dark path.
