This is tagged discussion and you seem to be asking the community as to our thoughts on the pairing, not recommendations.

Assuming I'm right, my thoughts are that there is an age difference that makes the pairing implausible, short of contrivances such as time travel, skipping ahead a few decades, etc.

Edit: We also know little of the character so even if there wasn't an age difference, I'm not sure there is much to discuss.
