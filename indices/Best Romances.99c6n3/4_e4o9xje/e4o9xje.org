I have a few long complete non-Harry romance recs, in case you're in the mood.

linkffn(12181042) - Percy/Audrey + war + smuggling muggle-borns

linkffn(5715586) - again, Percy/Audrey + war + smuggling muggle-borns, but a different take by a different author (remember that Audrey's basically a blank slate)

linkffn(7562379) - Ron/Hermione + retrieving Hermione's parents + drama

linkffn(7024025) - Ron/Luna, Ron/Hermione, and Harry/Hermione + drama and more drama

linkffn(5048412) - Ron/Pansy + drama and more drama + confusion

linkffn(2812800) - Ron/Hermione + constant unwilling time-traveling (and the loops it caused)

linkffn(1869902) - Ron/Hermione + drama + time-traveling son
