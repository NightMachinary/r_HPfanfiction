My headcanon is that muggleborns don't have parents that can easily reverse what their kids fuck up so it's easier to just ban them all, especially since even magical born kids aren't going to be responsible enough. BUT once they've passed OWLs, they should be allowed to do magic since they could leave school and not lose their wand, meani they must be considered adults or trained enough by then to be responsible.
