I've always thought of it more as.... doing magic, and being part of magic? So, I guess the way I've always thought of it is that casting a spell is an active act of doing magic. You have to have the intent, the ability, know what you're doing, etc. Doing it in that way is thus illegal for many of the reasons other people have mentioned.

But, for example, small kids who have bursts of accidental magic don't get in trouble, because the intent isn't really the same and they aren't really "doing" the magic, the magic is just breaking through. In a similar, but technically different vein, I've always figured the brooms are already enchanted. I suppose you need some sort of magical "touch" to make them work (actually - I don't know! Could squibs ride magical brooms? Muggles?) so, you're not actually doing magic, you're just a part of magic that's already been done. Same as if your parents are doing magic around you or to you that's not illegal, but you doing magic specifically underage is.

I guess another less complicated way is: the trace is on the wand (is this canon or have I just made that up?) so magic that's done without a wand isn't technically illegal. That doesn't really explain the Dobby thing... But that never made sense to me, unless it's more specifically that it happened in a muggle household. Like, other households have house elves and have no problems. To be honest, I haven't read that book in a loooong time, so I could be forgetting something.

Those are just my two cents!
