I presume that, the ability to play Quidditch or Quadpot on them and the way they are used for transport aside, it's because brooms as used by children are something in-between a toy and a bike (the one with pedals, not one that uses petrol); in fact, there's probably someone out there who'd already compared Quidditch to weird cricket on bikes with elements from some other sports added in.

Given that, and the fact that there's things like /toy brooms/ so clearly brooms aren't deemed too bad to be used by children (toy brooms are just slowed and have a height limit for flight), and the fact that flying lessons are part of the first year curriculum so kids returning home from Hogwarts are expected to be capable enough to no longer need those precautions, it makes sense for their use not to be banned. Since breaking the stature of secrecy by flying in view of muggles is another thing entirely (because, you know, it's about doing anything clearly magical where and when muggles can see it), I feel that the potential for doing it does not count as a reason enough to ban it wholesale.

As for the wands in that equation, well ... I do agree it is quite likely there just to put a limit on Harry. That said, I think one could justify the existence of that particular ban with the fact that for one, spells can be dangerous in weird ways so it's better for underage wizards not to practice them in places without adult wizards or witches---and I presume parents could ask for an exception to be made due to need to practice, like “on that-and-that day, the magic performed in the vicinity of that underage wizard/witch will be ignored because they need to practice [insert this-or-that spell from Hogwarts curriculum]”, the same way Arthur got permission to use floo on Privet Drive 4 even though it was a muggle place and thus shouldn't have one (I have no doubt that with corrupted enough officials, a lifetime exception for purebloods is a possibility, so yes, unfair it could be)---and then for two, I think it's that people think that underage wizards and witches do not, strictly speaking, need wands to live because they are still in education and thus don't need them for work---and they'd need wands for their work after passing their NEWTs and then getting hired, hence permission, but they don't need wands for word after merely OWLs because they do not yet work /unless/ they've been expelled and thus have to work with whatever skills they have which would give when wand rights but only if they aren't still continuing their education---and finally for three, considering how the kids tend to be behave at Hogwarts I really wouldn't be surprised if the higher-ups just saw them as irresponsible kids, or at least most of them, and thus did not really want to entertain the notion of said kids being free to use magic.
