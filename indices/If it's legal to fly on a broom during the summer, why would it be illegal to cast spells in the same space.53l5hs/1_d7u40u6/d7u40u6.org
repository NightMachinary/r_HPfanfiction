I could invent any number of reasons. Perhaps improperly done spells require special training to undo, and Hogwarts professors get training in that. Perhaps Hogwarts has enchantments on it that help children control their magic with a wand, and it's a lot more dangerous for them to use a wand outside the school. Maybe brooms normally come with anti-Muggle spells on them.

On the other hand, it doesn't need to be consistent, only plausible. Quidditch is a national obsession. Quidditch-related lobbies must be the strongest in the nation. So it makes sense from that perspective that brooms would get special treatment. By comparison, wands are an omnipresent tool, but people only spend a few galleons on wands per lifetime. It's an inelastic good.
