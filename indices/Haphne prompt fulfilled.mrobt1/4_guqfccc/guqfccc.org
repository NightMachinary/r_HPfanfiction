Call me evil but I would like option A and C (from original post) but not as ending, more like in midway. Then they build their trust back (in sequel?) through being forced in situations where they have to talk or help each other out... I'm a romantic that way and think that love is not easy to forget.

I'll definitely read your story once I'm free (and there is more content) and will follow (and favourite) for future updates. Good luck and hope you have fun writing it :)
