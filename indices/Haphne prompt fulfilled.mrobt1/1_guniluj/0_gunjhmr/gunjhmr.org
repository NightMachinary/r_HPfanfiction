Phew! That's a loaded question haha. The short answer is: if a fic I write does /not/ have a happy ending, I will tag it as tragedy. Otherwise, you can be sure that - at minimum - Harry and the principle love interest survive to the end and have a ride into the sunset.

HOWEVER - people who do read my stories will tell you that I can be pretty merciless in the hardships my characters endure en route to said happy ending. For this fic, I feel like you'll probably be okay. It will mostly track with canon for 5th year, diverging as we move along (stays with Daphne POV most of the story).
