It's a really cool idea and tackled in many works of fiction. Its a setup that can go in a myriad of different directions depending on the writer too. I personally would write some antagonist organization that would molds the collective unconscious through targeted subliminal messaging like ads and stuff.

I think the last time I saw something like this was in Chaos;Head anime. (I may be thinking of the wrong anime name though)
