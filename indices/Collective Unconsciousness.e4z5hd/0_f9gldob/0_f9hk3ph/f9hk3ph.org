But none of those are true cultural influences. Things like Tolkien Elves are nigh universal, if you ask any person what an "elf" is, a majority of people are gonna have Tolkien's works in their mind, alongside the portrayals inspired by it.

Anime or marvel isn't nearly so world-altering or universally known, not to mention the subtle differences in perception - a superhero isn't the same as a wizard. An anime protagonist with "powers" isn't the same as a wizard.

In most people's minds, A wizard is old, has a beard, lives in a tower and reads books all day and has his moments of summoning the elements and annihilating orc armies. A lot of the time, especially in a world where the HP books don't exist, they gain their powers from long study and experimentation or from otherworldly entities, not an inherent quality.

A witch flies on a broom and has a cat familiar, however modern conceptions are slowly changing this into witches becoming more modern but with an increasingly occult twist, and also support the idea that witches gain their powers through study and deals with otherworldly entities, now more than ever.
