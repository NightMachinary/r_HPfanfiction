You show me an idea that radically changes the magic system, and all I can think of is the ministry running around trying to keep up with everything.

All I can picture is panicking ministry employees trying to deal with sudden changes when big blockbusters hit the muggle scene like the MCU or /shudders/ Twilight.

Auror: Madam Bones, there's a vampire uprising, and none of the Lumos spells are working on them!

Bones: What do you mean, not working?

Auror: It just makes them prettier.

Bones: What? How... Damn muggles and their stupid kinemas.

And then anime becomes popular worldwide, then we're all f*cked.

Edit: The replies I've been getting make a lot more sense and wholeheartedly agree with your reasoning. What I've written is only meant to an attempt at crackfic style humour.
