It could go different ways, with, like you said, gradual change, with the world changing over time, or it could go the "retcon" way, leaving anyone non the wiser about what happend, except some scarce individuals that are "off" of the reality vector. Like Dumble or maybe Harry.

For insnace, one day everyone's going to class, and no one notices, except Harry, that their techer is now Orland Bloom-looking, long-eared supermodel named Dobbion. Or on the next sorting ceremony, some of the students are there for the Mage course for those born without magic.

Either way, it would probably not jump to sudden changes after every movie or game (unless it's a crackfic), but would have to reach critical mass in the CU to take effect.
