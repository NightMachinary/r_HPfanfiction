You know, that sounds baller!

Turning someone into a monster just because people believed he was one. With time, as more people considered him a monster, he was becoming one even more, which made people to have even worse opinion on him. Put that into a perpetual CU circle of fear and hate, and Tom becomes an embodiment of antichrist.
