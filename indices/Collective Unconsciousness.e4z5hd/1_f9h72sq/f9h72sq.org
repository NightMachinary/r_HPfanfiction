Tom Riddle is just a normal, courteous kid who was molded into a hideous totalitarian snake monster from years of persuasive urban legends because he blew the whistle on Hagrid, and everyone /knows/ Hagrid couldn't be the Heir of Slytherin.

Slytherins as a whole are turned into stupid racist caricatures and cowards because everyone /knows/ that that's what Slytherins are.
