Vanishing Practise.

People are started on Vanishing with slugs, then mice, and Hermione is at one point said to have moved on to Kittens.

Think about it, and think about the mistakes that Vanishing produces - in the books, it's described as half-vanishing something, or only vanishing things like bones or skin or muscles. So Hermione was just sitting in that room making the bones of little Kittens disappear.

Not to mention, if it's possible to Vanish kittens, then it's possible to vanish other mammals of that size.

Like human babies.
