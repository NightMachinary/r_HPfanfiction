House elves can teleport practically anywhere, and many from "noble" families don't even notice their house elves except for when they actively call for them.

This means there are house elves out there who spy on their mistresses and masters doing the dirty.

In fact, given the way he kind of seems a little obsessed with Harry, I think Dobby might be one such house elf.
