Vernon literally choked Harry through a window. The cupboard not to mention and that Harry is locked up for days at a time with only one cold soup per day as food that he shares with Hedwig.

Also like people have died in the Triwizard turnament before and while they took precautions that only adult wizards could partake - look how it worked out.

The everchanging teachers in Defence against the dark arts. I know the post is cursed but like couldn't they have given the teaching post to a teacher who wasn't gonna try to curse a student or trying to kill them? The only teacher in that subject who wasn't involved in anything of that matter was Snape and that is saying something.

Quirrel turned out to be Voldemort and he tried to kill Harry

Lockhart tried to Obliviate Harry and Ron and was willing to leave Ginny behind to die

Lupin well he was nice but he tried to attack Harry Ron and Hermione as a Werewolf

Moody wasn't Moody but Barty Crouch Jr and he actively tried to have Harry killed and he killed his father on schoolgrounds and used unforgiveables on students.

Umbridge sent Dementors to Privet drive to literally have Harry assassinated, the blood quill and she tried to use the Cruciatus on Harry

Severus Snape - no noteworthy incident apart from the fact that he was mean. He killed Dumbledore but Dumbledore asked him to so that doesn't count.

Amycus Carrow - actual Death Eater used dark curses on Students and forced students to use dark Curses on other students
