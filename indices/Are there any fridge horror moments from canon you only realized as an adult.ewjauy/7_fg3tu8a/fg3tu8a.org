Combine two of the factors already stated - mind-altering magic (potions, memory charms, Imperius) and a lot of hormonal teenagers with minimal adult supervision - with the attitude of the Inquisitorial Squad / junior Death Eaters and the way Snape and Umbridge back them unconditionally. How likely is it, really, that there /weren't/ multiple rapes committed just during the time period covered by the books, especially during Umbridge's and/or Snape's reign?
