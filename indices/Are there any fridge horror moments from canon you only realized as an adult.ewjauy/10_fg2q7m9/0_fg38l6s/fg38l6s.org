Broom cupboards are never mentioned as romantic destinations in cannon - it all comes from fanfiction.

First mention is in CoS where Binns says: "There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard"

Then there are several mentions in GoF because Skeeter interviews Harry in one:\\
"“Let's see . . . ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.” It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her."\\
"...it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard."\\
"...things that he couldn't remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard."

Mentioned a few times in OotP:\\
"...where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artifacts. Mr. Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard."\\
"We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then. . . ."\\
"...peering around the hall as though hopeful [Dumbledore] might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard"

And that's it.
