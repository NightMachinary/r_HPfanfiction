We had a few people who got injured during PE. No one was carried away. You had to walk. And that worked just fine.

Hell, I remember a few injuries when we played football during breaks. If you got a wound, you washed it out with some water and played on unless you were bleeding all over the place. In that case, you hobbled to the "infirmary", where you got a bandage and were told to go back to class since the break was over.

The only time an ambulance was called, it was for alcohol poisoning during our graduation celebrations. And that was just one guy.
