The mandrake sentience doesn't seem to be higher than on animals. In the early days, they cry for attention. Later on, they start to spend time in the company of the others of their species, like forming packs.

People eat animals. Pigs are quite clever, I've understood. So I think the problem would be for vegetarians and vegans and the problem would probably be related to using medication that uses animals on it.

I refuse to think that anyone was cutting the mandrake while they were still alive. I refuse!
