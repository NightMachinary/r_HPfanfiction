In folklore, a Cerberus is literally meant to guard something. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not a natural creature at all in the HP universe, but one created from magic specifically for that purpose. In which case, it may only be happy when guarding something like that, and would be miserable running around in the open with nothing to do.
