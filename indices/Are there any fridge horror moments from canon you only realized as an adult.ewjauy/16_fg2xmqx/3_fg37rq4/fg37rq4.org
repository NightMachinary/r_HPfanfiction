Potions ingredients, animal to object transfigurations (That don't even have a reason it seems. At least potions have an actual use), summoning spells like /Serpensortia/... It probbadly is not easy to manoeuvre all of that.

I would guess when it comes to using potions a vegan witch or wizard would decide if the potion was something they needed or not, just like with medication in real life.

I do not know how a student would manoeuvre having to do things that may go against their ethical believes, but most people don't become vegetarian or vegan till they are adults, so students who are should be outlier cases.
