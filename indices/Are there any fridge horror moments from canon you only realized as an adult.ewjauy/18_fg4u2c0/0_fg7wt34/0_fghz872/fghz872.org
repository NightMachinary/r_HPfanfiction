In Order of the Phoenix, in his worst memory that Harry sees in the Penseive, they flip him upside down and show everyone his underwear. Then after he calls Lily a Mudblood they flip him upside down again and James says "Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?" In England "pants" is used to refer to boxers or underwear. Present Snape then wrenches Harry out of the memory.

They committed a bad enough (in my opinion) sexually charged attack by showing everyone his underwear then then were perfectly fine with exposing his genitals to everyone as well.

Read that scene but read it as though Snape were a woman instead. Then tell me how absolutely horrific that entire memory is.
