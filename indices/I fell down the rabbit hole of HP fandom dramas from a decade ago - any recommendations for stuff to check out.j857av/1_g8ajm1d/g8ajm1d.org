Oh man [[/r/hobbydrama][r/hobbydrama]] is full of that.

Here's one on the Snapewives [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/d4wwir/harry_potter_fandom_married_to_severus_snape_on/]]

One on Cassandra Claire: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/de0204/harry_potter_and_ya_literature_the_cassandra/]]

One on Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/9n4vge/fanfic_community_popular_author_turns_out_to_be_a/]]

They have a great write up on the My Immortal saga as well, if you haven't gotten your fill: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/cylwll/harry_potter_fandom_goffick_harry_potter_and/]]

And I'm sure there are more I'm forgetting. The older posts were better, but if you sort by best of all time you're sure to get sucked into an amazing rabbithole. [[/u/iwasonceafangirl][u/iwasonceafangirl]] has some of my absolute favorites.
