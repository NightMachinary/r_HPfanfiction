"A Black Comedy" by nonjon on fanfiction.net. Harry and Sirius are burglars and they have to get past various ward sets for their crimes. A word of caution though...do not try and read and drink anything at the same time. I laughed so hard in spots that I shot soda out of my nose and that HURTS. Having said that, I recommend almost everything by that author.
