Doesn't the trace kick in when they are issued a wand? Prior to that it is considered accidental? We only know for sure Hermione was doing magic on the Hogwarts express (no concrete textual evidence of deliberate mahic earlier) and as there were plenty of people on the train over 17 I'm guessing it gets lost in the "noise". Like the twins doing magic at home working on things before they cime of age doesn't attract attention because magic at the residence is expected with several older wizards living there.
