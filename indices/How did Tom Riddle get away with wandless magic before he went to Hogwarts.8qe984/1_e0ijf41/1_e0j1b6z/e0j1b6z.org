We don't really know if the Trace is a piece of magic on the person or if it's a spell at the Ministry. If the latter, there is some quality about underage magic which makes it trackable which changes when you turn 17, breaking the Trace's ability to detect you. If the former and the spell is on the person, we don't know when it is applied.

Lack of prosecution of pre-Hogwarts magic can equally be explained as a lack of enforcement as a lack of detection.
