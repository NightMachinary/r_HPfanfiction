  A better candidate for your question would be 'what did wizards do during the bombing of london'. The assumptions there are much smaller...

But that's the issue precisely. The bombing of London only caused "small" explosions that are well within the borders of what magic can reasonably withhold, from what we've seen in canon. By contrast, a /Nuclear explosion that wipes out an entire city/ is on another level entirely, and it's far less certain wizards could have protected themselves from it. As for Japan just transitioning out of isolation at that time --- that's /muggle/ Japan. The wizarding community of Japan could very well have been a first-rate world power and we wouldn't know.
