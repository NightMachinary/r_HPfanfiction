The glass-sand and all that, that's all movie-only. The best interpretation of /Protego/ I've seen is that it's not a "deflector shield" sort of thing, it's a magical barrier that will /protect you no matter what/, except from Dark Magic especially designed for piercing a Shield Charm (i.e. the Killing Curse). A Shield Charm could thus sustain absolutely anything non-magical, no matter the force behind it. A /Protego/ could protect you from a nuclear blast --- only, you couldn't keep it up forever and the radiations and heat would get you.
