There was no way magic could contain a blast like bomb going off. From what we saw in the movies and books blasting curses threw off very little shrapnel and a lot less energy. Bombs like that a direct hit there's nothing left. Shrapnel could easily punch through a shield. Even Dumbledore could not stop all the glass he had to transfigured it into sand. The bomb would simply kills the wizard. Even if none of those things made it through there would still be enough force to liquidate organs and move them around.
