Sure, but they could also very well have been established after the war, instead of being an old magical community.

Or (given the relative lack of 'swords and sorcery' mythology in eastern countries) it could be that they never had the integration with the non-magic world that happened in Europe.

My point was, unlike the rest of Europe, which shares a common history (and situation of generations of European conflict), Japan is far enough removed from England in WW2 that the assumption that they share a common situation with England.

(Of course, I would fully expect cannon to have a school there eventually, as it is a global franchise and Universal Studios Japan has a HP theme park there :P )

I think my favorite idea about why Japan doesn't have the same 'Medieval Magic' concept that you see in the west is that "Medieval Swords and Sorcery" is used because it is something (Medieval setting) that is familiar to the population but not too familiar, so that they pick up the environment quickly but don't balk when you add fantastical elements. For Japan, you often see these types of stories set in 'ancient china-like kingdom', which has a similar familiar but not to familiar status (And given that HP is just a 'modern' version of S&S...)
