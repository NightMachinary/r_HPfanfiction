Forget London, Tokyo was basically leveled by Firebombs. The atomic bombs, while significantly more psychologically damaging, were certainly not the only means of complete destruction. (This is the argument you often hear in defense of dropping the A-Bomb, that it wasn't really more horrifying than anything else happening in that war)

If you are worried about the magical response to Hiroshima, Tokyo is just as questionable. And if you handwave that magical Japan was based out of the old capital (Kyoto), then you could say the same about Hiroshima...
