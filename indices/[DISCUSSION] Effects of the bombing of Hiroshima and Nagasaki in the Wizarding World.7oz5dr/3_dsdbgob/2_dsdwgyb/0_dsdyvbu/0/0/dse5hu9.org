To be fair, even if you ignore the insane destruction that is WW2, it is highly unlikely that anyone with that level of integration into the world could ignore it being wartorn. Europe was certainly wartorn for much of the previous 1000 years before WW2. I don't care if you can shield against it: Stopping falling rocks and avoiding sieges will require some thought.

Of course, you could go with "When it gets tough, the magical community retreats into itself and closes off access from the Muggle world". Then you are arguing more for 'It isn't that magicals didn't notice, but they didn't notice it was significantly worse than the previous conflicts', which does fit in with the books. But you are assuming when the fighting starts the Leaky Cauldron shuts itself off behind magical barriers till it is over....
