I feel like History of Magic would get a lot less boring...

but really, I could see the School basically using the resurrection stone to acquire the singular best teacher of each subject who ever died?

The Cloak could be incorporated into the wards, ie Death will never find the school? So 0% death toll forever.

The wand could either become a Champion's weapon like the Sword, or also be incorporated into the wards and making them literally unbeatable.
