I believe canon Ginny never did lose her crush/love for Harry, she just tried to convince herself otherwise. What OP is asking for is probably something like Ginny stopped caring for Harry romantically at all and Harry goes to comical lengths to win her back, perhaps like copying her valentine's poem from CoS or something.
