I can second many of these recommendations, but my top picks from post-2013 would be:

- /The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond/, linkffn(9818387). By far the best soul bond fic I've read--a realistic handling of the trope with a slow burn romance that doesn't gloss over the problems or immediately jump to True Love.
- /Long Live the Queen/, linkffn(11500936). A bit on the silly side, perhaps, but if you like muggle curb-stomp, this is the story for you.
- /Escape,/ linkffn(11916243). The only long-form marriage law fic I've seen where Harry and Hermione do the sensible thing and get out of dodge. A lot of people on this sub prefer /Marriage Law Revolution/, but this one is definitely the best in my book.
- /Order of Mercy/, linkffn(12181042). My all-time favorite canon-7th year fic. Focuses on Percy working undercover to help muggle-borns escape the Death Eaters.
- /Harry Potter and the Magic of Life,/ linkffn(11002763). A mostly-fluffy Harry/Daphne fic, but the writing is pretty good, and the cursebreaking trip is a lot of fun.
- /Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary/, linkffn(12407442). Luna gets the Diary, and hilarity ensues. One of the funniest fics ever, but definitely not crack.
