Agreed with the "everyone has an opinion". It gets lots of love and lots of hate.

Some caveats for new readers:

- It was written serially, over an extended period of time. This impacts the plot development, and the first handful of chapters are perhaps not the author's best ([[/u/daystareld][u/daystareld]] has written a alternative beginning, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMoR), which expands and imo improves them).
- Harry can be hard to get along with. He's condescending and arrogant, especially in the early chapters. He can also be a very loyal friend, but he doesn't count many people as friends.
- It's as much a tutorial in psychology and reflecting on one's thinking patterns as it is a story. I didn't mind the author tracts, but they're noticeable and they do put many people off.

On the other hand, you can expect a complex plot with legitimately smart characters, lots of humor, loads of cultural references, and an impressive enemy. And it's complete.
