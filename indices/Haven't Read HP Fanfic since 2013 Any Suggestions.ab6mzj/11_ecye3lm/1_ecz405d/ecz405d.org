I think a lot of the hate it gets is from people who don't appreciate that the MoR Harry is not the same Harry from Canon by a long shot. It sets a handful of solid divergences from Canon and explores the totality of what those changes mean.

It's very much not for everyone, but I don't think it deserves the hate it gets all the time here.
