I just started reading linkao3(The Boys of Crowhill) based of a rec from another thread, and it's very well-written. It focuses primarily on Harry; any adult relationships are background. Another one of my favorites is linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) which is the best piece on Snape that I've read. It's from 2011, but has far too few kudos, so perhaps it'll be new to you? Linkao3(Swung by Serafim) has an interesting premise and also phenomenal writing -- Harry gets Obliviated by Lockhart and forgets everything. Linkao3(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) is another fantastic read and exactly what it sounds like.

A couple more of my favorites -- just putting links because this is turning into a wall of text... linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; The Augurey; Forbidden by Savageland; Princess of the Blacks; The Young Adventurer's Club; Family by Necessity by ArithmancerProof; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw; Reign of the Serpent). I also gotta shameless rec my own series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

I hope you like some of these! Happy reading!
