Quickly skimming through my favourites these jump out:

- linkffn(*A Long Journey Home*)

Possibly my personal favourite fic, a genderbent Harry is thrown back thousands of year in time and discovering she is immortal takes the slow road back. The modern times sections aren't the best, but the one-of chapters in the past are excellent and the Merlin arc is downright totally awesome.

- linkffn(*Grow Young With Me*)

Fluffy romance with a Muggle OC. It doesn't do much more than that but hot damn it is good at what it does.

- linkffn(*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*)

This one is kinda weird. A slow-ish fic focused on young muggle parents? It's got excellent writing though, and not all is as it seems. If you like the day-to-day life beats you'll love this fic.
