The most recent update to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) was in 2015. Still incomplete, but I'm hoping for another chapter really soon. It's an oldie, but it does a really good job of time travel, balancing advantages with disadvantages and focusing on how Harry builds up his relationships with his friends again.

And I recently laughed all the way through linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). Excellent Snape redemption arc (very much in character), lots of subtle jokes. It follows the stations of canon rather closely, but the author very much does it in his/her own style.
