Oh yeah! I primarily use and prefer Ao3 because of its tag system. Because I love very niche tropes. Also it's not because of mobile, it's almost the exact same on desktop.

They recently added a filter where you can specify tags that you don't want turning up. So if there's a specific pairing you don't like you can pop that in the tags you don't want. It's under "Exclude" and works the same way as "Include". You could also try key words to exclude like "slash" although that term is more popular on ffn than it is on ao3.

To avoid slash, I reckon your best bet is setting your category to "Gen" which means that the story, while it may include a relationship, isn't soley focused on the relationship if there is one. It's my fave filter.

Just some general tips I use too because not every top rated fic kudos wise is actually that good:

- try flicking between the different filter options when it comes to "sort by" to find new content. Date updated best for fresh but kudos for renowned. Then mix them up when you've exhausted them.

- Like a fic? If there's a tag that that fic used that's quite niche, click and check it out, sort by kudos or date updated. For example, I started using "Harry is not a horcrux" and "Harry Potter Abandoned By Dursleys" which are very small tags and turn up results I wouldn't find other wise because they don't have thousands upon thousands of kudos. I also love time travel but I have read all if not most of the highest rates stuff so I check the tag by Date Updated once a week or so for new content that looks interesting.

- Like an author? Maybe check out what they bookmark and filter through what they put down as Recs Only to see their favourites. I don't do this often but it can work, also with other people who have bookmarked the same fic as you. Chance you have the same taste.

There's also searching through bookmarks in general but I haven't tried that out.

That's all that comes to mind rn! Hope it helps
