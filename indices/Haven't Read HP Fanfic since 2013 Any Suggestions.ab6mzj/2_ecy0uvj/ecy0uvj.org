I never really got into Harry Potter fics until a couple months ago. Here's my faves so far!

/Some include slash but that's not the focus, I prefer plot over porn myself and my list reflects that/

*The Meaning of Mistletoe*

The first instalment of this four part series was posted to Ao3 in January 2017 and it is by far my favourite set of fics in this fandom. It has a very interesting take on magic, characters and goes in so many directions yet naturally flows.

*The Dogfather*

Only recently completed this year, a wonderful comedic tale of a What If where Harry is adopted by nice muggles and comes into contact with Sirius and Remus. I've yet to read the last chapter but I'm sure it's just as great as the rest of the fic (I just don't want it to end for me yet :P)

*The Art of Self Fashioning*

2015-2017 Very dark and disturbing fic that goes into the magic of transfiguration. I found Harry's perspective to be quite unnerving to read but I read on none the less.

*Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat*

The first of the fics I've listed that isn't complete but is still actively updating (updated yesterday in fact) and also one of the first I read. I need to give it a re-read but I remember liking it. It is Tomarry Time Travel which isn't everyone's cup of tea but even people who don't like tomarry have been seen to enjoy it.

*Quiet Like a Fight*

Probably the least popular fic on this list with just over 670 kudos but I think it deserves more. A What If situation in which Harry becomes a Slytherin simply because he doesn't have any prejudice on the subject so when the hat suggests it he's like "sure? I guess?". No annoying cliches, no bashing. Just Harry being a kid. Part of a series that is sadly incomplete.

*face death in the hope*

Still updating time travel fic with Regulus Black and Harry Potter. Very funny and very well written. Tagged with them as a ship but I've read up to chapter 30 (waiting for more chapters so I can binge) and they haven't gotten together yet.

Edit: how could I forget Antithesis?!

*Antithesis*

Tragedy. Only very recently completed this October. I find it quite hard to summarise past the tropes but seriously, I enjoyed it. WBWL.

And those are most of my bookmarks tagged as recs!

Others I have marked as rec but honestly can't remember if they deserve such praise or if it just hit my tropey wants at the time include:
