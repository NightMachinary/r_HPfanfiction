linkao3(13795605) If you're okay with Fem!Harry, this is a really good fit.

Other bonuses: No canon-rehash plot, believable characters, /ungodly/ amounts of worldbuilding. Seriously, [[/u/Taure]] has a spreadsheet of the protagonist's finances, a primer on pureblood ideology, an essay on how magic works (which is floating around the DLP forums somewhere), a map of Hogsmeade and a guide on dress robes.
