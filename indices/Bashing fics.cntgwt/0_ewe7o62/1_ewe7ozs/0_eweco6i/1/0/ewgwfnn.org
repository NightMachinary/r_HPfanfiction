The interviewer is clearly an author stand-in. He know things there's no way any interviewer could know, or are we supposed to infer that the ministry had peoples hiding in the girls closet at Hogwarts, taking note when Hermione didn't ask her roommates for beauty tips ? Also any sensible person would have retreated the second an interviewer started telling you how you should have handled your sentimental life in high school.

It's so stupidly written, the basic idea of taking Hermione down a notch could have been executed way better. And if the point was to take apart Hermione then it should at least have stuck to her canon mistakes and avoid piling made up shit on top of it. I know I should expect nothing from a bashing fic but this one was particularly egregious.
