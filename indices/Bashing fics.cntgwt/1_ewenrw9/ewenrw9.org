The ones I can think of are linkffn(A Cadmean Victory; Susan Bones and the Prisoner of Azkaban). The first one is a meh story because Harry is your usual broody indy!Harry who gets mad at the world, the second is meh because again he's kinda like that and on top of that the story becomes ridiculously difficult to follow at the end, which caused me to drop it.
