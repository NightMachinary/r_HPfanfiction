Without giving any spoilers away, it's super long, time-travel, eventual slash (but I'm literally like... over 100k in and it's still gen sooo), and really well-written. Slow moving but there's enough small climaxes and sub-plots to keep it from dragging. Not yet complete but pretty regularly updated, so don't worry. Highly recommend!
