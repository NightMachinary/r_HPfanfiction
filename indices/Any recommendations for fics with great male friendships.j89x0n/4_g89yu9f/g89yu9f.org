For some great friendship scenes with Harry and his dormmates check out Unthinkable Thoughts by Aidan Lynch on ff.

It is an old abandoned Drarry that is not that great, but it really shines when it comes to the camaraderie between the Gryffindor boys.

It totally helps that the author went to boarding school in the UK, he even explains some things about UK boarding schools in the reviews, which is one of the reasons why I still got this bookmarked.
