Harry/Ron Bromance

Harry and Ron are drunkards, and hate their current life. They come up with a dumb plan to go back and fix things to avoid their crappy life. Seriously, when I say dumb, I mean DUMB.

Well, it works, and they end up back in year three. Except, Harry Potter wasn't born in that world, James Potter Jr was. Ronald Weasley wasn't born in that world. Ginny Weasley was. (For the people who haven't caught on, Ron was born female, so was named Ginny. No more Weasley children after that) ANYWHO, Ginny is a perfect female version of Ron back then.

There's other pairings, but they aren't totally central to the plot until the epilogue, where they go full-on crack.

HOUSE YEET REPRESENT!
