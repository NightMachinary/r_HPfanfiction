linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)

The first of a series, based on Alanna the Lioness, although no knowledge of the crossover is required. Your mileage may vary on certain parts, however the writing does improve as the series goes on. This is pretty AU, with the premise being that Tom Riddle became a politician, rather than Lord Voldemort. Fourth book is currently on hiatus.
