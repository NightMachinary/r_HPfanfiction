It may not be to everyone's tastes, but laventadorn on AO3 has some great female Harry stories (The Never-Ending Road, No Journey's End) which I've been following for ~5 years now. It begins with Chamber of Secrets if I remember correctly and is a slow burn pairing Harry with Snape, but their relationship isn't (currently) a romantic one. She's still in the process of writing No Journey's End and I think is still planning on finishing up until the end of the seventh book. It's definitely worth a go - her characterisation of Snape in particular is one of my favourites.
