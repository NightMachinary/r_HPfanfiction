[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][The Wendell That Wasn't]] is absolutely hilarious and fluffy.

Severus Snape is forced to haunt Harry Potter. Neither one of them is the least bit happy about this. Also, Ginny is a horrible baby namer.

[[https://pubfiles.elusiveguy.com/J4AEk8cTPwNAzaw][Faith and Understanding]] is my favorite fic.

Ginny and Luna's friendship and Ginny's musings therein. As heartwarming as they come. A true platonic love story.
