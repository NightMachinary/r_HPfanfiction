Thank you, a lot of people don't realize that it was intended to be symbolical. Hell, in canon it's not even confirmed that Merope used a love potion (that's Harry's and Dumbledore's guess considering the situation and that she was more likely to use that rather than something like the Imperious).

Edit: Also just imagine how fucked up it would be to say that rape-babies can't feel love and will all grow up to be psychopaths. Voldemort was a product of a fucked up upbringing, and all the inbreeding probably didn't do him any good either. The only role the love potion played was that his father abandoned his mother and him, which more than likely started his hatred of Muggles.
