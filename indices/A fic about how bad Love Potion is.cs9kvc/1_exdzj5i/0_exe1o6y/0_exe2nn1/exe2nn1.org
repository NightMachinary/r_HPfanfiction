Yeah, I would credit a lot of things in tandem for Voldemort's brand of psychotic. The Gaunts were evidently genetically predisposed to insanity in a way even the Blacks couldn't match. He lived his childhood in utter squalor, and at some point during his formative years, he was probably exposed to the horrors of the blitz. He was magically gifted in an unusually conspicuous way; any feelings of superiority he nurtured as a child were likely magnified by his apparent supernatural powers. He was sorted into Slytherin, a house known for its glorification of pureblood elitism, and was probably not well-treated until he carved out his own place there with his talents. The love potion, if there was one, which as you point out is not confirmed, could have played a part, but it just as easily might have not.
