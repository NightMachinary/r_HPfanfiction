JKR has confirmed that this was just meant as an allegory - normally children born to Love Potion parents would be able to form loving bonds. It's just that Voldemort was unable to form said connections, and oh, look, he never had a chance for a pair of functioning, loving parents in any case, because his dad was trapped and raped for however long that lasted.

That's why Harry's ability to love is a 'power he knows not' - Harry grew up emotionally neglected to a degree that would emotionally cripple many, but is very well-adjusted despite that.
