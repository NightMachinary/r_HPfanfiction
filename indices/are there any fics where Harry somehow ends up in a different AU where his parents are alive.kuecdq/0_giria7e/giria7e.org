Harry follows Sirius through the veil and ends up in a No-Voldemort AU with no way to get back. The Other Harry still exists, though, so the "you're not my son" angst is diminished a lot. Recently updated.

EDIT: Bot took longer than 50 minutes to pick it up, so direct link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22810651/chapters/54512623]]

EDIT2: Different direct-link since the fic's got 2 more chapters on AO3.
