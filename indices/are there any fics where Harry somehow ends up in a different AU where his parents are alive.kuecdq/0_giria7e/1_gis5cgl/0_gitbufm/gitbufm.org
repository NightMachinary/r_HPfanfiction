Just read it and I agree. I also found myself skipping over a good chunk of every chapter, because nothing ever seemed to be happening. Like why did I just read Harry despairing about what to choose for breakfast for paragraphs on end? The fic does focus heavily on Harry's relationship with the other dimension's Potters though, if that's primarily what you're looking for.
