  Curious, and more than a little frustrated by the fact that Dumbledore and others are keeping him in the dark about everything, Harry takes a peek into Snape's Pensieve. Instead of learning the truth about what he's certain is being kept from him, Harry learns that his father is every bit as conceited as Snape had claimed that he was, and that he's more like Snape than he is his own father.
