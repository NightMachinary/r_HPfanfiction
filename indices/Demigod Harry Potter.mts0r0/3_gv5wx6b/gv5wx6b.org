Prophecy of Two Boys By Smartiepants

People who are born with two souls in their body are rare. But since when did Harry and Percy obey the rules? Follow them as they try to survive after their brother was mistaken for being the Boy-Who-Lived. AU. Wrong BWL

It isn't finished and is dead as it hasn't been updated since 2017 but is still an interesting read
