I think one of the things that tends to foster 1-dimensional fan fiction characters is the very love that writers have for them. New writers love Harry or Hermione or whoever and don't want to give them flaws, but by making them perfect, they doom their story. Good characters need flaws and things to overcome and learn from, but some writers just don't want to be "mean" to the characters they know so well and love.
