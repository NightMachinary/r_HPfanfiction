Do you? You don't have to look at them if you don't like them. Most of the posts in this sub are about Harry. Every single day. I'll agree with you that there are too many of /them/, but that's what the hide button is for isn't it? Sometimes I can hardly click it fast enough.

In any case I can't see how your comment is relevant to the OP.
