I'm a big advocate of showing rather than telling and making sure your main characters actually change/react/evolve in your story. And don't bury these changes in walls of expository internal thoughts. Actually show them changing through their actions and conversations.

People are formed by how they were raised but they change/evolve as they experience new things. Characters that are fully explained/formed in the first chapter with no change in attitudes/behavior or that do a complete 180 based on one story beat/revelation aren't realistic. Humans don't work that way.
