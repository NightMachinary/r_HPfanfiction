Like a knife that can jimmy any lock? A mirror that can communicate with it's pair undetectably? A map that can see through high powered transfiguritive magic? A cloak that allows it's wearer to avoid situational death or those who wish to kill you? I think I would settle for a fic that showed the tactical use of the magical items he already had at one point, or theoretically could collect.
