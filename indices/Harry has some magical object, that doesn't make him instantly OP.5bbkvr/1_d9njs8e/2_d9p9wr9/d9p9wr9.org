Wouldn't mind a story where wands are for everyday, and staffs are for really powerful/heavy duty work. Like Bill might use one at work, but he wouldn't carry it - carrying it in public is like carrying an assault rifle, or driving a bulldozer, or holding a power drill. Like, maybe you have to have a license to own one, or at least registered. It's not practical for normal charms and transfigerations, and will lose to a wand in a duel probably, but is useful in a fight against magic resistant slower non wand holders, like giants, trolls, etc.
