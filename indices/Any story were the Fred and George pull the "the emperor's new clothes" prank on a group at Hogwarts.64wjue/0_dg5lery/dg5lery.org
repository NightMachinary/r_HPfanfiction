I do remember one I read where someone plays this sort of prank on Hermione where she was charmed to think she was wearing clothes and walked through he school and she blamed Harry for it. It really was a small thing though. In this story, I think Harry either jumps dimensions or travels back in time and things are slightly different. And when he get's there, he learns that he was never friends with Hermione, and someone did this prank to her and blamed him for it before the start of the story.

I'm pretty sure the story was decent, but do you really want to read it because of this one reason? I'd have to think hard to remember which this was.
