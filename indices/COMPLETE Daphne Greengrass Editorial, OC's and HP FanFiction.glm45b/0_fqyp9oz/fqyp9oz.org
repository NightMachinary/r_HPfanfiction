You did a great job at explaining Daphne and her origin. I was surprised when you mentioned how little she was actually mentioned in the books. Makes her popularity in shipping hilarious. I really love how the fandom created these charachters and are still adding to them a full decade after the book series ended.

I think a big reason for her creation that you didn't mention is the fandoms desire of a somewhat neutral Slytherin side. Fanfiction writers love sorting Harry in Slytherin and the Slytherin we did have were kind of lacking. All of them were openly bigoted. So fanfic writers took the barely mentioned Slytherin in Harry's year and made them neutral.

I wish the same would happen to the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students, but it's unlikely with how little writers sort Harry in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff and have him actually interact with them. Would be nice to have a somehow universally accepted charachter for people like Lily Moon and Su Li so it doesn't feel like every other iteration is completely different.
