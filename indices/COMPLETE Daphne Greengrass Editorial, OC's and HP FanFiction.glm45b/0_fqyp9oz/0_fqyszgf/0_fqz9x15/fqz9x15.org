I'd definitely watch that video, too. The Problem of Slytherin is one of my pet peeves about the series.

In terms of story potential (even though she doesn't appear in canon-years stories), one of the biggest points for me is having Dorea Black be Harry's grandmother. JK could have done the series a lot of good by keeping what she'd already implied on the Black Family Tree, and instead, she ignored it and created new characters to be Harry's grandparents.

For that matter, whatever happened to Cedrella Black, Arthur's mother? We never see Ron's grandparents even mentioned despite implying he has a large extended family.
