The way I imagine it, most people point out that not only is it not the first time a Slytherin and Gryffindor have dated, there are more than one current couple in the school across those houses. And then any Slytherin that hates Harry assumes that Daphne has some plan that involves seducing Harry Potter and they just go on with their lives.
