Good video, I think you did a pretty good job in summarizing what makes Daphne so popular.

My thought regarding her case is that, first, it starts by a good aesthetic name, I always liked the name Daphne, followed by the fact she has an already established canon background(Slytherin, not part of Malfoy group, pureblood) and a fanon background(best friend with Tracey, cold/distant personality). Then, we have the fact she can be whatever you want her to be without repercutions, nobody can say your Daphne is OOC because there's no canon character to compare with, authors have free rein in what they can do with her.

She can be the anchor for Harry to the "proper" pureblood traditions, and then, we have the whole Gryffindor/Slytherin relationship, forbidden romances are simply irrestistible. You have tension, drama and conflict that only "true" love can endure. Also, you got post-Hogwarts shenanigans if you take in consideration Harry becomes in-law with Draco, leading to a very awkward family reunion.

Daphne has all the advantages of a fanon character without the drawbacks of being an OC.
