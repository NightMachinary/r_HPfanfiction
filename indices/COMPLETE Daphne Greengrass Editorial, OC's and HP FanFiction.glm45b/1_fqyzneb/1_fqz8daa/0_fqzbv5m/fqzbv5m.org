Sure, no problem.

I still believe that, above all, beauty is what holds all of this together. Let's be honest, she's the stereotypical beautiful girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. People want Harry to be with someone beautiful. In my opinion, it's not a shallow thing, people just want Harry to be with someone pretty. It's in a way, a "reward" for everything he has been through. Also, Daphne Greengrass is, in my opinion, a beautiful name. The hero slays the dragon and gets the princess, and you can always switch roles; Daphne being in distress(save her from the snake pit) or Harry(help him with his complex situation as the Chosen One).
