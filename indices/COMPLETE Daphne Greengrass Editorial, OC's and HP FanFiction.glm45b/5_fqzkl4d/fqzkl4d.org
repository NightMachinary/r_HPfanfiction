Really good video and analysis of the Daphne Greengrass character. One point on her origin I do think you missed however is that Daphne is basically in many ways a replacement of the fem!Blaise Zabini character fans shipped with Harry that was popular before 2005 when her character got revealed to be a dude in Half Blood Prince. That pre-2005 fan version was also a ice queen type character and Daphne basically filled the void that was left when fem!Blaise no longer was usable, and later become even more popular than fem!Blaise.

Also, cool to know your the author of Living Dangerously, as I've recently been starting to read it and am quickly becoming a huge fan of that story. Almost finish with it and then I'll start reading the sequel Living in Secret soon after. Can't wait for that.
