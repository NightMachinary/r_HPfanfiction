The thing I love about this is that the fandom collectively decided to take this barely mentioned character and build a fairly cohesive set of character traits and personality around her completely by accident. I was actually surprised when I reread the books to find that Daphne has no character. I was so used to her having the same personality, even in stories where she isn't the focus. It's pretty amazing.
