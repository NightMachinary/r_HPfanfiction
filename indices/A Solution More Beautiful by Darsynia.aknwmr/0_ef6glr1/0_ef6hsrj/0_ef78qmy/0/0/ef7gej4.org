  Even if it isn't specifically a carbon copy of the author, it is still often classified the same way. Was that really necessary?

Was what really necessary? Pointing out to you the meaning of the words "self" and "insert"? Not really, but talking about fanfiction at all isn't strictly necessary either.

In any case, I just think this kind of attitude is the reason why words like "nonplussed" or "literally" have lost all meaning.
