The only one who ever says "My love" out loud in the fic is an adult. And that happens once.

I always write from the POV of a character, not an omniscient author. So, fifteen year olds will think of their boy/girlfriends as "their love". That's what tends to happen when you're young, full of hormones, and just got together.

Not that it happens that often anyway ("his/her love" is mentioned 9 times total, in over 50 chapters), and never out loud.
