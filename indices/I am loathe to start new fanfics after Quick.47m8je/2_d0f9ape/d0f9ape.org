If you want more fic with rich world building, I suggest [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] by Diane Castle, where "Harworts" is an exclusive boarding school for training commandos, spies, handlers, interrogators, hackers, and other staff for Britain's tumultuous Intelligence Community, where skill, technology, and occasional James-Bond-style superscience takes the place of magic. Most children who go there come from families in the Community, such as the "Wellesleys" and the "Malenfants", but some common children, like Hermione and Colin can get an invitation if they do something particularly cunning or vicious. The overall plot follows canon loosely (in that the big challenge of each year parallels that of that year of canon), but it's a plus in this case, because it's interesting to see how the magical events of HP canon are reflected in this spy-verse.
