well linkffn(4098039) has in depth worldbuilding and the author is very fond of using elements or details foreshadowed 300000 words ago to come in effect later on in the story. The pacing is unequal but the writing competent, which is also how I'd describe Prince of the Forbidden Kingdom so there's that.

Stands complete at 1.3 million words, which should qualify it for the "epic" descriptive.
