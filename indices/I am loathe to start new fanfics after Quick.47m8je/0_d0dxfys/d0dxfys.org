Read something what is supposed to be "light". A comedy or something like that (like linkffn(A Black Comedy)). After that it should be easy.

If that is nothing to you either read nothing a week. Helps too. Than you should easily bea able to immerse into a new fic. I unforunaly cant recommend something like those both as I never finished either.
