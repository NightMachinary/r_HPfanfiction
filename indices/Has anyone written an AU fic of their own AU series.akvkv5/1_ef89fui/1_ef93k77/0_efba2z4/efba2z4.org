Yes, there are updates coming. However, I'm not posting anymore updates to anything until I actually finish a story. Redheaded Stepchild is first on the docket though. I plan on finishing it before the end of the year (no promises). There will be a year 6 and year 7, though in grand tradition, year 7 will not take place at Hogwarts at all and will feature Sir Hilary Clawsworth.

As for whether or not the two stories are in different continuities, the answer is kinda. Stepchild runs on rule of funny and is a crack/comedy story. Hunters runs on rule of drama and is a pulp fiction action story.
