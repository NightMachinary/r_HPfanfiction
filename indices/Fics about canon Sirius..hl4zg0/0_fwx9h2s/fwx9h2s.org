Hi :) I'm currently working on a couple of Sirius/Black family-centric fics. The first is Circinus, which is an AU in which his mother saves him from Azkaban and, along with his grandfather, secures him a trial. I'm still in the early chapters but it will be a rather long and detailed one, in the long run. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23559502/chapters/56518936]]

The second is The Dog Days of Summer, which centres around the summer when Sirius was ten. It's basically a whimsical tale set at the Black family country estate and features magical creatures wherever possible. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21737692/chapters/51857092]]

I try to stick to characterise Sirius as canon as possible, but my characterisations of the wider Black family are very heavily influenced by Izzythehutt's Black Sheep Dog series, which is a brilliant AU in which Regulus survives the cave, which leads to Sirius getting roped back into the family. Check it out, it's brilliant :) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611]]
