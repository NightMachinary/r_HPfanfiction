  The Black Family had seen its rapid decline over the course of five years. Now, with the apparent death of the last male heir, Arcturus Black presides over a dying dynasty, Walburga Black begins a slow descent into madness, and Sirius Black is jailed in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit.However, Arcturus isn't content on letting his ancient family name die out just yet, nor is he all that keen on handing his estate to the terribly déclassé Malfoys. So he, along with Walburga and a very reluctant Lucretia, begin a quixotic crusade to free their wayward heir from Azkaban.Meanwhile, in a more bucolic setting, Regulus Black lives in peaceful self-imposed exile after faking his death to protect his family from his betrayal. Until one night, he finds the long-forgotten mark on his forearm is burning once more.What happens when this highly damaged, emotionally constipated, extremely dysfunctional group of individuals meet under the roof of Grimmauld Place 16 years later in the midst of the second wizarding war?Chaos. Utter chaos.Set mainly during the events of OoTP, with a relatively lengthy prologue covering the years from 79-95.
