[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23655241/chapters/56780728#workskin][Ozymandias]] - linkao3(23655241) Hi! I'm currently writing a fic that's an OoTP AU where Sirius's mother, Regulus, and his grandfather are all alive and in Grimmauld Place when he goes to claim it for the order. There's definitely no wolfstar (no need to worry on that front lol) and Sirius's characterization is not fanon influenced at all. Feel free to check it out :)
