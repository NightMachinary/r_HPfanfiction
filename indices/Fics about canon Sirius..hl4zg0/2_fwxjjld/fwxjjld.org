It's not /entirely/ canon Sirius but it's the closest I can think of for Golden Trio Era

Linkffn(A Bond of Family by Daily-Chan) warning it's part of a series and you'll need to read the previous parts first.

It's not wolfstar, Sirius and Remus are very tactile with eachother and people think they're a couple which is honestly hilarious bc Sirius is just completely oblivious to it.

Linkffn(Saving Sirius by imaginationcelebration) is Marauders Era with slight wolfstar but it's emotional and I cried.
