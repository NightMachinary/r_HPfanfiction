I kinda like the idea of this mixed with the faith/belief background system in the Riordanverse: Harry ends up becoming a minor god due to the magical population's belief in him.

However, because of a Spaghetti Incident crisis going on at the time (this is pre-PJ), he's literally given a brief, semi-distracted five second speech, a manual on "How to be a God" is thrust into his hands, and then he is literally punted out of the Olympians' Throne Room's doors.

Utterly baffled and wondering "what the fuck just happened", he wanders away.

..It's only after the crisis is resolved that they remembered they treated a new god that way, and they're like, "Oh... oops? Anyone know where he wandered off to?"
