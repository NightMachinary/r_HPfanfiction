All of the above, really. I'm really looking for someone to make sure I don't go crazy on some things and keep me on track. I have a tendency of running things to to the ground. Also, I sometimes gloss over certain things and don't flesh them out as well as I could so having someone to point things like that out would really help the story.

Also, having someone to bounce ideas off of makes me a better writer.
