Firstly tell us what your story is about. If its something like Draco/Hermione, Slash, or Harem that's something a beta may have an issue with.

Secondly what are the things you want in a beta? Someone to give feedback on plot arcs? Characterization? Or just someone to proofread for spelling and grammar purposes?
