I doubt that any former Marine would be comfortable with the idea of child soldiers unless you go with Audie Murphy as the dimension traveller. Teaching the DA how to defend themselves yes, but turning them into a fighting force? Why not simply travel to Eastern Europe after the Warsaw Pact collapsed, organise a few weapons and then use them together with the Invisibility cloak to clean house? Not traceable with magic and this plan does not rely on using 14-16-year-old children in combat situations.
