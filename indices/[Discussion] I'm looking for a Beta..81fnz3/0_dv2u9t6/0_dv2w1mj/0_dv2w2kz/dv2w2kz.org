  After a panicked rescue, a man wakes up in a familiar shack. He thinks he's gonna be stuck in a book series, but, its a whole lot worse. - So this is my first HP fanfic This will kind of be a self insert, however, I am going to make it more humorous than serious. PARTS OF THIS STORY WILL BE COPIED DIRECTLY FROM THE BOOKS BECAUSE ROWLING IS A BETTER WRITER THAN ME! I OWN NOTHING!
