I've typed four different answers to this question and I can't figure out how to describe it.

Okay, the short version is a former US Marine has an accident on a cruise ship during a storm and dies. He wakes up as Harry in the shack where Hagrid finds him and the Dursleys. Over the first few years he does his best to learn but is not a SuperSmart!Harry or SuperStrong!Harry until way later (like 5th or 6th year). He has quite a bit of knowledge about the books and plays with the timeline a little bit (I'll explain more about that if you agree) but doesn't completely throw everything out the window. When the war happens, he uses his military background to prepare the DA, however, I'm also going to have Voldemort's people more capable as enemy combatants as well. I'm not trying to turn this thing into "Platoon" or "Saving Private Ryan" but I think a more tactical war would make for a very interesting deviation from the standards we usually see in fanfics.

In addition to all of that, he's not in the HP books world. He's actually in a fanfiction. He has to navigate Ancient and Noble Houses, attempted Harem's (This will be SFW, I'm not writing smut........ yet.....) comically overbearing Weasley mothers, etc.
