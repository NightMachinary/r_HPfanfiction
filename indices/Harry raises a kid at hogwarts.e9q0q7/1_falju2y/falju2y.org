Oh, Harry raising a kid, I like this trope a lot. Linkffn(3123443), The Little Child to Lead Him, was a decent fic about this and one that I enjoyed. For post-Hogwarts have you read linkffn(11111990), Grow Young with Me? This one was a very good Harry focusing on being a dad fic that I liked a whole lot and one that I found had a spark. Hmm, this one isn't quite Harry raising a kid completely, but its a story about Harry and a young child that I find stupidly endearing, linkffn(12265183) Picnic Panic. This one is an absolute favorite and super endearing, once it moves past the Ron bashing that happens in the first half of the first chapter.
