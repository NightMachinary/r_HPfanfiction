This is something that gets floated around the HP fanbase quite a bit.

Personally my favourite theory and the one I could believe is that as Grindelwald was rising to power, he imperiused a young rising star in Germany and the rest as they say is history...

However, another theory that I myself have is that perhaps Grindelwald was one of those Eastern European collaborators who rose through the ranks of the Nazis and had his own reign of terror but unlike most of his collaborators, his campaign of fear almost exclusively waged against magicals?

These are just theories though. Nothing concrete because there's no real canon evidence to prove anything.
