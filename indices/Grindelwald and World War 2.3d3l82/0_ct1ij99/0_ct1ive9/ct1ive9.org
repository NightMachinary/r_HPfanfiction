*Conclusion*

Ultimately, I think there are a great many ways the wizarding and muggle war could have been connected. Because they ended at the same time, I must believe that they were deeply connected.

I do not see a very plausible way of a muggle war starting a wizarding one. Perhaps a Japanese one, against the USA (Or the British Empire!?) after the nuclear attacks.

While firebombs and conventional weaponry would be too slow to kill wizards by much other than chance, the annihilation of two cities probably killed a great deal of wizards by chance. I do not know the formula of wizards:muggle in Britain to apply it to Japan, but I'd say it likely at least some perished in the attacks.

It's also weaponry on a scale that seems unlikely for muggles to have, so it could have been suspicion of a magical attack. I have fondled with the idea of using Hiroshima/Nagazaki as a catalyst for a wizarding war with Japan, I must admit.

Either way, based on my previous statements, I must say that it seems incredibly likely that the War started with Wizards. Maybe it was started because the Magical Voivode of Rzeczpospolita Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego spilled pumpkin juice on.. Emperor? Chancellor? Fuhrer? Grindelwald's robes. Maybe it was a territorial expansion of Magical France into Magical Germany.

Maybe Grindelwald just felt like a particularly evil villain and decided to assassinate the Grand Magical Archduke of Austria and bring War because.. why not?

Alternatively, to line in with Canon a little bit, its possible that Grindelwald began establishing his Greater Good policies in Germany and enslaving the muggles, and other Wizarding nations interfered out of the good of their hearts (Read; to preserve the Statute of Secrecy).

Possibly foreign powers declared war to topple Grindelwald and stop the utilitarian plan. Maybe Grindelwald's /reich/ (empire? kingdom? a god damn republic? WE KNOW TOO LITTLE, J.K!) declared war when offended by foreign interference?

Possibly the Greater Good plan succeeded in Germany, under the guise of a National Socialist fascist government, and war was declared because Grindelwald needed to control the wizarding population in a location before he could begin enslaving the muggles there.

/Note; Another theory is that the relative ease the Wehrmacht crushed opposition with was because Grindelwald's wizards had already conquered the enemy wizards there, and used their funky mind magic to make a muggle conquest relatively easy? Then the turn and consequent defeat of the Wehrmacht could be attributed to when foreign Wizards at last managed to make a stand against Grindelwald. Perhaps Russia could be large players?/

In the end, its impossible to say something for certain, and the events surrounding WW2 are vague and broad enough to be twisted to almost whatever the fanfic you write requires. If you need super!evil Hitler-is-literally-Antichrist Axis from a modern perspective, there certainly is enough evidence and misinformation to support that. If you want a Blamed-by-the-Allies ala WW1 setting, there certainly is enough evidence and misinformation to support that, too.

WW2 was such a massive event, and there is too little known about it to even establish everything about the real one. With the little worldbuilding outside of Harry's life J.K did, almost everything about Wizarding WW2 is pure guesswork and estimations.

Either way, I'd love to hear some comments and further discussion on this. I'm sure I have some silly points, and some wrong ones, but hey, that's what Reddit's for, right?
