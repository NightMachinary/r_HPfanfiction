My thoughts on the subject of Grindelwald is that, as far as involvement in the Third Reich goes, he was not the power behind the throne, so to speak.

See, my headcanon when it comes to Grindelwald's reign as a Dark Lord was that, whereas the other Dark Lords sought to attract the pureblood elites into their ranks, Grindelwald went the other way.

One thing that truly struck me in canon was the fact that Durmstrang was pureblood only.

Now let's assume that as far as the European continent is concerned, Beauxbatons basically took in students from west and south of Germany-France, Holland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal to name a few. Given that this is prior to World War two, you can also make the assumption that Beauxbatons offered schooling to wizards and/or witches from French colonies such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, the Mauritius Islands etc.

Switzerland, given that it's the Helvetian Confederation, would either have its own hilariously over-defended and secretive school (muggle Switzerland takes its home defence /very/ seriously, hence nigh-on universal national service, the obligation to own & maintain military-grade weapons in everyday households and enough mountain shelters built to withstand direct hits from nuclear weaponry to house and sustain a substantial percentage of the population in case world war three breaks out. Do NOT fuck with the Swiss) or would have the choice of either Durmstrang or Beauxbatons.

Beauxbatons is about as inclusive as you can get. It routinely accepts Veela, has a half-giant headmistress in canon and is known to also accept muggleborn though whether or not there are selection criteria is very much not commented upon.

Durmstrang, on the other hand, is commonly thought to service Northern and Eastern Europe. Germany, Austria, Russia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are some of the countries you'll find in that part of the world. It is also known for two things-first, it teaches Dark Magic as part of the curriculum. DADA would be mistaken as a muggle artistic movement by your average Durmstrang graduate-if said graduate happened to have any knowledge of the muggle world because this school does not accept any muggleborn at all.

Think on that for a moment. The most prestigious magical school in Eastern Europe leaves the muggleborn out in the cold. They get accepted into lesser schools where, presumably, their education suffers as a result. They then enter magical society at a distinct disadvantage due to their heritage and cannot, in theory, fight back against Durmstrang graduates who have had seven years' worth of training in the Dark Arts before they even enter the magical world.

Downtrodden, kept from moving up the social and economic ladder at every turn, the muggleborn aren't in a good spot to do anything about it.

Which is where Grindelwald comes in. He has, in this lot, a ready-made army with which he could conquer Europe provided they are willing to follow him. In exchange for further training and better positions in his new regime, he would have them do just that-conquer magical Europe in his name.

There is only one problem, namely his army's origins.

The Nazis had no qualms in labelling Eastern Europeans as inferior. Jews, Gypsies and Slavs were well known targets for their ire from very early on in the history of the Nazis, though Hitler did tone down the slav bit at the start of world war two-at least until the Wehrmacht moved into Russia.

The problem for Grindelwald would have been that most of the muggleborn in his army would have roots in the muggle communities affected by the nazis and would, therefore, blame him if they did anything nasty to their relatives (which they certainly would have).

So, if Grindelwald wanted to keep his army happy enough to do his bidding, he would have had to distance himself from Hitler's views. A select few of his army would have been German and they would have liaised with the nazis in order to ensure cooperation, but I think that that was as far as Gellert's cooperation would have been able to go under the circumstances. Do a job for Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels or Goering every now & then and be repaid with extra armaments, passes for Grindelwald's men around the Reich, maybe some possessions 'liberated' from captured countries etcetera. An easy, but definitely hands-off relationship.

In the meantime, he was free to follow the German advance with his own Army, catching the wizarding governments with their pants down as they tried to keep the nazis from butchering their muggle counterparts and ruining the magical society that depended on trade with said muggles to keep their economy going (money goes some places, but gold goes everywhere as they say). He would slaughter the wizards fighting the Nazis, using the subsequent goodwill to gain access to weapons or goods he could then deploy against a now defenceless wizarding enclave, raining /nebelwerfer/ rounds and 200 pound bombs down on the heads of the panicking citizens while his troops massacred anyone who did anything other than submit.

This way, when the Russians rolled in, he could also strike the same deal with them whilst posing as a resistance fighter-help in subduing nazi collaborators on the magical side in exchange for killing nazis. And if said nazi collaborators happened to prance about in robes and pointy hats? Well, they were wannabe nazis in Eastern Europe. Kinda strange to start with.

Of course, he didn't count on the war actually ending. Which is when, in my mind, Dumbledore would have pounced.
