Well, its very hard to say. We don't know everything about the second world war, and we know /very/ little about the wizarding one.

I think it is an interesting idea. Rowling states that the wars 'fed into one another', but as seen in HBP, the wizards have pretty much full control over muggle governments. The Ministry could redirect the president of the USA, no questions asked.

So what does that say for World War 2?

We do not know if whatever wizarding factions located in Germany had the same levels of control over their muggle counterparts as in Britain. For that matter, seeing as the Statute of Secrecy was enacted in the 18th century, there was no Germany to be spoken of.

Did wizarding territories of the time mirror the muggle city states? Was there a wizarding Prussia? *Is* there a wizarding Prussia?

Bulgaria, however, /is/ a magical country. In the 18th century, Bulgaria was Ottoman. Is this an inconsistency? Maybe. Nations are dynamic, however. Just because Wilhelm and Bismarck united muggle Germany, it doesn't mean it happened on the wizarding side.

/(Side note; personal head-fanon is that Grindelwald is both wizarding Bismarck and Hitler - he united Germany, and he lead it to war.)/

The HP Wiki implies Grindelwald is Hungarian, or born somewhere in Eastern Europe. It doesn't seem very plausible, with him having very strong German themes, and sharing a last name with a Swizz village. Gellert is a Hungarian name, but that does not necessarily imply him being Hungarian, especially as a Wizard.

/If/ there was indeed a wizarding force behind the German government, as seen in Britain, it is a very broad topic to try and theorize what this means. How much did the wizards there actually care for muggle matters? Did they have anything to do with the Great War?

Personally, I like to think they didn't, but they played into WW2 because they saw how a great industrial war wreaked havoc on the world and the natural states of things. Did perhaps the great catastrophes a great modern industrial war like WW2 brought upon the world bring forth modern anti-muggle tendencies?

I can see wizards being wholly unconcerned with muggles pre-Industrialization (See; laughing at the effort of witch burnings.) but the tune changing once they could see just the spread of muggle madness. Hiroshima/Nagazaki? Certainly.

While Tom Riddle is implied to be /evil/ because of his conception and his youth in an orphanage, I could very well see his anti-muggle feelings growing from growing up in London and experiencing the war shortages and the Blitz. As a matter of fact, I cannot see any wizard experienced full-scale muggle warfare and going away with anything but decisively negative feelings. Maybe the level of governmental control seen in HBP arose after the war, and it wasn't in fact things like NATO and the threat of M.A.D that brought about /Pax Americana/, but rather wizarding control?

It certainly seems plausible.

I've rambled a bit, and lost the original thread - Grindelwald. Let me try to get back on track.

Let's head to the /big bad/ first.

*The Holocaust*

I've seen in a story I've now long forgotten, where Grindelwald was searching for some sort of artifact that had fallen into Jewish hands, and the Holocaust was used as a way to efficiently search for it. This, to me, seemed rather contrived and extremely shoehorned.

The idea of the Holocaust itself is very, *very* touchy. Either way, this is not the time nor place to debate the reality of such an event, so I will just consider the common /"6 million"/ story a fact in the wizarding alternate reality.

How does that key in? As far as I can tell, Grindelwald did /not/ consider muggles something to be exterminated, rather something to be enslaved by a superior ruling class. You could use the Holocaust as a method to being exterminating muggles. World population at the time appears to have been somewhere around 1,5 billions, which does make the supposed dead in the Holocaust rather inconsequential. For the amount of resources required for this operation, and the time invested, it does not seem worth it from a pragmatic wizarding view.

On the other hand, I once had a theory that the Holocaust was some sort of morbid industrialized /"human sacrifice"/, and that it was a wizarding ploy used for.. whatever you wish, really. You'd just need an appropriate /Ritual/ that required human sacrifice. Personal power for Grindelwald? Massive scale thought control? Maybe a /Bloodline Curse/ (ala /The Dresden Files/) keyed to possible every muggle, thus requiring the large numbers of subjects?

If you somehow needed a power-up for your WW2 era wizards, this certainly could be a way to do it. You'd probably (read; definitely) offend someone, seeing as you'd essentially call the nazi's blameless and blame everything on wizards, but someone would probably be offended if you were to mention this Era in the first place, but that is just the way of things.

*Grindelwald*

Where does he fit in? Was he just a /Voldemort/ of the times? People in the HP stories constantly imply that Voldemort is the darkest and evilest Dark Lord there ever was. Maybe they are exaggerating, because Voldemort is now and relevant while Grindelwald is old and imprisoned, but it still seems rather silly. If Grindelwald was, essentially, Wizarding Hitler, you'd have to do something with the term /Dark Lord/ to make canon not seem rather faulty.

Maybe a Dark Lord is a term for the head of a magical terrorist organization? Maybe Grindelwald didn't actually use Dark magic? Either way, if Grindelwald indeed /was/ a Dark Lord, he couldn't have been Wizarding Hitler unless most characters are vastly over-exaggerating Voldemort. It'd be like comparing Bin Laden to Hitler - although neither of these were actually powerhouses of /personal/ power, like Grindelwald and Voldemort. That is just the difference between a muggle and a wizarding leader, however.

So what if Grindewald was Wizarding Hitler? He'd have to be the leader of the German(?) wizards. Did he unite Germany? Did someone else? When? Did it fall apart after he fell? Why did everyone else not interfere when Dumbledore(?) /possibly/ wanted him jailed in Nurmengard? Surely Wizarding Hitler would have been executed as his defeat, or assassinated prior to imprisonment / in prison by someone he had wronged.

Dumbledore only interfered and fought him after /supposedly/ five years of war. We can't know if the wizarding war lasted as long, or was as spread out. Dumbledore was not the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards at the time, nor did he hold any important positions but teaching at Hogwarts. As such, it was clearly a personal interference, against his old friend gone /bad/.

Did Dumbledore act against his country, attacking a foreign leader? Or was England involved in the war at the time? If it was, why didn't he interfere earlier? Surely personal problems must have been set aside for the good of the country? Dumbledore's own ideological stance certainly wouldn't allow him to do such a thing - he and Grindelwald developed the /"Greater Good"/ philosophy together, after all.

*Britain*

Perhaps this means Wizarding Britain didn't enter the war until 1945, ultimately allowing Dumbledore to act openly against Grindewald. Fanfiction often portrays Wizarding Britain as weak and backwards, but seeing as the Statue was established in the 18th century, Britain was a very powerful empire.

The Statue of Secrect was enacted in 1692, 80 years before American independence. Does this mean the territories are still under British control, or do they follow a Bulgarian example and are now, too, independent? Did the wizards there follow their muggle counterparts, or would they remain content with English rule? Why wouldn't they? They wouldn't have grown so detached from the home country with the ability to create Portkeys and Apparition, and with a much smaller population, I could see it feasible that the American territories remained British in the magical world. That could very well be the case for other colonies, also.

Or, Wizarding Britain never had any colonies at all. Australia is mentioned in DH in connection with Hermione's parents. There are no special inclination that it has a deeper connection to Britain, and its likely Hermione only sent them there because they had wanted to go there, and it is an English speaking country. You could take this little connection and make it so that the colonies still remain Wizarding British, however.

If this is the case, the British Empire would be very fierce. The Union of the Crowns occured in 1603, while Great Britain was not formed until 1707, which is post the establishment of the Statute of Secrecy. One can say with reasonable security that there is no such thing as a Scottish wizarding government, however, and can reasonably conclude that it is a part of Britain. In fact, the Wizarding world is said to be British, so this is a confirmed fact.

*The War*

So why did the wizards allow a muggle war on this scale to escalate? It could have been a reasonable way for nefarious wizards to cull the population, or it could have been a matter out of control that they could not reign in. Alternatively, the muggles could have been mere puppets that possible wizarding factions threw at each other. While a magical war would be fought swiftly and in the shadows, a muggle invasion of Poland would probably be very distracting to possible Polish-Lithuanian wizards.

The land would scorch and burn, supplies would be cut of - it is reasonable to assume wizards get their food from muggles, as there doesn't seem to be sufficient infrastructure to allow otherwise. As such, a muggle proxy war could certainly be a viable strategy. It could also have been banned by the ICW post WW2, to go back to the point of a wizarding enforced peace. Either way, there are too many possibilities to be considered.
