Two of the stories that come to mind where their hatred is worked around are [[https://sites.google.com/site/harrydracosmoochfest2013/home/fics-and-art/kiss-the-joy][Kiss the Joy]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879835][Salt on the Western Wind]]. Kiss the Joy is set in the Room of Requirement just after the Battle, and is one of my favorite "after war healing" Drarry fics. It features plenty of antagonism between the boys and arguably some of the best intimacy scenes I've read because of the emotional way they're written. Salt on the Western Wind uses a type of bonding to get them to further the process of getting over their hatred, which normally I consider to be a copout, but it uses the troupe well in my opinion. I also enjoyed having Ron and Hermione's characters included; I like it when Harry's friendship with them shows some depth in fics, beyond the basic "I support you and your choice" or "I don't support your choice to be with Draco".

I also would recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]]. It's one of the most believable build ups that I have seen (aside from The Man Who Lived, that was already posted).
