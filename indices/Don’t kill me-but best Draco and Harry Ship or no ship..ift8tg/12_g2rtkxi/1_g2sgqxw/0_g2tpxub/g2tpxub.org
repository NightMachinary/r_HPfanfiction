No problem! Newts is also quite political now that I think about it, if you've read that one.

Some other fave Draco fics of mine, but you've probably read most of them or they're more on the fluffy side: linkao3(Tea and No Sympathy; Running on Air; All Our Secrets Laid Bare; The Bucket List by GallaPlacidia; A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption; Nearly Lost Things, Carefully Tended)
