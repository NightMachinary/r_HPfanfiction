Draco grows into a different person (for compelling, if somewhat disturbing, in-story reasons) in the linkffn(Innocent) series and ends up in Harry's circle of friends, but it's only a small thread in book 1, which is half a million words, and becomes more significant in later books, so if you're just after Harry/Draco it may not be the best choice. Great series though.
