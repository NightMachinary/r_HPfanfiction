There are some really wonderful Drarry fics out there. My favorite fic ever - het/slash/gen/whatever - is The Man Who Lived. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621]]. Not sure it counts as “gritty” but it's long, moving, sometimes very funny, and sometimes emotionally brutal.

Evitative [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461]] is a well-written Harry is resorted into Slytherin fic. Has some Drarry hinted at but really focuses more on their growing friendship.

The Blood Magic series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1068473]]. Very angsty, endgame Drarry, with Harry a drug addict and Draco fighting PTSD after the war.

I have others but not sure this is the type of thing you're looking for.
