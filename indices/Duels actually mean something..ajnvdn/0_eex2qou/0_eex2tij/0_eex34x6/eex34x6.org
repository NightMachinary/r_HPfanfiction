Could be. I just like to think of it as a partial reason why Harry always seems to have a leg up against Malfoy in most violent circumstances, and a sort of magical reason why they grow to hate and distrust each other so much after First Year.

I had bullies growing up, and we mostly just grew up and stopped caring about our differences. Harry and Draco have a long standing feud that sort of exacerbates everything whenever the two get involved in the same scheme.
