Man I have been recommending this story a LOT lately, but still

The Prisoners Cipher linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher)

Harry is already "evil" at the start, but as the story progresses you start to realize why he descended into literal madness. Most of the backstory is told in mermories and its more of a mystery to be solved. Dark ending.
