I don't know what would qualify as "more evil than Voldemort." Personally, I love fics in which Harry gradually falls down the slippery slope of morality. Here are a few that I have enjoyed:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] - linkffn(3688693) Tom Riddle's memories gradually slip into Harry's mind through dreams over the years. Harry's eventual quest to understand the Knights of Walpurgis sends him down a (figurative) dark rabbit hole. [COMPLETE: 20 chapters; some slash, but it's not a focus of the story]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][Welcome to Hogwarts 1949]] - linkffn(2550563) Harry travels back in time to the year Tom Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets. Harry doesn't realize just how far he will go to keep his own secrets and ensure he can return safely to the present. After all, if none of this is real then his actions don't really matter, that makes it ok... right? [DEAD: 28 chapters]
