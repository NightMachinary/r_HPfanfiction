Your fic looks extremely interesting to me. Considering you suggested on a "No Slash" post, I hope it isn't slash later on. Any other pairings in mind or you think it will be a gen fic ? I do love me some Harry/Daph, but I could see you not doing that. Gonna be reading it after I'm done with what I'm reading right now.
