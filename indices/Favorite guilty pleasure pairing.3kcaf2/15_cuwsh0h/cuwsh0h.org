Draco/Luna. It seems strange but it feels like they would work and wouldn't work at the same time. She is patient and kind but stern which he would need to get his act together. But she is also strange enough to be able to see past the person he puts forward. I am a believer that while Draco is a dick, he is completely capable of being a good person.
