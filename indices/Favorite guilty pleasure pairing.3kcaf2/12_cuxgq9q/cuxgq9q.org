Young Tom/Minerva (in a, erm, speculative way)

Heh, I actually feel guilty pairing anyone with teenage Voldy. He belongs more in an asylum than a pairing. Still, I think a well written pseudo-romance between (or even just a friendship) them would be really fascinating to read about. As long as it doesn't end happily becoz canon.

So yeah. Any recs?
