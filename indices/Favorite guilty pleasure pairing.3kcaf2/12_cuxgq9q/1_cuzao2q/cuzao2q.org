The only fic I've read (and sadly it's abandoned, I think) that had Tom/Minerva was this one: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/619228/chapters/1117296]]

Essentially it's an AU where Dumbledore and Grindelwald successfully took over Britain. Riddle never became Voldemort as a result, and instead teaches at Hogwarts alongside Minerva.

Any other Tom/Minerva recs? Preferably friendship.
