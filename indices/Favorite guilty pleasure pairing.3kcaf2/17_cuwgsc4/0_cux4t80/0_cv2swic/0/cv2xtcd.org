I have to mention a recent fic I came across - it is one of the best Snarry stories I have EVER come across. Ever.

Sticks to canon but with major tweaking on the side lines due to one of the best uses of time-travel I've ever read. Excellent character development, slow building relationship and wonderful characterization and building of Snape. Very funny especially early on, but gets darker and more intense as the time in the story passes. I highly recommend - it is a one-shot but very long and spellbinding. Added it to my uh, Snarry collection. Lol.
