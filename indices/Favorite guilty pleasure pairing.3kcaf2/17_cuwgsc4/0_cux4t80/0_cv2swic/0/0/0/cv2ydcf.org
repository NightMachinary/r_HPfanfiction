...To be honest, I've only recently got into HP fanfiction. I've read fanfiction for years in other fandoms but never HP (I only wanted to read the books)...but I've read some really good stories so far, most of which include Snarry - and yes, several on my list are the "classics".

There is an ongoing one I'm reading, has Snarry...but a very realistic and painful take on what would have happened if /they'd/ happened while at Hogwarts. What makes it interesting is that it is from Lupin's side as he's having his own personal problems with Tonks. Features varying amounts of horror from the Order of the Phoenix as well. If you're interested, I can link it. (And the author also writes some seriously excellent Harry/Hermione).
