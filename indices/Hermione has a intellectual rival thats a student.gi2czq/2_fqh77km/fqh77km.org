Not sure if Victoria Potter counts as genderbender since she was born biologically female and stays that way, but it's a good "female Harry" fic that includes what you've asked: linkao3(13795605)

Victoria gets into something of an academic rivalry with Hermione in the classes they have together.

No shipping yet, and if I know the author it probably won't happen until the inevitable sequel-fic.
