It tends to happen a lot in non-Harmonian smart!Harry and fem!Harry fics. I don't have any recommendations off the top of my head, but by searching for those keywords and excluding the Harmony 'ship, you'll find quite a few. In my experience, it usually ends up bashing Hermione or at least rubbing the rival's superiority in the reader's face a lot, but if you're into that sort of thing, who am I to judge?

Generally, my sense is that Hermione's canon personality isn't actually that aggressively competitive: she just doesn't resent others doing things better than her, and she doesn't prioritise being the best at anything, just being good for its own sake. For example, after Harry mastered the Patronus, she didn't rush to learn it; and after Harry got a better DADA grade than Hermione in Year 3, she proceeded to spend a big chunk of Year 4 helping Harry get even better at DADA. In Year 5, she could have probably maximised her own DADA proficiency by organising a small, easily hidden, study group of the best students in the year and inviting some NEWT students to tutor them; but instead, she tried to organise education of as many people as possible.

The only time she resented someone doing better than her---Harry in Potions in HBP---it was because she viewed the HBP book as recklessness and cheating.

Had she been sorted into Ravenclaw or Slytherin, she might have acquired a more "Best or Bust" attitude over time, but that didn't happen in Gryffindor.

That having been said, if events had conspired to put her into a proverbial arms race against one or more rivals or enemies, that could lead to her doing interesting things; I'd read that.
