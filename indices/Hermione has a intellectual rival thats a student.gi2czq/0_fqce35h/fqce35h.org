I read a fic where Hermione is replaced by an OC with a different family and a more... combative? ruthless personality? The point was that she would realistically go into Slytherin because she hadn't some kind of hero worship towards Dumbledore and instead of pacifying the blood purists or letting herself be a punching bag like some fanfics would make her be she would face head-on Draco and others and hit just as hard if not more right from the beginning. But on to your request, she develops a rivalry with the Patil twins that becomes so intense that Daphne started calling it indecent. Pansy was also some kind of rival in Transfiguration along with Padma because she had been tutored in the subject before Hogwarts or something like that.

This rivalry with the Patil twins is such that Valeria and Parvati are qualified as the two students that have the most problematic relationship along with Harry and Draco by the time of the inauguration of Lockhart's duelling club and it incites Snape to call them for an exhibition duel along with the two aforementioned boys. It's really interesting to read about the 'brightest witch of her age' still having rivals who sometimes win. The story is linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House). I know it's not exactly what you asked, but it's the closest I got and it's hands down one of the most well-written stories I've read. The first chapters are, allegedly, a bit rushed because the author wants to get to Hogwarts quickly, but this, in my opinion, along with some errors are nothing compared to the way the author shapes the story to differentiate it from the original and the way magic is used is really creative and the possibilities are explored while still sticking to canon or semi-canon material except when the author has to create it completely.
