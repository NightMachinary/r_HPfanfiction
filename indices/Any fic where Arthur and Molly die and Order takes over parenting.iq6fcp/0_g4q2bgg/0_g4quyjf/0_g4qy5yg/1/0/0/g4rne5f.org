As the old saying goes 'Where there's a will, there's a way.' Dumbledore would find a way to ensure that the Weasley children would be housed with their loving +sour+ aunt after all he isn't Chief Warlock & Supreme Mugwump with friends in high places for nothing! To be honest I'm going with the manipulative/senile Dumbledore trope for my idea. After all cupboard-Petunia & stamping-out-Vernon are the epitome of a loving family.

Most likely they'd just house them all in #12 Grimmauld Place like they did in canon.
