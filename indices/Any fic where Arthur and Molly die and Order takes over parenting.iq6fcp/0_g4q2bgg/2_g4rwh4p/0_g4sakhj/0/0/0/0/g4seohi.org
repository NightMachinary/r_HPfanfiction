They may know if he Apparates but they have no way to track him to his destination, especially if he Apparates multiple times. Coz otherwise Voldemort would have tracked Harry and Hermione after Godric's Hollow and I doubt their protective enchantments would hold up against him.

All this is basically Rowling trying to shoe horn an aerial battle into the book and doing a shit job at the required worldbuilding.
