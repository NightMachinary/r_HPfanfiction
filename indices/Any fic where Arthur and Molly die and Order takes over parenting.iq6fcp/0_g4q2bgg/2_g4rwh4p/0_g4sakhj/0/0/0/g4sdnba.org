  “We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Trans-port. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.”

I assume the Death Eaters know better than anyone if they couls have caught Harry when he apparites.
