Mundungus would be worst -- he's seen shirking his duties on several occasions, and I don't think he'd be any better when it comes to taking care of children.

Snape's biggest problems stem from his past and his emotional problems. If he did a honest attempt at it, he would at the very least make sure that the children aren't outright harmed, but how well would they be off in the end? He's not exactly the warm and cuddly type.

Moody would probably be the best emotionally of the 3, but with how unpredictable children can be at times, his paranoia could potentially cause the children to set off booby-traps or similar, which could lead to major harm.

So to summarize, I think Dung would easily be the worst. As for the other 2, it's a toss-up. Moody wouldn't be able to handle their unpredictability, while Snape wouldn't be able to give them the emotional support they'd need.

This is all assuming we're talking about small children who are still dependant on adults to a degree. Those at Hogwarts age and beyond would probably be able to cope best with Snape, because emotional neglect is probably less harmful for them (since they can get the emotional support they'd need from friends, etc) than Moody's traps.
