  In OotP, Molly is questioning what would happen to the kids if she and Arthur died. *Remus then says that the Order wouldn't just let them starve.*

They did such a swell job with Harry though, didn't they? I wouldn't really count on the Order to look after them; the kids would end up fending for themselves.

Good prompt, though.
