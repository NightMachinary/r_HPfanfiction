This isn't exactly trained by muggles but linkffn(Learning to Breathe).

Short version is that Sirius trained Harry using both muggle and magical means to turn him into a super-soldier to battle Voldemort. Even after winning, Harry swims around the lake and runs like 5 km in the morning just as a warm up. You ever see the anime Full Metal Panic!? This story is that in HP fantasy setting and without mecha. Harry is also emotionally obtuse, much like the Spartans are depicted in the Haloverse. It also has one of my favorite scenes in the fandom, where Harry uses his animagus form to defeat a magical beast (seriously its awesome).
