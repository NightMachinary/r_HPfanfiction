more recent, but does it change the original as it relates to this discussion?

this second post mostly examines copyright of fan fiction as in context of fan-fiction author's liability if they attempt to make money of it - summing it up as "plot can stand on its own, with no reference to the worlds, characters, or situations created by the original copyright holder." I have yet to read any fanfiction that would pass that test.

As far as copyrights of fanfiction authors themselves, this quote:

"But if your fan fiction story creates a new work that is based on the original, but transforms it into something new, that story could then be protected in its own right at least so long as it is a non-commercial work."

But the explanation that follows it restricts "new" rather severely. Pretty sure the way she explained it, that any story heavily featuring one of the major HP characters wouldn't qualify.
