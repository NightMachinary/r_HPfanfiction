  Nobody HAS to write fanfic. We don't get paid. It's not for profit. We do it for fun. Your attitude around this is poisonous to a community based on fans coming together and creating content around something we all enjoy.

I very well know that, that's why i'm replying to any comment and any email that you guys send to me. I understand that morally you're right and that is why i'm trying to resolve this issue.

But It is still nice to know that some of the people won't be able to sue me (realistically, not that they could - i mean we live in the world where thepiratebay exists, aren't we?).

  Just make it a super easy process for people to remove their content from your website, and stop acting as if it's some favor you're doing. It's disrespectful and rude.

It won't be a one click operation no matter what. I still need to confirm that people asking to remove their works are actual authors.
