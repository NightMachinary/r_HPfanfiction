Characters have certain aliases assigned to them. After fic is uploaded, it is analyzed and noted where each character has been mentioned in the fic. After that it builds a graph with those vertical lines. Each one is one mention (there's also a transparency involved, but that is besides the point).

Email seems to me like the most obvious way to ask for takedown notice without unnecessary complications. Not only that allows author to keep record that he/she sent request, but also in case i'll need to ask something that is more convenient for everyone.
