The point is? We didn't post it on this person's site. I say WE in this case because the fic in question on my end is a co-written piece. If we didn't put it there... it doesn't belong there. It is /really/ that simple.

My stuff individually appears only on one site. My co-writer's stuff? Appears on two sites. Both sites are WELL KNOWN and appear in searches if you type in either of our work. And those are the only sites they are supposed to be on.
