We "jumped on this bandwagon with pitchforks" because it is still our work. Again, /we/ decide where it is hosted.

With your analogy of a library? You have it backwards. In this respect the publisher is the "host". The Library is the Internet.

Real World example Harper-Collins does not have right to touch Orbit books. Two different publishers with two different author lists. If Harper-Collins were to try? Orbit would sue them in a heartbeat... because they have no right or legal grounds to touch /their/ writer's work.

So, in this respect, we have chosen our publisher(s). That publisher is not you. The books /are/ available at the library, but do not carry your mark on the spine.
