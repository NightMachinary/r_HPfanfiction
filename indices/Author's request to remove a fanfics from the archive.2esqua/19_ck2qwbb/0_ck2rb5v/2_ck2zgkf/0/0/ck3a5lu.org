My works are being posted elsewhere without my permission. I thank you for removing my works, but the point still stands. For example: when an artist has his/her work posted places without his/her permission, they stop posting their work. When a writer finds his/her works posted elsewhere without their permission, why wouldn't the same thing happen?

Harry Potter is about community. It's about being kind to one another because we all love the same thing. But here is a community of authors--friends of mine, fans of mine, people I am fans of--who are being disrespected like this and it's just not okay. I applaud you for trying to make things right now, but a bit of foresight could have prevented this entire situation.

If I take my works down from a site and you (the general you) have a private copy of my works, so be it. But you do not get to distribute it to other people. It is for your eyes only the moment it goes offline. If I say "Feel free to share my works however you see fit, as long as you give me credit", you are then allowed to share my works.

I like the idea of your archive, Kane, don't get me wrong. You did a great job on it. The character footprint is a gorgeous idea. I just don't UNDERSTAND, still. You never asked permission to use our works. Not once was there a "Can I keep your story archived on my site?"...in the email you sent me, you said, and I quote:

"Hi Kimmy. Just so you know the situation not only from your friends' description - FH is an automatic archive that saves all the works from ff.net in order to preserve them in cases when ff.net removes stories for various reasons.

P.S.: I assume the you are aware that all of the stories cite original authors and contain links to the original stories, right?"

You didn't attempt to apologize, ask permission, or anything. You just wanted to tell me that your archive was automatic and my friends were blowing things out of proportion. That is the problem here.

I'm sure half of these authors would be fine if you just asked permission. A little, "Hey, xxx, I'm sorry about that thing I did where I posted your story without letting you know. Can I keep it up there though?" would go a long way.

Thank you, however, for removing my works.
