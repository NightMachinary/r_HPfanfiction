  And people like you make it not so fun anymore. People like you are WHY stories are disappearing off the internet.

Could you explain logic here? I mean, how would a copy of someone works, linking to the original and the author, result in an author loosing his will to write.

That seems like a huge stretch and an argument for the sake of the argument.

  Which I did in my first email. But apparently I need to email you AGAIN, I need to make you comfortable, because this is apparently about you and not all of the authors who are upset you're hosting their works without their permission.

Didn't i explain why i was doing that? I did that because some of the authors said they are OK with FH keeping their stories. That's why i asked everybody once again - to make sure that i was removing correct stories.
