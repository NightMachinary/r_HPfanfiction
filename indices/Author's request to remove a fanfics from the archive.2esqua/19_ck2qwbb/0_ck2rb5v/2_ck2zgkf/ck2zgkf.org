Ahh, see, realists would realize just how crazy this whole idea was in the first place and realize how upset it would make people.

No. You did NOT ask permission. I'm sorry, but "explaining the situation" is not asking permission. Never have you said, "Sunset on Heartache, I would like to host your stories on my website. Is that alright with you?" You've simply state that they are there, and said that I could have them removed if I emailed you links. Which I did in my first email. But apparently I need to email you AGAIN, I need to make you comfortable, because this is apparently about you and not all of the authors who are upset you're hosting their works without their permission.

The interesting thing about libraries is that they're full of books that have been published, are original, and whose authors are making money off of them. Those authors have people who will stick up for them should someone "steal" (yes, I am going to say that) their works.

We do not.

We don't make any money off of this.

This is a fun hobby for us.

And people like you make it not so fun anymore. People like you are WHY stories are disappearing off the internet. Has one author who realized what you're doing come up to you and said, "Thank you for hosting my works without my permission"?

It doesn't MATTER if it doesn't hide the author. You're still doing this without anybody knowing about it. While we were contacting authors last night, do you know what one said to me? "This makes me so nervous."

Ughhh. I guess there's one thing to be said about you, and it's that you don't fold under pressure.
