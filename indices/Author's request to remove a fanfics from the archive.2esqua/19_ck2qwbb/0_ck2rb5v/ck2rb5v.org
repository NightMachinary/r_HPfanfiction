  Disregarding the fact that it's "too hard" to ask permission individually (I mean, come on, if you want to host our fanfiction you NEED TO ASK PERMISSION, regardless of how you do it), we've all emailed you. So you have our emails. You've talked to us. You've tried to convince us that this is a good thing.

Here's an interesting thing about libraries - by law every publisher in most of the countries has to provide certain number of copies to the state library. That is done so that information is always available freely and is not lost (no matter how bad that information is). Sure, this is not a very similar case, but nevertheless you should see the analogy here - FH is completely non profit. It doesn't make any money, it doesn't hide who is the author or where the original story is. Instead of leaving it be, some of the authors jumped on this bandwagon with pitchforks.
