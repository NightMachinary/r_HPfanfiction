The library analogy is a terrible one. A published author is agreeing to that when their text turns into an actual book. By publishing on ff.net I am agreeing that my work is ONLY accessed on ff.net. I choose to not have it in any other medium. Even your archive.

And I am also reserving my right to have it removed at a time that I see fit. I am not agreeing to make it public domain for all time.
