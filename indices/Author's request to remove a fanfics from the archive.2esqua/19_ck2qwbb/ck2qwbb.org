So you created a bot that automatically "preserves" fanfiction without the fanfiction owners' permission or prior knowledge, and you're upset that some authors want you to take them down? I just don't think you're connecting with why we're upset, to be honest.

And, as Bicky pointed out, through ALL of this conversation, never once have I (or any of the FFNet authors in our facebook group) been asked permission for you to host our stories.

Disregarding the fact that it's "too hard" to ask permission individually (I mean, come on, if you want to host our fanfiction you NEED TO ASK PERMISSION, regardless of how you do it), we've all emailed you. So you have our emails. You've talked to us. You've tried to convince us that this is a good thing.

But still you haven't asked permission?

I just don't understand.

Another thing--you're "preserving" the stories. However, the only one who has the right to "preserve" our writing is us. And we have. As Bicky told me, she has "back ups of her backups of her backups". Yeah, they're not online. So what? There's plenty of other fanfiction if, god forbid, something happened to our work. Nobody needs to read our work should we decide to delete it or if it's deleted and we choose not to repost it.

If you really can't ask permission, then you really don't need to be hosting our work. Just saying.
