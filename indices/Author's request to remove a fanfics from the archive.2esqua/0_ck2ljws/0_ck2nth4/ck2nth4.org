Perhaps I could suggest that if the site is truly intended as a "backup" version, in case things are lost, that you might switch the links around. This way the primary link, when they click on the story title, would take them straight to the ff.net website, where we have hosted our stories, and can communicate with our readers. Then you can put your backup link, your secondary copy that is supposed to be there just in case ff.net take stories down, as just that, a secondary link to the work, just where the FFN link is at the moment.
