  Also, what're you going to do, go to a lawyer and get them to shut down the Wayback Machine while we're at it? I'm pretty sure you'd be laughed out of a legal office for asserting you own anything based as deeply as fanfiction in someone else's intellectual property. But hey, mob justice is okay right? You get 'em.

Really? Hmm... the Wayback Machne also honors fanfic author's requests to remove their works and do so. They also honor DMCA takedowns on work that was stolen, also from fanfic authors.. Get over yourself. If it's so bad, why are you hear and obviously reading it.
