I love how you failed to address any of my other points. Thank you, you fail at reading comprehension. Please start sending letters of inquiry to every author and publishing house that owns any world you've written fanfiction in, post-haste.

Get over myself? If what's so bad? I feel like you're just being angry because you feel personally attacked by this person, whose intent was to make sure that content that was removed by sites who find it objectionable is still accessible somewhere. Obviously, if you're an active author, you'll repost it. But what about those authors who have long-since left whatever fandom they wrote in? Should their work simply vanish forever? Because of your wounded pride, it might.

Now, assuming you're an author whose work has been collected by the robot that assembles that site, and you take umbrage with this fact, you can then e-mail the administrator and have your work removed. Not a huge deal.

But what you're arguing is "Do it my way because I said so." That is not okay.

As for why I am here and reading this thread, it's because I enjoy fanfiction, and I welcome a place where I might be able to someday find an old favorite that's long since gone missing otherwise. I feel I should show my support. If that means arguing with someone like yourself, then so be it.

Addendum: /Everyone/ based in the US honors a DMCA takedown notice. The penalties for not complying are stiff for hosting companies. If, for example you had a Youtube channel, I could file a DMCA takedown notice on your wholly owned and self-created content, and Youtube would automatically take it down. The process for countering a fraudulent takedown notice exposes you individually to the person filing the takedown, since your personal information is required to proceed and file a counter-notification. At no point is the takedown filer required to identify themselves. Abusing a poorly weighted and most-probably broken system is not the way to ensure your wishes are followed.

(I had no idea where to put that final segment, but it needed saying.)
