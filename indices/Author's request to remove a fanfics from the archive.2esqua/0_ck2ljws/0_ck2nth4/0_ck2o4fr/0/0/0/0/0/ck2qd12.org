I have also said that i understand that it would be impossible for a robot to do, and so yes, i would expect you to contact the authors individually. I do understand that this is a mammoth task, and probably a large part of why no one has created an archive like this before. I understand that this is not going to be an easy fix and yes I do get that you don't add the stories manually, but in the case of getting permission, it isn't something that you can refuse to do because it is difficult or inconvenient. I do not believe that I am being unreasonable, and nor do the other authors. And I would like to point out that we have been talking a lot, and yet, still, not once, have you asked for permission to host our stories.
