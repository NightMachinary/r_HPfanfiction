You dug your own hole, now you get to climb out of it.

There is an old adage we teach our children when growing up; if you don't own it or can't get permission, don't take it. That's where you are. In doing that, you are now invoking the wrath of many. We have every right to demand you contact authors before using works that don't belong to you. It's /not/ going too far for you to do that. Your 'bot be damned. YOU run the bot, so it's YOUR problem. Shoulda' thought of this before you set that bot up, shouldn't you? I'm sure your ISP and webhost will see it that as we're all reporting you there as well. Let's see what they say about what you should do, hm?
