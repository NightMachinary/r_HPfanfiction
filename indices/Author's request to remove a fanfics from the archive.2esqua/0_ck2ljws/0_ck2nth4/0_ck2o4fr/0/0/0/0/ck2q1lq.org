Bicky, i explained at length that it is impossible to ask every author for their permission. If you have any ideas, do explain how does FictionHunt robot is supposed to find your and the rest of the author's emails. Or would you expect me to contact each author individually? You understand, that i don't add fics manually by hand, right?

I've done as much as possible to comply with various author's suggestions, but at this point you're being unreasonable and simply taking this issue way too far.
