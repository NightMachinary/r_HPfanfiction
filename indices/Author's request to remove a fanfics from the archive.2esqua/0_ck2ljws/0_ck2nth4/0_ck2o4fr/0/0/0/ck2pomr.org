Yes, I do mind. Because while these actions you are taking are great, and are appreciated, I do not think we have dealt with the core issue here, which is that you haven't made any attempts to ask for permission. Until that is addressed, the petition will remain. (my suggestion would be that you actually remove the archive links for the stories until you have permission from the authors, which I am aware is a time consuming job that would have to be done almost one at a time, but you have your archive, and that isn't going anywhere. Therefore you have the time now to ask permission properly, before you host stories online without the permission of their authors.)
