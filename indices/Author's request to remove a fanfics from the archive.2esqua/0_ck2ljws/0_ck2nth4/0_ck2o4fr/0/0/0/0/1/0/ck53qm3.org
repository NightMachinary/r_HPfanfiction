This cuts both ways. Calm your misplaced righteous fury. If people have to contact you to re-host your work, then /you/ have to contact the rightful owners of each and every intellectual property every time you write anything using something they own!

Add to a story? Contact the owner, get permission. Otherwise, you can't publish it.

Write something new? Contact the owner. They say no? Too bad, you can't publish.

What's that, it's too much work, the author is dead, but the work is still owned by their estate, or the copyright is in limbo, and you can't figure out who owns it? Too bad.

That's essentially your tone here. I for one, do not appreciate it.

Also, what're you going to do, go to a lawyer and get them to shut down the Wayback Machine while we're at it? I'm pretty sure you'd be laughed out of a legal office for asserting you own anything based as deeply as fanfiction in someone else's intellectual property. But hey, mob justice is okay right? You get 'em.

I'd castigate you further, but I find you beneath contempt.
