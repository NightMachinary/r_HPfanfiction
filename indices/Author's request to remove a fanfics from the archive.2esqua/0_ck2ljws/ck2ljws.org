I think there's a disconnect here--I don't think people going to your site understand what your site's intentions are. It's not clear anywhere that you made it to archive deleted stories, which I think you need to say somewhere. Authors who find their stories on your site may be understandably upset that your site is taking away traffic from their story on FF.net (and thus reviews and follows, etc). Your link to the FF.net story /isn't/ clear; I completely missed that little greyed (FF) and would have no idea it was a link, let alone a link to the FF.net story unless you mentioned it. If the link to the FF.net story were the main link and your archive were greyed and clearly labeled as "fictionhunt archive" it would clear up a lot of confusion.

But even so, I think plenty of authors are uncomfortable with their stories being hosted on sites that they did not personally post on. Mirrors and archives are usually only trouble no matter the intentions, diverting traffic from the original source and inconveniencing authors who no longer want their stories online (sure there's always an archive somewhere, but at least no one so easily accessible). You should handle individual requests of authors the very least--you shouldn't host their content if they don't want you to. It'd be disrespectful and only discourage people from posting creative works online.
