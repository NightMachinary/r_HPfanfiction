What if the author asks you to take the story down from your site and later takes it down from ff.net? Is it available somehow by some kind of private request form?

Edit: Just clarifying. I'm asking about if the stories are NO WHERE ELSE on the internet, as in have been taken down from everywhere, will they be able to be requested somehow. Like a last resort.
