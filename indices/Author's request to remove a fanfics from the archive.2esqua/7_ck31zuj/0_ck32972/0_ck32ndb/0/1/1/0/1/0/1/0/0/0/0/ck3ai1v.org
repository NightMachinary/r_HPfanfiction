It a really good thing that your mind is not the mind of the general population because if it was society would be more fucking pathetic then it already it. I cannot believe you are so naive to think that just because YOU believe in a certain thing. As it has already said, when an author posts on the internet it belongs to them. End of story. Good bye. The End. It really is not a hard concept to grasp. The fact that you have continually failed to see that leads me to believe you are not with the rest of us in the real world where Copyright is a well received concept.

Plus, handing something out is a completely different point all together. Publishing something is something you have done, it is yours to own, yours to do as you please with. When you GIVE something out you are doing just that, giving it away. The word give means (in case you missed the concept of giving now) to freely transfer the possession of (something) to (someone). Which means you remove all legal right to it.

To publish means to prepare and issue (a book, journal, or piece of music) for public sale. Which means, unless asked or bought, something that an author has published is not available for anyone simply because they 'want' it. Also, in case you are unaware, the word issue means the action of supplying or distributing an item for use, sale, or official purposes. To which has not happened here.
