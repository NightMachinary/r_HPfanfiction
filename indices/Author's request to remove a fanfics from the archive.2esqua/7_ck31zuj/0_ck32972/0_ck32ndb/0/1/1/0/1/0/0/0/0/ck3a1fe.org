Forgive me but I think my brain just malfunctioned. So you have the right to view ANYTHING you want on the internet? So someone posts 'photos' (your choice not mine) of something they've worked on but have decided they want to make it exclusively buy it online only and you go around sending people a way to download this artwork for free, thus disrespecting the creator of that artwork/photo and you think this is okay?

Well I must be a special kind of stupid because that is just messed up.
