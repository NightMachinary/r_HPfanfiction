It isn't naïveté. It's common bloody decency. You. Don't. Take. What. Isn't. Yours. What part of that do you not understand?! Do I need to write it in crayon?! I am having to spend my day off (the only day I'm getting off for a week) dealing with this crap because some bonehead thinks it's perfectly okay to take MY work and the work of my FRIENDS and post it somewhere we don't bloody want it!
