I don't expect the author to do anything. I at least was trying to say I understand if they have legal reasons to not want the story available anymore and understand them taking it down but I don't have a problem with people passing around private copies.

The poster of the thread made this good example.

  And here's an example: say, you wrote a book. You printed it in 100 copies then you put it on a cart and went to the city center giving a copy of your book to anyone who would ask. Later on, you've had a change of heart and would like to take all the books you gave away. What would happen?

Stuff gets "taken off" the internet every day, and I don't have a moral problem with people passing it around after it's been officially taken off.
