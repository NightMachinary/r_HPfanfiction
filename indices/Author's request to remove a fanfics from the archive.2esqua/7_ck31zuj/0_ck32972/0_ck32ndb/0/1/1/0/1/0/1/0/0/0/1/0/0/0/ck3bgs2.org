I said I disagree. In this case, I don't care what the authors want. Theft or not is semantics or a legal argument which isn't what I'm arguing. I disagree that they are a bonehead, I think they are doing a good thing. Probably went about it the wrong way, but a good thing. My logic isn't flawed. It is internally consistent. It just disagrees with you.
