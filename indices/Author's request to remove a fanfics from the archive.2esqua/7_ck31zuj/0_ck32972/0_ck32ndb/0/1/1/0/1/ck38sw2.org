Why in Merlin's name would you think that it would be ok to ask for private forms when there is, as we speak, many authors demanded their stories be removed! Surly, common sense tells you that the authors of the work will not be happy with him giving private forms. Is it that difficult to fine the actual author and ask them like a decent person.
