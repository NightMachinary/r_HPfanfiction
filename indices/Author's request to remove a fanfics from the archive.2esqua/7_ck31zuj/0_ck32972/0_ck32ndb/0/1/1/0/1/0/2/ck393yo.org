As authors we have the right to take down what we don't want up. If it's taken down chances are the author doesn't want anyone reading it anymore. There are several Fics i can no longer read and respect the author enough not to go behind their backs and try to download something I have no right to have. Seriously. It's rude and disrespectful. As an author you should understand this.
