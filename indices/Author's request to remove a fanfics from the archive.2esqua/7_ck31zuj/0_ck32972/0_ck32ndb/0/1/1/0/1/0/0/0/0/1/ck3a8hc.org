It's different if the person then wants to sell it for profit. They probably made a mistake in posting it first but I would comply with their wishes. Distributing it in this instance is denying them money, what they have determined to be fair compensation for their work. I was talking about a photograph that someone removed just because they didn't want others to see it anymore, like people do to fanfiction. In my mind it's two different scenarios because one you are monetarily hurting someone and in the other they just want something.
