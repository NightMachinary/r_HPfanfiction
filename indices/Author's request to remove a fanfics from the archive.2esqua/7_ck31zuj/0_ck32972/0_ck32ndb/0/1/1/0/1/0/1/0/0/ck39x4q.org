Yes. They do know what they are getting themselves in to because they choose to publish their work on an EXCLUSIVE website... meaning it was meant for that website alone. It isn't for someone to come along and take it. There is a reason why sites like FF.Net has privacy clauses. Ever heard of privacy, because I think you are lacking the definition of the word. Authors put time and effort in to their work, they place it where they want it and they do not expect it to be taken from them. It is exactly the same as building something, or painting something, it is not right for that piece of art, once it's been removed, to then go on display somewhere else simply because other people want to see it again. It's called having respect for the authors decision to remove their work and dealing with it.
