I agree whole heartedly with taintedtash. How DARE you. You have been told by /multiple/ authors to /remove/ our work from your site. I know for a fact that Tash is one of them. And when we say /remove/ via DMCA we mean it all. /Totally. Completely. Absolutely. ENTIRELY./

That means no link-back, it must be gone. Completely. As for the person asking about fics? Most of us have had our work STOLEN from fanfiction.net by this... cretin. Mind you, this may create a rash of removals by the writers themselves, because this... this...

I don't have a polite word for this. It is OUR work. We post it where we want for a reason.

Consider this, all of you. If every author that writes fanfic were to receive a C&D tomorrow, /this/ place, in it's original format would be violating the terms of the C&D, but WE, the writers, wouldn't be able to DO anything about it, because WE did not put our works on his site. That, in part, is why the control of WHERE our work is hosted ultimately lies with the writer.
