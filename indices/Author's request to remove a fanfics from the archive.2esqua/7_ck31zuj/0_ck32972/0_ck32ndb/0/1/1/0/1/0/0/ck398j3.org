It's not your right to have them. Authors down for a multitude of reasons. One, they get published and have a no fanfic clause in their contract. Then you are jeopardizing their livelihood. Two for retooling. Three because they want them off the web. Four, the reason I have so many, because people can't stop this crap and steal them. They repost them without permission. That makes you irate.

Just because your want something, it's not your right to have it. All there is to this. If it's gone, it's gone. Too bad. People that write put countless hours into their stories. Not to mention blood, sweat and tears. It's their right what they do with it. Not your to think because it's 'only' fanfiction that you get to have it. The world doesn't work this way!
