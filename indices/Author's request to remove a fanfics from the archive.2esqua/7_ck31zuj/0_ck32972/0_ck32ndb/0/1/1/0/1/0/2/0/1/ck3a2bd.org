You're a special breed of fool, aren't you?

Not your right to have it. Period. Copyright attaches even to fanfics. Period. The authors own them. Period. They decide what's done with them. Period. Even on the internet. Period. Everything is on the internet, including published books. Authors get to remove those, too. As do publishers. Just because 'you' don't mind doesn't meant that carries over. Just because 'you' don't agree, doesn't mean you're right. It just means you're the kind of person that allows this crap to propagate and encourages these people.

It comes down to one simple fact; the person that wrote it owns it and gets to decide what to do with. Your opinion on the matter means nothing. Whether you personally agree means nothing. And they are preserved. The author has them. If they want it shared, so be it. If they want it kept in their desk drawer and for no one else to lay eyes on it, like so many of mine, so be it as well. You have no say so in the matter and your opinions on it count for nothing.

Quit being one of the 'entitled' ones that feel because 'they' want to read it, 'they' should be allowed. You aren't. If you missed the boat, not the author's issue. It's yours. Deal with it and find something else.

This isn't about preserving anything. When you publish, be it a book or magazine, you still own it and have say-so in what's done. It also means for every use they have to pay you, via the internet or not. Doesn't matter. It boils down to not your right to have it. Ask the author. They say no or don't answer, you're SOL in getting it.
