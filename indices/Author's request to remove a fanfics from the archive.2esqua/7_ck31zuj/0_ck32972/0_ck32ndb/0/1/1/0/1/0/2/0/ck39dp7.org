I don't agree with this, sorry. If you put something up somewhere that it's publicly accessible on the internet you should assume that it's going to be available forever. That, in my opinion, is part of the reason for internet aliases, so when you don't want something attributed to yourself or think there's the potential for this in the future you don't attribute it to yourself.

I don't think it's disrespectful or rude. If I ever removed my work and people were still passing around private copies I would see that as a valid consequence of making something publicly available. If you don't want people to be able to access something, if you want to be able to retract it at some point in the future, don't put it on the internet. I thought this was basic knowledge.

I just disagree with this fundamentally. Creations should be preserved even if the creator doesn't want them to be.
