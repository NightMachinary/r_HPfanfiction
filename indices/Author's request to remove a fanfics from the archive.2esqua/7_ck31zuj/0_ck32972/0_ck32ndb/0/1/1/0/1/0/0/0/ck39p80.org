I think of it like a photograph. Someone publishes it on the internet. Then later they want to take it down. But people still want to see it. I don't have a moral problem with people still passing around the file for private use even though someone else created it.

When I publish something online, I think of it like sending a story to a magazine. You're signing over the rights to it. They have control of it now. Well when you put something on the internet, even though you still retain control of where it is, I think there's an implication that it's publicly available now.

Mostly, I think I don't sympathize with people who take down stories enough. I understand them wanting them to not be "published" as in posted to a site anymore. I get that. Legal reasons, don't want them up there, don't want to be associated with them anymore, etc. But I don't sympathize with people who create marvelous things for public consumption and then deny the public that. I frankly don't care that they have a "right" to the creation. If it was on someone's computer, and never posted then that's different. That's still their private thing. But when you stick it on the internet, it isn't your private thing anymore. It's the public's.

If say something profound and later take it down, I don't really care you want it gone, and I will work to keep the art you created alive and available for people to enjoy.
