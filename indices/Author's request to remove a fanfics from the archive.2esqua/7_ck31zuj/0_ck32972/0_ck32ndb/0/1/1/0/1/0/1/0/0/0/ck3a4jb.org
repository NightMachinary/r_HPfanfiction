I don't believe authors are really so naive as to think that posting it on FF.net means that they'll be able to delete all publicly available copies.

When I put something on the internet, whether it is fanfiction (I have two stories of my own) or something on facebook, original fiction, whatever, I put it on the internet with the understanding that no matter what I do to try to delete it it will be available until the end of time. I thought this was a basic assumption. I guess some people think that you can make things publicly available, like sticking a painting out in the middle of the street, or handing out free copies of a book at a supermarket, and expect to get all the copies back at some point.

In my mind, when you make something publicly available, you do so with the understanding that it will be so forever. If someone put their photograph on a website and later tried to take it down, or handed out copies in the street and later tried to get them back I would have no compunctions keeping a copy for private use or downloading a copy of the photograph to keep for myself.
