Primary link would always link to the original story. If author asks to remove his or her story i'd comply and that story won't be available via Archive link too. It'll be listed as a title, summary and other details, but there won't be any text.

Rather then explaining here's the result of taking down a fic - [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9809583/1]]

I wonder if i should remove footprint thingy from removed fics.
