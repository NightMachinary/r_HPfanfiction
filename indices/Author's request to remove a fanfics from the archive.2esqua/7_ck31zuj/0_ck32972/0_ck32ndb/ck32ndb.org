I've gotta admit you have a good search engine, and the character footprint thingy is kinda cool.

I would have asked you to take my stories down if you were taking traffic away from FFn though, to be honest. So does the primary link send to your archive rather than FFn when the story in question is taken off of FFn (whether by the author or site) ? Is that how it works?
