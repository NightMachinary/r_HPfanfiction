I'm not an author but I just want to say that this fella's site has a search function that actually helps find specific stories and types of story, which means I could find, read and love some fics that I would otherwise have never seen and for that I thank them. You know, what with the search on ff.net being a bag of wank. The site helps get the fics out there and seen by people, which ultimately is what most writers want when they post online. Edit: also, any idea for when the site will be back I have a bunch of fics i want to read which I won't be able to find again otherwise
