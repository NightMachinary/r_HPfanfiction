Might be worth sending the mods of FFN a message and see if they're willing to endorse you, that way it can be part of their T&C's that you have to be okay with your story being archived to post.

If I were you i'd just remove the stories of the people who are getting annoyed about it for now and stick something on your site to say you'll take down a story if requested, you'd be a dick not to.
