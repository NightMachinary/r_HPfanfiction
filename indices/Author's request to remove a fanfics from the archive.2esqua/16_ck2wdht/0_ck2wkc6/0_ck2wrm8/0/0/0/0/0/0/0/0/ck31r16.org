It's hard not to be upset when you realize something was done with your work without your knowledge. I upload to ff.net because I like certain things about the site, so to find out that my fic was uploaded to another without my knowledge or permission of course gets me upset. I want to know where my fic is at. I want to know how it is doing on a daily basis with traffic. I could upload to other fanfic sites, but I choose not to. I felt like this took away my choice. Was that your intention? No, clearly it was not and I can see that now, but that's how you made me feel and I believe that is how you are making others at this moment feel.

If I had not been a redditor I wouldn't have known my fic was uploaded to FH. And that upset me. So it automatically puts you and many authors on the wrong foot. BUT my beta talked me down. He thinks this is a "valuable service" and we discussed your site more. The only main problem I have with it now is I don't like the highlighting. I get what you are saying, but I would rather it not be highlight able. Do I just send an email saying to disable the highlighting?
