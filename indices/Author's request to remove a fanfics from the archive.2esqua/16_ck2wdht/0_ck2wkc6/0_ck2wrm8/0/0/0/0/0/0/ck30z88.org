I looked at the site and talked to my beta. (Who I trust more.) That's another thing, I don't know you and this site, so trusting you to have my fic there and not being asked first is hard. It also puts us on the wrong foot. This is how I found out... I hope you can see why many authors would automatically be up in arms.

Anyways, you're right. This will probably not take much of my traffic. I still think you should have found a way to ask, that still rubs me wrong, but it does seem to primarily lead readers to my site. The archive though... I don't like that it can be highlighted and thus would make it easier for other people to copy and paste my work. Are you going to continue to have it highlight able.
