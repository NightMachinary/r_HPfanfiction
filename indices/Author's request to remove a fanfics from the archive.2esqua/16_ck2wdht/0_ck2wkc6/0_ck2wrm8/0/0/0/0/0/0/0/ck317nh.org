I sure can disable highlight on any fics authors ask, but to be honest if anyone wants to copy your work, they'll do it. Highlights are somewhere in the same league as image blocking (when you can't copy image to the desktop) - more of a demand made by lawyers to say "look, we tried!".

Yeah, the way it started was a total mess. It's like a trial with jury, even though they are explicitly told not to view defendant as guilty, they still do.
