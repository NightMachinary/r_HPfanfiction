  You have a way to automatically upload thousands of fics but not a way to automatically send them a message saying hey we're putting your fic on this site.

Indeed i don't have. It;'s pretty simple. How can I contact you? It's either PM or an email. Right? PM is a no go - FFN will consider constant emails with the same text as a spam. Email - does FFN show author's private email available for everybody to see? No it doesn't.

That's it. There's no magic here and i can't pull out a rabbit out of a hat.
