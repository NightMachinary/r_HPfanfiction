OK, i apologize, but why don't you read original post? This part:

#+begin_quote
  Which is not only unreasonable (there're thousands of authors), but simply technically impossible since authors don't have emails or any other form of communication available to the simple robot.
#+end_quote

Regarding this:

#+begin_quote
  It takes away my traffic, I'll have less reviews, followers and favorites.
#+end_quote

FH doesn't have reviews or favorites. Nothing like that. If person want to add a review or follow you they will have to go to the FFN. Please, do take a look at the website.
