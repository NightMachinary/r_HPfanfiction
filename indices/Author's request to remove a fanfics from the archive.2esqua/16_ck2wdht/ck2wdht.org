My fic is on here... I don't appreciate this. It's my fic I should be able to say what site I want it hosted on. This is hours of my work. I know you are trying to do a nice thing, but it's not right. I as an author have the right to say I don't want my fic on this account. It takes away my traffic, I'll have less reviews, followers and favorites. You should have asked. I should have been somewhat involved in this process. Even if it was asking me for my permission just something. That's my fic and I didn't even realize it was on there. Do you have any idea how upsetting that is?
