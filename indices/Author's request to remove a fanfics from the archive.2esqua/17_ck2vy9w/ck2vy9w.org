I'm just going to use an /in fandom/ example. I have all of Rankina's work. Every last bit, in a private file. Her work is no longer online. She removed it, as is her right as the author.

However, what I am doing is vastly different from what you are doing. She left permission for us to share /privately/ her work after she pulled it down.

She. Left. Permission. So I violate no rules by having a private copy that more or less has a share alike agreement on it. I also have a copy of "Forman's Familia". However, I do /not/ have permission to share that work. So it remains a private file.

Your argument, that you are only keeping an archive in case something happens... doesn't hold water. The writer, while not holding rights to the characters in this situation, still does own the unique way the story is presented (more or less the plot for simplicities sake). The author also controls where it is printed/published/hosted.

If I want my LJ to host my work with password protections, that is my choice. Or hosted only to a specific facebook group... again limited only to the group, that is my choice. If I were to pull down all my work? Still my choice.

You need permission from each author. And funnily enough? I leave a public email available on Ao3, which is the ONLY place I post my stuff. My co-written works? Also appear on ff.net. I'm one of the writers angry with you. Reason? My co-writer and I did not grant you permission to host our stuff.

We defend what rights we do have to a derivative work for a reason. We still have that right. If we don't defend it? We lose it (yes this is the trademark argument, but still valid).
