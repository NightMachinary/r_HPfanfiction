This isn't rage. Rage with me is typically profanity laced... as several author friends can attest to.

Am I angry? Yes. Did that probably bleed over a little bit? Of course. How could it not? However, I maintained a civil tongue. I'm also a writer, I'm going to /be/ expressive.

And I already sent you the DMCA last night with all that information. Thank you for having a prompt reply to my co-writer and myself.
