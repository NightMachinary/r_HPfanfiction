Not going to go over everything you said as I'm just going to repeat myself.

If you wish, I'm going to remove any of your stories. Just write me an email (could be found on About page for now). Include names of the stories (or better links) just so it would be faster to find them and some info proving that you're an author.

That's it, no need to go into this rage mode.

And while you're so expressively defending your works, you might also read [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2esqua/authors_request_to_remove_a_fanfics_from_the/ck2vhsx][this comment]].
