  AFAIK fanfiction can not be copyrighted by fanfiction author

No, quite the opposite. The fanfiction author owns the copyright. So does the author of the original work. It's illegal for either to distribute the work without the consent of the other, and it's illegal for a third party to distribute that work without the consent of both. This is just a section of copyright law that's pretty much ignored most of the time because (a) fanfiction authors can't generally afford lawyers to protect their fan fiction and (b) fan fiction is generally a good thing for the original work's popularity.
