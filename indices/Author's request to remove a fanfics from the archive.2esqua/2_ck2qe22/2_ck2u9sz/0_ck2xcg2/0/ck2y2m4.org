I don't want to keep cluttering up this thread by essentially reposting the same comment, but I would really like some source on your claim that "The fanfiction author owns the copyright."

Because every thing I've learned about copyright indicated the opposite, and the only mention I've found of a case that examined this question directly claims that the judge dismissed it "with prejudice" - as in, it's so far out that it's not even worth the court's time to examine the details of such claims. [[http://debmcalister.com/2013/04/28/copyright-myths-from-the-world-of-fan-fiction/][link, see bottom]]

Again, I am always up for being corrected, so if you have actual cases or even opinions of legal professionals to support your claim, I would very much like to read them.

PS. keep in mind that DMCA takedown notices aren't relevant here - I know some fanfic authors filed them, and sites complied - but more often than not this is case of people either not knowing their rights, or website owners lacking means/will to defend themselves.
