Conceded. [[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf][This fact sheet from USCO]] says that only lawful derivative works are covered by copyright, and for them to be lawful they must be authorized by the rightsholder for the original work. Its definitions of "derivative work" don't apply to most fan fiction -- it talks about incorporating copyrighted material from the previous work -- but a skilled lawyer could probably make it stick.

Assuming Rowling's past endorsement of fan fiction is to be construed as legal authorization, most HP fan fiction is lawful. One can register a derivative work with the copyright office. It appears that there is a separate author listing for the derivative work, which implies a different rightsholder. But that endorsement was not enough to hold up in court.

I'm confused as to why a fantasy world and its characters would count with copyright law rather than, say, trademarks.
