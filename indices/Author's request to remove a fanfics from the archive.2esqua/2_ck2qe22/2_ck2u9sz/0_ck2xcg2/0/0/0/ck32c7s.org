  I'm confused as to why a fantasy world and its characters would count with copyright law rather than, say, trademarks.

Literature always falls under copyright. Trademarks are mostly domain of marketing material.

The 2 aren't mutually exclusive. HP as in a wizard boy in glasses and black hair is pretty known to represent the franchise of Harry Potter - so if I were to promote my new shop by drawing a sign with Harry Potter, signed it Harry Potter's Coffee Shop - Rowling would have cause to challenge me for misusing trademark of the name Harry Potter and probably the general imagery too, despite it being my original drawing.

If I actually went and copied part of a book cover's image for the sign - copyright violation of that image I copied without permission.

In the case of the archive though there is no question that none of the fanfic authors have any trademarked material - since they don't market or trade on any of the content they create in the fanfic.
