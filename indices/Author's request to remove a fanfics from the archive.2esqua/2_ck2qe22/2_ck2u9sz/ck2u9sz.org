  That said, if specifically asked to remove the fics from an author who can verify it's actually their work, you're obligated to take it down. They could legally force you to do so if they wished (though most fanfiction authors don't have the time, money, or inclination to create a legal dispute over it).

Can you provide source on that? AFAIK fanfiction can not be copyrighted by fanfiction author and the only protection its afforded is vs plagiarism - as in if someone claimed they wrote it or used in their own work...
