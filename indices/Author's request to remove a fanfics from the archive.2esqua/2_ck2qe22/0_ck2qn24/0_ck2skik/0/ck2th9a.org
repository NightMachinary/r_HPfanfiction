  Could you not post information on the site just to say that it's an automated system and if an author asks you to take their work down, you will do so?

Yep, already done in the About page.

  Other than that, I think your scoop system is actually a pretty good idea. I had been hoping to find the ever-elusive, deleted excentrykemuse fics on there, but regretfully they aren't there... Real shame, that. I've been after copies for ages.

Actually, that's exactly what pushed me to create this archive. That and desire to have an exclusion filter to hide any stories with characters i'm not a fan of.
