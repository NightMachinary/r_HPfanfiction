  I [do] have a problem with someone sending a robot in, taking my content, uploading it somewhere without asking or even notifying me--and then I find out about it myself, and I'm made to prove to them that I have a good enough reason for them to remove my story from their site.

I can entirely see [[/u/marshmallowpuff]]'s point here. It /is/ possible to set up an automated PM system that would reach anyone [who has PM turned on] and at least notify them that their work has been scooped, if not ask for permission. That would allow them the opportunity to email you to have their work taken down--no matter their reason for wanting their work removed, you /should do so without complaint/.

It should probably also be noted that what you are doing isn't actually /allowed/, good idea or not. Be thankful that authors have only complained to you and not to FFNET (who really ought to know that somebody's /crawling/ their archives).
