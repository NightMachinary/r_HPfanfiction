I agree entirely with [[/u/Servalpur]]. It's practically impossible to contact everyone and entirely unfeasible. Some people delete a story for personal reasons though, and may not wish for it to be 'out there' anymore, in any form. If those people contact you and ask for stuff to be taken down, then you should do it. It's their work, after all.

Could you not post information on the site just to say that it's an automated system and if an author asks you to take their work down, you will do so?

Other than that, I think your scoop system is actually a pretty good idea. I had been hoping to find the ever-elusive, deleted excentrykemuse fics on there, but regretfully they aren't there... Real shame, that. I've been after copies for ages.

/Edit:/ on reflection, it's not unfeasible to contact everyone. An automatic PM system could be implemented.
