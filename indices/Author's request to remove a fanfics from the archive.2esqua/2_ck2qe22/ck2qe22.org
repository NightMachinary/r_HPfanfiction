I'm torn on this kind of thing. I've read fics that were intentionally taken down by authors before, and I've spread links around to people so they can do the same. Ultimately, I've always felt that one of the largest dangers to the fandom is having stories disappear off the net due to any number of reasons. Ranging from people hosting their fics on blogs that got deleted (the several LiveJournal purges ~5+ years ago), people hosting the fics on personal sites they just stopped paying for as they got older, archive sites going down because there's so little traffic compared to the past, that the person running the site just feels it's not worth it any more. I could go on and on.

I personally took like a 5 year break from fanfiction between 2007 and 2012 (I had been reading since 2000 prior to that), and was really taken aback when I found that Livejournal had pretty much died, and all the old rec lists had stopped being updated. It was a real kick in the pants to find reams and reams of lists with just dead links, and since many of the fics were high quality but not necessarily extremely popular, many of them actually did not have backups online.

It's with that reasoning that I can say that I see nothing wrong with archiving fics without asking the authors first (though I think if possible, a good faith effort to at least find an email wouldn't go amiss). That said, if specifically asked to remove the fics from an author who can verify it's actually their work, you're obligated to take it down. They could legally force you to do so if they wished (though most fanfiction authors don't have the time, money, or inclination to create a legal dispute over it).

TL;DR: No to individually asking every author if you can archive their stories. It's virtually impossible to do so. There are fics that are 15+ years old at this point! Yes to removing stories from the archive if asked, you're virtually obligated to do so.

Also, on a personal note, you're really damn cool for running this archive. I've never used it before, but now I definitely know where to go when I want to find removed fics.
