As a reader: thank you for your work. Don't see anything wrong with you making backups, authorized or unauthorized of fanfiction.

Especially since you took the step of making first link head to original source so as not to siphon off traffic.

edit. In light of current wave of anger directed at you, perhaps you could circumvent it a bit by not hosting a browsable link of the backup directly for the fics that authors refused to be hosted at your site.

Instead allow users to input a "friendly request" through a small automatic form for an archived fic from your "personal backup" which is than automatically shared to the email address that your new "friend" provided in the request form.

People share stories from their personal backup collections by request all the time like this.
