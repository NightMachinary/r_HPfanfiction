I agree with what most of the other author's say. I found my stories on your website and that infuriates me. Not only was I never asked for permission; but I would have never granted it. All of my stories are on ff.net, and only ff.net, for a reason. And that reason is largely so I maintain a modicum of control over them.

Technically; too, what you're doing is against the ToS of ff.net. The same ToS that I'm pretty much convinced I'm the only one that actually bothered to read when I agreed to publish there.

But Excerpts!

A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Website, including but not limited to User Submissions (defined below), without FanFiction.Net's prior written authorization.

C. You agree not to access User Submissions (defined below) or FanFiction.Net Content through any technology or means other than the Website itself.

E. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to the FanFiction.Net servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.

D. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Content other than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of User Submissions of third parties obtained through the Website for any commercial purposes.

Also in there as part of the user action is that I do still 'own' my stories. I have granted fanfiction.net the right to use them. That does not mean I have granted a third party the right to copy them. I have not given you any such permission. I can, in theory, take you to court over it. I'm also curious as to what ff.net would do if we pointed out you have a robot essentially mining their information.

It's the same way in the real world. A Hollywood studio can't use a song in a movie without getting the rights. You cannot use my works or do anything with my works without my permission.

You say that asking for permission is unreasonable? It most certainly isn't. Asking for permission is the basic tenant of this type of endeavor. And no; a robot not being able to do it is not a valid reason. If you want the archive; you better get the permission. Don't spout any nonsense about it beinig 'unrealistic' because it's far, far from it.

TL;DR: If an author tells you to remove their stories from your archive. You remove their stories from your archive. And you do so immediately.
