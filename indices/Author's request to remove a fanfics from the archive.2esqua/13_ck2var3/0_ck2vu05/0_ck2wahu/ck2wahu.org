Actually; you do. Those are under the 'General use' part of the terms of service and required by anyone who uses the archive. True, they do not exist to be enforced. They exist so when someone does somethign like this, fan fiction has the legal high ground to do something about if if they wanted to. You're essentially data-mining off of their hosting. I suspect that would concern them.

I'm not going to jump through hoops to get you to rectify something you should have never done in the first place. Given your blatant disregard of other basic thing here, I'm not sure I want you to have any access to my personal information. You could very easily make an account on ff.net. You may even already have one. And you could send me a PM asking for permission to use my works. I would respond to that likely within twenty-four hours. The entire process would take less than ten minutes of effort on your part. Probably closer to two if you have an account already.

And had you done this; you could have probably sold me on the idea. Had it seemed like a passion project for you, I may have gone along with it with some conditions applied. But you didn't make the effort. And you went ahead without consent.

I'm TheEndless7 on ff.net. I've done a sort of AMA on here; I respond to every message I receive on ff.net. I am one of the most accessible fanfiction authors I know. Your laziness in getting basic permission to use others work is not my fault. Remove all of my stories from your archive.
