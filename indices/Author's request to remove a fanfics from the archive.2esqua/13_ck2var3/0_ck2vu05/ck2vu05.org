  Technically; too, what you're doing is against the ToS of ff.net.

You do understand that I don't have to comply with FFN TOS, right? TOS like that is not an enforceable agreement. Any lawyer worth his/her salt would say you that.

Anyway, feel free to write to an email with your name, stories you want to take down and a screenshot from your userpage (as a confirmation that you're actually an author).
