Seems like an over complication. I mean, let's say there're other websites that keep stories. How would the know and why should they adhere to it? I mean, if people think that i'm an evil guy here, they really need to reconsider this whole situation, because people with different set of morals can easily just ignore any requests and keywords and not just store other people's works, but make profit off of it.
