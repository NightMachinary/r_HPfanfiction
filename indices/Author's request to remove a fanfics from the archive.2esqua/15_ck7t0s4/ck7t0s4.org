Super late to the party but eh :P

I write stories on fanfiction, and i'm slowly moving towards Ao3 as well, which is why my opinion on this might be inconceivable for many fanfiction writers

I love the idea of this website. So many good stories get deleted because either someone complained that it was too graphic for a certain site, or that they didn't appreciate the content. not to mention sometimes writers take down their stories and never post them, for reasons their own.

for me as a reader, this can be depressing. i've spent countless time asking authors who have taken down stories that people enjoyed to either re-post them, or if they don't plan to do anything more with their story, to at least let it be spread around for the readers to still enjoy, even if the author themselves doesn't care for it. i love stories, hell i've read hundreds of them, and the thought of them disappearing is terrible.

i've gone on fictionhunt in the past to read stories that have been taken down from other sites, and for that i truly applaud this archive. the fact that i can re-read a story that i thought was lost to me always brightens my day

now as a writer...

i still think the same.

i write my stories for the enjoyment of others and myself, i don't see the problem with my stories being shared around and enjoyed. If fictionhunt is acknowledging that this is an archive, and he's not plagiarizing, than i really don't see what the problem is. it's impossible to ask personally for each author's permission and in my own honest opinion, the stories are being enjoyed and better yet saved.

heck, should something ever happen to the stories i write i would like knowing there was an archive keeping the words i wrote safe.

I write these stories for free, for the enjoyment of myself and others, and really, in the end of the day knowing someone has read my work just makes me happy, call me simple i guess

i know my opinion isn't popular, but that's how i feel, especially since it seems he is trying to fix the site
