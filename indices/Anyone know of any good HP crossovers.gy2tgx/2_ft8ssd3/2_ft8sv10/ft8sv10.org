  How could she have been so stupid to let this happen?Harriet frickin' Potter, Witch-Who-Won, acknowledged Auror, overpowered and abducted by a pair of muggles. The press would have a field-day.Seriously, at least if they'd put her in a damp cellar, she'd have known what was going on.

  Everyone heard about him. The brilliant Sky who'd help anyone in need before vanishing into the air. Who would perform incredible feats, and summon creatures, and plant forests of bizarre man-eating trees. The most coveted Sky. Harry? Just tried to live out his other-worldly pension in peace.

  Rose Potter died during the First Task of the Tournament. Rosabella Vongola, daughter of Enrico Vongola, remembers it quite clearly.Good thing, too, because death apparently is not enough to stop a prophecy.

#+begin_quote
  The Arcobaleno, betrayed by their previous Sky, are always looking, always searching, always wondering. But days turn to weeks and weeks turn to months and months turn to years, and to search and have hope with no results is too painful, even for them, so they stop. They go on with their day-to-day lives, sometimes allowing themselves an illusion of hope before crushing it once more. It is when they cease to look, to search, to wonder, that is when she finds them. And so the strongest seven finally belong. And she does too.

  Harry's journey to become the man known as Skull De Mort was unintentional. It began with a realisation, a broken-down motorbike, and a trip to Japan.

#+begin_quote
  Skull wonders sometimes if one day, he will slip and forget to lie. It doesn't quite happen like that, but it does take just one night. One night that loosens his tongue and Skull can't lie anymore. Well, he can, but the selective blindness of his fellow ex-Arcobaleno vanished the instant he spoke the words, "I was a soldier." He carries his scars, hidden under the leather and the make-up. From Voldemort, Malfoy Manor and the battles he's fought and survived. He was fine with being weak. The weak are never called to lead, to protect.
