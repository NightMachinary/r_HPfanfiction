Linkffn(Under the Veil by Poplasia)

If your looking for morbid, there has been the creation of both a orbital railgun, and the main character stabbed themselves in the past two chapters alone.

Do keep in mind this is a very much terrible way to describe this, and takes quite a bit out of context.

Basicly the story so far is Sans from Undertale gets himself stuck in the void due to plot, and meets Sirius black, who just got himself thrown into the veil of death. They teleport to the Harry potter universe, traveling through time, where plot happens, It updates roughly once an month.

It avoids the pitfalls of both fanons, I.E. manipulative dumbledore, terrible twinspeak, and jerkish ron.
