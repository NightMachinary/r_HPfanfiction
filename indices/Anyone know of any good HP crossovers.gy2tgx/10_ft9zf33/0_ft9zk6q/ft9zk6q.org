  Harry Potter has no idea what to do. His new Auror recruits are nothing short of hopeless. Then an idea hits him..."So, let me get this straight: we're supposed to show some wand-waving weirdos how to do our job?""Yes, that is the general idea."Or: failing Auror recruits get dumped with MI-5 to get a lesson in how spying is really done, and with cooperating magical and Muggle terrorists on the loose, working together might just be a necessity anyway.Set in Spooks season 5 and after the Deathly Hallows, but before the epilogue of Harry Potter

  When Scotland Yard is stumped by the murder of Amelia Bones Sherlock Holmes investigates the seemingly impossible locked room mystery. His conclusion? "They teleported." Seven months later they bump into a trio of teens in a London cafe and John Watson discovers that his friend was perfectly serious. They are now in the thick of the strangest case of the great detective's career.
