The problem with most crossovers is that they are from people who are desperately unhappy with some fundamental characteristics of HP universe, mostly finding Harry to be not enough superhero in the style of Marvell comics and similar. And they are right, Harry is not superhero. It always fascinated me as even after defeat of Voldemort he is distinctively NOT a superhero, but a little more experienced, a little bit more battered, but still seventeen year old student of Hogwarts a year before his graduation. More to this [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][on my blog]].

So, better chance for a crossover is in non-fantasy land:

- linkao3(Operation Wandless by EllianaDunla) is the crossover between HP and TV series Spooks (about MI-5).
- linkffn(Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard by Charlotte Ann Kent) really nicely done crossover between HP and Sherlock (something between the Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and the modern Sherlock)
