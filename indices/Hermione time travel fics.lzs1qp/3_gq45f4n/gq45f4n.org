Hopefully you haven't read it yet! It's well written and has Hermione plan a trip to the past for three years after the end of the war. She's pretty thorough which I liked. She enlists Sirius' help and together they try to track down Voldemort's horcruxes and destroy them. I'm only about 40% of the way through, but I hear there's a huge plot twist!
