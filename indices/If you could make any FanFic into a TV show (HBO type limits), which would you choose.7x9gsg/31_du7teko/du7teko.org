I think I'll go with linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) as it has a bit of smut, a bit of mystery and looks like it'll have a very graphic war. Runners up being JBern's linkffn(Bungle In The Jungle; The Lie I've Lived) as similar action with some smut fics or linkffn(Harry The Hufflepuff) as a zany family friendly sitcom or kids TV show.
