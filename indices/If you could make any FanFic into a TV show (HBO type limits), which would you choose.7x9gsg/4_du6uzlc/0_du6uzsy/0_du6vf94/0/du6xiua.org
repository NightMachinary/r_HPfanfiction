I enjoy it for its more realistic reaction to a snake that kills on sight being loose in a school of children. It would make a ton of sense to close the school and make sure there isn't another one.

I also feel its less a competent government and more a few competent people/departments that the HP community as a whole generally feel are competent. Amelia Bones, without any real canon support besides her murder, is generally viewed as being competent and a threat to Fudge's administration. The same with the Department of Mysteries and Croaker.

There's also seeing a good-guy manipulative Dumbledore get out maneuvered and called out for getting stuck in one way of thinking.

All that said, you are correct that everyone is slightly too competent/aware/lucky and far too many potential problems are resolved.

Still its a story that I have in my Google and Calibre libraries and I hope to see a sequel/resolution of the main Voldemort story line someday.
