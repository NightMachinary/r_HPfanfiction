That really depends on what you mean by 'Good' i dont really pay attention to quality of writing or tropes. A fanfic gets a good job from me if it makes me giddy and is fun/filled with awesome moments. So while i can recommend fics for you i cant say if you or anyone would find them good.

Fates Gamble

FateProphecy-Break

Harry Potter and the Eclipse Princess

Queen of Conquerors

The Golden King and Harry Potter

The old version of 'A Broken Wizard and a Broken Magus' i haven't tried the newer version yet.

Harry Potter and the Counter Guardian

Approaching disaster.

Gorgon and Thanatos, was decent but i havent kept up to date.

Many people also enjoy the Matou Shinji series but iv never tried it, i hate the base character too much for me to even try a fanfic where he is the MC.
