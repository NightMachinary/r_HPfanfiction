Harry potter and icecream delights. A sweet Harry/Luna romance fanfic. Its a bit out of character but i do love it and a well acted slice of life show would be awesome.

Harry Potter Geth. Mass effect and Harry Potter cross over into a somewhat absurd power fantasy where magic and space age technology meet clash and mix. Seeing Mass Effect's universe done properly in live action would be awesome.

Or just about any action Anime style game or show/ HP. Im a combat junkie and HP when it has a crossover generally seems to focus mostly on the combat. So theres a ton of options out there, just off the top of my head though i would probably want to see Fates Gamble. A MASSIVELY OP HP/ Fate stay night fanfic, where by the end of the first story it would not be inaccurate to call Harry a god.
