A Black Comedy - a lot of its chaos, slapstick, sex related humor would play well on screen. Characters are not so obscure compared to most fics. Most characters other than Harry are pretty in character. The duel between Voldemort and Harry + Sirius would be amazing to watch. Harry's little trick with the arms would have so many cool special effects. It would have great merchandising opportunities. The story is segmented in a way that would work for an episodic mini-series.

Hell, when you read this fic, it already reads very visually, camera shots and choices wouldn't even be that difficult.
