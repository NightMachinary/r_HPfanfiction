I'd LOVE to see The Pureblood Pretense as a series. It has 3 sequels, currently: The Serpentine Subterfuge, The Ambiguous Artifice and The Futile Facade. TFF is slooooowww ongoing, so currently incomplete, but it's definitely not falling off the rails -- in fact, the story and the world get better and better at every chapter
