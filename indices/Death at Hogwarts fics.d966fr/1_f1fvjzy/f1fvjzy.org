But of shameless self-promotion here, my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001435][Phantom]] has a string of student murders around Hogwarts. It's a Haphne mystery thriller, the downside is I admittedly haven't updated in a while, but do plan to get back to it

Edit: Read title without reading description and realised it's not exactly what you're asking for, but I'll keep the link there all the same
