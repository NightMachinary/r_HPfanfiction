Yes I've read some and I think it's because the authors realized that the Heads of House were not what they were meant to be and wanted to remedy that.

But I seem to have stumbled upon a bad string of fanfictions in which McGonagall is her usual canon self and Harry accepts it. Harry goes to see McGonagall with a problem, she doesn't take the time to listen, doesn't believe him or dismiss what he says as exaggeration. Harry then leaves, disappointed and without a fight. Harry is a wimp. It's fanfiction! He should say something! It would be interesting seeing McGonagall realizing her mistakes.

“I don't know why I even came here. Just as usual, you're of no help. Am I wasting your time? Do you have more interesting things to do than to listen to me? Do you think I come here just to annoy you? No, I come here because you're my Head of House, you're supposed to be the person I go to when I have a problem. But do you listen? No, of course, I'm always exaggerating or lying or you don't have the time. Personally, I'm used to deal with things on my own, but some of the students in your House are eleven years old, they are children who need help and sometimes a Prefect won't cut it. And after that you blame me for getting into dangerous situations when you won't take me seriously when I come to you. Do you investigate the claims of the students? Never, why bother? If they were assigned detention, they deserved it. If they lost point, they should be trying to win some back instead of whining about it. Children's problem are so inconsequential. Severus Snape is Neville Longbottom's boggart? Why the young man is easily scared. Harry Potter is slandered by the student body? It will toughen the lad up. I loathe Professor Snape because he is a bully and a lousy teacher but he's a better Head of House than you are, at least he fights tooth and nail for his students. Why are you Head of House, exactly Professor? Because of your Gryffindor Pride? Wear a badge it will suit you better. If you don't care for us, at least step down and let us have someone who will. My parents would have been so disappointed in you. Goodnight”
