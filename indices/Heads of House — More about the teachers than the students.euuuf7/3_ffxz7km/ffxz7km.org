I swear no one has heard of suspension of disbelief.

The vast majority of your issues stem from one core fact: if the adults of canon had acted in a reasonable, responsible manner, canon would have been much different and honestly boring.

Year 1: don't tell students about the third floor corridor, and put an age line/fidellius on that door, tell the teachers the fidellius secret. The mirror traps Voldemort, nothing else happens.

Year 2: Slytherin's monster is in the castle, has an incredibly long lifespan, can petrify and kill people without leaving a mark; teachers research magical snakes, stock the castle with dissollusioned roosters, and maybe stake out the toilet where the ghost of the only dead victim from the first time happens to be haunting.

Year 3: Remus and Dumbledore do a quick check of the Shrieking Shack after Halloween, apprehend Sirius, find out WHY he broke out of prison, capture Pettigrew, Sirius is exonerated, etc.

I could keep going but it doesn't matter, because in this situation, canon from Harry's perspective would be boring as hell. Or at least, not remotely the same story and more “slice of life” in a magical world. In the story that JKR wanted to tell, Harry was the protagonist and mystery solver. That means that the adults can't solve the problems for him. They can certainly help or hinder him, but in the end Harry saves the day. Characters behave the way they do to tell that story, regardless of how they should logically or reasonably act. This is compounded by the target audience of the books, along with the narrative style: ie, for children and then young adults, and fantastical/whimsical.

Finally, there's the intent of the writing vs the perspective of the reader. JKR intended for Dumbledore to be a the wise mentor, for McGonagall to be the stern but fair teacher, for Molly Weasley to be the overbearing but loving mother. However, based on an individuals past experiences, biases, and beliefs, they may regard each of these characters WILDLY differently.
