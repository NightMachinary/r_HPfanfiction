Two sentences inton your "fighting back" Snape would have been like "50 points from Griffyindor, detention, and see me after class".

Have you forgotten how it is to be in school? And I mean not even specifically a British boarding school (which is even more extreme), but just a normal, modern school. There are some teachers who give a fuck, but if they don't, they don't. And as a student, you are always powerless and at the mercy of the teacher.

Then there is the fact that this is a British boarding school in the 90s. Thirty years ago.

Back then (and to an extent, today still) bullying and roughhousing was not only allowed, but to an extent encouraged.\\
Blah blah, stenghtens you, blah blah blah.

The argument essentially boils down to "How are you ever going to have authority, when you appeal to it for all of your problems? How are you ever going to have authority, when you cannot deal with adversaries who don't play fair?"

I'm not in favor of this kind of teaching, but that is the underlying idea behind these "teaching methods."

If Harry had gone to Dumbledore, and he had spoken freely, I bet his response would have been along the lines of "Harry, all your life you will have people hating you for who you are, through no fault of your own. You can either learn to deal with it now, or later. I recommend now, when a mistake costs you 50 points and a detention, not your job and career."

This of course doesn't make it okay, it doesn't help social justice, or is healthy - but it is a way of thinking that exists, was prevalent at the time.

In other words: this is an explanation, not a justification.
