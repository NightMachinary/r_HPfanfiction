As an aside, I find it really weird that one teacher teaches seven year groups worth of classes by themselves. I'm a secondary science teacher, and I'm basing my observations and thoughts off my own experiences teaching in the Australian (specifically in the state of New South Wales) system.

My first two years of teaching were at a Central school (K-12), where each year group at the secondary level had roughly 50-60 students. At Years 7-10 level where they have more compulsory subjects, this translates to two classes per year level. Let's equate Science with Potions. At Hogwarts, Potions classes were organised as Gryffindor/Slytherin and Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff, so student numbers in the 1st-5th year classes would have been similar to what I experienced with my 7-10 classes. The school I was at worked on a Week A/B timetable, and the students in each year level did 7 hours of Science classes in a fortnight. For this to happen, plus the 11-12 students doing 7 hours of one or more specialist Science courses in Biology, Chemistry or Physics, we needed to have 3 teachers (1x Head Teacher + 2 teachers) in the Science faculty to cover all the classes. The standard load is 5 classes per teacher. Head Teachers typically have a reduced load of 4 classes due to their increased admin load. Even allowing for the fact that there are no specialisations within Potions at the 6th and 7th year levels, and that it tends to collapse into one class for those year levels due to the small number of students who meet Snape's requirement of achieving an O at OWL level to be eligible to continue with Potions to NEWT level, I don't see how it is physically possibile for him (or teachers of any other subject at Hogwarts) to teach 12 classes apiece.
