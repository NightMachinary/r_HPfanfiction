I like any fic that focuses on Harry and is all around well done. Good writing, plot, etc. I've read and liked Methods of Rationality, Delenda Est, Prince of the Dark Kingdom, the saving Conner series, the firebird song series, Again and Again, Rebirth, and The Lie I've Lived. I prefer stories where Harry is darker, but that's not necesary and I prefer straight pairings over slash, but I'll read stories with slash pairings so long as it's not just one giant lemon.
