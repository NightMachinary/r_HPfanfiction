Ok, so I can't link cause I'm on mobile, but everything I'll suggest is on ff.net.

There's Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic. It's a Harry/Hermione story. It doesn't exactly match any of your preferences but is well written.

Brutal Harry by LordsFire explores a badly abused Harry who has had to learn to take care of himself being introduced into the magical world.

The Wise One: Book One: The Becoming is the start of a three part series. In this Harry is rescued from the Dursley's at 8 by Sirius and they leave Britain traveling around the world to keep Sirius hidden. The trilogy goes from the time he's 8 all the way through his teenage years.

The last one I'll recommend is Broken Mind, Fractured Soul by SensiblyTainted. This story deals with a Harry who is horrifically abused by the Dursley's having Multiple Personality Disorder. It's a story that has Snape as a mentor and as Harry gets older he's not light, but he's not exactly dark either. I'm currently in the middle of the sequel and it's a very interesting read. I should warn you that the sequel will have elements of slash, but it isn't the focus of the story.

Hope I could help! If you'd like more just let me know.
