Well, [[/u/wordhammer]] (author of one of my recs) suggests on his FFN profile page [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP_5_Starred_and_Featured_Authors/84507/99/1/1/][this up to date, DLP-related C2 list of fics on FFN]]. Also, my top recs, reposting from [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1qiha3/recommendation/][an old thread]] on completed fanfics.

I suggest:

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

This one has some of the best time travel ever, and has alt history and alt present day characters that the author actually makes one care about. Harry has some idiotball issues, but he does in canon as well. Some people don't like the romance; that is the pair listed. I like the historic stuff, as it seem so well done. Original magical ideas that thankfully don't result in Harry immediately rolling over Voldemort. A good read.

and /maybe/ the extremely violent and body-horror-filled:

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

I'm still not sure if I actually recommend this one. It is a thing that stands alone amongst all the sappy and crappy gray/dark Harry Azkaban shitfics. This story is *dark*, it is the exact opposite of a comfort fic, it does not have a happy ending, it does surprising and horrible things to the main character. It does have a sequel, which I have not gathered the courage to continue, but it stands alone just as well. And you'll be happy to finish it, because you know there isn't another chapter of the main character being tortured just a link away.
