Heh, for your tastes, all kinds of stories are too slow ;). But I definitely second the recommendation.

What I will say is, Don't pay too much attention to the summary; I reckon it's misleading. It makes the story sound really melodramatic like a soap opera, which it isn't. The best way to tell if you'll like it, I think, is to just read chapter 1 and decide whether you like Abby.
