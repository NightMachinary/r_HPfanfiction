Take a look at [[http://commonplacebook.com/art/books/word-count-for-famous-novels/]] ... is the plot really sufficient to carry novel as long as The Order of the Phoenix (257,154)? This is really simple boy-loves-girl, girl-loves-boy, they-have-their-issues-and-then-they-get-together. Nothing against that, it is a sweet story, but in length it should be somewhere closer to “Sense and Sensibility” (119,394) and certainly not twice as long, and it shouldn't be also longer than three-stories-in-one “Jane Eyre” (183,858) or “Little Women” (183,833).
