I am not about loosing details, but every sentence either helps to carry the plot (and that includes building characters, tension, everything, I am not an action-hero simpleton) or it bores a reader uselessly. Every plot has only so much text it is able to give energy to: if you prolong the story from Christmas to June, just because you don't know how to write “And then for five months nothing serious happened.” (looking at you linkao3(17777138)), then you have some seriously pissed of readers. Or if you cannot decide which of the fives takes on one story you make, so you put all five of them in your story (linkffn(5141159), and I blame the sin of serialized writing here), then you can destroy even a lovely story. “Grow Young With Me” does nothing so obviously horrible, but there is a lot of fat to cut and lot of unnecessary subplots to remove.
