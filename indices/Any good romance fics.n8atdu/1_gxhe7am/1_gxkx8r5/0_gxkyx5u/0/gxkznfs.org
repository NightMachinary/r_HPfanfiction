I enjoyed Sense and Sensibility, and Jane Eyre, but I don't have a problem with books being longer than them.

/Could/ it be trimmed and still convey the story? Certainly. Would that be /better/? Debatable; some would be more inclined to read it because it requires less investment of time, others would be saddened by the loss of details. Is it /essential/ to pare it down? I'd say not.
