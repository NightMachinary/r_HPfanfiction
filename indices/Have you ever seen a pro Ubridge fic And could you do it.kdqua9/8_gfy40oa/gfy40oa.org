I think you'd have to tone down the child torture but you could depict Umbridge as in over her head trying to:-

- Teach, for which she has no training or aptitude.
- Investigate Dumbledore's secret society which, from her point of view, uses Hogwarts as a recruiting ground and has infiltrated the Auror department.
- Control a school of children whose parents are preparing for civil war. In canon the Gryffindors are far more violent than their opponents (e.g. Montague/vanishing cabinet).
