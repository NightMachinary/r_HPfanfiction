The story The Real Us by Seel'vor on fanfiction.net (can't direct link story due to rule 8) has Umbridge being friends with the marauders and actually being one of the "good guys" who acts like a bad guy. Eg her sending the muggleborns to registration camps is actually sending them to vacation camps to protect them.
