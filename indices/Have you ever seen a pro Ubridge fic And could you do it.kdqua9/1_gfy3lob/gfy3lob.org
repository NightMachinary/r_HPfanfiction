I read one that was /sort of/ pro-Umbridge? The basic premise was that somehow Umbridge discovered Harry with the Dursleys when he was still a kid. Because of how badly they treat him, Umbridge petitions for custody and gets it.

Even though Umbridge doesn't treat Harry super well, he still prefers her to the Dursleys because:

1). He's given good food, a bedroom, new clothes, etc.

2). He's provided with opportunities to learn about Wizarding society and magic.

3). Umbridge sets clear rules for Harry's behavior. He knows what will get him punished and what will get him praised. This framework (as Umbridge-like as it is) makes him feel secure because he feels like he has more control over his environment and what happens to him.

At first, Umbridge doesn't care about Harry at all except for the positive attention she gets from being Harry's guardian. As time goes on, she /does/ end up having /some/ affection for him (albeit it's a long, long way away from unconditional love, it's at least some kind of positive interaction, which he didn't get from the Dursleys.)

So while I wouldn't call the story pro-Umbridge exactly, it's not anti-Umbridge either. I'd say it takes her personality, as portrayed in the books, and puts her in a situation where that can actually have a somewhat positive impact, if that makes sense.

I'm sorry I've forgotten the name of the story, but maybe someone else will know. It's definitely worth a read.
