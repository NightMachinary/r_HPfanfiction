The original story was going to be Harry and Luna going across America and documenting what they find (in the story itd be explained that the Americas aren't that explored magically compared to the old world.) It would be a sort of biography with a chapter about the creatures and places they find and then actual story between them.

It was supposed to be framed as a book Harry and Luna wrote.
