If you like that particular dynamic, then linkffn(Learning to Breathe by onoM) is pretty close to that. Its Harry/Ginny, but the characterizations in the story are more in line with those of Full Metal Panic (a mildly entertaining school/military/mecha/romance anime, look it up if your interested).
