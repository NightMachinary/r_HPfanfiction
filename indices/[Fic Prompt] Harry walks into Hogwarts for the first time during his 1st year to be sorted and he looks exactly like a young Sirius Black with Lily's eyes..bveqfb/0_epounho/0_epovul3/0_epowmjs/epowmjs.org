Given that Sirius was the one who sent him to his near-death encounter with Remus in transformed state during their schooldays and was later believed to have betrayed the Potters to Voldemort - though I can't remember whether Snape would have been party to that information at the time - I would think rather less, if that were possible. Poor Harry.
