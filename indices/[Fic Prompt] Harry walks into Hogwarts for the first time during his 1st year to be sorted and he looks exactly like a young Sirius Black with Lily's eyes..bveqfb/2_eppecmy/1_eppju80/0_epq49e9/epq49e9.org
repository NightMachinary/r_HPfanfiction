Maybe biologically but then again biologically speaking it really doesn't matter for him anyways since both his parents are magical anyway. It's a cultural thing and derived from , afaik, nazi genetic beliefs. I.e. if your grandparents were non-aryan then you are not Aryan, even if your parents are.
