IRL it's possible to have twins that had two different fathers, so i can't see why with magic you couldn't have one baby that has two fathers.\\
Technically, it's even possible via biology, albeit unlikely - twins of different fathers, where one absorbed the other in the womb resulting in one child with mixed genetics, with magic to keep him from dying of autoimmune response.
