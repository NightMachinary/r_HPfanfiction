All of your mitochondria is inherited from your mother (the ones in the sperm cell die). So while this is an interesting idea, it would mean that only witch/muggle relationships will give magical children and wizard/muggle relationships will not. Unless there's some other factor from the wizard which mutates the muggle's mitochondria... hmm.
