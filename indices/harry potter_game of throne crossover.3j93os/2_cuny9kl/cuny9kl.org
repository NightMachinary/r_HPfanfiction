Yeah, as [[/u/KayanRider]] said, it's a very niche 'market'. I'd just head on to the x-over section on ff.net and read the longest ones and the ones with a good amount of reviews. I can only think of one fanfic which is /completed/ (plenty of good in-progress ones) and semi-good in that x-over. I'll get back to you.

edit: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11255223/1/The-Wizard-of-Harrenhal][The Wizard of Harrenhal]] Quite ridden with clich√©s but not a bad read at all, if I remember correctly
