I think the reason you have so few answers and votes, is because what you are looking for is really niche and only exist in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Game-of-Thrones-Crossovers/224/8324/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10][right crossover section of ff.net]]. So if you just head there you can litterally read all fanfictions written with said premis in an afternoon.

But here are my four favorite crossovers between GoT and HP:

Ongoing:

linkffn(The Difference one man can make)

linkffn(The game of lord voldemort)

linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhall) /This one is finished, but the auther keeps making omakes and AU to the fic./

Semi abandoned

linkffn(A game of magic)

linkffn(11233702/1/Beyond-the-Wall)
