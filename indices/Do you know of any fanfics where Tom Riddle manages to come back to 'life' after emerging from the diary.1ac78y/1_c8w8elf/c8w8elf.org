[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][*A Butterfly Effect.*]] In this fic, Diary!Tom is a bit difficult to explain without giving some really great {great = uber creepy} plot elements away. Let's just say that his corporeal form plays a huge role in the second, third, and {I assume} fourth book {which is only two chapters in}.
