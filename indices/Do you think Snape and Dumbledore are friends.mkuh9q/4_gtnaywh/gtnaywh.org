Not friends. First, there is a huge age-gap between the two, it would be impossible to be on equal footing. I think they had a mentor-mentee or a father-son relationship. Even though Albus used him, I think he did really care about Snape. They did care about each other but their relationship couldn't be described as 'friends.'
