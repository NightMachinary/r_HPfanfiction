No.

I don't think Dumbledore really has very many friends. Snape is most definitely not a friend, because Dumbledore doesn't consider him an equal. He is is boss: in the school, in the Order, and for the Light.

The only people I recall that Dumbledore calls friend are Flamel and Moody. Fudge is not a friend, although Dumbledore is not his boss. Everybody else, he sees himself in a position of authority of them, and that makes them ineligible as true friends.
