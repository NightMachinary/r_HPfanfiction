Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard of the age. He promised to protect Lily. He has a whole organisation of people who should be able to protect this one woman. And still he fails?

Snape begged voldemort to not hurt Lily, and in all fairness to Voldy, Voldy asked Lily to "step aside girl" three times. Which is a hell of a lot more chances than most people get.

Fair enough he shouldn't go back to Voldemrt, but why on earth would he stick by Dumbledore instead?? Why not screw them both and just run away to France?

What is motivating him to stay with Dumbledore? What does he have to gain? Dumbledore broke his promise. Why does Snape have to keep his?
