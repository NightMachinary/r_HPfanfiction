I always got the feeling that that promise Snape made to Dumbledore was essentially an unbreakable vow. Or at the very least, a promise that Snape is now ensnared by.

He gave himself to Dumbledore in the desperate hope of saving Lily.

But Lily died anyway? So why on Earth does Snape stay? Dumbledore promised to save them and he didn't? Why trust a liar? Snape barely cares for Harry, he does so out of duty to Lily's memory, not because he likes Harry.

I just feel like that promise Snape made was more than a troth, it feels more binding. It's Dumbledore or orders him to go back and spy after Voldemorts return. Dumbledore who commands him to leak the day of Harry's removal from Privet Drive. Dumbledore who puts Snape into a position where he is hated by both Voldemorts followers and all of Hogwarts by being headmaster.

If Snape could have, he would have just ran. Hidden far away from all the nightmare and mourned Lily somewhere. But he doesn't. Why the hell does he stay?? What is motivating him to stay?? What does Snape have to gain by staying at Hogwarts and working for Dumbledore?? Nothing. To protect Harry? A boy he doesn't like, he has no attachment to only for Lily? That's not love, that's an obligation. He hates Harry, that's clear throughout the books. If Dumbledore hadn't made him stay, Snape would be long gone.

Enslaved is a strong word but I can't think of a better one... Trapped?

That's my view of it anyway.
