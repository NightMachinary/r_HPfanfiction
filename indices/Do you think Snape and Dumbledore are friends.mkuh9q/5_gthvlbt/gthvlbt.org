I don't think Dumbledore knows how to have friends... I feel like people respect Dumbledore but don't necessarily like him. I feel like Dumbledore views 'friends' as "people who have use/value".

I think Dumbledore is 'friends' with Snape, as much as someone can be. Friends in that he uses Snape as a close advisor and is pleased when Snape complies. And to Dumbledore, that is what a 'friend' is.

But Snape (imo and it's just how I read it) is indebted to Dumbledore, is forced to obey him, enslaved by him in a way. He does not like Dumbledore but is obliged by the necessity of a vow ("what will you give me Severus? Anything") to be a servant. But no, he does not like him.
