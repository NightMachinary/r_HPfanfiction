Dumbledore still has an immense amount of power and influence over Snape's life. Like he could literally get Snape killed, or thrown in Azkaban, or destroy his livelihood if he decided to withdraw his support over a relationship issue. If Snape wanted to break up, it would be really hard for him to get out of the relationship in a peaceful way without risking his safety.

Just because two people are adults doesn't make a relationship healthy or okay. That's why doctors are not allowed to date their patients, even when their patients are adults. And why it's frowned upon for college professors to date their adult students. Or bosses to date their underlings.
