Well age matter for two reasons. First because usually men that are 30yo like Snape are not attracted to men aged 100yo+ (even if we qssume that adumbledore looks.like a 80yo the point still stands). Second because of the power dinamic. Dumbledore is not only Snapes boss but he was also his teacher and headmaster when he was a kid. It is weird.

About Snape I wont enter indetail because I am tired of the Snape is good/bad debate but his views about live and relations are certainly quite abusive imo.
