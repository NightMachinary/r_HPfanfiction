#+begin_quote
  Harry has almost accepted that he won't be going back to his own time, and he's working in a small apothecary in Diagon Alley to make ends meet. Then someone tries to blow up his employer's shop, and that brings him face-to-face with Tom Riddle, who he successfully avoided during his time at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.
