  Tom Riddle finds that he does not like it when Professor Potter doesn't pay him any attention. Something should be done about that.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N: Fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.

  The Dark Lord wanted a consort and had decided to host a competition that involved nearly everyone in Britain. If they thought they were good enough, they could enter to compete in a certain amount of tasks set by the Lord of the lands himself. Only the victor would have the skills necessary to become Voldemort's consort. Harry unfortunately nabs the Dark Lord's attention. Voldemort does as he pleases.Hermione enters to win, Bellatrix takes interest in certain people, and of course there's the villain causing trouble.A/N: SLASH/Harrymort/AU. I'm still waiting for someone to tell me exactly how this sounds like Harry is a slave. Please do so. Nothing at all would suggest it. How about we don't assume that because the word "consort" is involved, it must *obviously* be about slavery. Does anyone actually know what a consort is?

  The last thing Voldemort remembered was dying. The next thing he knew, he was wet, blind and back to his homunculus body.A few days later, he realizes he wasn't back to his Homunculus body but was actually in an infant's body.A few weeks later, he realizes he had been reborn and the one who gave birth to him was no one else but his nemesis Harry James Potter.A few months later, he realizes he actually adores his new â€˜mother'.A few years later... he finds out his father is actually Tom Marvolo Riddle.
