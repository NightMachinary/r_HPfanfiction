Especially, “There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel” linkffn(13137899), which has the most awesome Petunia around (or How did I destroyed The Mightiest Dark Wizard of All Times with the Handbook of The Muggle Liaison Office) and one of the darkest Dumbledore's I have ever read, and yet I still don't think it is a stupid Dumbles bashing.
