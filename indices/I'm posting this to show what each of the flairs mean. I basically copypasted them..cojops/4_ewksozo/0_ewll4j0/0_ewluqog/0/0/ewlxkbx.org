What do you even mean how is it vote manipulation. It's pretty definitely vote manipulation, and saying "downvote me elsewhere to even it out" isn't going to change that, if anything it makes it worse.

You are trying to influence how people are voting to make something more viewed, and that is therefore vote manipulation. Period. That you're also trying to counterbalance your gained votes isn't really relevant because it's not about the karma so much as it's about the visibility. You just need to trust that people are going to upvote you if they feel this needs to be visible, and trying to influence them 'cuz everyone needs to see this!' isn't necessary or a valid excuse.
