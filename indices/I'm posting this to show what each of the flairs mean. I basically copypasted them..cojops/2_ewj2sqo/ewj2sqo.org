According to the "How to flair your post" link in the sidebar, "looking for fics that fit a certain criteria" is simply [Request] not [Seeking Recommendations] as stated when submitting a post. It also describes [Wiki] and [Recommendation] flairs which aren't mentioned in the post submission page (which implies by omission that such should simply be [Misc]).

Personally I have flairs simply turned off across reddit. I find they're more trouble than they're worth. /HPfanfiction is hardly a high-traffic subreddit and it's usually easy to figure out a post's intent from the title.
