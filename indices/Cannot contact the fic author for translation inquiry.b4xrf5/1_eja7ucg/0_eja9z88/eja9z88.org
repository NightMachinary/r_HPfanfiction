I agree with this. I would be offended if someone translated my work and posted it separately from me. Wait for the author to respond and let them post it themselves. It's not yours to do that with without discussion. I know you have good intentions but when you write something it becomes very personal to you and there is a lot of emotion you feel towards your fic. I had a reader post my fic on a site - she gave me credit etc. and posted it there because I didn't use that site and wanted others to see it- but it truest upset me. Because it was my story and my story should be where I felt comfortable having it. I felt robbed of that choice and I despised that she took my work and did what she wanted.
