I know how you feel, but don't do anything without the author's permission. I'm very familiar with the story in question - it's one of my all-time favorites, and I'm also sad that Oddment Tweak hasn't ever produced more or even responded to anything else, but that's how it goes.

But taking someone else's work and posting it without their permission, even when you're translating it, is not cool. I recently discovered someone else reposting one of my stories without my permission and I was surprised and how angry it made me. They did a bit of editing on their own, nothing major - mostly changing chapter headings, etc, and still gave me credit, but the discovery felt like a violation, like a betrayal of trust.

Don't do that to someone else. Especially don't do that to someone whose work you've enjoyed. It's incredibly disrespectful.
