Just do it. Fanfic is already a derivative work made for fun that doesn't explicitly get Rowling's permission for each work.

So go ahead and translate the work, and don't be a dick about it - clearly flag it as a translation at the start of each chapter, and link to the original English-language version. Add a disclaimer along the lines of "if you like this work, please go to the original work at this link and give the author kudos/reviews."

If the author somehow later shows up and asks you to take down your translation, then they're being the dick, not you (after all, they took JK's work without explicit permission from her to make their own derivative work, so refusing to let others do the same is hypocritical dickery).

Obviously that doesn't apply to straight-up plagiarism, but for things like AU-of-an-AU or "alternative endings" or other types of fanfic-of-fanfic, then you absolutely do not need legal permission, and so long as you're polite about referencing and linking to the original fanfic, I'd say you're also in the clear etiquette-wise.

EDIT: Bunch of other folks in the thread offering opposing opinions. That's how it goes - reasonable people can disagree. I still maintain that by at least trying to contact the author and clarifying that you'll take it down if you've given offense, you're in the clear.
