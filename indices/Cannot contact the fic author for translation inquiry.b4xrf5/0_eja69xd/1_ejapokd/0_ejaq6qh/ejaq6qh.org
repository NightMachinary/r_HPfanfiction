I would think personal attacks and plagiarism would be much more disrespectful.

And, as it happens, I did have someone ask to re-post one of my works to a website I don't use (not HP fandom). My response was literally, "...nice of you to ask, but pretty sure you don't need my permission. Just list [my alias on the original website] as the author and link back to the original post, and that's all good, man."

Now if the author resurfaces and says she's not cool with it and wants the foreign-language version taken down, it would only be polite to comply.
