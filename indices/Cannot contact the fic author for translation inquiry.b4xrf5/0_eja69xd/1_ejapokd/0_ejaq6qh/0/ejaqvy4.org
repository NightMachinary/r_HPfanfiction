You see, in your example, the person asked before doing anything - that was appropriate. That way you, as the author, could decide whether or not you would like to have your work posted somewhere else.

Taking away that choice, taking away the author's control over their work, is the problem.

Personal attacks (I'm talking internet flames here, not something actually dangerous) don't feel anywhere near as violating or disrespectful, in my opinion.

You're right about plagiarism though.
