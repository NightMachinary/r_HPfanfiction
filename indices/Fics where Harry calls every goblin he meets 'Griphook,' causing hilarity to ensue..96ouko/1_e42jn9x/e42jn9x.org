I can't remember which fic, but there was one where the goblins started taking human names to be more approachable, and one of them was named Sally. Harry was mentally debating telling them that that was a girl's name and ends up not doing it, then after he leaves Sally asks the other goblin if they think Harry noticed that she was in fact a girl.
