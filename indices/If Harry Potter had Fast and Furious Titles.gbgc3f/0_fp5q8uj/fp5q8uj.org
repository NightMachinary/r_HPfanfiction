I would read Harry Potter presents: Snape and Sirius. Actually I wish there was a series called Harry Potter Presents. It would be like the Old DC O Comics presents. Showcase a character or concept from the HP world. Harry Potter Presents:Tales of the Unspeakables. Harry Potter Presents: Trials of the Tolly Witch Harry Potter Presents: Marauders Mayham. Etc....
