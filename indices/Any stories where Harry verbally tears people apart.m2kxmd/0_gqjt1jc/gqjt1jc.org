The closest I can think of on the spot are [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/cywscross/pseuds/cywscross][cywscross]] stories. Harry tends to be rather well spoken and shoots down people with calm poise. But he doesn't tear Umbridge, Voldemort or Malfoy apart as far as I know...

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217][Dead Man Walking]] he starts to take his studies seriously after 4th year and gradually learns how to keep calm and verbally backtalk.

Or in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][C'est La Vie]] he also showcases calm poise.

(Both are incomplete)

Otherwise....I think wbwl have usually smackdowns you're looking for. Though I don't keep track of them sorry.
