Imagination by Potato19 sounds like exactly what you're looking for. linkffn(12149290) It's in the immediate aftermath of the Final Battle and with both Harry and Hermione feeling alienated by the Weasleys while the family grieves over Fred, they grow closer and eventually decide to get away from it all and see if they can restore Hermione's parents' memories in Australia. Short but sweet fic with Harmony pairing and despite what the premise may make it sound like, no Weasley bashing.
