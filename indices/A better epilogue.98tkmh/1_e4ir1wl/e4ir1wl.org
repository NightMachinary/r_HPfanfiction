Yeah it always seemed obvious to me that Harry should have been a teacher... and the period of disappearing for a few years also makes a lot of sense to me. If there's one guy who would need some time off to see the world and discover himself it would be Harry.

I have to admit I only skimmed the fic. It seems a bit wordy for what it is.

but that's probably because my weak spot for HHr.

"One Big Happy Weasley Family" actually has one of my favorite Luna quotes in all of fanfiction:

  "That's actually a great idea. If we go on like that, we could have Hogwarts full of a single, one big happy Weasley family one day," said Luna full of excitement. "Or even the whole wizarding world. Wouldn't that be cool? There would only be muggles and Weasleys!"
