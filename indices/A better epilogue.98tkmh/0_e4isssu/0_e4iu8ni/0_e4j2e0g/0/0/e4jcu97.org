Agreed with the Matrix, not so sure about the Epilogue -- it's just 7 pages that you can, like many fanfic authors do, choose to ignore.

But in defence of the prequel trilogy, they've spawned a rich backstory for the originals and so much ground for exploration in the EU. My favourite characters in Star Wars are Anakin and Ahsoka, and if you look at Star Wars fanfiction, Anakin is the most popular character to write about.

I /really/ hate what Disney have done with the new trilogy though. The Thrawn/Mara/Jacen Solo future was way more interesting than what they've made, and I'm worried that relegating them to /Legends/ will decrease the interest in both reading and writing for that future.
