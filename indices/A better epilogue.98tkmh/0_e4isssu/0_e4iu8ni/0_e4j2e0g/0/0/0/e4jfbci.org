  The Thrawn/Mara/Jacen Solo future was way more interesting than what they've made, and I'm worried that relegating them to Legends will decrease the interest in both reading and writing for that future.

See, that's exactly my point about the epilogue in HP. Couldn't agree more. Yet, you said:

#+begin_quote
  it's just 7 pages that you can, like many fanfic authors do, choose to ignore.

Which isn't really true. You can't unmake the Epilogue. It is inherently intertwined with the world of HP. It is bad for the book series, but it is catastrophic for the lore and fanfiction, because it stifles creativity. The Epilogue immediately split the community into Epilogue-compliant and EWE stories... it reduced the interest in reading and writing stories for that future where Harry becomes a healer or a teacher, because they were relegated to /EWE/ fics (who are only of interest for cynical assholes)
