Timely Errors is a fun story with essentially that. It's a Thursday and things always go wrong on Thursdays and he ends up being covered in time sand and sent back in time. It's just good craic really! The DADA teacher is a Moody-esque knock off and Harry's trying to avoid him because they're too interested in Harry's experience with Unforgivables. It's back to Marauders but the Marauders don't like him which is a different dynamic. It's fun I recommend it!

Harry is very 'Well this just may as well happen my life is dumb enough as is". It's very funny. Very Murphys Law.
