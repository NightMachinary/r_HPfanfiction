The main character temporarily breaks time at some point in one of the later years of linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red), and it's one of the most gloriously surreal things you will ever read. You may ask: is it worth it to read the whole thing just for that chapter? Not as such, is the answer, but the story is generally awesome and it is /generally/ worth it to read it.
