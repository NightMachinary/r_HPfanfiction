Hi! I'm currently writing a story with two OCs in it. I haven't planned for them to get in a relationship with any of the main cast so, no. But they pretty much grew up alongside Harry and are two of his best friends/family.\\
I believe my favourite interaction so far was in between Remus, Sirius and the OCs and also with Harry! It's all family dynamics :))
