I wrote Draco with an OC.

I picked up an old fanfic I'd written years ago pre-HBP without looking at what's actually going on in the HP ff community, and I see in hindsight that she kind of had a similar place as fanon Daphne Greengrass does (pureblood Slytherin, but not sympathetic to the Death Eaters). I probably would've swapped her out if I didn't have a huge backstory that didn't fit Daphne, and OC's parents were also Death Eaters, which to me didn't suit the Greengrasses. I left them, the Parkinsons, Bulstrodes, and Zabini parents to be various shades of pure-blooded families.
