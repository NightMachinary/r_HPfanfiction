Thanks man! I'm still working on the first chapter. Progress hasn't been bad, I just keep rereading it and adding and subtracting things to make it better. Once I have a few chapters done I'll be sending them off to my beta who is a professional writer himself (he also knows Jim butcher personally so fuck ya there lol).

This is my first ever attempt at creative writing, so I just hope I can write the story that I have in my head well enough to do it justice.
