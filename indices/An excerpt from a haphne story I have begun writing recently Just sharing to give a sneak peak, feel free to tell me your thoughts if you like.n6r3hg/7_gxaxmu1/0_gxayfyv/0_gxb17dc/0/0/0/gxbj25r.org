Ahh I think I don't have a preference between the first two, but I deff won't be posting on Wattpad. Every time I've tried to read a fanfic on Wattpad it's been locked behind a paywall (subscription) and I don't want my fic locked behind something like that. I'm not doing it for money I'm just doing it for fun
