Although, discarding the easily treatable plague, this time really calls for some humanity-is-dying-from-plague story (the magical version of “The Day of the Triffids”!). The only one I know about is “Harry Potter and the Guardian Wand by sikeus” linkffn(6719282). Awesome setup, but then it drags on for too long, unfortunately.
