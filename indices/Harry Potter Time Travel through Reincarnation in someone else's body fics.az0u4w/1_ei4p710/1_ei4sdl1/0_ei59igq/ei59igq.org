And was a monster on the same level as people like Bellatrix(?). This guy literally killed people for their stories, and for those saying erasing memories isn't killing them, it kind of is. Your essentially erasing a pretty big piece of them(after all, the pieces sell books) which means that they are not the person they were which means your killing that identity. He's viewed as an idiot, but to me he's a monster who deserves everything he got in canon.
