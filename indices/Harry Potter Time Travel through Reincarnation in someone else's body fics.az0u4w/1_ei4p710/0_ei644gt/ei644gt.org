Ah. This fic. You know, this actually inspired me to make [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/67l4vj/what_are_some_dealbreakers_that_make_you_click_x/][this post]] last year.

Like, I understand that this is a humor fic, but Dumbledore's evil scheming in the beginning of Chapter 12, specifically calling Hermione a mud blood, pairing up Harry and Ginny with a life debt orchestrated by allowing Ginny to be possessed, and all the greater good talk, just ended any chance of me going any further with it. I mean a grown up version of Harry Potter demeaning, embarrassing, and degrading a 12 year old Ron Weasley was pretty out of character, but combined with Dumbledore's spiel?

That was a little bit too much for me.

idk, maybe the fic gives more context and it will turn out that it's all to make fun of those tropes, so I'll read a bit more of it, but the bashing and characterization of those characters were just really out there and over the top.
