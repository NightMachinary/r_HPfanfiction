I am aware of this one and its been on my "to read" for a while. But I have yet to get up the energy to read it because:

- A: It's Gilderoy Lockhart (eww)
- B: Its rated T (which concerns me based upon the premise)
- C: Harry still exists and I was concerned how the author would depict Harry seeing himself.

Honestly, the only reason I still want to read it is its depicted as "Humor" and I do like funny crack fics at times.
