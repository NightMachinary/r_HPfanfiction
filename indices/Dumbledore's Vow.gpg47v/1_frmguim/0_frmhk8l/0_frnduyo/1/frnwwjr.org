It baffles me that this wasn't an option on the table. Unless they were under a Fidelius, I don't understand why they couldn't blow Malfoy Manor sky high and then hunt the Horcruxes at their leisure.

Hell, get Snape to tell them when Voldemort is there and boom assassins. Or just strap a some sort of explosives in there and kill them all, there's got to be someone fanatical enough to do it.

With Voldemort gone, they could remove his soul anchors without the threat of Voldemort himself.
