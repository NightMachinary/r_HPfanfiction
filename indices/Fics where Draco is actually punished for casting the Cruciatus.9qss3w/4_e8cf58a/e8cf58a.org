I'm not sure why you're hoping for Malfoy to get punished - while Draco makes an attempt at the curse, Umbridge actually casts the curse and is rescued from the centaurs and freely walks out of the school back to her Undersecretary job. AD was the one who rescued her - if he can manage to "forgive" Umbridge using an unforgivable, he will "forgive" an attempted one as well.

I cannot say for sure, but worst case scenario, a criminal case between HP and DM, the persecution would go as "HP cursing DM to point where he bleeds rivers of blood over something DM was trying to say". Any lawyer worth his salt would trash HP's case. I doubt saying "cru-" is enough to get off of using a hack and slash curse on a person.
