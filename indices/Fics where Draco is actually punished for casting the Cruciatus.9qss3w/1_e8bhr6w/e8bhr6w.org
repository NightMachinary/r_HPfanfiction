This is just speculation, but here's what I think. First, Snape is the one who found them. If it was any other teacher, Malfoy would have been in a lot more trouble. The fact that it's Snape is important.

Now, Dumbledore would have been the one who expelled him. If Draco would have been expelled, his mission to kill Dumbledore would have been a failure. Had he failed, Voldemort would have killed him as punishment for him and his family. Dumbledore explained on the top of the tower that he never did anything to stop Draco because he was trying to protect him. By not expelling him, he was still trying to protect him.
