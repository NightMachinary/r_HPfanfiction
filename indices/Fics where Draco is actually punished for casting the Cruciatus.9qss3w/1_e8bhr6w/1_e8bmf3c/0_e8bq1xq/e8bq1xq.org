Yeah it's not like Dumbledore is evil just for shits and giggles. He just has his own agenda (protecting Snape and winning the war) that takes precedence over his duties and protecting his students.

I often get into this argument with Dumbledore lovers who are under the false impression that I consider him "comically" evil. He's just evil like any other regular person: Rationalizing himself into a position where he has to do evil things to continue.
