  By not expelling him, he was still trying to protect him.

I would honestly rather believe that he's protecting Draco to keep Snape breathing (which he views vital to the war effort, perhaps only 2nd to Harry), due to the unbreakable vow he gave to Narcissa (are the motivations for that ever explained?)

Otherwise, protecting someone with three attempted murders and unforgivable use is just plain evil stupidity.
