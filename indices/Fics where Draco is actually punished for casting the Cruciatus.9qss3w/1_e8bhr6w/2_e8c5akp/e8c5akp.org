I think it's also worth noting that Harry was the only witness, and since Malfoy didn't complete the curse there wouldn't have been any evidence. And Harry's account couldn't really be considered unbiased - it was well known that he and Draco didn't get along, and Harry would've had motive to lie about his actions being in self-defense.\\
Even if Dumbledore had wanted to expel Draco (which he obviously didn't), I doubt he could have justified doing so.
