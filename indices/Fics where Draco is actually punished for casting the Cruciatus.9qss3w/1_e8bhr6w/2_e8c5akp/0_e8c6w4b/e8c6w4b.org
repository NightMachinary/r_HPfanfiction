Yeah, in a world with mind reading and flawless truth serums, there'd be no way to verify Harry's account... Sorry for the sarcasm, it just feels incredibly silly when I hear things like that. The Malfoy name had already gone to dirt, Lucius was a confirmed and imprisoned Death Eater in a society with a shitty court system.

And Scrimgeour (no clue if I spelled that right) would have been chomping at the bit to have A) Have a verifiable public record of doing something against the Death Eaters and B) For saving the "Chosen One". There's not a chance that without Dumbledore handling the situation to his liking that Draco would have gotten off for half of that stuff.
