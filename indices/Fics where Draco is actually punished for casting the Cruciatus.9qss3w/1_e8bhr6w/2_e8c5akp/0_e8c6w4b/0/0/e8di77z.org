  After all, innocent people get thrown in jail (and not just Sirius; Scrimgeour arrested Stan Shunpike)
#+end_quote

Sirius was imprisoned without a trial, and thus without having the opportunity to provide any defense, Veritaserum or otherwise. Shunpike wasn't convicted, just arrested, I'm pretty sure. Even if he wasn't, was he ever /confirmed/ not to be a Death Eater? He sure was weirdly intense about Sirius when he thought he was a mass murderer.

  whenever we saw court proceedings (Dumbledore's memories in GoF, Harry's trial in OotP) neither Veritaserum nor Legilimency were used.
#+end_quote

Harry's trial in OotP was a kangaroo court - they were deliberately messing with the system to get a guilty verdict that they knew wasn't true. Using Veritaserum would be directly counter to that. I think that during Karkaroff's trial he actually WAS under Veritaserum. When he says that the literal prosecutor's son was a Death Eater, everyone takes it seriously instead of writing it off as a desperate prisoner saying whatever he thinks will cause a stir. Why would they react that way, unless they KNEW he was telling the truth.
