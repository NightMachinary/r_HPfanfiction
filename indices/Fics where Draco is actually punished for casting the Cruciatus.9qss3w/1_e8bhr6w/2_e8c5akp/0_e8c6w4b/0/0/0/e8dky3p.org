But Karkaroff isn't behaving anything like a person under Veritaserum. When Crouch Jr is given Veritaserum after the third task, he's described as talking "in a flat, expressionless voice" (GoF Chapter 35) and is calm throughout the whole thing, while Karkaroff is described as shouting and sounding panicked. (Also, Karkaroff didn't name Crouch Jr as a Death Eater in the books.)

As for Shunpike, we're clearly not supposed to believe he's a Death Eater. Mr. Weasley says "I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and ‘three arrests' sounds better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases'" (HBP, Chapter 16; note also that Shunpike isn't the only person the Ministry is holding on dubious evidence) and it's not like Scrimgeour tried to convince Harry Shunpike was actually guilty.

And of course Harry's trial in OotP was a kangaroo court, but if Veritaserum or Legilimency were generally admissible then Dumbledore would've requested they be used.
