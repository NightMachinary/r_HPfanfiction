Actually, he was "arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters' secret plans in a pub" (HBP, Chapter 11); there's no indication that he did anything more than talk. And Mr. Weasley said "I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and ‘three arrests' sounds better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases'" (HBP, Chapter 16), showing that both the Ministry knows full well he's not a Death Eater, and that they've arrested and held other innocent people. Plus, I think it's telling that when Harry confronts Scrimgeour about Shunpike's imprisonment, Scrimgeour doesn't even try to convince Harry that he could be guilty.
