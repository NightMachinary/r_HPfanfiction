  Yeah, in a world with mind reading and flawless truth serums, there'd be no way to verify Harry's account...

Except that everything we see of the wizarding justice system suggests that they don't use those methods? After all, innocent people get thrown in jail (and not just Sirius; Scrimgeour arrested Stan Shunpike) and guilty people walk free with alarming regularity in the series, and whenever we saw court proceedings (Dumbledore's memories in GoF, Harry's trial in OotP) neither Veritaserum nor Legilimency were used. They aren't even mentioned as possibilities, which strongly suggests that they're not admissible in court. Plus, both Harry and Draco were underage at the time, and it seems reasonable that there would be strict regulations on using Veritaserum or Legilimency on a minor.

And sure, the Malfoy name didn't count for much at that point, but arresting or even expelling Draco on such limited evidence would set a precedent that I imagine a lot of prominent, powerful families would find quite concerning.
