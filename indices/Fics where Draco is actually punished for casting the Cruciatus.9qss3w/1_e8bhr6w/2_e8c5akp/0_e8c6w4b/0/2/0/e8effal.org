I never said that Veritaserum is illegal. I said it's not used in court, which is different. Lie detector tests are perfectly legal, but you still can't use them to get someone convicted (at least in the US). I don't understand your explanation of Karkaroff not being given Veritaserum, either - you say it was because he was already in prison, but the point of his hearing wasn't to evaluate his guilt, it was get the names of other Death Eaters. If the Ministry had a "flawless truth serum" that they could use in court proceedings, why on earth wouldn't they use to make sure he truthfully gave all the information he had? And similarly, if Veritaserum was an accepted part of court proceedings, why didn't Dumbledore request that Harry be testified under it at his trial?
