The difference is current evidence suggests lie detectors are maybe 65% accurate, Veritaserum assures compete honesty (short of mastering Occlumency). But as I said, the restrictions on it appear to be in cases where the person is thought to be insane, so their honest opinion isn't worthwhile in court. A sane witness to an attempted crime is something can come before a court, especially when the purported criminal has so much going against him.

The Kakaroff point wasn't about Legilimency,.I'm saying that generally when the full court is called in it's on a case which has already been decided beforehand. There exactly zero reason to use a truth serum on someone you've already decided is guilty. Crouch Jr and Bellatrix were thrown away in record time and Kakaroff was only brought before the court because he was giving up names. As Dumbledore pointed out, having the full court meet for a hearing for underage magic was extremely unusual. The reason I brought these up is best you mentioned them in your initial response but you didn't consider that these were highly irregular. Harry wasn't originally supposed to be in court, he was set to have a meeting with Amelia Bones alone, and the others weren't hardly court proceedings (Kakaroff's wasn't even). When asked about this, JKR said that it /is/ used in interrogations but that it wasn't taken as gospel because of the insanity and Occlumency possibilities. As for why Harry didn't take it, there's plenty for reason. Imagine Fudge asked him "Is Dumbledore working against me?" He'd spill the beans on the Order and Sirius's presence at Number 12, even if the Fidelius prevents the Ministry from going in. That would put lots of people in jail.
