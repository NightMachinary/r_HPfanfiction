The problem is Sirius was apparently caught red handed and thought to have been insane, so his testimony (Veritaserum or not) was considered inadmissible; Harry was not thought to be insane. Draco was a student, son of a convicted death Eater and while Harry was a popular, living witness to give an account and who could volunteer to take the truth serum (Scrimgeour was desperate to get Harry on board months later, after all). In the examples you mention those people were all presumed guilty (or else already in prison, e.g. Kakaroff) or the court cases were farces (Crouch Jr. and Bellatrix), the result was immediately obvious in every case from the beginning. Veritaserum was never said to be illegal at all, Snape even threatened Harry with it in OoTP.

And I doubt precedence would have been an issue at all. People were thrown in prison without a trial right after the first war, but that didn't spread out to judicial practice as a whole as Dumbledore confirms in OoTP by pointing out how excessive Harry's hearing was.
