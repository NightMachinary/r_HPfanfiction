This is a bit wtf moment in the books for me. Harry gets in trouble for almost accidentally killing someone who was going to purposely torture him. And fucking Snape wanders in, throwing Harry all the blame, as usual. If there is a fic where people get remotely upset with Draco for attempting this, I would be super happy.
