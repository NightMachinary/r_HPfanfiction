One of my favourites is right now [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=241161][Pirates]] which is a OOC (think that's the right term). It's a WIP Dramoine, but the plot is good, and the characters have depth. It was the premise that drew me in initially, although I was worried it might fizzle out in the end. Needless to say, that didn't happen ;)
