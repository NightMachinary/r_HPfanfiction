Work in Progress

This is a Marauder Era fanfiction. It is about when James, Sirius and Lupin are at school. Right now it only has 34 chapters and she only updates like once every 6 months but it is still a great read! Story sticks fairly close to what you could have guessed times would be like then based on the original series by JK

This story is about what happens during book 7 while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out hunting horcruxes. It is told from mostly Nevilles point of view. It's pretty much exactly what you would imagine went on while you were reading about what the trio was up to. It starts off at Bill and Fleurs wedding and ends just after the Battle of Hogwarts.

3 books complete, 4th in progress

This is the James potter series, it's fantastic! Centers around Harry's first born son and his first 3 years at Hogwarts. Features old and new charecters, but the story is great. Good news, the author is working on the 4th one now!

This is an alternate universe fanfiction. It's the entire series written as if Harry had been sorted into Slytherin instead, and it's amazing! I actually found that I liked this version of Harry a bit more than the one in the original series. He is just a lot more of a badass and much less of a whiny bitch. Beware though because this fanfiction is 10 chapters shy of being complete. You end after reading one chapter of year six.

This is another version of what happens at Hogwarts during year 7 from Nevilles POV. It is much darker than the fanfiction resistance, but I actually enjoyed the intensity of it. Very good read, it is complete with 25 chapters.

This is a completely amazing one shot about Dennis Creevey and other members of the DA and I believe some from the Order of the Phoenix. Basically Dennis takes pictures of the scars left behind from the second war, its beautiful and touching despite being around 1,600 words.
