[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]] by Inverarity is the first book in a series about a young American witch with a terrible destiny. There's four books so far, supposed to be seven in the series, and it is absolutely amazing...almost professional quality. Needs way more credit than it gets. Darker plot than the HP series, but still just as fun.
