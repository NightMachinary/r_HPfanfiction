My Favorites :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] by Mira Mirth : This is /the/ Slytherin Harry AU. Excellently written and beautifully characterized. Each chapter is better than the last and it seems to get better on every reread -- I've read the 5th and 6th years of this story at least a dozen times. If you haven't read this story, stop whatever the fuck you're doing and start reading. WIP.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Trilogy]] by Shezza : Dark!Harry. Slight crossover with Dresden Files. The Fallen angel Meciel gives seven year old Harry a chance to escape the Dursleys and be powerful. Great Asshole Harry and excellent action scenes. Also, best Dumbledore characterization ever. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]] by Sanction : Epic LOTR-esque journey. Harry, Moody and his mercenary nephew go on a quest to retrieve a weapon for Voldemort's downfall. Best characterized OCs /ever/. There are lots of twists and turns and major character deaths, but it never goes into grimdark territory. Story's major arc complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite][Equal and Opposite]] by Amerision : Easily the best 'Harry goes Dark' fic and revenge fic I've ever read. Harry meets his evil female self from another dimension, who intentionally seduces Harry and then leaves him, leaving Harry's life in shambles. Great twisted relationship between Harry and his female self. Harry's fall into darkness and madness is beautifully depicted. Slightly short, but complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][The Wendell that Wasn't]] by Opalish : Crack One-shot. Snape's ghost haunts the Potter family. This is some of the most hilarious stuff I've ever read.
