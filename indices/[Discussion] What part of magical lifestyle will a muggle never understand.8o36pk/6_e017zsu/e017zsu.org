There are some great explanations here, but one of the most glaring things I would think is the following:

Man cannot understand God.

And to muggles, wizards and witches are basically gods. Demigods, if you want. /Reality/ bows to their whims. /Your mind/ bows to their command. The fabric of the universe itself is in league with them, not through convoluted science and difficult theorems, but through their own mind, will and wand.

  Personally I think that difference, for example, between Western and Asian cultures are much bigger that between magical and non-magical Britain.

Yet Asian people have the same limits as you. They use the same technology, the same science, the same basic reasoning.

Magic - a reality bending force of ultimate power - seems like a bigger separator between those who have it and those who don't.
