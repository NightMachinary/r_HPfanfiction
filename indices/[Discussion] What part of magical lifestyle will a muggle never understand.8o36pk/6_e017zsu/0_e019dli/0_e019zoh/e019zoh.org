They are just like all of us, just with the /teeeensy tiny/ exception that they are literally as powerful as the gods of the greek, norse, roman,... pantheons. And the most powerful amongst the wizards and witches would even punch those guys out of the water.

They die, yes. But for a first, their lifetime /easily/ spans three muggle generations. Second, there are legit methods of prolonging that life and, in theory, even make them immortal. Life and Death for wizards is even different in the spiritual sense, as they are all well aware of the existence of souls and ghosts.

Their emotions are not just internal. Their feelings have actual effect on their surroundings. You don't even have to go to the obscure, talking about convoluted magic like the Love that was apparently needed for Lily's protections, or the true Hate that you need for the Cruciatus. I'm talking simple temper tantrums of toddlers, leading to magic violently, or subtly reacting outwards. Wizards and Witches know, from their day to day experiences, that their feelings, whims and emotions hold true, measureable power.

And then there is the point Achille-Talon brought up. Magic makes the impossible a daily occurence. With any nationality or culture you can at least think that their understanding of the laws of nature are somewhat similar. Wizards couldn't give less of a shit about the laws of nature. They care for the laws of magic, and that means they're thinking in an utterly different basis for their mindset. You cannot overstate how jarring; what an impossible to cross threshold it is, to find yourself confronted with a culture where even such things as /gravity/ are seen different. For wizards that isn't a natural fixture, its just a practical suggestion brought up by nature.
