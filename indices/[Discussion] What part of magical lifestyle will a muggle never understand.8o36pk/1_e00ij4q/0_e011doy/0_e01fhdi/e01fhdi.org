I agree with most of what you have said. I admit my view is a somewhat cynical view (not surprising considering who that quote is from), so take that with a grain of salt.

As I see it, the first step to understanding is being able to empathize with a person/culture/nation. You need a point of reference for this, and magic is an utterly alien thing to muggles. In the past, I would say that was probably not as big of an issue. In the modern world though, magic is often treated in a "wink-wink nudge-nudge" sort of manner. It's a trick, or an act. Even if people consciously accept magic is real, unless you have felt it, lived with it, its hard to find a way to relate to that.

I have always wondered about this aspect of magical versus non-magical too: what is it that makes them different, such that they can use magic? The only idea I have been able to come up with is that its not blood, but something about the psychological mindset wizards and witches that they are born with. Perhaps they are more open to the infinite, the arcane, the mystical as it were. Maybe they are people who are born able to accept the inherent contradictory behavior of magic itself (it has rules, except when it doesn't). If a muggle study were conducted, I suspect that they would classify all witches/wizards as having some sort of mental disorder (I'm not saying that is true, but its an interesting idea).

Ironically this might imply that so called purity of blood actually has a kernel of truth, but that its actually about the way a child's mind forms and develops. This may be what allows them to use magic, since magic is not a form of energy that exists within them, and why they cannot tell who possesses the capability until they first perform accidental magic. Indeed, since emotions are so inextricably linked to their magical capabilities at any given time, it suggests that possessing a certain mindset is inherent to the ability to use magic in the first place.

When you think about it, this would explain why some of the most powerful canon wizards are also more than a little loopy to us. Dumbledore is to put it mildly an eccentric old man running a magical boarding school, with questionable ideas about student safety. Voldemort is a narcissist with a god-complex, convinced of his own inherent superiority and invincibility, even though his Horcruxes prove that he does NOT think he was invincible and was in fact more afraid than anyone else. Its also why any wizard/witch with a shred of rational thinking or planning capability seems to be able to utterly outfox entire populations of magical nations.

And yes, Hermione's parent would certainly want to take her out of the world. But she would not want to leave. What they can't understand is that magic is part of her life, and giving it up would, at least in her mind, mean that the Death Eaters won.

TLDR: I suspect wizards/witches have entirely different mental setup to that of muggles, and this by definition makes it hard
