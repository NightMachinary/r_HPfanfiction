To be honest I agree with your opinion about the "they will never understand me" idea. It does not make a lot of sense using a logical perspective. Its born, I think, from an attempt to try and explain the inconsistencies in canon with why they do not involve Muggles, why the muggle-borns don't just leave, and some rather terrible parental/guardian behavior displayed in canon towards magicals (Dursleys, Grangers, etc.). People are trying to reconcile this.

Thus, the fandom arrives at the conclusion that either magic is so important to people who are able to use it that they could never give it up, or that they are too proud/unwilling/ignorant to try and take the out.

Just my thoughts on the matter.
