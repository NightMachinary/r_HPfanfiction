I think magic is just an ability. Like super-powers, gene X, etc. It doesn't transform you into another being and make you better that people without it.

Nothing in books contradicts it. The wizards and witches there use the modern English and terms, interactions between children are not different from modern teenagers, etc.

Also they *learn* magic. It's not chaotic but follows some strict rules and laws. It also means that magic isn't beyond research and therefore science.

Those who scream "You don't have magics, so you will never understand me" are just rebellious teenagers. Even in this thread no one gave anything concrete to prove that statement.

I think Rowling made her magical world irrational for entertainment purposes only. She wanted it different, so she took mundane things and just twisted it to look unusual.

  And yes, Hermione's parent would certainly want to take her out of the world. But she would not want to leave. What they can't understand is that magic is part of her life, and giving it up would, at least in her mind, mean that the Death Eaters won.

Non-magical people have such thing as compromise. They could get her away from Hogwarts, move to another country and apply her into another more safe magical school.
