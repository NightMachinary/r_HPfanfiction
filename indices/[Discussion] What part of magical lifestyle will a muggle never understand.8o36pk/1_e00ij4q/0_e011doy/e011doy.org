I don't think any human had ever considered cutting his/her own hand with no reason.

Also your answer contains nothing about why a muggle could never understand the magical world.

All you have said can be applied to any person (magical or non magical) born and raised in one culture and never known about others.

  Has it ever occurred to anyone that the reason Hermione spent so little time with her parents was because they couldn't relate to there daughter and her lifestyle?

Personally I think no. Rowling didn't included her parents in the story, because their first reasonable action would be to get their daughter away from the environment where her life s under constant danger and it would had destroyed the plot.

  Perhaps this is why very few magicals end up with muggles. Wouldn't that be a one-sided relationship...

Or it's because wizards very rarely go into non-magical world.

Edit: fixed errors.
