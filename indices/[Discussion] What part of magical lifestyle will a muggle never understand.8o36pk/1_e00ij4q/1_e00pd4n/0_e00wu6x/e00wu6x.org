No. Punishment by way of pain is at best a band-aid solution that validates their arguments, and at worst turns them into martyrs and unites the public against the punisher (they may have done x, but that doesn't give you the right to do y).

One can learn much from the Soviets. After Berlin fell, no one knew what happened to Hitlers body. Later on, it was revealed that the Russians had secreted it away, so that followers and revolutionaries (see: neo-nazis) would not be able to use it as a propaganda tool and rallying point for their ideology (kinda what they did with Vladamir Lenin's body too).

The best solution would be to turn them into cultural pariahs, using magical contracts or the authority powers of the Ministry to brand them in a permanent manner, so that no one would ever listen too or even tolerate them in the magical world. The best example I can think of is shown in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). When Slytherin's descendants tried to attack Britain with the Spanish Armada in 1588, the Ministry responded with the Ultimate Sanction, a contract that magically forces the citizens of Britain to feel undisguised mistrust and outright hatred for anyone descended from their line. This is touted as why Slytherins are so hated by the time of canon.

If you believe, as some do, that the taboo Voldemort casts on his name is in fact a power held by the Ministry (or requiring the authority of the Ministry at least), it does not seem infeasible within canon. One could place a taboo on the last names of the death eaters, so that if anyone with magic uttered there names the ministry would be instantly alerted and punishment would ensue. Like with Voldemort's name, people would begin to automatically fear or even hate the name and what it stands for. And they would teach their children, who never knew the difference.

If you don't believe this would work: in 1935 there were 40+ people living in New York City with the name Adolf. There were 5 by 1950.

Something similar to this, turning their entire world, the only one they know how to live in, against them and their so-called "pureblood," would be the ultimate punishment. No martyrs, no symbols, no remembrance.
