To be honest, I would hope they wouldn't forget the first time, but they did. Frankly, its hard to blame them for it too. When the miraculous happens, people often don't question it because they're afraid if they do it will not be real.

Don't get me wrong: I agree with you that is what you should do and its what I would want them to do. My point was that 1) most people would not follow through with that, just like they often avoided embracing the darker aspects of war and 2) their is not real proof that their ideology has been stamped out, and the way you do that is too not turn them into martyrs. Unless you eliminate all reference and memory of an ideology, eventually it will resurface. Don't give your opponents a pole to hang their flag from, better to burn the flag instead.

No I do not have kids, though I do end up watching and managing them alot in my daily life. I certainly understand the desire for vengeance given the atrocities (both seen and unseen) inflicted upon the children at Hogwarts.
