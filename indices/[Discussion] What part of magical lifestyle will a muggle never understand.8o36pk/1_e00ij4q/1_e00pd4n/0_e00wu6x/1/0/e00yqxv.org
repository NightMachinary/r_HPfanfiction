You are giving the public too much credit I think. The idea that they would be merciless assumes they would consider their actions and punishment. The truth is that after most conflicts people try to forget anything happened and pretend their is not/never was a problem to begin with. Thats the worst thing they can do, but it invariably ends up happening. Why? Because most people just want to get on with their lives and not think about the bigger picture.

Wizards are no different in this regard. Realistically, what would most likely happen is that the people would leave it to their government to deal with the situation, and assume they would handle it adequately (thats pretty much how it is during the entirety of the Harry Potter series). As bad as the wars and attempted pseudo-holocaust were, most people would trust their government to deal with it and try to pick up where they left off. Thats how people are.

In the end, its whoever controls the ministry that will decide this. In their case, Shacklebolt spent time not only fighting but being chased down by both the DE and the Ministry, so he would be more prone to punishing the offenders. Others in positions of power, like Harry, Ron and Hermione, would be equally adamant and would have enough political influence from their fame to push anything through.

Do you know understand why the Nazi government and their crimes were so effectively ground out, while the crimes of Imperial Japan are rarely mentioned or taught to the Japanese? Its because collectively, the Americans, British, French and Soviets agreed to grind the German publics' faces in the crimes that they had committed. The entire German public was forced to watch and view the results of the concentration camps, the mass graves, the experiments, the remnants of Warsaw.

It is a far greater accomplishment to make your enemy see through your eyes than to close theirs forever.
