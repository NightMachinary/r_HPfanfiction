Magic is at the core of this. Whether they have wands or not, magic is in every part of their lives. If you don't have it you can never truly understand what its like.

There is a line from Knights of the Old Republic II by one of my favorite fictional characters that sort of gives you an idea of what magic is to wizards, and what taking it away would be like (imagine jedi = wizards):

"Yes, and what are they without the Force? Take the greatest Jedi Knight, strip away the Force, and what remains? They rely on it, depend on it, more than they know. Watch as one tries to hold a blaster, as they try to hold a lightsaber, and you will see nothing more than a woman -- or a man. A child."

Its the same thing for wizards. Magic is so inextricably a part of their lives that they practically have no idea how you can function without it. The resident expert on muggles in the Ministry of Magic doesn't know how to light a match or how a tent works. Ron has to brainwash a driving test proctor.

Has it ever occurred to anyone that the reason Hermione spent so little time with her parents was because they couldn't relate to there daughter and her lifestyle? Perhaps this is why very few magicals end up with muggles. Wouldn't that be a one-sided relationship...

Just to drive this home: not once in the entire series does any character in the wizarding world contemplate giving up magic or being part of their world. No one seems to consider going muggle at all. Its who they are.
