Think about what a person talks about with on a normal day with the people they know: their job (for adults), their education (for students), recent news and politics, celebrity gossip, sports, music, fashion, travel, etc.

In the wizarding world, every single one of these reference points will be different. Different jobs with different duties and different working procedures, different subjects studied in school, different news, different politicians and political institutions (and even different nations), different celebrities, different sports, different music, different clothes, different transportation.

With all that in mind, I'd turn the question around on you: what part of magical life would a Muggle understand? A Muggle and a wizard have very few shared reference points for all the things people normally discuss. Food and the weather are the only two that are really the same, and even then only if you don't delve too deep (e.g. they share the same food only so long as they discuss eating rather than cooking).

Truly, the only universal I see without anything lost in translation is family and relationships.
