I will never completely understand pregnancy. I am only able to observe and while that grants me knowledge it will bar me from every bit of knowledge that can be only gained by experiencing it.\\
That would be very similar to your proposed question. There will always be a fundamental difference. Not saying that we could not live side by side, afterall men and women have done so since forever, but it will always be a different. I could sit their and watch a woman in labour and contemplate her situation guess at her sensations and feelings and maybe be accurate. I will just never really know.

Everything that is being done with magic or because of magic can be accepted by me. I will just never be able to reach conclusions that can only be reached by doing magic or feeling it. If these conclusions cause life-style things, I would never be able to recreate them on my own and the reason they exist will be strange.
