Your answer is very similar to "you can never understand what another person feels because you aren't that person".

While technically it's correct, in general it's wrong, because all of us are very similar to each other from the biological standpoint and people of one society are similar from the cultural standpoint.

Psychology wouldn't exist if a person from outsied couldn't observe and find behaviour patterns in different people.

Using your example, while you cannot feel exactly what a pregnant woman feel, using your knowledge (from books about pregnancy) and your empathy you can make assumptions about her feelings to interact her, to help her where she struggles, to comfort her, etc.
