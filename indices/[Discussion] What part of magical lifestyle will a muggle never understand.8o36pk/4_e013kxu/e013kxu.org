Sharing the world with other living beings that are as intelligent as humans, but are /clearly not human./

Centaurs. Goblins. Merpeople. House elves.

All of these would be a match for a human, so we can for now apply the word "people" to them. Nevertheless, despite being "people", they are not human, and seemingly have no desire to be human. They have their own wants and needs, their own cultures, their own quite rich internal worlds. I think this would blow most Muggles' minds. We're not used to having a non-human counterpart that could actually match us.

Hermione runs into this a bit with S.P.E.W. Her heart is absolutely in the right place - Muggles figured out that keeping other human beings as slaves was wrong a long time ago, and that's her background. However, she doesn't think to /talk/ to the elves, and thus doesn't quite get for a long time that they see their position very differently than she does, from what to a human would be a pretty alien perspective.
