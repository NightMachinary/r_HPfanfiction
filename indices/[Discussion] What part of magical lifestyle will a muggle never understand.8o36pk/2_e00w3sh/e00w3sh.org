In HBP "The Other Minister" the muggle PM becomes frustrated with the magical ministry's inability to just stop Voldemort because (and I have to paraphrase here) "you're wizards, surely you can just fix it with a wave of your wand" and Fudge (I believe) replies that "the other side has wands too". I think this is a perfect example of muggle/wizard incompatibility: In the muggle world 'magic' is an abstract thing that is limitless. In the wizarding world 'magic' is a given, and they work to test its limits. Magic has consequences, and cannot do everything or anything.

Another example is Hermione's reaction to being made prefect in OotP. She immediately wants to inform her parents, because this is an achievement they will actually recognize and understand. Implied in this is that her other achievements are not understood. They probably understand when she says she placed first in every class, but they cannot understand what she's learned. Her pride at finally mastering something like the Patronus spell means nothing to them, because "magic is just about saying the words and directing the piece of wood, right?" And even if she explains how it works, they won't be able to try it out to fully understand it. She can explain the theory like it's an obvious thing, but they can never relate to how it actually is.

Magic is also scary to muggles, so there are things you wouldn't want to divulge for fear of seeming suspect. Love potions, obliviation, imperius and polyjuice makes it possible to control and manipulate anyone. They have ways to murder without a trace. Even basic pranks in the wizarding world have the potential to be terrifying to muggles, like eating a candy that makes your tongue swell up so much you cannot breathe, suddenly completely at your pranksters mercy. Wizards are scary AF.
