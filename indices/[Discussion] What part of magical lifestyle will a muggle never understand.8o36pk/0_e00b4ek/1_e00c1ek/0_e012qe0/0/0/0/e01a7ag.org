Yes, but how many people actually go towards their death in peace, knowing god has their backs? With the exception of the most fanatical, no one. Or in other words: no sane person trusts their spiritual feelings 100%.

For wizards it is an entirely reasonable thing to trust thiose feelings. They know this spiritual power holds true force to repel evil. And even if they can't do the charm themselves, they know others can do it.
