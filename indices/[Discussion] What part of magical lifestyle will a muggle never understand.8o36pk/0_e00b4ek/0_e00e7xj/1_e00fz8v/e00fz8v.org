Fair enough, but the way I'm looking at it, "Voldemort's plan doesn't make sense" doesn't actually translate to "Voldemort is not cunning and formidable". Indeed, I was taking the fact that Voldemort is cunning and formidable /and yet/ his plans are ludicrous as symptomatic of wizards' /general/ mindset that allows a mastermind to think this is an okay plan.

It is a testament to both Voldemort and Crouch Jr.'s unparallelled brilliance that in /spite/ of how convoluted the plan was, it still went off without a hitch until the /Priori Incantatem/ threw a spanner in the works. That they thought of that ludicrous plan is symptomatic of wizarding society as a whole lacking common sense (as also shown in the same book by... most everything about the Triwizard Tournament), /not/ of their personal lack of intelligence.

But there is no denying the plan was /way/ more complicated than it had any need to be. Rather than Confund the /freaking Goblet of Fire/ and take the risk of /attacking Alastor Moody in his own home/, they could, just off the top of my head, have faked a permission slip for Hogsmeade from Vernon Dursley, and then proceeded to ambush Harry on his next Hogsmeade visit. Don't tell me Barty Crouch Jr. and Peter Pettigrew, two extremely intelligent and competent Dark Wizards, working on the orders of an even more brilliant one, couldn't have achieved /that/ with much less fuss than that Goblet gamble.
