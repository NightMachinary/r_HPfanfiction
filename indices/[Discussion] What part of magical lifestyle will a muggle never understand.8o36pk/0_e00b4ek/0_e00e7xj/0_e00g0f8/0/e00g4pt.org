Though I agree with the thought, one may justify that this wouldn't have been quite enough. There seems to be a certain ceremony to how the blood is taken (use of a knife, for one thing); perhaps Harry needed to /be/ there, and the blood thrown into the potion harvested just a few seconds prior, for the ritual to work. There's wiggle room.
