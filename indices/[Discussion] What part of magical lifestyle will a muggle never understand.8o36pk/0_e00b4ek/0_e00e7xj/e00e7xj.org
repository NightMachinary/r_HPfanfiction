  Voldemort's plans make no sense
#+end_quote

1. Voldemort's top two "plans that don't make sense" occur when he doesn't have a real body, and is desperate as hell. Desperate people will grasp at any straws.

2. The GoF plan is actually rather brilliant (risky, but once again: desperate). Get your agent into Hogwarts by disguising him as a person Dumbledore trusts while keeping said person around to interrogate the shit out of to learn the information necessary to pull off such a thing with said person being widely known as a paranoid coot who used to work for/with the agent's father, giving said agent a decent enough understanding to start off with. Then, slip Harry into a tournament he can't get out of. Make sure he does just well enough to have a decent start at the final task, where it is easy to arrange for Harry to get to the Cup (via Imperious on Krum). Use said Cup to kidnap Harry, take his blood to re-embody Voldemort, kill Harry and send him back using the Portkey on the Cup, making it look like he died winning the Tournament. A tragic end to a promising wizard, keeping Voldemort's return secret. This only fails because of Priori Incantatem.

I never liked the idea of "Voldemort is stupid." We know that great skill with magic is correlated with great intelligence (see Dumbledore calling Voldemort the greatest student Hogwarts has ever seen, Griselda Marchbanks saying Dumbledore did things during his NEWTs that she had never seen, Grindlewald) and Voldemort is (with exception of the love-related old magic he scorns and wand-lore) easily the best wizard (in terms of doing magic) of all time. I mean, shit, it only took Voldemort 33 days in a Dumbledore-free world to seize near absolute power in Wizarding Britain. Hell, in /PS/, Hagrid says that Voldemort was close to winning until he bounces off of that love-related magic he scorns.

Hell, I don't even like the idea of him being called crazy. Sure, we would call splitting your soul via murder and placing soul fragments into objects to preserve your life crazy, but Voldemort is clearly /amoral/^{1}/./

^{1}Amoral as in not subscribing to any moral ideology beyond "might makes right."
