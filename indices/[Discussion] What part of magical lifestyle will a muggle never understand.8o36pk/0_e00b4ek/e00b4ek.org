It's more the spirit of the thing; in the Wizarding World "the impossible" is not a thing.

Most wizards have /no idea/ how most advanced magical artifacts work, or how Voldemort or Dumbledore can do what they do, but those are a matter of everyday life. Wizarding life is going out in the street for your morning stroll and suddenly finding that the pavement has turned pink, sentient, and fluffy, and would like to have tea with you. There is no /known/ spell to do that, but a wizard will just... shrug it off. "Oh. Another magical thing. /Someone/ messed about with government property, best to Owl the Ministry..."

This is the root of the "wizards are silly" thing we see so much: wizards are, as a result, extremely gullible, because they live in a world that runs on weird, abstract, highly unpredictable rules. Voldemort's plans make no sense and no one questions it, for instance, but that's just symptomatic of the magical mindset; in a world where tap-dancing while saying some fancy pseudolatin and shaking a bit of wood with a feather encased inside will make it rain frogs, it doesn't /seem/ so far-fetched to propose that the best way to capture Harry Potter is a year-long scheme involving impersonating one of Dumbledore's friends right under his nose for months, tricking an extremely powerful magical artifact known for its impartiality and divination capabilities, and manipulating events to make Harry win a tournament years above his age group in difficulty. And so they just stick to their first idea, because why /shouldn't/ it work? Everything else does.

*In short, it's not that a Muggle would find any one magical thing disorienting, it's that the combined weight of it all is a mindset where the entire world is a wackyland running on nonsensoleum and you should just accept it rather than look at each individual piece of magic as a miracle to be marveled at and analyzed.*
