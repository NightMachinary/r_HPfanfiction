It kinda jumped the shark in my opinion. It wasn't really necessary and I just didn't like Harry's literal bird pet becoming part of his harem before realizing that she actually wants to be in Tonks' harem. The idea of a 12 year old dating and I think marrying at some point? an 18 year old was too weird for me.
