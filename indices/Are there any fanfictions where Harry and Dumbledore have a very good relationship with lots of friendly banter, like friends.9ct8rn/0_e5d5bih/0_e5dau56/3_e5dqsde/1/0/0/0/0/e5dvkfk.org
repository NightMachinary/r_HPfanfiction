This is just a bunch of [[/r/iamverysmart]]. "I am beyond your simple meat body concepts such as morality, once you ascend to the seventh layer of nihilistic metasentience you might have a chance of understanding."

For that fic in particular, I haven't read it in a while (and don't plan on rereading it), but is he really "near-omniscient"? He knows a lot of stuff but he isn't a god. And tbh they just handwaved the pedo-ness away because the author wanted to get their rocks off and didn't want to think about how gross it is for an 18 year old to be lusting after an 11 year old.
