Yes, so long as people are having offspring, natural selection is in play.

Men are constantly selecting for traits, women are constantly selecting for traits, and the environment always affects the manifestation of these traits. Reproduction is the core mechanism of natural selection.

If you don't understand this very basic tenet of evolution - if you don't understand what natural selection even *is* - then I don't see any point in continuing this conversation.
