  I wasn't using the nature fallacy, and neither should you, because I can just as easily say, "well, animals eat their own shit in nature, hence it's good".

I didn't say that being gay is good because animals do it. I said that implying being gay goes against an evolutionary perspective on morality is ridiculous because being gay is something that happens in nature - beings which have no concept of morality and care only for survival perform /gay sex/ with no matter of irregularity.

  Survival - that is, natural selection - has never been "paused", and never will be.

This is silly. You could make the argument that so long as people are having offspring that natural selection will always continue. The problem with your statement is that humans stopped producing offspring for /evolutionary purposes/ literally /thousands of years ago/.

We've *LONG* since passed the point where we choose our mates based off of anything more than social purposes and, more recently, love.

As a matter-a-fact, people who choose to (or are forced to, in the case of gay couples) adopt are likely sticking to your imagined ideal of natural selection more than non-gay couples. Imagine it - CHOOSING who you want to nurture and have for your offspring. Perhaps it's not a natural form of selection, but it's the next closest thing we, realistically, have.
