Except our morality hasn't been tied to pure survival in thousands of years. People have been /gay/ for thousands of years. Hell, in many cultures it was perfectly acceptable until the emergence of the more modern religions. So I'm quite unsure how you've reached the conclusion that the anti-gay morality is tied to evolution.

FYI - Animals gay-love fuck all the time, bro. Are you going to tell me that we're more closely tied to our instincts and evolutionary patterns than they are?
