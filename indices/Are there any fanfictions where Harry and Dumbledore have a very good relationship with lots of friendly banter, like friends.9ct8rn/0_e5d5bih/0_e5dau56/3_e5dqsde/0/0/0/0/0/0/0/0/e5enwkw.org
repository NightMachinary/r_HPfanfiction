Natural selection doesn't have a purpose, original or not. It's simply a term to describe selective pressures on living organisms.

You keep fundamentally misunderstanding basic concepts, which is ironic, because you then turn the tables and accuse me of missing what you're saying. No, I am not missing what you are saying, because what you are saying is predicated on a fundamental ignorance of evolution and natural selection.

Anyway, I'm done here, and the mods said they don't want me to keep talking about this, so I'll stop. Later.
