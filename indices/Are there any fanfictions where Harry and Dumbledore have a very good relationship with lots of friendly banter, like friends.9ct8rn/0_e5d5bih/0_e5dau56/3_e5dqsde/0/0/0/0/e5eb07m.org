You're not getting my point.

You're thinking of survival in terms of a daily struggle to stay alive, but that's not what I mean when I talk about evolutionary pressures. Survival - that is, natural selection - has never been "paused", and never will be. The criteria for it may change, but the core principle of nature selecting for certain traits through reproduction will always be a fundimental part of the human condition. We have not "conquered" or "stopped" evolution.

To think that these biological instincts which have manifested themselves in many societies will simply go away because, hey, it's 2018 now, is simply ridiculous. At the end of the day, we are all genes expressed in an environment.

I never made the argument that being gay isn't natural, in that it doesn't happen in nature. That was never my position. Of course it happens in nature, but as an anomaly, not as a rule, because of course, the animals that don't reproduce don't leave a line of descent and don't propagate their genes. I wasn't using the nature fallacy, and neither should you, because I can just as easily say, "well, animals eat their own shit in nature, hence it's good".

It's /implicitly/ tied to evolution.

Yes, there have been societies where these sort of relationships haven't been so frowned upon, like in Ancient Greece.

At the same time, also in Ancient Greece, they didn't particularly frown upon what we'd consider to be pedophilia today, so you kind of made my point for me.
