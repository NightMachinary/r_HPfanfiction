I wasn't comparing the two. As I said, I was approaching the subject from a morally nihilistic position, from which there is no inherent objective morality. From this position, it doesn't make sense to say I was comparing the two, because at the baseline, no action is inherently, objectively amoral, including homosexuality, including murder. Obviously, I'm not comparing homosexuality with murder here, right? All I was doing is taking a more realistic look at morality in general. Do you see what I'm saying?

Regardless, I'll stop talking about this in general, if you still thinks it violates the rules. I don't really care one way or another, and the conversation was getting pretty stale anyway.
