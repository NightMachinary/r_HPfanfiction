I would like to double down on mind arts, it's my favourite portrayal of Dumbledore as a mentor and probably my 3rd favourite fanfic mentor overall (Beaten out by Voldemort, twice)

He is really open and up-front about some of his own flaws and paths to power, but still has that /distinct/ tone of mysterious and secretive old wizard. He tells Harry about his similarities to Riddle, and his worries about Harry potentially abusing his powers pretty early. He similarly allows Harry access to a lot of magical materials whilst still very obviously observing everything he reads.
