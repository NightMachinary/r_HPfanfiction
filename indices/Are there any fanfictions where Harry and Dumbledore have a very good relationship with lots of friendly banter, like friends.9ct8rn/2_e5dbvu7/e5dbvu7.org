Way AU and written before book 6 was published but "Harry Potter: Dark Memories" has a really good Harry/Dumbledore mentor/not-quite-friendship-but-close relationship. linkffn(3655940)

It's actually and all-time favorite of mine and I go back and reread it on a regular basis. And it's complete and not badly written so there's that going for it as well!
