linkffn(Blindness) has him see souls (but be blind to all else) and magic, and work on resurrection. The Deathly Hallows, the Veil and vampires come into play later. It's truly rather good, but has a couple of things some people might not like: namely, it has a Harry/Hermione pairing, an arguably OP Harry, and an afterlife system that the author thinks is perfectly OK but not everyboyd would (I, for one, think it's rather horrific).

In linkffn(Core Threads), Harry manipulares peoples' magical cores and later discovers that cores and souls are the same thing. He's a bit put off, seeing how lightly he was twisting them around earlier. Anyway, he ends up having a few hundred thousand souls to himself. (It makes some sense in context.) All this textually fits your request, but has none of the 'dark' undertones your 'Necromancer' term implied.
