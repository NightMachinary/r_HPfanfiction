linkffn(9057950) Too Young to die is honestly one of the best dark!harry I've ever read. Harry in there is young, sometimes foolish and irrational and a very picture of what a psychopathic child is. The plot revolves around Harry trying to resurrect his dead sister. There are also overused bad!Potters and a twin boy-who-lived, but I promise you, it's not what it looks like.
