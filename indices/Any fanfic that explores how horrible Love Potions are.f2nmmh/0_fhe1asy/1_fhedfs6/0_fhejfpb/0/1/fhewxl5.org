I think the books do show some of the issues around them - Voldemort's conception for instance, or Ron getting slipped the love potion. Neither are portrayed in a good light, IMO.

That being said, she does put it as a 'normal' thing of life in the WW. IMO, it follows the same trajectory that most of the WW details do - where she put it as a throwaway detail early on (Lockhart referring to it, Molly Weasley saying she'd made some when younger, etc) - probably drawing mostly on the idea of them in european traditions/folklore. But later on, when it gets more serious/adult, she's forced (or decides) to build upon them further and try to integrate them into the world.

Though, I guess it's not always shown as something fully accepted - people didn't seem to like the gossip that Rita was spreading about Hermione using love potions on Harry and Krum, for instance.
