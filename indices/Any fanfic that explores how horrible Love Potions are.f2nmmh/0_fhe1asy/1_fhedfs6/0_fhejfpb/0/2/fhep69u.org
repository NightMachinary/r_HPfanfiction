i think JKR understands the problem. didn't she choose this to be the way Tom was conceived specifically bc of how vile it is?

but again, the attitude surrounding love potions in the books is really weird. on one hand, Dumbledore considered Merope's use of a love potion akin to the Imperius Curse. on the other hand, there doesn't seem to be any regulation regarding them as Fred & George sell them openly in their shop, and other characters who touch the topic (Hermione, Molly) think they're not a big deal.

maybe the modern potions aren't as dangerous?
