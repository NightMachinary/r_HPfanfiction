We know that there are various strengths of love potions, and that Amortentia is the strongest. The one Ron takes seems pretty powerful too, but I don't think it was actually that.

A personal headcanon of mine is that the potions Fred and George sell have a very limited duration and an effect weak enough that they can be resisted. Perhaps they also only key them inside the shop before selling? That strikes me more like prank material, tbh. Like, go to the shop, get a potion keyed to you, then feed it someone you want pranked. All of the sudden, they /notice/ you, maybe make some weird attempt at flirtation, it runs out and they're left confused.
