You know, I never realized that only women use them in the books. And what is ever worse, when Fred and George sell them, they're part of their WonderWitch line. How messed up is that?

I don't like the implications of this. One, that only women are desperate to have others fall in love with them (because men are apparently not so interested in that, right?) And two, that if a woman uses them no one seems to think "rape"

This is absolutely horrible
