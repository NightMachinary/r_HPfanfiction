[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), is a very sweet Harry/Ginny romance set in an non-magic AU, so there is no Hogwarts at all. Harry is a celebrity in a different way, and his parents' true identity will be revealed in the end. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is one of my favorite Ron/Hermione fics. Harry, Neville, and Weasley kids all went to Beauxbaton, for a very good reason. Dumbledore was brilliant in this story.
