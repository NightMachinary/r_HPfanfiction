I'd say that if you have a time jump, a sequel makes more sense - provided the main plot has finished an arc at that point as well. Further, if too many side plots are unresolved, and won't be resolved "off screen", then continuing makes more sense. Basically, if you could stop the story at a point, and not feel like something's missing, you can do a sequel.
