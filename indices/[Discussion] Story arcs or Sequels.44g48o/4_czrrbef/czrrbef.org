If a story can stand on its own, I think sequelisation is generally a good idea. For example, linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) ends with a tragic scene, but this is a very effective ending to the story anyway. There's a short sequel, which is essentially a "happy ending"; this (at least for me) made it feel very different.
