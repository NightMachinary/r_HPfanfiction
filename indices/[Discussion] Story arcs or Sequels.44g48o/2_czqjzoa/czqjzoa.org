I debated whether to start a sequel ("Heart and Soul") or continue with "The Power of Love." Breaking made sense, since it was the same time point that JKR did. But I also continue with the very next day, so it's less of a break than hers.

Authors have some incentive to stick with one story, because it leads to a lot more reviews on that one story Anyone who sorts by reviews will be more likely to see the longer story.

On the other hand, two separate fics may also give more chances of being seen. Also, a single uber-long fic may be too intimidating for some.

So, it's a toss up as to what is better or worse. I agree with not breaking off after a really short span, not unless it's a natural breaking point (like end of the school year). I think I probably made the right choice, but there were reasons to not do it that way.
