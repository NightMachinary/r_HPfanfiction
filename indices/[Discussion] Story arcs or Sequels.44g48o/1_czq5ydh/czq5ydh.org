I think stories should end with the main arc and the big climax. If a story moves along evenly with no twist/surprise/head-turner, then it's not over. If it's passed that big climax and now all that's left is a series of little upheavals, it's gone on too long.

I usually run into those gone-too-long stories. It's often a result of the main arc being finished up before the subplots. While it's possible to have subplots end in the epilogue, most of it should be done before the climax of the main arc.

Sometimes, the writer keeps adding more stuff just because they have more ideas. That's when I think there should be a sequels. Take all the little ideas, create a new big arc, maybe leave one thread hanging in the last story, and merge them into a sequel. Otherwise, the action is uneven and there's really nothing to look forward to.
