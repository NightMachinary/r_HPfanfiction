For me, I find that /if you have planned your story/, it becomes very obvious where the breaks are, where plot points/arcs come together before there is a break and the start of the next arc. The natural story end is when the major conflict is resolved. It's the end of the journey, of the battle (either literal or figurative), the happily ever after.

When authors start with a great idea (or even many ideas), but don't really have a plan (and therefore a conclusion) they don't know what the major conflict is. So it just goes on... and on... and on... and things might resolve, but it doesn't feel like an end at all. The other side is when the conflict resolves, but it hasn't been hard enough, major enough, leaving the reader feel unfulfilled.
