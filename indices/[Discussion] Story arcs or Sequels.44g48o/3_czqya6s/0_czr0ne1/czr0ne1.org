So, since I'm asking this as a reader, you feel I'm encountering either unplanned or poorly planned stories, leading to my confusion over why they did or didn't break off to a sequel? I can get behind that. I do read a lot of former WIPs after they're finished (or nearly so), and there's no guarantee that the author worked from an outline.

With the one where I wondered why they stopped and made a sequel, I don't think I was unfulfilled by the major arc's resolution, but rather by the lack of resolution to any of the subplots or character arcs. Although it wasn't very good in general, so it's hard to say, you could be right.
