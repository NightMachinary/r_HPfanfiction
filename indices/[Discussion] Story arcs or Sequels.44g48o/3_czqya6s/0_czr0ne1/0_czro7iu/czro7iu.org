If you feel like the subplots are more interesting, that tells me that the author didn't concentrate on the major conflict enough for it to feel major. For example, in the first HP, the major conflict is Voldermort after the stone. The subplots which lead to this (what was in the vault, what is in the corridor, what's up with snape etc, etc) all lead up the major conflict. The other subplots, like the dragon, are resolved beforehand. The subplots which aren't fully resolved (Snape), still fell like they have reached a conclusion of some kind. There can be a hook for later (why is Voldermort after Harry), but as a reader, everything important feels complete.

If you wonder why they are cutting the story because things aren't resolved, then yes, I think it has been poorly planned. And I don't mean that everything needs to be known beforehand, more the author has to say, 'where is this going? why am I writing this story? what is the point?'. If they know that, then they know the major conflict, and they know how they want it to end. The easiest stories to see this in are romances, because the point of the story is to get together two characters. Once they are (happily) together, that's the happily ever after, the conflict is resolved.
