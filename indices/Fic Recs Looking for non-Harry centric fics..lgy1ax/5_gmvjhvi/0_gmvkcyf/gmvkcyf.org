I'm fine with them but I don't like reading wolf star or jily. So in other words I rarely read fics from that era. I read a Lucius/Lily fic at least 6 years ago that I thought was cute. I read Severus centric fics and enjoy them. I just don't like Remus or Pettigrew. And I can barely tolerate the other two.
