Also, baring that, this is fanfiction. We don't need to keep it "realistic". If you want to read a fic where everyone in said fic is gay, you have all the right to request it and others have all the right to write it.

"Realistic"...when talking fanfiction based on a magical world, where people use wands and dragons and soul sucking creatures exists.
