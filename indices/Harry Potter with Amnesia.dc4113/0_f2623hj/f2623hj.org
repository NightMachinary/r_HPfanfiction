[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13082262][gone was any trace of you]] is Amnesia!Harry during an Auror investigation. A little angsty but with a happy ending.

[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsVTBydGk2R3NIVU0][hgfan1111]] wrote two great Amnesia fanfiction.

- Brighter than Sunshine, where Harry and Ginny were memory charmed by someone right after Voldemort's defeat and assumed dead. Harry woke up in a muggle hospital, become homeless for a while and eventually studied at a college.
- Away from the Sun, this one focused more on Ginny's adventure in rescuing the (again) assumed dead Harry. There's a plot to remove Harry from the ministry. Harry is sent to a facility that experiments in removing memories.
