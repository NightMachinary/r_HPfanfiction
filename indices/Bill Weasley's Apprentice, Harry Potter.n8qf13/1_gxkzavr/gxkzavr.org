I doubt it. Voldemort would just switch plans since the whole purpose of the convoluted plan was to get past Lily's protection (Wormtail suggests to use other people because it would speed things up in GoF). If Harry is no longer at Hogwarts but out in the open, things become much simpler.

Unlike Harry, the guy was an actual child prodigy so I'm not sure how that would work either.

Otherwise pretty cool idea.
