  In a world where people are destined to be either Doms or Subs, Kurt is marked as a Sub. However, he is not very submissive and decides to hide his status. His life is not perfect without a partner fulfilling his needs, but he manages and is proud of his own independence. That is until he meets Blaine - a Dom whose one look makes Kurt want to kneel and give up all control. Or not.
