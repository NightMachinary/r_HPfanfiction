Um well Harry isn't a first year in this one, but it has people thinking he's a seer when he's really a time traveler, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349/chapters/16316573]] My laptop is unfortunately broken, and I'm unsure how to link this in a less ugly way using my phone, so there ya go.
