I can't link it because Harry isn't of age, but Summer of Change by lorddwar is a pretty decent Honks fic mixed with some powerful!Harry.

EDIT: Sorry, didn't read the description before responding. Harry/Tonks is one of my favorite pairings, but it's not quite common enough for (to my knowledge), those kinds of demands.

linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) has them as a pairing where they're not romantic but get together. I wouldn't call it a smut fic because nothing is ever explicitly described (though it is, often, explicitly /said/).
