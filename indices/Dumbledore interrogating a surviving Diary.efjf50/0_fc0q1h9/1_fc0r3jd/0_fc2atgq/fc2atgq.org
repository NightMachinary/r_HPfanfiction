AND Dumbledore all but blamed Harry for the petrifications. He didn't really, but to a 12 year old kid, that sure seemed like Dumbles blamed him. Didn't stop other people from blaming Harry either. Add in what happened last year when they went to people in authority.

It's no wonder the Golden Trio never went to a higher authority. It's a staple of the Harry Potter series. Once you hit 30, you become incompetent. Except if you are a bad guy. Then you only become mildly competent, but it's still enough to be a threat. IIRC in cursed child, Harry himself admits this.
