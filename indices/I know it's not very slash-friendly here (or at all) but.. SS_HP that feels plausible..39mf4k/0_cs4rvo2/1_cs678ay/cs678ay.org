I would hazard a guess that the vast majority of all non !Dark, multi-generational pairing fics happen when the younger person is over the age of consent (17). I would also say that a majority of these fics happen Post Hogwarts so that argument is moot. Believe it or not, good authors of these pairings write the pairing RESPONSIBILY so there is none of that pedophilia nonsense.

So I'm not exactly sure what you think Older Adult/Harry or Older Adult/Hermione readers are reading but it is certainly not pedophilia.
