A student/teacher relationship is squicky even if the student is seventeen. It comes too close to Wife Husbandry.

An age gap that large bothers me in general. I'll go along with it if it's pure smut, but a healthy romantic relationship requires a level of equality and equal maturity that's largely impossible to achieve with someone who's half your age.
