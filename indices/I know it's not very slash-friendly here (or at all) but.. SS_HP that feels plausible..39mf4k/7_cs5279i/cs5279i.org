Ohh, I remember one from early in my fanfiction days. Not sure how well it's held up to time, but it was my favorite HP/SS for a good long while.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361/chapters/1321936]] - Cambiare Podentes A prophecy demands that Harry perform a ritual with Snape that forces him into sexual slavery in exchange for a massive power boost. They're both very not okay with this, but go through with it for the sake of defeating Voldemort. I remember them being largely okay in terms of characterization, and the build being believable, but the premise implies a lot of iffy consent issues.

Note--worth mentioning that Harry is 18 in this.
