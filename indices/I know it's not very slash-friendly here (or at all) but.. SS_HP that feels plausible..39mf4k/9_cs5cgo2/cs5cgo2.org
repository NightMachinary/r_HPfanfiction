I'll be honest here - there isn't a single one that feels plausible. But if you can suspend your disbelief of one of the weirdest and most fucked up and plain wrong pairings in the entire fandom, then there's probably some out there with atleast good writing.

How could you make make it plausible? Make a female!Harry and.. oh god no that'd be even more wrong, but atleast it'd fit Snape's character more. I.. I don't know why you want this and I don't know why anyone would write it.

Here, I'll leave this obscure silent hill/hp [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186953/1/Who-Has-Time-For-Tears][crossover]] that does Snape's character pretty well. I'm not sure anyone would be able to read HP/SS after it (:
