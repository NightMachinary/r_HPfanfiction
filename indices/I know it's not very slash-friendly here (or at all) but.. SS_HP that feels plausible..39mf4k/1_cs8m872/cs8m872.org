I reread linkao3(Rapture mia_ugly) and the sequel linkao3(blood but also roses mia_ugly) recently and was reminded of how clever "Rapture" is with the multiple timelines and how it interweaves with canon. I find the end bits of it not as satisfying as they could be, but the sequel makes up for that IMHO.

(Let's see if this bot thing works for me on my first attempt.)
