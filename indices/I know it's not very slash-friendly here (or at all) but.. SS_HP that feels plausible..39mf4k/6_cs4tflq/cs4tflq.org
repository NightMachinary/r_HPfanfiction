[[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708][The Apple Tree by Philo]] creates distance from Harry and Severus' early, antagonistic relationship by diverging from canon after Order of the Phoenix, but taking place Harry's seventh year. During the elapsed time, we learn that Harry explored the muggle world, working and forming relationships, and also spent time developing his magical gifts and creating his own vision for his future.

You can easily buy this more confident and mature Harry being intrigued when he inadvertently glimpses another side of Severus.

Some readers were upset over the lack of warning about a plot point that has been construed by some as sexual assault, though there is disagreement about that interpretation.
