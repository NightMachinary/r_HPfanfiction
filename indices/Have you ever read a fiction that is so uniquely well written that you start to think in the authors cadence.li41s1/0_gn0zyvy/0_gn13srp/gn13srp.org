Sorry it took me a while to respond, I was on my phone and don't really know how to link fictions properly yet haha.

So the first 2 that come to mind are "The Changeling" linkao3(189189) and "Harry Potter and the 'superhero' origin story" linkao3(24413623)

I read The Changeling in one sitting, and I couldn't stop thinking like that for like a whole week. It was amazing. I see this fic recommended all over, so I figure it doesn't need much of an introduction.

Harry Potter and the 'superhero' origin story also had my head spinning lol. I saw it recommended in one of the threads here and clicked to read a bit without looking at any of the tags or anything and was instantly sucked in. Read all that was written at the time (about 35 chapters) on a Friday afternoon, and was thinking like that for the whole weekend. It does have some M/M, which isn't really my thing, so I haven't really been keeping up with the updates, but the author updates it quite regularly.
