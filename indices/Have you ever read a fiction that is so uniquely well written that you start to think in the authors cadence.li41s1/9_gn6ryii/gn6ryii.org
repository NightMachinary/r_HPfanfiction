Newcomb's What You Leave Behind is perhaps the most well-written piece of fanfiction I've ever read, especially the edited version on DLP WbA. The technical writing, humour, world-building, and characterisation are at par with JKR's work. The only issue would be the somewhat darker setting, but I enjoyed it since it was a reasonable plot deviation.
