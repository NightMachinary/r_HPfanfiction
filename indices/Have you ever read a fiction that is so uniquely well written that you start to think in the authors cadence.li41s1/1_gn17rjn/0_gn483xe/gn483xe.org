I'm not even joking, this has happens to me... it's weird but kind of funny. Literally what happened today: I am getting a cup if juice, internal monologue: as I picked up my glass of juice I scanned the room before noticing a strange box, walking over I realised that it was from the attic. As I pondered whether or not to open it, my frizzy-haired sister came in and told me mum was looking for me.
