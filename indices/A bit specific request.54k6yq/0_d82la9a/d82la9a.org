linkffn(9200391) I think Harry is pretty competent in this one. Harry and his band come up with clever solutions to problems, but his conflicts aren't by any means easily resolved. He still makes some childish mistakes and is ultimately ruled by his emotions.

I don't think there's any Weasley bashing, since the Twins are a huge part of the story. There's almost no mention of Ron, though. I think he speaks twice in the whole fic lol.
