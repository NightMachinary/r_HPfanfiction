In Dumbledore's will:

"Tom, you are now Dada teacher for life."

Ecstatic at achieving tenure this early in his second career, Voldemort fails to question the blatant absenteeism of the Golden Trio during his classes, since hiding from Death Eaters is actually on the books as a valid excuse for missing classes. Well, that and being a fugitive.

He turns out to be an impressive teacher, best-in-a-generation material to those with the balls to turn up to class (mainly muggleborn, much to his confusion, though that confusion vanishes when one of them tells him their parents won't accept 'but it's a class being taught by magic Hitler' as an excuse for bad grades).

This also means that his Death Eaters lose control of the school over time as Voldemort does too good a job teaching his students how to defend themselves. Which in turn causes a fracturing in the Death Eaters' ranks as some start to recognise that their Lord is unfit for that whole leadership thing and start shopping around for a replacement.

Which... And so on and so forth.

And then the Battle of Hogwarts happens and Voldemort dies, having ultimately proven unable to live up to Riddle's level back in the 1950s. He takes the curse with him upon death and has a surprising number of muggleborn willing to swear up and down that he was actually a good professor, honest.
