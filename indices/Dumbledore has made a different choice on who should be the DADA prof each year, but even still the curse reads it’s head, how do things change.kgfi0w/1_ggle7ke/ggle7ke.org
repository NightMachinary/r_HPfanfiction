Second year: a Muggleborn professor for Defence against the Dark Arts. During the Chamber of Secrets fiasco he is murdered. Ron and Harry go to chamber alone without help. Ron tried to use a spell with his wand but it backfired causing the explosion.

In year 3, an auror say Williamson is the DADA professor. When Sirius first comes to Hogwarts Remus is called and asked to stay for added protection. Remus finds the marauder's map and goes to the shrieking shack. The auror goes to the Forbidden Forest on hearing werewolf howls and goes there and is killed.

In reality, it was Barty Crouch Jr who taught DADA in fourth year. In this one, they never go to attack Alastor Moody. On the other hand, it is Bartemius Crouch Senior whom Barry Crouch Jr pretends to be.

In fifth year Umbridge sends someone else as terrible as her to Hogwarts. She does everything Unbridge does and in the end Voldy shows himself so she is ousted.

In sixth year, Remus is DADA professor. Snape is Potions professor for 1st to 5th years and Slughorn is for NEWT students. At the end of the year, Voldemort takes charge. As he is a known member of the OOTP. So he is forced to leave.

In last year, some other death eater is DADA professor and we all know what happens in the end.
