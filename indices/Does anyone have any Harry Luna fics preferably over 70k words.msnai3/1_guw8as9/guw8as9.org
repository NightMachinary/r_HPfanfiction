Help of a Seer by Aealket. It seemed to end abruptly to me, but that could just be me wanting more of the story. linkffn(7548963)

And I just learned that the FFN link I had for Harry Potter and the Final Straw by Bellerophon30 is no good. (Not to be confused with the story of the same title by courderouge2006, which is completely different.)
