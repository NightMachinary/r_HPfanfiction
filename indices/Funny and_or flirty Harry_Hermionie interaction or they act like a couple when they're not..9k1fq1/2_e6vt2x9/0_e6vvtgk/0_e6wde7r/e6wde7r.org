It was the first story I've ever published and at some point down the road I realised how awful it had been written (far too many dialogue tags, a few bad word choices), so I fixed those. I honestly can't believe that it had gotten 300 favourites in that atrocious state.

The promised continuation on the other hand was a difficult thing because nothing I wrote had the same tone, instead of lighthearted fun it was gritty and dark. So I ditched ten or so plot lines before deciding to go with what is chapter 2 now. By far the biggest challenge was to preserve the focus on their friendship instead of turning it into cheap romance.
