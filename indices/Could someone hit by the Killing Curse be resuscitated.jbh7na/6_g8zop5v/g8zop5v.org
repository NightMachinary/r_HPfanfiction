We know there is a concept of souls in HP verse, with this in mind I see two possible options:

Killing Curse expels the soul from the body, once that happens, there is no way back. Like Dementor's Kiss. There is a cheat - if soul is somehow tethered to mortal realm either via Horcrux or Sacrifice (Harry's mum).

The other option is if the curse causes instant, severe damage (though unnoticeable on the surface) to the body (and Fake Moody mentions that underpowered wizard could cause a nosebleed) - then question is more interesting, could you repair the body and retain the soul inside? Again, it would seem that Lily's sacrifice, when Harry chose to return either "fixed" his body, or delayed the damage.

However, since there is no definitive answer it is up to individual fanfic writers. Though I would caution against making it too cheap. Would rob the curse of its horror if you could undo it easily.
