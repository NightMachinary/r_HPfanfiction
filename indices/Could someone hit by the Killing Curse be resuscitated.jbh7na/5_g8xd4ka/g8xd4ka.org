  Of course, it depends on how the killing curse works.

In canon, the magic system is a conceptual one, it doesn't follow the laws of science but its own set of rules. This difference is very important in /how/ the magic works :

- In the manga/ anime FMA, Roy Mustang create flames by adjusting the oxygen level in the Atmosphere, and then igniting it with a spark created by his special gloves. The "Alchemy" of the manga follows the rules of science, and Roy Mustang is unable to control flames if he is unable to create a spark (because he is wet as an example), just like he would be unable to create a fire in a vacuum.
- In Harry Potter, a wizard just as to use "Incendio" (or any other fire spell) to create a flame. It doesn't matter if the wizard is under water, or if the material is fire proof, if you use "Incendio" on something, it's on fire.

With that in mind, the Killing Curse doesn't "kill" someone by some cause, but just "make him dead". Which is why there are no known counter. It's not just a matter of having his heart stopped or something like that, but being dead by every sense of the term.

I also want to point out that, while the Killing Curse" kills without cause any physical injury, it doesn't mean it kills without a trace. As Dumbledore said, "/Magic leaves traces/" and the victim of the Killing Curse may be very easy to identify thanks to the magic traces left in them. The fact that an injury caused by Dark Magic can't be healed (like George's ear) and that the Killing Curse is one of the Darkes Magic probably means that someone killed by it can't be saved at all.
