  Like, if a George had gone to a Muggle hospital, could a doctor have sewn his ear back on, or would the curse somehow have prevented that?

In OotP, Arthur Weasley tries a "Muggle way" to treat his injury (stitches). This method fail because the poison left in his body melted the thread, and while Curse are not poison, I like to think a similar thing would have happened to George. Maybe his ear would not have reconected to his body despite a "succesfull" procedure, or maybe the thread used to sew his ear back would have rot. The point is that, because he was hurt by Dark Magic, he can't be healed.

For a time, I wondered if injuries caused by Dark Magic could not be healed by removing the injured part before healing it. As an example, Dumbledore has a curse on his hand? Amputate his whole arm and then grow it back. In the end, I decided that such method should not work (in my opinion), because it just feels cheap. An easy trick for the heros to heal from an "unhealable" injury that was somehow never discovered by generations of healer (including Muggleborns and Muggle enthousiasts) but easily found by a teenager.

Honestly, it just because I don't like the trope of Harry healing himself with a Muggle trick, but if I absolutely had to find an explanation, I guess I could say that Dark Magic also let a trace on the soul of its victims. Magic is used to "return people to normal", but because of this magic, the injured state is now their "normal" state, which is why it can't be healed.
