Eh, I'm fond of magical dooms having non-magical loopholes. I did think of the snake thing, but that was due to the venom as you said, and the fact that they even thought to try it suggests that the idea of using Muggle medicine isn't obviously doomed to fail.

Speaking of "removing the injured part", I've wondered if a Death Eater defector could try that as an admittedly drastic way to remove the Dark Mark.
