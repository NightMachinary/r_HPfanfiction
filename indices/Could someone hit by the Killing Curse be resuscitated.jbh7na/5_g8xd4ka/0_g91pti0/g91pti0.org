As I understand it, the thing with curses in Harry Potter is that the spell damage can't be easily repaired (ie George's ear couldn't be regrown because it was cursed off). Unless you happen to know the specific counter curse, and there obviously is no counter curse for Avada Kedavra.

So, the question is, are curses irreversable by any means without the counter-curse, or just by magical means. Like, if a George had gone to a Muggle hospital, could a doctor have sewn his ear back on, or would the curse somehow have prevented that?
