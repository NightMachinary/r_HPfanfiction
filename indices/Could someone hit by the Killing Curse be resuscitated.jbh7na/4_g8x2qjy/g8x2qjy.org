Given what we've seen of it in canon, I wouldn't have thought there would be enough time - it seems fairly instant. What I always think though is that it should be possible for people to protect themselves against an AK by conjuring up a big animal of some kind, and putting it in front of them so that the killing curse hits the animal instead.
