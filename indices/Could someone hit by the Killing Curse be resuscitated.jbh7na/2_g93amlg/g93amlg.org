I always thought it caused soul detachment, to pass onto the afterlife as a literay foil of dementors who destroy the soul, but not the body. Simply because of JKRs writing about afterlife.

With more though on the topic, it would make sense for an AU to say the killing curse kills the body, but dementors affect the soul.
