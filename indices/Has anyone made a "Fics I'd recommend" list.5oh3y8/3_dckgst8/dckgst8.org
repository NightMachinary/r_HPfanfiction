[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjOZthnO_ILQZ68l99rZTij8iDnQAHILUN5BV9HpY_o/edit?usp=sharing]] I made this sheet of fics I read a while ago. It hasn't been updated in a while (but I have been reading less hp fanfics recently, been doing more programming). Has the title, link, author, character list (so you can see pairings), word count (note that this is not auto-updated so the written down number could be old), rating, Categories, and my rating. I made this a while ago because I was bored, and I reread fics so it's nice to have a list of them. Please note that the ratings are my ratings of them, lots of other people might like them, but I might not have/may have enjoyed them greatly.
