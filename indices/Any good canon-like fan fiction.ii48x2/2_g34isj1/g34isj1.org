It gets super mixed reviews but "Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness" by thanfiction is pretty good. Its in the archives (I don't have a link handy right at the moment). It's dark (and a little cheesy to be fair at some points but the general story I think makes up for it) and follows Neville and co. from the DA during DH at Hogwarts. Its canon compliant with the small amount we know happened from the books since the trio weren't there at the time with canon pairings (Neville and Hannah!!!).
