Yeah one death in particular stands out as being especially cheesy (gonna stick with my original descriptor there). Out of curiosity, do you have any better suggestions for a canon compliant fic? I tend to stick to my OTP ship, but wouldn't mind some suggestions like the OP if you have any; I'm working on branching out a bit more. Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness just happens to be the only one I've read of that type so without anything to compare it to, I thought it was pretty good.
