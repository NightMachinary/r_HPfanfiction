No one has mentioned Floreatcastellum yet? I don't have any particular recommendations, OP, but look through her [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum&ved=2ahUKEwici5eupr7rAhVFgRoKHUaKCOcQFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw1Luvm3NWeJ3gidg0PFbutp][account]] , which is full of stories that are canon-compliant, with beautiful writing. I dare say all of them are good.

I know I said I have no particular recommendations but I really love linkffn(The Moon and the Sea by FloreatCastellum). It's short, but beautifully written and heartbreaking. I also love the Colour of Everything. Two of her most popular works are the Theia Higglesworth series and Not From Others.
