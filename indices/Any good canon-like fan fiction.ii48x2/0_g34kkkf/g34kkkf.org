All the stories by Northumbrian (on fan fiction) compile themselves into a big universe set mostly between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue. My favorite is Strangers at Darkeshaugh. It explores the Potter family from a muggle point of you. All the major pairing are the same and the story follows canon, but there is a very important family of muggle ocs which might put some people off. linkffn(Strangers at Darkeshaugh )
