The reason why so many authors have a hard time with the House system in HP is mainly that it didn't make any sense, to begin with, and is awfully simplistic and cartoonish in Canon. Basically, you have:

Gryffindor: the Good Guys, Hero, and Righteous folks, Selfless people who have for greatest ambitions in life to be Good People. They are liberals like JKR and so they are awesome.

Slytherin: HitlerJugend. They are conservatives and so not awesome. Apparently, the House is for the ambitious and the one who cares about Greatness in a more selfish way. Which is bad according to JKR.

Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff: exist.

It's just bad writing all around. So when fanfics writers try to "play with it" they have a hard time writing it right since it's too flawed in Canon to make it decent.

If you remove or "share" with the other Houses manipulative, ambitious, and cunning attributes from Slytherin, it's just HitlerJugend.
