You might like the House portrayals in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series. Harry goes to Slytherin and belongs there, but befriends people from other houses too. The other Slytherins consider secrets to be normal and gifts without a price tag to be suspicious, but they do protect each other and Harry makes some good friends. The Gryffindors have bad apples amongst them, but Percy is happy to help anyone with homework, and the Twins are open-minded about the origins of a prankster; if you can cause chaos, you're alright in their book. Ernie McMillan of Hufflepuff is still very suspicious in second year, but in fairness, there's more circumstantial evidence against Harry than in canon (albeit there's also good exculpatory evidence). It never really bashes any house.

(What it does do is completely reimagine the storyline. With Tom Riddle alive and well, running a political party instead of a war, the whole social landscape of Britain is quite different, and Harry's challenges are likewise quite different - but just as life-threatening.)
