  Ravenclaws are bookish nerds who have zero social skills and also bashed as bullies of poor Luna. Hufflepuffs are loyal but in some fics in 2nd year and 4th year they are also bashed for not staying loyal to Harry.

I mean, this isn't exactly a huge deviation from canon... Luna /is/ bullied by her own house. The Hufflepuffs in Harry's year /are/ absolute shits to him in both second and fourth year.

Re the main point, yeah it's stupid. So stupid. Harry in Slytherin ends up with Harry having a personality U-turn. Harry in canon is mildly sneaky- by need not design. He is used to keeping things to himself because he spent ten years of his life having absolutely no one he can trust, but he's still kind, warm, and very loyal once he realised that he actually was worthy of friends and in the wizarding world people liked him. He bonds very easily with both Hagrid and Ron, and his determination to save Hermione from the troll when at that point he didn't even like her shows just how fixed he is on doing the right thing. So many Slytherin Harry fics take his mild sneakiness- which basically translates as "doesn't tell adults stuff and only shares with close friends" in canon and turn it into someone with plans for world domination who's actually quite dislikeable!

I think Harry has always been distrusting of others and rightly so. Grew up with the Dursleys. First two defence teachers tried to kill/harm him. Best mates pet turns out to actually be the man who betrayed his parents. Another defence teacher tries to kill him and is also a supporter of Voldemort. Umbridge. Then Snape kills Dumbledore and ok Harry never trusted Snape but he knew Dumbledore did... No wonder he only really relies on Ron, Hermione and Dobby! But, like you say, the Slytherin Harry fics take it too far. Its like, Dumbledore says hello to him in the first week of first year and he's like "you may not address me, you must have been stealing my money, you set my parents up to die and had my godfather deliberately imprisoned. Do not offer me sweets I know they're poison," and it's ridiculous.

  are only Slytherins manipulative and politicians. Is it fundamental that only those in Slytherin are allowed to be cunning and ambitious and Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors are not allowed to be so.

Yeah I know what you mean. Like, Percy is seriously ambitious. Fred and George are cunning- as are Harry and Hermione to an extent. Oliver Wood is also seriously ambitious and ok it's fixated on Quidditch but ambition is ambition. "Ambitious and cunning" doesn't have to translate as "is a politician in training," you could have an ambition to be a successful sport player or an artist that sells paintings for a lot of money, or you could have an ambition to free the world of hunger and homelessness. "Ambitious" does not have to mean "is a pretentious dick!"

As an aside, I went to school with some people who were children or nephew/nieces of some quite influential politicians (like, at least two of them you'd definitely have heard of if you followed UK politics in the late 90s/early 2000s) and none of them behaved like the Slytherins in fic. Kids of politicians are either like canon Draco and all "my father blah blah blah" (showing off with no subtlety) or they just don't ever mention it because it's just what their dad does for work, and really what 13 year old cares about their dads job? No one I've ever met, and like I said I know a few people who are related to senior politicians, behaves like that irl when they're a child.
