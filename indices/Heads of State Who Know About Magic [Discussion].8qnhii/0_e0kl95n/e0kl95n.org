I doubt they'd bother to Obliviate them, at least in relatively liberal nations. It's pointless since their several years of term would have proven them to be trustworthy, and while Obliviating a Muggle who's only known magic for a few hours is safe enough, trying to change the memory of someone who has lived with it for many years would be much riskier, and unethical.

In short, English or French or what-have-you officials probably keep their memories, but this may not have been true of, say, /Bulgarian/ officials.
