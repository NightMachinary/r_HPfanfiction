This reminds me of the Denarian series where Harry would come to Hogwarts once in a full moon, spread rumors about Dumbledore being a senile old pedophile, Dumbledore would warn the professors to steer clear of Harry because he's quite likely to kill them and/or turn them dark (that particular Harry genuinely would, tbf), but they still had study sessions, worked against Voldemort together and would come save each other's ass whenever it was required.
