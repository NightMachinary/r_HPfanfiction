/This is bad, but I really like the prompt so... Also I'm not sure why when I saw "a being far more powerful" I thought of Merlin, but whatever./

The forest trembled with incredible force. From the ground beneath an old, mangled English Oak rose a robed figure, bathed in blinding white light.

"'lo, it is I, Merlinus, King of Sorcerers, God of the Natural Magicks, return√©d from Everlasting Sleep to rain down upon ye vengeance most terrible."

With a wave of his hand he cleared a large path through the trees, violently ripping their roots from the ground, and began to walk away from his accursed tomb toward the world he would soon conquer.

"Kneel before me," he spoke to the universe at large, "for I am your new-"

He stopped. Ahead of him in the path stood an old man, clothed in robes of deepest purple, foolishly blocking him from his destiny.

"Hello," said the man, giving a little wave.

The Great and Terrible Merlin intensified his ambient glow, looking more intimidating than ever. He laughed heartily. "You fool of a man. Ye dare impede me?"

"Oh, don't mind me. I'm just watching," the man said, looking like someone who'd wandered into a museum accidentally and figured he ought to take a look at things while he was there.

"I shall conquer this world, fool, with the might of my magicks!" Merlin bellowed, raising his arms and making the entire forest rise with them.

The old man nodded. "Not a bad plan. Bit unoriginal. If I may..." he raised a wand he'd been holding and slowly, quietly, a few of the trees around them began to re-root themselves.

Merlin deflated like a sad rubber ball. "You, too, have affinity with the magicks?"

"I do," said the man, smiling.

"Tell me, old fool, does the preposterous and bedeviled school my contemporaries began still exist?"

"It does."

Merlin sidled up to the old man, his glowing aura all but extinguished. "Tell me what ye know of Slytherin. Does he live?"

The man smiled. "No. Not for a thousand years. I understand you were in Slytherin's house when Hogwarts first began?"

Merlin raged and the forest raged with him. "I certainly was not! That bastard Slytherin dares to insult the name of Merlinus, King of the Natural Magicks, God Among the Trees. I hath never attended Hogwarts nor have I for a moment thought to consort with serpents and their ilk."

"Noted," the man said. He began walking down the path out of the forest and Merlin walked beside him.

"That son of a whore, Slytherin," Merlin continued. "Always hated him."

They walked on, the man smiling pleasantly while Merlin raged about Slytherin, the trees falling back into place in their wake.
