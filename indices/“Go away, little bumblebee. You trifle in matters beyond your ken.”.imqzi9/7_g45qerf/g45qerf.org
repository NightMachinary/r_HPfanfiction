A couple recs here.

Harry Potter and the Elder Sect is a Bewitched crossover... and the only thing you need to know about it is that Sam could kick Dumbledore's ass by wiggling her nose. It's a comedy.

Grimdark is not a comedy. Well, mostly. Harry was banished to a hell dimension, and they eventually summon him back. Only... it's been longer for him, and in the meantime he's become a warlord type person in hell. I'm pretty sure my description makes it sound like trash, but I assure you its good lol.
