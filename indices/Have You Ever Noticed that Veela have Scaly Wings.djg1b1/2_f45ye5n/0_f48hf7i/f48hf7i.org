I much prefer them being dragon-related, both for the fire thing and the scaly look, since both lineages of reptiles with powered flight had feathers, although not in the wing membranes themselves, in the case of pterosaurs and scansoriopterygids. Though they woudn't have scales on the wing membranes eatiher. Thus, dragons.
