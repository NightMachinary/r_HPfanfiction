Honestly I don't even try to pronounce those words in my head when I'm reading. I just sort of go "oh it's that one" and keep going. I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, and honestly while I love the exotic looking names, there is no way in hell I'm going to try and pronounce them. I mean hell, I used to pronounce Ravnica as "rav-in-i-cah" and there is no way any sane English speaker thinks that is right.

Which, you know, is probably why my stories are all nuts.
