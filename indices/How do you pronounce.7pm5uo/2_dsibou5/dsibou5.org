Nah-gee-nee

Seer-ree-us (though that could just be my american accent talking. It's the "serious" puns, I swear.)

and the other two I agree with you. Narcissa is from Narcissus of greek myth, so no question there, and Lushus, or Luscious, is just flat out wrong unless they're actively trying to piss Lucius off. It is definitely Loo-see-us.

I will admit, though, that I spelled Peverell completely wrong when I first read it. I thought it was Pervell for the longest time. The one day I realised I was wrong. It was weird.
