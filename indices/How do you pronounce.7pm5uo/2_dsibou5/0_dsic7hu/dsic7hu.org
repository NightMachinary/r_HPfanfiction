It's so funny how we hold tight to our pronounciations. Like I gave up Sirius's and admitted I'm wrong and what not and began pronouncing his name right but for some reason I absolutely can not ever give up Nagini's pronounciation. JK rowling herself could tell me I'm wrong and I'd be like 'nope don't care'

hahah I'm American too, when I first read it I DID say Serious, but I'm like 'no wait no one would name/pronounce their kids name 'serious' thats dumb so it can't be that. It has to be Sir-rye-us
