I have never once studied Greek Mythology outside of my Mythology class in high school, which wasn't part of the common classes everyone took. The middle school and two high schools I've attended didn't even have a Greek Mythology class.

Even if it was, Narcissus would be a small part of everything that was studied. Most people don't remember most of what they've learned in high school, much less middle school.
