You want crazy pronunciations, listen to the Game of Thrones audio books. They're read by the late Roy Dotrice and he does a pretty good job, but he could not stay consistent for anything. Brienne the Beauty is "Bree-enn" in one book and then "Bri-een" in another. I think he also changes up Danerys a few times. It's rather distracting.
