As a kid, I read Draco as DRAH-koh instead of DRAY-koh.

Narcissa (nah-SISS-uh) is pronounced like /narcissistic/ (which it shares a root word with).

Lucius (LOO-see-iss) shouldn't really be up for debate, since it's a real name, pronounced like Lucien, Luciano or Lucy.

Sirius is named after the star, which I've usually heard pronouce SIH-ree-iss (in the UK at least).

Nagini... I have no idea. It's apparently Sanskrit. I always read it as nuh-GEE-nee.
