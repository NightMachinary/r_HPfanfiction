I think you're confused on the Latin pronunciation rules? I've always learnt in my Latin classes that hard 'c'-s are the traditional rendition of the Roman prounciation, and "ch" is Church Latin.

As for "Lucius", I see where you're coming from, but at the same time, the English pronunciation doesn't pronounce the two 'u' the same way, whereas the French one does, which I feel is a substantial difference.
