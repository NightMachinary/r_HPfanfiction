  Lucius (LOO-see-uss) shouldn't really be up for debate, since it's a real name, pronounced like Lucien, Luciano or Lucy.

Well, /yes/, but on the other hand, wizards may still be working from the Latin name separate from how the pronunciation of the name on the muggle end evolved, so whule Lushous might be out, perhaks Lookious is not. Or, barring this, considering their last name, the Malfoys seem to be of French descent, so perhaps it's pronounced the French way, /lysiys/ in phonetic alhabet.

As for Nagini, I follow the movies' lead and say Nah-ghee-nee.
