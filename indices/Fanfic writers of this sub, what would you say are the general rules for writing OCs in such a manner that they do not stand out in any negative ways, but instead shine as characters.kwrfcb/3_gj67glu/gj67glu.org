Give them a goal. For instance, that OC you just dumped in Slytherin, her trying to survive isn't a goal. BUT, maybe she sees the racism in the house and she wants to change that. So she starts befriending people and excelling in classes. BUT that isn't enough. Her goal changes, especially when the war breaks out and people are trying to hand her over to the government. Her goal isn't staying alive and watching the events, but actively fighting against this oppressive regime. She collects other like minded individuals and starts attracting the ministry, freeing the captured Muggleborns.

Her goal changes as she changes as a person. Think of characters as people. Always ask what they want, and how do they obtain that? But each person is different, so how you might react to something is different than they would. You might see freeing Muggleborns to be enough. She might see killing the snatchers and Ministry officials to be more than acceptable. Don't try to put yourself into the situation. Jump into their heads, and convince your readers that they are reading about a real person.
