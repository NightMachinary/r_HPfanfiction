1. A very clear specific personality. I'm assuming this is not supposed to be a self insert story... so I think good characterization is KEY. The same way we feel we know canon characters enough to write them readers should feel they know ur OC the same amount. Otherwise it's hard to care about them and their contributions in the story feel forced. We already know the canon characters so some work is already done for u but we don't know the OC at all.

Characters need a value system and personality traits. And everything u say about them shoukd be reacted to accordingly by those around them. I don't really think characters need “flaws” we just need to fully explore their traits. Like Fleur is extremely beautiful, to fully explore this...she's used to guys being mesmerized by her so she can be pretty dismissive when it comes to them, also a lot of ppl don't take her seriously as a talented and smart person..she can also come off as vain cause she know she beautiful and her being a more feminine type of girl makes ppl like Hermione and Ginny not as fond of her initially. Hermione is an academic overachiever which can come off as annoying to some and she can come off as a rude know it all around ppl who don't value academics as much as she does (like Ron).

1. Any time the character is there, let there be something that characterizes them so we have a super clear idea of who they are. No one needs multiple paragraphs describing clothes or looks but sprinkling little details helps a ton. Like if ur character is muggle born then maybe their first instinct isn't to reach for a wand when angry it's to just slap someone. But if they are a Slytherin pure blood maybe in the same fight they immediately reach for a wand and they know lots of curses already. When first visiting hogsmeade ur muggle born OC will want to look at everything and take their time maybe buy one of each candy. Ur Slytherin pure blood maybe will know exactly what they like and don't like and might get bored quickly. Just little details that emphasize what we already were told about them.

2. Again this clear specific personality should guide how they react in different situations. If the muggleborn OC isn't used to having a lot of friends but now are meeting new ppl/feels overwhelmed or unsure of themselves in this unfamiliar wizarding world maybe they become a ppl pleaser and just agree with ppl opinions or go along with their ideas because they scared to give ppl a reason to not like them. Maybe we continually see them internally struggle and this leads them to be in a situation they really don't want to be in and they have a breaking point. Maybe initially when they talk they tend to sound unsure of themselves and add “but I don't know” when they present ideas...then later they gain more confidence and stop saying that.

3. They need a reason to exist. I think it rarely makes sense to just add new characters in to only go through canon events. It should be a new story that requires these extra ppl.

4. Of course no one likes all the Mary Sue pitfalls (too special, too perfect, everyone loves them immediately, everyone prioritizes them, overly tragic backstory that doesn't seem to affect them, etc)

5. Their place in the world should be thought out and make sense. If their dad is Rabastan Lestrange but they are sorted into Gryffindor then this will likely cause serious family tension and the Gryffindors might not initially be as warm with them (have to prove themselves or make friends with muggleborns who don't know about their family), other Slytherins they grew up around will likely have words for them or even stop talking to them as Slytherins are very insular.
