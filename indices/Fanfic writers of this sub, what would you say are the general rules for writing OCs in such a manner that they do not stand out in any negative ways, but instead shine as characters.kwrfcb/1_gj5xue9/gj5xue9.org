There was a good post on this awhile back that might give you some interesting answers to your questions. I copy-pasted my answer below from the one I gave in the other thread.

  Generally, my two preferences/guidelines for OCs are give them a reason for existing and give them a niche to occupy. Other than that, anything goes. That basically means they have some actual meaning or contribution to the plot/setting, and that they aren't just 'Canon Character, but...' and have a unique place to occupy in your fic.

  Meaning and contribution can be both from an in-world and writer perspective. Could be anything from a character's death sending out ripples through the world, a historical figure setting up or doing a thing that affects the present-day characters, or a character that pushes elements of the plot along though their dynamics with your protagonist or other characters. Basically, why do they matter? Why aren't they just 'Chorus member no.136'?

  I'm not sure if the 'niche' term is an actual thing I've picked up or not, but it basically refers to the 'roles' of your various characters and how they fit into the world around them. The big-name characters need to be distinct and more than just a reskinned version of another character, or you risk people confusing them or just not caring. If your character is just 'Ginny, but likes Divination instead of Quidditch', then my preference would be to just give Ginny an experience that makes her interested in Divination rather than just 'cloning' her and changing a few things. If you're going to have a second Weasley daughter, you need to make sure she fits into the world in a way that makes her different as a character (to clarify - that doesn't mean make her a chosen one, just distinct from other people) and where her interactions with the various other elements of the world (people, resources, places, etc) make sense.

  I'd also recommend doing a search of this sub on the topic - there have been some really good discussions on this that I've seen in my year here. If you're unaware of how to do this - find the reddit search bar, then type something like "writing OC" into it and click the little tickbox to limit your search to this sub, then search. You'll get a list of posts about OCs and can read them at your leisure. :)

After that, you write them how you write any other character. Write down everything you know about them and ask yourself some questions about what they're like and how they might react to various things until you're happy with how fleshed out they are. Then make sure to keep their thought processes consistent until they get some character development.

Also, don't make them a Mary Sue/Gary Stu.

That's pretty much it. :)
