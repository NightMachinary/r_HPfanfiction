yeah i like the AU-ness of that one

it's too heavy on the hermione-wank for my tastes, but can't be surprised seeing as the author is the type to enjoy hermione x snape

i like hermione as part of the supporting cast. it's weird if harry isn't being sassy to her or complaining a bit. for e.g, rustlings in the dark, the never-ending road for reasonable extrapolations of canon.
