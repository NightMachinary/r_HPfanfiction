[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] is always a good one.

Alternatively, if you're willing to entirely shut down your brain for about a week and then contemplate suicide once that haze of blissful idiocy is over, try any of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/263365/slytherin-nette][slytherin-nette's]] works. I'd start with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1670793/1/The-Perfect-Girl][Perfect Girl]].

Sorry, but are you not willing to leave it as an hypothetical of ending your life and look to finish the job? Look no further! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7868754/1/Behind-the-Veil][Behind the Veil]] will get you there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero][But wait, there's more!]].

For real though, if you haven't read Make a Wish or other works by Rorschach's Blot, give them a try.
