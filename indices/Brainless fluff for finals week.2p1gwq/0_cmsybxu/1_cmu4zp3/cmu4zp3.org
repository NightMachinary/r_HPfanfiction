Thank you for your suggestions ^{^} I've actually tried reading all of them except behind the veil, which I'm looking at now and which doesn't seem to be the lightest reading in the world. Perfect girl was really funny. But, I'm not sure why anyone would feel guilty about reading fanfiction? I feel like, if you enjoyed it, it did its job, right?
