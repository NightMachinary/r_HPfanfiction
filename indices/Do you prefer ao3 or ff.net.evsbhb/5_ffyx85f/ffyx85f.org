I like the ao3 website itself better, but the stories on ff.net tend to be of a higher quality. For ao3 I appreciate all the tags, which can give a much better impression of the story without having to go through and open it. I also find it easier to navigate. Again, however, I think ff.net simply has better quality stuff (and I really like that it has dark mode). I probably read a fair balance between the two sites, though.
