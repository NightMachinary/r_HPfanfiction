Ff.net for one reason: I get tired of finding stories that barerly have anything to do with the character I am looking to read stories about on AO3. FF.net only allows a restricted amount of main characters to be searchable for any story , while on AO3 people seem to tag anybody who makes a caneo appearance.

If somebody had a trick to get around this problem, please tell me. AO3 honestly has the better layout for reading.
