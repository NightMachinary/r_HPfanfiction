I read on mobile so reading on ao3 is a chore to be honest, their mobile site leaves much to be desired. I even prefer ffn mobile site to ffn app (it's just more comfortable for me, especially the search part).

Also for me searching new fics is easier on ffnet as well, since ao3 has this over tagging thing going on on most of the fics. It's hard to look for something on there
