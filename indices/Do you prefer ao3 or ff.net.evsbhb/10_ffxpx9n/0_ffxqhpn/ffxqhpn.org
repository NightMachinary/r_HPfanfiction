I agree with you!

Personally I read fanfic a lot more than I write, so I prefer ao3, because I found the fanfic I want more easily, but I kinda feel like all the very famous fic are on ff.net.

I was wondering if this was because ff.net was better from a writer perspective, but from what you're saying it's not the case..
