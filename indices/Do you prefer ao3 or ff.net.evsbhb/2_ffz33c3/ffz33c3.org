AO3. I really like the tags (hot take) and now that they've added the exclude filters I rarely go on FFN anymore. The download feature is also really nice (epub yay), it makes it easy to save a bunch of fics.

I'm actually surprised people are saying the quality on FFN is better since my experience has been the opposite (although I would assume we're looking for different things since the subreddit skews gender wise).

I feel like (especially in HGDM fics) AO3 is to Pride and Prejudice as FFN is to Romeo and Juliet.
