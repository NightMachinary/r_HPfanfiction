I tried to replicate your results by filtering my search the way you described, and I'm not seeing anything remotely similar. I have a feeling that you might have made a mistake with your exclude filters. Mind posting a link to your search page with the filters applied?

On a side note, unlike on FFN, A/B/O stories on Ao3 are very easy to filter out by just excluding the "Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamics" tag.
