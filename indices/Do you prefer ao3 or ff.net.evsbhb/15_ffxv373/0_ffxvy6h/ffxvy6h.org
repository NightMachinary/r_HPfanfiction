I can see how the slash can be annoying but because the search system in ao3 is better, I feel it's easier to just filter it out.

I never find good fics on ff.net, but that's propably because I never found out how to use the search system. The only way I find good fics on ffn is when people recommend it, so I know it's there but I can't find it on my own it's bothering me..
