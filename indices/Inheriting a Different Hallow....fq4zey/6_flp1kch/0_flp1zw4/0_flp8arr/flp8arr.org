But he made a Horcrux out of the cloak, so maybe he wouldn't use it and instead hide it? Maybe he decided that he's powerful enough to rely on the cloak of invisibility. After all, he could make himself invisible with charms just fine. And the fairy tale about "hiding from Death's sight" is surely overblown and can not possibly be a literal description?

Remember, he did nothing with the Stone. He could summon ancient powerful wizards and learn their secrets and spells but he didn't do it. Maybe he didn't know or didn't connect the fairy tale to the objects and considers them just very powerful artefacts, and the Cloak then would be just that - an invisibility cloak, with very long-lasting charms, just an heirloom in that atrocious family.
