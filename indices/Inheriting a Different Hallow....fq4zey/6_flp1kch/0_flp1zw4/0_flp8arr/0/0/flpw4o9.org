How, though? It's not as if the Deathly Hallows mark is engraved on the cloak. And there are other cloaks of the invisibility in the wizarding world. When Draco saw Harry with the Cloak (on the train before 6th year), he just covered him with it back. So, for the one who doesn't know that it's really The Cloak, it's just a usual one, everyone can buy it or charm it themselves.

Why would be an heirloom in the family? Well, they were poor as hell and still clang for the title of a pureblood family descended from Salazar Slytherin. They are bound to have an heirloom. Why just a cloak? Well, the charms on it are surely very good and it's not as if they could afford to buy another one, so they just passed it down in the family. It's probably the last heirloom they had, having sold other pricey objects.
