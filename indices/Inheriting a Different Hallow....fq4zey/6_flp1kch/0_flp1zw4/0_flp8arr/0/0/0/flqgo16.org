An Invisibility Cloak that has lasted centuries, even in canon it jumps out to Hermione and Ron as being suspicious that the Cloak is that good and has lasted that long. To an arguably wiser and definitely more intelligent Dark Lord (and maybe his early followers as well) that fact would be apparent and lead him to suspicion. Since the Tale is a fairly common wizarding fairytale I can see Voldemort quickly finding out what it is.

And you kinda just said my point for me, the Gaunt's would see the Cloak as far too useful to sell (especially as they'd never be able to buy another one, let alone of similar quality). Like the Ring, Voldemort would find it and 'pocket' it when he went to kill his uncle, then he'd likely do his own little observations of the Cloak and eventually reach the correct conclusion about it.
