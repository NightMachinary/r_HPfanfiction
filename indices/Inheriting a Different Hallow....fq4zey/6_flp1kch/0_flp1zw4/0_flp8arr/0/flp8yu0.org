My theory on that is the ring was a Gaunt family heirloom. He recognised it as something important to his family and thus that made it Horcrux fodder. I sincerely doubt he even knew how to use it or what it was and simply turned it into a Horcrux for that reason alone.

However, there is no way in hell Voldemort would completely throw away an Invisibility Cloak that had been passed down in his family for generations. He'd likely he immediately in awe/suspicious of the item and undoubtedly would make the link between it and the Hallows. Likely hunting for them much earlier than he did in canon.

I like to think he'd taunt Dumbledore in the Ministry duel for needing the Elder Wand to combat him. Maybe even sending Malfoy to kill Dumbledore AND retrieve the wand so he could kill him and take it for himself. Killing Snape a lot earlier (if he was still the one who executed Dumbledore).
