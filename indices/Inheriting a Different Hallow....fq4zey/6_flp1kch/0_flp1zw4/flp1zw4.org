I think it would still work with Dumbledore for that exact reason. If he was able to seek closure in regards to Arianna, in the same way the Potters & Peverell's did in this timeline with their loved ones, I think he would become more proactive and lead to a different approach to Voldemort and Harry.

Additionally, if Voldemort had the Cloak as his Hallow Horcrux I feel like he'd actually use it more and be even more of a threat. Almost like a Rogue or an Assassin, than a magical juggernaut.
