Love it, but I think it'd need to be someone other than Dumbledore who gives it to Harry or else we might see a very different Dumbledore than canon. We know he'd be tempted to use it, especially since it isn't cursed, and it can be argued that a lot of the poor decisions Dumbledore makes (of we ignore the plot necessity of them) are due to his compromised judgement stemming from Ariana's death. I suspect a Dumbledore who's been able to get closure from that incident would be very different, and likely far more competent, than canon Dumbledore. Not necessarily a bad thing, but harder to write certainly.
