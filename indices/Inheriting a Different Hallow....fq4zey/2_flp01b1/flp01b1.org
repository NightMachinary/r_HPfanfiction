There's a fic with a similar, though different premise: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8092431/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spirits-Within]]. It's been a while since I read it, but essentially James and Lily's souls are put into Harry when Voldemort attacks. The quality is ultimately dubious, though, with the typical signs of poor quality such Dumbledore bashing, mindscapes, etc. But it fits the prompt somewhat and you might be interested.
