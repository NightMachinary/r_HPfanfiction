Someone should really get around to writing one of those. Maybe set it like fourth year and present it as a bildungsroman that attempts to show Harry coming into his own with an evolving cast of characters around him as his life and relationships change as he grows up.

Probably need some type of an ice breaker to set up the characters meeting otherwise there's not really any logical reason for an adult witch to have much interested in a barely teenage boy at that point. Maybe something like pen pals or some other mostly anonymous interactive point.

Hmm there's a kernel of an idea there. Maybe I should write it.
