Yeah- I remember reading the start of Harry Potter and the New Life, but I never finished it, because whenever I came back to continue reading it I would always accidentally read another fanfic with the same name- albeit with the same characters, and so on, but subtly different.

As well as this, I think there were also continuations of "Vox Corporis" and "Coming Back Late", but I've never actually read them.

To be honest, I'm surprised there haven't been any continuations of Lori's Paradigm of Uncertainty trilogy, since it ended on something of a cliffhanger.
