Well, such "recursive fanfiction" is popular enough to have [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveFanfiction][its own trope page]]. There are already a zillion people writing continuations of /HPMoR/, for example, and I don't /think/ the author gave explicit permission to all those people. I don't see much difference between continuing a /complete/ story and continuing an /incomplete/ story.
