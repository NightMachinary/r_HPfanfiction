I think it is 100% okay if someone wants to do an unofficial sequel or an AU or a continuation of a fic, permission or not. It's like fanfic of fanfic... And fanfic is permitted so why not fan fiction of fan fictions? I don't know the policy of FF.net, but AO3 would only remove it if there was plagiarism involved. If the continuation is all your own work, then it is no different then any other fanfic.

Now, I'd suggest you try to get permission first, as that's kind of a nice thing to do, and may prevent wank down the line, but it's no more needed then asking JKR for permission to write your Steampunk Harem Harry fic.
