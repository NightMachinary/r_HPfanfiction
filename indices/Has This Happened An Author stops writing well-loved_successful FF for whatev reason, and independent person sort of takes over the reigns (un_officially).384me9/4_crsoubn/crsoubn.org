Not a lawyer.

This is a legal grey area. US copyright of derivative works only applies to lawful derivative works. While Rowling has approved of non-commercial fan fiction, that isn't necessarily the same as a proper license to create a derivative work. If a court says it's not, then Harry Potter fan fiction enjoys no copyright protection (aside from using elements from Rowling's fictional world, which are covered in her copyrights). Other fandoms with no explicit authorial blessings for fan fiction are much less of a grey area -- you've got zero protections.

I've heard stories of authors writing fan fiction, then going to a bookstore and finding a book for sale that's essentially their work with all the character names changed. Spoke to a lawyer; nothing they could do about it unless they got the original work's publisher to join in the lawsuit.
