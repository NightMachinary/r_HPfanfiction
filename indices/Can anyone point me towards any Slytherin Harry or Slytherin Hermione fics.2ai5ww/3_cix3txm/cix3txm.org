There is a ton of Slytherin!Harry fics, but a very small number that is tastefully done and enjoyable. Here are some:

- On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth (already linked from another post): Best of the subgenre.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]] by Big D on a Diet: a hilarious series of one-shots speculating on how certain canon events would have turned out had Harry been a Slytherin
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/][Hogwarts Battle School]] by our very own [[/u/KwanLi][Kwan Li]]: a fusion of sorts between /Harry Potter/ and /Ender's Game/.
- The /Grey Maiden/ series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1015585/Chris-Widger][Chris Widger]]: Harry is raised by Lily's friend: abandoned, but what's written is good.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When_In_Doubt_Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate!]] by Sarah1281: Harry is adopted in his infancy by Gilderoy Lockhart. A lighthearted fic. Has the rare property of being actually finished.

For Slytherin!Hermione fics, I occasionally trawl the fandom for those, subject to the constraints that 1) she is still a muggleborn, 2) she doesn't get an instant and inexplicable friend in Draco or some other cop-out that solves her problems for her, and 3) the technicals are decent. Given those, here are some that are either not too bad or have potential to be good:

- Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk (already linked from another post): Almost certainly the best execution of this premise so far.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/][Labyrinth]] by Kroontjespen: A Riddle-like, but recognizable, Hermione, with Harry tagging along. Updates very slowly.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5769888/1/][Who's Afraid of the Dentists' Daughter]] by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel: Probably abandoned, but what's written so far is amusing enough to be worth a read.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10462402/1/][The Snake Pit]] by cupcake0118: New fic, only one chapter so far, but, given what I've heard from the author, it has potential.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8094421/1/][Wake of War]] by JeanHermioneSnape: Obviously intended to be an HG/SS fic, abandoned, but it can be read as a decent character study.

There are a few others that fit the criteria but did not really go anywhere.
