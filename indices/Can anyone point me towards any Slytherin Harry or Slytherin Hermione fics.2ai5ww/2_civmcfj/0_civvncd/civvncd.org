I love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][/Princess of the Blacks/]] but fem!Harry is in Ravenclaw not Slytherin.

It doesn't matter if you're looking for 'dark' because /Princess/ has that in spades, but it doesn't have much of the overt multi-character politiking that seems to happen in a lot of the Slytherin stories.
