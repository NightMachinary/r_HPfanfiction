Not slytherin harry necessairily but anything with the pairing harry/daphne is typically a fic with a smarter harry rather than the rash gryffindor mentality. Not quite what you are looking for but similar would be the first book of congregation of asp by zaxorus. I dont remember what it is called, sorry.
