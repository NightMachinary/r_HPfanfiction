Ah! I think I have an idea. It's a reference! More fanon than canon and possibly outside-of-chronology, since I don't think he was ever actually in the Blitz, but I think it could be interesting.

Flight of Death (as in, plane-related flying) refers to him being under the Blitz and terrified of the flying-planes of death and his subsequent fear of it, which was the beginning of his journey towards Dark Lord-dom and his motivations toward the horcrux making. It's his symbolic promise to become that which he feared (Death raining down upon you while you can't fight back) and excel beyond it (his Horcruxes).
