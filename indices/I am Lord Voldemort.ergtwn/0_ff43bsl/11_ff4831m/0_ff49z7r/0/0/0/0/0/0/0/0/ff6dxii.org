Nah, you're totally being condescending throughout it. For example, your completely off topic:

#+begin_quote
  That's the thing,he isn't using "Volder" Hes using "Vol" In fact "Volder" doesn't exist. You're thinking of "Voler" which translates to Fly,wing,plunder or steal. The d in his assumed name is part of "de" which means of.
#+end_quote

The condescension here is in your assumption that you're talking to someone who /doesn't/ understand that - when it's quite clear that [[/u/vlaaivlaai]] does understand the component parts of Voldemort (Vol de mort), as their first comment in the chain literally shows. Your 'correction' comes across as smug and completely off topic, since you've basically made it up that they got an easy thing wrong.

Your next comment, the one chastising them towards civility, is also quite smug. You continue to discuss the 'Voler' part of it, which is again completely irrelevant, as vlaaivlaai has demonstrated an understanding of it multiple times. You then have the 'Watch your tongue' comment which comes across as /ridiculously/ condescending when written like that.
