I'm arguing that you're reading way to far into thus. As far as Riddle is concerned his name can be rearranged in a word that use VOL not VOLER and beyond that he couldn't care less for French syntax. You even said it your self.

  Voler specifically refers to 🛩️. People wrongly think it's 🏃.

Riddle wouldn't care about that and use the wrong meaning. You just got hung up on the actual meaning (That Riddle was wrong) and missed the point.

As a side-note. I'm being civil. Do the same and watch you tongue.
