Whatever you say. I am not setting out to condescend to anybody,merely to point out that in delving into the meaning of the name [[/u/vlaaivlaai][u/vlaaivlaai]] forgot that it's a children's book and far more simple than it's made out to be. If that's the way you and [[/u/vlaaivaal][u/vlaaivaal]] choose to take it then that's on you.

I Take it back,I Was condescending on one point. Dropping the F-Bomb in a mild conversation on a board devoted to a series aimed at the younger crowd is uncalled for. No matter how you try and justify it.
