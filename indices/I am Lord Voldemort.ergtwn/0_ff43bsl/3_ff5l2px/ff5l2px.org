I am french and “ vol de mort “ mean literally : “ robbery of death” like if you stole someone death.

In this sentence : “vol de mort” it cannot mean running away at all like in any way possible.

It could be flying but not from death. It would be like a flight of deaths, like a a lot of dead people flying in the sky like birds. But to be exactly correct it would be written : “vol de morts”

But im stinking with the robbery thing it is what make the most sense when you read it in correct french.

Hope i help.
