  French isn't great, but wouldn't ‘Voldemort' translate roughly to ‘flight of death'?

  Voler in French means flying as in "flying a plane", not flying as in "running away"

  You can also fly out of room ("She flew through the door" / "Elle vole vers la porte"), and you can use it informally as stealing, like you can "lift" something from a store in English.

Sorry, I'm a stickler for this. Replace it with "theft from death" if you want, tho.

Edit: some explanation I came up with on discord:

Vol de mort can be translated with "flight from/of death" but there are 2 ways to read that: flight = 🛩️ and flight = 🏃.

Voler specifically refers to 🛩️.\\
People /wrongly/ think it's 🏃.
