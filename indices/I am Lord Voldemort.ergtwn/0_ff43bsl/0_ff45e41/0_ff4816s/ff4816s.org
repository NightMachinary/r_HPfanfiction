You could consider Voldemort as Death, sure, but then you would be meaning "death flying from death" in your example. So I wouldn't say it means flying away from death. Voldemort can be roughly translated to either Flying Death or Theft of Death.

Though Theft of Death would mean he's stealing death, which doesn't make much sense to me. It doesn't mean he's stealing /from/ death, or that he's stealing life like he does with Horcruxes, but that he's taking death for himself. And I'm not sure what that would mean.
