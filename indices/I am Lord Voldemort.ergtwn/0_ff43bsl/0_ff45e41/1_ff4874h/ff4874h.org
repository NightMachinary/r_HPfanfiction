So, "flying away" carries more connotations of "Flee" than physical flight. "Voldemort" could be translated as the latter - as in, Death physically flying around. 'De' translates as 'of', and not 'from', in your example. Instead, it refers to death itself.

Alternatively, you can look at it as 'Theft' - it wouldn't be quite grammatically correct, but "Theft from Death" is a meaning you can take from it, and you need to make some concessions when making a good name!

Another angle might be more poetic - a flight of birds would translate the same way (using vol), so you can picture death in the form of a bunch of flying objects/birds darkening the sky and approaching...

(Flight, as in to run away from or flee, would be 'Fuite" as a noun or "Fuir" as a verb)
