That is also still mildly appropriate. Combined stereotypes of Wizarding ignorance of Muggles and Britain's ignorance of France. I like the idea of the Purebloods finding out their boss is named after a Muggle Doodad and getting miffed in that "Did you hear..?" - "I know! Such a travesty. It's never the ones you expect it from, is it?" - "Tsk. Dark Lord today, DJ in Ibiza tomorrow. No respect for traditions." etc etc sort of way before promptly never mentioning it to Voldie for fear of Death or Crucio.
