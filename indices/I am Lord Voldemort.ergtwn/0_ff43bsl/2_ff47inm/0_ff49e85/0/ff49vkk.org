Oh, definitely - it's physical, vertical flight. I'd just think of fleeing from something as 'flight /from/' instead of 'flight /of/', but that might just be me. Though 'Flight of' could mean that whatever it is is fleeing, but there's not really a better word for physical flight in english that I can think of.
