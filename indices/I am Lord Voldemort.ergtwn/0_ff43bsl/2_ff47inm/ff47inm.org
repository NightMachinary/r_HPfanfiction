Vol in French does match with Flight in a few ways - both mean flight (with wings), both can mean the distance covered by a flying person/object, and both can mean a group of similar flying objects/things (eg, a flock of geese = a flight of geese = un vol d'oies). Vol in French also means theft, like you say, though I would disagree with it being informal like 'lift/lifting' - my family would use it interchangeably/in the same context as theft in english.

Flight, as in to flee, would be 'Fuite' in french.

I think that 'Flight of Death' would be a fine-ish translation for Voldemort, as would 'Theft from Death' or 'Flying Death'. 'Flight *from* Death', however, would not be a good one.

Personally if I had to pick them, I'd pick "Flight of Death" for the obvious one (that the English newspapers/public would be likely to pick up on) and "Theft from Death" as the alternate/hidden one. The dual meanings are strangely fitting - I doubt that Rowling actually considered that in naming Voldemort, despite her knowledge of french. "Death's Flight" is one I'd be partial to as well, as I find it more poetic - but it'd likely unfortunately send the wrong impression
