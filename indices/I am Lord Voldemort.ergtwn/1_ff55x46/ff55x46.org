Having the name Voldemort translate to "flight of death" where the 'flight' means literal flying actually makes some sense, given that Voldemort is one of only 2 wizards shown to be capable of unassisted flight, and given that his chosen symbol is a skull hovering in the sky. HE is death, flying toward his victims.

Even if I admit it's much more plausible that either JK is a poor translator or that Voldemort himself is shit at French and intended it to be 'flight FROM death' in the sense of 'lol my horcruxes will save me'.
