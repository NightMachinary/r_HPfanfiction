I legitimately regret reading that story. Not only did it seem to be written by a 12 year old, it's also a complete copy of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) but written with Voldemort and Dumbledore in the tournament instead of Ron/Harry. I actually wish I had spent my time sitting in silence than reading that story.
