No, it isn't mentioned that Remus spoke to him, only that he was going to. I usually listen to the audiobooks, so I can't be sure if the quote is exactly right, but Remus says,'If anyone is going to speak to Snape, it will be me'. This happens when Harry talks to Remus and Sirius via the floo and tells them Snape has stopped giving him lessons. Sirius is outraged and says he is going to have a world with Snape, and so Remus says he'll be the one to do it. It's chapter 29.
