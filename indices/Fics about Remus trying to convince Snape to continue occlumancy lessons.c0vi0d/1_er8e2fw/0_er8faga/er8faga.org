Now this is unexpected! I'm a bit hesitant to express my views on this matter, but in that fic the author sort of tried to make Remus understand Snape and how the bullying affected him and they both sort of opened up to each other and all that. It also seemed like the author was a bit,well, making fun of Remus. This might be only my impression, but she made him seem a bit too, I don't know, weak maybe. For example, Snape goes on about how the four of them bullied him, and Remus whispers,'not four'. It's like, he is smart enough to know that he is guilty for not doing anything. Now I think of it, I was an odd fic. But I've seen Remus portrayed as rather submissive in this case. There was another example, where in a longer fic he simplly wrote a letter to Snape, apologising for his part in that incident and Sirius tore the letter to shreads and it was the end of it. There was another fic where Remus actually grabs Snape and shakes him. It was amusing, but to this day I'm not sure what I think. I think my main issue with this situation is that I don't want to see Remus at a total disadvantage, but he can't succeed here either so it has to be convincing failure.
