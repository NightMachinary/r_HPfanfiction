Thank you so much. Yes, this is pretty much what I wanted. That description of Snape's appearance at the beginning maybe seemed somewhat off, but only because it's Remus's point of view and it's usually Harry who describes him that way. I really liked the conversation. 'you wont' get the apology you need' lol. I really wonder what Remus thought about the whole thing. What I really like is that you keep Remus calm while Snape seems angry, this makes it even more amusing.Im no expert on Snape, but it seemed odd he'd admit he saw no one loved Harry. I don't know why I was so surprised. Btw, your Remus swears:) It's one of those things I'll still have to get used to. Oh and I kept wondering if Snape will mention 'younger women', because he usually does. Thanks again.
