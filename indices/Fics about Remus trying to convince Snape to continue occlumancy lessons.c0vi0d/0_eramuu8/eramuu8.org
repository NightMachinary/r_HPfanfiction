I have written it for you as part of a slightly longer story, including some of Sirius and Remus remembering James which you can read [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/post/185620620611/a-missing-moment-from-chapter-29-of-ootp][here]], if you want. However, please see below for the Remus-Snape conversation, and please do let me know any feedback you have. It's been a long time since I wrote either of these characters.

It was just a few days later when Remus sat in The Three Broomsticks, nursing a beer and helping himself to the small dish of peanuts on his table. Rosmerta had chatted lightly, but she hadn't quite looked him in the eyes as she pulled his pint, and a few minutes after he had left the bar, he saw her cleaning the place where he had leaned. He remembered with a pang that she had greeted him as Professor Lupin, and therefore likely remembered the reason he had left the school.

Snape was late, and Remus had almost given up on him when the door creaked open and his sallow, greasy looking face appeared. Remus held up a hand to him, and Snape stalked, bat like over to his table, flicking his wand around them as he sat. Their conversation was now private.

‘Is this about Greyback?' Snape asked brusquely. ‘Or have you word fromm Dumbledore?'

‘No,' said Remus mildly. He pushed the extra pint he had bought towards Snape, who ignored it. ‘I heard that you ended Harry's occlumency lessons.'

Snape sneered. ‘Black sending you to do what he can't, is he? Must be frustrating to hand over what little responsibilities he does have to you.'

‘I've also heard why you ended them,' said Remus calmly.

Snape flushed, the scowl on his face so vivid that Remus almost leaned back. ‘I told Potter to mention it to no one - thank you for informing me that he has disobeyed me yet again-'

‘Severus,' said Remus, in what he hoped was a placating tone.

‘I will not have him in my office again,' Snape snarled. ‘If the boy is so arrogant, so ill-mannered, so entitled to believe that he may snoop through my private-'

‘Harry's faults aside,' said Remus, hoping to temper Snape's anger and avoid the defensiveness Sirius would have thrown at him, ‘Dumbledore must have emphasised the importance of him learning occlumency. Surely you-'

‘The boy will never learn,' replied Snape, his lip curling in utter contempt. ‘He is too emotional, too weak. Frankly I am tired of looking through his pathetic little childhood and boohooing that nobody loved him - it bores me, Lupin, like everything, the boy believes himself to be unique and special-'

‘None of this is relevant,' said Remus, hoping that he was managing to keep the irritation out of his voice. ‘You know what is at stake, you know what could happen.'

‘And it will be entirely the boy's fault. He is the one who threw away his chance of learning.'

Remus rubbed at his eyes and breathed deeply. ‘My god, Severus - after all these years, you let a schoolboy rivalry-'

‘This has nothing to do with Potter,' spat Snape.

‘It clearly does,' said Remus firmly. ‘Harry is not James, he is not the same person-'

‘He is similar enough that I can see past the Boy-Who-Lived wonder for his flaws,' Snape insisted. ‘And I can see that it is worthless trying to teach a boy who is neither capable nor willing to learn, much less one who shows an utter lack of respect for his teacher.'

‘It's your job to keep trying regardless,' said Remus. ‘When Dumbledore hears-'

‘Dumbledore is more than welcome to take on the responsibility himself,' said Snape silkily. ‘He is the one grooming the boy for great things, is he not?'

‘He's trying to protect-'

‘Believe that if you must.'

Remus studied Snape carefully; he was sure his own face must be scowling now too. ‘You will not get apology you need,' he said in a measured voice, ‘because the man who owes it to you is dead.'

‘I have no desire for an apology from James Potter - I couldn't care less-'

‘I have tried, for my part, to make amends, to move on-' Remus tried to continue.

‘Ever the wise, responsible, mature one,' sneered Snape. ‘How is it on those lofty heights, Lupin? I would have thought a man so virtuous as yourself would...' Snape shrugged, a nasty glint in his eye, ‘avoid sordid affairs with younger women?'

Remus closed his eyes, and looked away, trying to hold back the heavy sigh that threatened to escape from his lungs. ‘That's... again, Severus, that's not a matter of relevancy to the-'

‘I will not teach that boy privately again,' Snape hissed, leaning forward. ‘And I will not have whoever's trying to adopt him lately lecture me on the morality of refusing to indulge his spoilt behaviour.'

‘Severus-'

Snape rose from his chair. ‘I will see you at the next Order meeting,' he said curtly. ‘Best of luck in continuing to babysit Black.'

Remus watched as Snape stormed out of the pub, his cloak billowing behind him. He sighed, and reached for the pint he had bought Snape, which had remained untouched. ‘Shit,' he muttered, before taking a deep gulp.
