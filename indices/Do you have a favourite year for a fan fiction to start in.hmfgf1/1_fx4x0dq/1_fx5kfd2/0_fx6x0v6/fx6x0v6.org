I know! Dumbledore is extremely powerful, enough to take down Grindelwald face to face and be the only one Voldemort ever feared, but all of the manipulative!Dumbledore stories (that I've read, anyways) don't really show that- they just show an old man going senile or being outwitted effortlessly by this pre-teen/teen boy. Probably not gonna happen, even if Harry becomes Lord Potter-Black-Hogwarts-Emrys-Whatever. Dumbles has got experience. (Also come on, he can totally be scary. We've seen it happen in the books once or twice)
