My favorite trope is Harry being smart and diligent. Thus, I like fics that start before Harry attends Hogwarts.

Students can change their habits, but most fanfiction seem to rush it. Nobody can convince me that 2-3 years is enough time to become on par with Dumbledore.

That being said, I also like wholesome fics that start on 3rd year. Thirteen is a very interesting age.
