Depends on if it's a full AU or just a canon divergence, I just want the /whole/ story, like give me all the background and tell me who this character is to you. Exquisite ðŸ‘Œ

Otherwise I adore post-war fics exploring that whole mess and ones where the author expands on what we already know of characters, like their prowess or intelligence, etc.
