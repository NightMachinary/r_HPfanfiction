I like a lot of variety.

If its a Peggy Sue I like 1st, 3rd, 5th or 7th. They each give interesting possibilities and constraints on the Peggy Sue.

If its something that retroactively changes a bunch of canon for an AU I prefer 1st or post 7th. Either going into it all fresh, or covering the changes on their own terms without going into overload covering the massive AU while trying to manage new plot as well.

If its Time Travel I like 5th or 7th if the character will be attending school or 4-12 years post Hogwarts if they'll be in a different role.

If its post canon I prefer either first or second summer after the Battle of Hogwarts if I'm interested in how the characters grow into a world where they no longer need to be child soldiers, or 9-12 years after the battle to explore epilogue alternatives.
