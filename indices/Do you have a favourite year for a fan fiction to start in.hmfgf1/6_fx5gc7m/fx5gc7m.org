I like 4th/5th year fics a lot, mostly because that's the point at which the world and characters are most interesting- they're beginning to mature and display critical thought, as well as beginning to feel pressure due to Voldemort's return. This pressure makes the story- and alternate versions or directions of the story- really interesting to me. As much as I love a good-ol' "and everyone lived happily ever after" fluff, intense stress provides so much opportunity for characterization - how people and relationships deal with stress or even life-threatening situations tells you a lot about them.

However, I'll also speak out on behalf of "eighth-year" pieces because, frankly, they're fun! They have a sort of college dynamic, often the situation sort of forces previously dived house members together, everyone's a bit more mature (which avoids the often-cringey second-hand embarrassment of the early teens). But, most of all, it provides us with all sorts of interesting interpretations on how Hogwarts functions after the war, what reparations are being made and how? What's going on with new students? What's going on with "eighth year" students? How are the events of past canon being talked about? In my opinion, it's fun to read.
