I really, really love post war fics. I love the characters, but there's something just better about reading about them as adults now that I am one.

I also love Mauraders era fics, especially if they are time travel fics with post-war adult characters ending up back in time still as adults (think Wind Shear, stuff like that).

If we're picking stories that start during the school years, I think I prefer fifth year and beyond for a start. I like using the shitshow that the Tournament was as a jumping off point for change.
