Anything from third year on. So much of HP fanfiction is either romance (which I usually avoid) or the standard 1st year AU/OC repeat (cough/regurgitation of canon/cough). If I see a 'redo' type fic I prefer when they just start in another year straight off and just clue us in on their changes without dragging it out.
