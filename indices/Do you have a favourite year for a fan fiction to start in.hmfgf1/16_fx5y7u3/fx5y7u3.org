4/5th year for me!

Its very flexible and follow the two most devastating deaths in the series.

You can do so much with it, have Harry be consumed by revenge ultimately losing everything in the process, or maybe have Harry become something greater and inspire hope.

First/Second year is too young if you want to go into a different direction and third year is perfect.
