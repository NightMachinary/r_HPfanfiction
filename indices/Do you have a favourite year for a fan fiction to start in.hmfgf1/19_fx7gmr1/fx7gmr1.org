I prefer either third year or sixth year.

Third because thirteen is old enough to have the ability to think critically and investigate and figure things out, while still being young enough to act with childlike innocence and earnestness.

Sixth is great because it's when most people start to really think about life after school and develop friendships and contacts that will exist into adulthood. It's also a good age for children to have their worlds rocked with new information and new mistakes and have them be old enough to begin to figure out how to deal with that.
