Ok so! Here's the thing, I'm the same as you, I read Antithesis and was mostly lost a lot of the time but enjoyed the fic overall. I learned to... Not really pay too much attention to the motivationd and just enjoy the characters and overall story.

Essentially:: -Aidan loves Lutain and would do anything for him.

-Aidan really wants to feel useful. This need to be useful causes him to gravitate to the people who make him feel most loved. This causes him to switch sides (sometimes he's good, sometimes hes evil, overall he just wants to be seen and will go to the people most likely to do that.) He doesn't have loyalties like we usually expect from characters.

-This need for acceptance makes him very easily manipulated. By Crouch and others.

-The tiredness and potion is explained later if it hasn't been already.

-No one likes Aidan apart from Remus. Even Skylar who respects him often doesn't necessarily like him. The vice versa is also true though for the most part, Aidan harbours a grudge against Skyler so hates him on princeple.

-Overall, people do think he's powerful and a prodigy. The problem is he's also insane and very niave and easily controlled. Powerful and determined but so very childish in a way.

The main thing with Antithesis is important self worth can be. Aidan has none. He is beaten to the ground time and time again. No matter how hard he tries to be good and please others, they don't see him. And every time he tries to do what he thinks is the 'right thing' it ends up hurting him and everyone around him. And it's painful to watch.

I think around chapter 60ish... Yeah... I felt the plot kinda got a little lost? There were random jumps and unexplained motivations. He was working with Skyler all of a sudden for no real reason?

But it's worth it to stick with it. Just smile and nod and go with it rather than ask too many questions, that's what I did and I enjoyed it.
