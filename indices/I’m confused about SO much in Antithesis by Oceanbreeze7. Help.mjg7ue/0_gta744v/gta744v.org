Oh this is one of my favourite stories!!! Ok, first off, it's extremely complex and dwells into human psychology and behaviour more than most stories, both original work and fanfics, it's really not feasible to go that deep. Readers often find the behaviour of the characters to be inconsistent or hard to explain. Anti-thesis ignores that.

At the heart of it, Harry has a major identity crisis throughout the story and that's made worse the environment, position and circumstances he finds himself to be surrounded by. He hates his former family, but he doesn't like the new one he has, not as much as he thinks he does or wants to. It's a conflict between what a person hates, what a person wants and what a person really is.

The most consistent bit in the story is his love for animals.

The rest is a huge overlap of human tendencies and emotions which result in conflicting actions.

Now with respect to the power thing, it was very confusing to me as well. It really didn't make sense because until year 4, we had the sense that Harry was super powerful, but suddenly he has a crisis regarding his ability and that he isn't good enough. I don't really remember nearly enough as to understand why that occurs, but i think it's a result of him comparing himself to Voldemort, an adult with years of experience against himself, a child of 14. I think it's a result of trying to take short cuts and reach the pinnacle. He always wants to be on top and in a position of undisputed power.

Now Adolonda... See I love the portrayal of the basilisk in this because of the fact that the story takes into account the conniving, cunning and malicious nature of the basilisk. See most fanfics make the bloody snake a soft, warm hearted creature that cares for humans. When it isn't really in their nature. It makes little to no sense as to why the big bloody snake that kills with a look would be kind and submissive.

She is nice to Harry at the beginning to establish trust and a relationship. After crouch enters, she goes to push him towards doing stupid shit and takes advantage of the trust he placed in her, and attacked his insecurities - along the lines an abusive mother would do - see Elton John.

Why did she do it? Easy. She is cruel. She had her own agenda. She was never a nice or good person.

Crouch made Harry harm himself to further his own selfish agenda.

Harry was a victim on multiple fronts. I love the story because it really depicts the vulnerability of child to external factors who really don't care about him at all.

When Harry dies, you can count on one hand the number of people that legitimately care for him. It's a sad story, but it hits really close to home.
