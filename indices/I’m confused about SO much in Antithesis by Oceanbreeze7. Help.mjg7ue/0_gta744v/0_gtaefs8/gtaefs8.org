Ahhhhh so relieving! The power thing was making me crazy! And you're too right about the Basilisks!!! I was like â€˜why are you doing this Ado! You're supposed to be his quasi-surrogate mum!'. Thanks for forcing me to take a look at my head cannon. Why would a reptile, designed to kill first and never ask questions, be a cuddle plushie?

And you're definitely right about the psychology. It keeps reminding me of psychological movies/books (Pi, Clockwork Orange, OFOtCCN, etc) and yet I hadn't really allowed it to become a primary theme in my head. So thank you for that wake up as well.
