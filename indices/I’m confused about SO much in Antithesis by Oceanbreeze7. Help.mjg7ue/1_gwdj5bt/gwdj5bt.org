The first thing I want to stress, Antithesis was *never* intended to become what it did in terms of popularity and following. The story originally was written with the intention of being a self-indulgent project, which subsequently exploded somewhere around the late 30-40's chapter count if I had to guess.

That means there are a /lot/ of unexplained plot holes or gaps that never were filled or corrected. The story had a flaw, which evidently became a dozen flaws when the story continued, and they were never corrected or thought through all the way because- well, who was going to read it? (In retrospect, karma really kicked me there).

[[/u/Snoo-31074][u/Snoo-31074]] is absolutely right in their synopsis and analysis of the work. There are a few other things, mostly why I decided to write a certain way or what I was intending to do behind certain actions, but for the majority, it's just as they said. /"It's a conflict between what a person hates, what a person wants, and what a person really is."/

Some actions don't make sense because (if you're referring to early chapters prior to my moment of /'oh no, people actually like this story')/ it may have been that I genuinely hadn't cared much or thought much about it, beyond 'wow wouldn't this aspect be cool?'

But, once I really started to recognize the impact the story had and how much people enjoyed it, I buckled down and really /tried. Everything from the scene involving drinking the potion in the chamber was calculated and intentional./

If you don't understand something- then that's alright. If the story confuses you, that's perfectly fine. If you can't understand why Adrian would make a certain decision, that doesn't make you less of a reader.

One of my favourite jokes I had while writing the story is "Antithesis is a story where I think /'hmm, this can't possibly get any worse,'/ and then proceeds to get worse," because that's the exact point. I tried to subject the characters (mainly the protagonist) to every category of trauma or angst I could possibly write. It's totally alright that you can't relate or understand one of the many many aspects that I wrote- nobody is expected to understand or relate to everything.

The reason Antithesis has touched so many people is that the trauma or angst that you don't understand is something someone may relate to completely. Someone may be struggling with a condition beyond their control and find it mirrored in my work. Someone may understand how to keep walking forward because they see their habits or routines mimicked within the work.

The story is confusing, I totally agree, but it has a purpose and helps those who need it. With that being said- message me, /let me know/ how I can help you, and I'll see what I can do for explaining both the characters and plotline, or letting you know /why/ I made characters act a certain way.

Life isn't easy, but I've learned sometimes I can make it a little easier for those who need it. :)
