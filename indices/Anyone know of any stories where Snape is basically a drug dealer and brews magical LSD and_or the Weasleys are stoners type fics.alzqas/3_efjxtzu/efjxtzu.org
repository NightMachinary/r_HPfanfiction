I'm reading A dealer, not a Death Eater. It might fit what you're looking for.

Snape is a drug dealer who brews party potions as a sideline to his apprenticeship.

It starts off with a heavy focus on this with Lucius Malfoy as the master of the market and Mundungus Fletcher setting up deals. It's got very complicated with the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore fighting Voldemort and it's becoming more 'A Death Eater, not a dealer' as time goes on.
