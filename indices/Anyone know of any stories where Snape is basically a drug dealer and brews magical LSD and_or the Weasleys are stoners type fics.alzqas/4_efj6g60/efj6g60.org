This is another thing that canon doesn't really cover. Substance addiction.

Imagine if cigarettes IRL were actually healthy. That smoking was better for you than not smoking. Everyone would smoke a pack a day at least, adults and children.

If there were a magical cigar with no downsides but was slightly addicting nearly every wizard in existence would have a cigar on them.
