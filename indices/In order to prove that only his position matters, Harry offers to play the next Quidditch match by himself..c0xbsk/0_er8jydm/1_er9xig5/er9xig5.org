Snitch is OP though and I know there are fics that reduce the point gain because of how ridiculous it is. I mean in the World Cup Bulgaria almost tied it because of Krum maybe even won when Bulgaria scored 1 goal. It feels like that games results were like that just to show that the snitch isn't always the automatic winner regardless of how hard it is to believe that one of the best teams in the world couldn't score more than one goal compared to the 17 the other team scored.
