I mean... let's say it takes 10 seconds to fly the length of a Quidditch pitch. Maximum time it would take for an unopposed team to score 150 points with the Quaffle is going to be around two and a half minutes.

So unless Harry catches the snitch within a couple of minutes, he's going to lose that game. He's not caught the snitch that quickly before, and this time he wouldn't have two beaters protecting him.

My money is on Harry being shown up as hilariously wrong.
