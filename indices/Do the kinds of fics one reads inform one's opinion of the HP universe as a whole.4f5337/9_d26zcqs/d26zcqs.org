Well, it's a fact that wizards (at the basic level) are superior to muggles:

No muggle dropped out of a window (like Neville!) will bounce (no: such a child will be DEAD afterwards!) or recover from injuries (broken bones!) in a few days (or a night if they are vanished and re-grown!) and no muggle can make for example a very detailed statue out of a piece of rock in seconds (transfiguration!) or fly (with or without a broom) etc. etc.!

The thing is they hamstring themselves with their narrow mindedness (suppremacists at least!), so over all they aren't superiour!
