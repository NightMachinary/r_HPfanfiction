I would imagine. This is based on characterization more, but I find people often read fics and get a very skewed version of that character and then use it as "proof" in debates or canon discussions. I seen a Dramione versus Ronmione debate a while back on this subreddit where someone posted a discussion between two friends of theirs that replied almost entirely of fanon arguments and headcanon. Or someone will list their reasons for hating Ron as a character and while some are valid, others seem to be heavily fanon influenced. Or when people take some throwaway line in canon and see it used so often in fanon that they forget it's not a big deal in canon.
