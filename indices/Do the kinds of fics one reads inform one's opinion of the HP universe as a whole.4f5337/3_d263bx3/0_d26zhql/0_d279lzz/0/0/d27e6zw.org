I'm sorry, but to me that just seems really over the top in the context of what's actually in the book. Harry clearly knew his own name, and we see the Dursley's referring to him as Harry. Harry mentions Dudley beating him up plenty, but not his aunt or uncle, so to say more is speculation and not canon. I'm totally not against it in fanfic, at all, but it gets a bit silly when people start to say it's what definitely canon. It even says in the book "the Dursley's had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he'd liked." As for Vernon the rapist, that needs to stay firmly in fanfic, please. You can (and I do) maintain that Harry was abused without turning it into a nightmare scenario.
