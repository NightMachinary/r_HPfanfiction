I've never said that all of that was canon - I only stated that we don't know specifics (Harry doesn't like speaking about it - than again: He's "bothered" enough to ask Dumbledore not to send him back to the Dursleys!), but "He'd never been allowed to eat as much as he wanted." could mean that he was never given enough food to be fully saturated (which again might explain his stunted growth, I mean he's not exactly a midget, but he's not exactly tall either!)

I agree that beatings aren't canon ;) (sure they might have slapped him occasionally or spanked him, but not outright beating/whipping him with belts and other objects!)

Vernon is an ass, but I agree that (in canon) he's not a rapist!

Well, you can't - abuse is always a nightmare scenario (for the person in that situation), sure it could have been worse, but "the cupboard under the stairs" is still pretty bad IMHO (come on: Children don't belong in cupboards - even less if there's a whole other bedroom available!)
