There's no indication that that was not the case! Sure, it's speculation to say it did (just like it's speculation to say Vernon, Dudley and Petunia never hit him), but if it fits the fanfiction, then I am not against an author using it (note: I don't know if Rowling ever clarified how far the neglect/abuse went, but even if she did: The books never cleared that up, so it's no wounder that this became something that's up to the discretion of the writer in fanfiction! If the story is well written then I don't care if the author makes the Dursleys out to be total monsters (like say: Vernon the rapist!)!)
