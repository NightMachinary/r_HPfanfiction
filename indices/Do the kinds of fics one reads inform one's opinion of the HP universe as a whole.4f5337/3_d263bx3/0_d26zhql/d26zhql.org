Abuse is still abuse even if it wasn't bad (sorry, but we don't really know the extent of the neglect and abuse at the Dursleys - they probably didn't beat Harry regularly with a belt or anything, but Dudley still beat him up regularly (Harry-Hunting!) and he often received no food (we don't know if he was seriously malnourished, but it's a possibility and it might have stunted his growth (compared to his parents he's not that tall after all and most people are at least as tall, if not taller, than their parents!))
