Honestly, I didn't quite realise the level of blatant corruption and shittiness of the Ministry until I read a couple of fics.

Also, I didn't quite realise how strong Harry is magically until I read a few Super!Harry fics. No, I'm not saying that super!Harry is canon or anything, just that when all the ridiculous stuff Harry's done /in canon/ is put down on the same page, it becomes pretty obvious that Harry's fairly powerful in canon, too.
