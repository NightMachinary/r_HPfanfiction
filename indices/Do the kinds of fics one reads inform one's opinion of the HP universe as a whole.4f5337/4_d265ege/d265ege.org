Kinda the opposite. Seeing all sorts of /bad/ ideas in fics has likely influenced my interpretation of canon in terms of what tropes should be /avoided/ (if possible) when you're reasoning out conclusions from canon facts.

But the positive form doesn't really occur - I don't really see something in a fic and think "this should be a part of canon". Probably because my primary standard for how much I like a fic is how canonical it feels (not just factual compliance, but also feeling like canon in tone).
