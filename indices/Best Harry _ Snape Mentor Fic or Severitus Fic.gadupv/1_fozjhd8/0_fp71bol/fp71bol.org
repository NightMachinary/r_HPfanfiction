When I was younger, I loved Harry's new home. Unfortunately, I no longer enjoy it because I can't get pastSnape thumping him and Minerva giving him a kiss on the cheek in the same scene she finds out. Literally none of the adults hold him to account for it, despite it being a criminal offence. Then, the story goes onto have Snape a guardian for Harry? It's just not right. It's such a shame it starts that way.
