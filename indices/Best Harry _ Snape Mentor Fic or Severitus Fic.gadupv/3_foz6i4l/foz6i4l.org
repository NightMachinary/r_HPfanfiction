That's one of my favorite tropes, so here are a few off the top of my head.

There are also a bunch of hidden gems on [[https://potionsandsnitches.org][potionsandsnitches.org]]. You can find an old one of [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3048][mine]] there as well, if shameless self-promotion doesn't put you off too much.

I hope I got this fanfic bot thing right.
