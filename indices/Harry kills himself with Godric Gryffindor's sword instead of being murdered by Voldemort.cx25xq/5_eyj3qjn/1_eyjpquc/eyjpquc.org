You make a really good point. With Nagini, the Horcrux was part of her, so cutting off her head killed the Horcrux. With Harry though, it is just in his scar, and we know that it can be stored in inanimate objects, so just killing Harry would not be enough, they would have to specifically aim to kill the Horcrux in the scar. If they just killed Harry, the Horcrux could just attach itself to his scull and continue to exist.
