I was counting on the tear jerking scene with Harry planting the ancient blade of his House in his heart but now ...God, id give anything to have everyone witness the Boy Who Lived trying to stab himself in the forehead with a big ass sword. But in all fairness, my head canon is that the sword/venom will work just as well even if not pointed at the scar as long as they kill Harry.
