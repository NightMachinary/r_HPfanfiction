Y'know, I'm reminded of that scene in Kingdom Hearts I, with Sora impaling himself on the keyblade of heart in order to release Kairi's heart trapped within himself.

...Okay, my mind is going strange places. Seven princesses of heart, seven horcruxes, one of which is concealed inside the protagonist and requires him to (not quite) die to release it...but then, in KH1, releasing Kairi's heart has the effect of uniting the hearts of the seven Princesses of Heart and unlocking the Final Keyhole which released a huge swarm of Heartless.

I wonder if there's any fics where destroying Voldemort's horcruxes unleashes something really really bad. Like, the ruined soul chunks combine to make some horrifying abomination, or they break the barrier between the mortal and spirit worlds to release lots of horrifying abominations, or...?
