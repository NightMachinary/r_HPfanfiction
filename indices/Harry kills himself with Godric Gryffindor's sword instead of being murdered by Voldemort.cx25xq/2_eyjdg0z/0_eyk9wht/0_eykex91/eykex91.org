Unwilling to sacrifice Harry just to guarantee Voldemort's death, nor destroy such priceless artifacts as the relics of the founders, Dumbledore instead investigates ways to separate souls from their vessels without destroying the latter.\\
In his research, he finds records, of an ancient dark wizard who created a 'Key To The Heart', which he used to steal souls of unusual purity for his unspeakable rituals; seeing this as an opportunity, Dumbledore sets out to retrieve the surviving Key To The Heart, planning to use the ancient dark device for good by extracting Voldemort's horcruxes from the artifacts (and Harry) that they reside in.

But though Dumbledore's plan is well-intentioned, the malevolent shards of Voldemort's soul aren't inclined to go quietly into the beyond.\\
And the Keyblade of Heart hasn't forgotten its original, terrible purpose...
