I don't have one on hand where Harry offs himself with the sword. I /do/ however have one where he pulls a Dumbles and has Snape off him instead (Snape-icide?). It's quite the old fic, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Curse of V'Ardian) is both complete and reasonably well written.

I will note that this fic has a number of what are now considered bad tropes that, at the time, were considered quite original. On the bright side, they're written well.

Spoilers below explaining how this story fits the prompt. Harry never manages to actually destroy a Horcrux himself. However, as a Horcrux he is able to call the soulpieces in others to himself, merging them and cleansing the items. This means, of course, that by the final battle's end he has more or less Riddle's entire soul fighting his own for dominance in his body. He anticipates this and asks Snape to hang around the battlefield and green-light him after he kills Riddle. Snape does.
