God, i had the idea of Harry killing himself for some time now, but my second plot direction was having Snape doing it, putting a lot of stress on their already existing relationship as being either extremely controversial (like in canon but even more so) or bordering on Mentor!Snape .I almost started writing a fic about it, i really was seeing it. So thank you very much!
