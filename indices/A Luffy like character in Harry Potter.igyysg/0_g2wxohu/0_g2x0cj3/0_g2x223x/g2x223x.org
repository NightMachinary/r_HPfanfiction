Right i didn't mean for you to focus on that first bit, it was mostly a joke.

It's not a bad thing to have opinions on what makes a good mc or a stories quality. They are your opinions. My point was your original post didn't explain WHAT you were looking for other than Luffy-esque... and the I pointed out that at least you and I seem to have different views on Luffy's character...

So, to clarify, You would love to see an HP fic with an mc that is:

shonen protagonist(unwilling to give up, "goofy")

dense

brutally honest

dangerously adventurous(could you define this?)

Not afraid of anything

Incredibly loyal
