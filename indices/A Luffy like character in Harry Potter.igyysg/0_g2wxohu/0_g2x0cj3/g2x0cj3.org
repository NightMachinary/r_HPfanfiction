You are right. Maybe sometimes I ask for too much in mc's that I get very easily dissapointed. And yes majority of shonen characters are goofy kinds of people.

Ron I believe is the most relatable and human character in hp, he gets jealous easily and wants to outshine others, and I like him a lot. However he is insecure and he maybe dense but he is not like Luffy. Luffy is dense, brutally honest, and the most distinctive thing that separates luffy and ron is that luffy is dangerously adventurous, he is like literally not afraid anything at all. And also Luffy always believes in his friends regardless of the circumstances.

I've read a lot of hp fanfics and many of them are very disappointing, not that I am trying to make fun of the author's hard work. Its just that maybe I am too used to these shonen type MC's. The only fanfic's in hp I truly enjoyed were Umbrus shade and Magical Creatures Will Get Me Killed (Again). If you have any fanfic recommendations with these type of mc's, I would appreciate it very much.
