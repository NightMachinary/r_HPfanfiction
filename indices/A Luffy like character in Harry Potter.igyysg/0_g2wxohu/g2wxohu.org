Incredibly dense and obsessed with food?

Ron.

But seriously, while i don't get whats so great about an idiotic mc(i did follow naruto but much prefer non/semi-canon fanon takes) I'm not sure what you mean by this? Being unwilling to give up on a dream and pulling miracles out of their.. butt is pretty much a shonen protagonist staple... along with being clueless about women, obsessed with something(ramen, being normal, food), etcetera, etcetera , etcetera ....

While i'm not a writer it would probably be a good idea to give potential authors of this fic you'd like written an idea of what you think makes Luffy... Luffy. Otherwise it's possible that someone who takes you up on this will have different views and you'll end up with another "bad" fic(in your opinion at least)
