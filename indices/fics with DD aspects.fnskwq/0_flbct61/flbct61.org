There was a fic like this, Harry Potter and the Natural 20, I think. A wizard from D&D ends up in the Harry Potter universe and works exactly like his class is supposed to work in D&D (memorized spells, cantrips, full body heal after 8 hours of sleep, etc.). The author even had a character sheet and threw dice for his character's actions. Unfortunately, the fic was abandoned after some time (at least when I checked last).
