In one of my stories, Harry has the Horcrux removed (without either party knowing what exactly it was) and then his old wand isn't working for him properly. He then is taken to another wand shop since Olivander's whole "Terrible but great" speech creeped him out and unknowingly ends up with a Gregorowich remake of Lily's wand (due to her protection still being active).
