One theory is that the piece of Voldemort's soul in Harry slightly affected what wand Harry would get; Harry's wand was the twin to Voldemort, so it isn't unreasonable to say that the Phoenix wand choosing Harry was partly because of the Voldemort soul shard. That being said, it's possible/likely that the Phoenix wand would have chosen Harry /anyway./

This theory isn't actually confirmed, just a theory. If we assume that it's true, though, it helps explain why Harry's with different personalities still get the same wand.

Another possibility is that writers still want Priori Incantatem shenanigans to ensue, in which case Harry getting a different wand is a bad idea.

Or it's just laziness/forgetfulness.
