I think I will agree to disagree with this. Neville could have been the Chosen One. Unless the premise goes with the idea that everything prophesied must be set in stone with no wiggle room or alternate interpretation, that it was always going to be Harry versus Voldemort no matter what, then Neville would have been just as valid.

Harry was chosen by Voldemort because he was a halfblood. It was the Rule of Cool that made that decision, unless I'm forgetting another motivation.

Neville was instrumental in fighting Voldemort and his forces. He killed Nagini. He helped lead the DA at Hogwarts in the Trio's absence. He was every bit as valuable as Harry was while living in enemy territory, keeping children safe, and helping the students learn to fight. His tragic family upbringing was also a great alternative version of the 'tragic hero orphan' trope.

I have long felt that if Harry had failed, if he had actually died, then Neville would have been the one to take Voldemort down if the prophecy truly needed to be fulfilled.
