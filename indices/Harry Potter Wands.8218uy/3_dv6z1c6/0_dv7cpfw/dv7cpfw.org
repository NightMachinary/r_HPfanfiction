Actually, this makes me think of something. Neville never got the chance to try what would become Harry's wand. Like Ron, he had a secondhand wand - his father's.

That would make an interesting canon divergence point. Neville could have beaten Harry to the Priori Incantum wand if he had gotten the opportunity to get a wand of his own. He would have had a better suited wand and would likely have been a more confident wizard because his magic was better controlled and more responsive.
