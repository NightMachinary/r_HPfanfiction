I personally see the same wand thing as Fate interfering with the choice, Harry is the only one destined to defeat Tom, yes Neville was close but coming in second still makes you the first loser. Harry and Tom are two sides of the same coin but are still the same coin. Their magics resonate on a far higher plane than just they share a Phoenix tail core. This is why the feathers dropped at the same moment, it's why not everyone who has a Fawkes Phoenix core wand can preform Priori Incantum with Tom or Harry. Fawkes became a different after that moment in time like you aren't the same being you were two days ago, the feelings you experienced between then and now changed things about you, how you deal with anger or happiness or frustration. Fawkes changed since then but in that one second two perfectly twinned Feather fell.
