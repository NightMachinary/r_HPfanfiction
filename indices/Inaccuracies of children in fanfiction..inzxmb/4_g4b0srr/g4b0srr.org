It is very different for each children. Our Annie went to wake us up walking when she was just slightly under one year of age (on the Christmas Day morning, even!). It is really difficult to make broad generalization about babies. I don't think there is any reason to believe small Harry couldn't wake up in the middle of the night and walk (keeping balance by holding on fences, if necessary) through Little Whinging.

Oh sorry, I missed you point. You were saying about running, not walking. Yes, that is a nonsense.
