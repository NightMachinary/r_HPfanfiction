The bludger accident is mostly certainly not accidental magic. That occurs in 6th year, far past the point at which accidental magic happens. No accidental magic is mentioned in that scene. Harry still gets a cracked skull and fall. Incidentally, he survives falling with a cracked skull. Additional evidence is that Newt states muggles have different physiologies and gives Jacob a helmet. Fantastic beasts is written by JKR. A car crash is no threat to a trained wizard.

Would you let a toddler ride a bicycle with no training wheels?

It would hardly be noticeable. The sheer amount of misinformation in this post about child development is staggering, to say the least of the general public who could care less about a random child.

And again, babies do run at 1.5 years old. It is entirely fair to say that a one-year-old can run.
