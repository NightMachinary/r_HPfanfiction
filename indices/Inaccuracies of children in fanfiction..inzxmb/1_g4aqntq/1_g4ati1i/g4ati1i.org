The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) associates crawling on all fours with early onset of independent walking, however independent walking is commonly defined as a minimum of 5 unaided steps. Regionally collected data in Norway shows that by 13 months, only 50% of children /start/ to walk, and by 14 months 75% started.

At 18 months, or 1.5 years, an average child will not likely start running. Children of that age may run with an assistant, either one of those toy cars with no bottom that the child stands inside, or an adults hand. The fanfiction in question of my earlier statement implied that Harry was capable of running on his own. If it were me, I might have said that Harry waddled after Tonks, or something else along the same line of thought. I'm all for an AU where wizards and witches are tougher or more advanced than regular people, but if it isn't shown, I'm going to assume poor research.
