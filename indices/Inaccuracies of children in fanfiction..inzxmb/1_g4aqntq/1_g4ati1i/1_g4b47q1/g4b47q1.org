  I'm all for an AU where wizards and witches are tougher or more advanced than regular people, but if it isn't shown, I'm going to assume poor research.

I mean, the very fact that they showed a baby wizard running around at an abnormally young age should be enough, no? Or do you want them to explicitly state that wizarding children develop quicker than their Muggle counterparts and interrupt the flow of the story to do that?
