That's actually an indication of a fascinating psychological phenomenon. You'll probably learn about it when your psychology class covers infant development. Culture informs the age at which babies develop. For example, a culture that heavily prioritizes child self-sufficiency will start conditioning the baby to walk from a young age. Note that this does not mean that babies in countries that do not have such a focus are not prevented from doing so as a result of a physical reason, they merely do not learn how.

I've detailed elsewhere why it would not be unusual for a wizard baby to walk/run a little earlier. Harry's straight up flying at 1. In any event, they are probably capable of doing so at 1.5 when normal babies have the capability to do so.

I'd also note that although it was probably accurate in this case, citing a single study to contradict the standards used by a very large population, based on data integrated from many studies, is usually not a good idea.
