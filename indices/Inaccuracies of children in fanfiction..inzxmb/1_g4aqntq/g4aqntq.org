The average child can run at 1.5 years old. [[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/pdf/checklists/Checklists-with-Tips_Reader_508.pdf]]

Sure, it may be more of a waddle, but I doubt a fic author using "run" is using the word to describe an olympic sprint.

Also, people generally stop swimming in frigid oceans far before 115. I don't think it's implausible that a baby wizard could run even earlier than 1 because of their physiologies or do so through accidental magic, especially since the age at which children hit developmental milestones varies /greatly/ in the real world.
