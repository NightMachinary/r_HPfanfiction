Ok, I know this is an exception of all exceptions, but a friend of mine has a kid who is now a professional athlete. He was running at a year and a half, according to them. They have videos, too. It's kind of hard to tell his age in the videos, but I'd definitely say he looks under two. It was unsteady and yeah, not clean, but he was definitely running in the video.

Again, I know a professional athlete is not a good measuring stick, but still....
