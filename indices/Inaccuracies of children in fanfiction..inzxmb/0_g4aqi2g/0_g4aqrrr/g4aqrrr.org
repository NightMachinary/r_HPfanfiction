My point is I just read another fanfic where baby harry, at less than 18 months old, was running around a pool after 7 year old Tonks. First off, 7 year old Tonks would be in the pool if she tried to run around it, second, who lets a toddler run around a pool, third, no child at 18 months can run. At all. I am studying child development for a bachelor of Education, and I can say any child that can run at that age is a super sayan
