I'd say that accidental magic would be a very tricky subject to work on, especially considering the understanding that children have. If a child is not capable of properly communicating with others, they get upset. It might be too hot at night, so they want the blanket off, but they want the weight of the blanket, so they cry. How does magic develop? Is it a core that grows with age or is it a skill/muscle that is developed? Now combine them. A child who does not have the cognitive development required to know the consequences of actions and lots of power can do virtually anything with little control. I'm amazed that muggleborn households stay in one piece before Hogwarts.
