I see that you mentioned studying child development for a degree and thought I'd say that helpful tips from your background specialty will always be a helpful resource for other writers! I have the same experience with the areas I'm studying at uni and a lot of the time people are far off the mark when it comes, for example, to legal procedure in a UK context. No crashing of gavels and ‚Äúobjection!!‚Äù would be tolerated in any courts of Britain, even magical ones. The very idea makes me cringe haha.

I'd encourage you to go easy on people messing up in your area of expertise, just because we don't have the same knowledge - in fact, you're in a good position to make a post or two educating us and making us as writers stronger for it. I checked and there isn't a good one that's specific to hpfanfic - I'd love to hear your thoughts on hypothetical development of accidental magic and how that might map onto child development for example üòä that would be so cool.

Lots of fanfic writers are writing on stuff we have no clue about and it can be a baptism by fire. I'm still in the early stages sinking my teeth into writing fanfic and developing confidence, and I'm sure if I didn't see this post I'd have messed up this point. It's a long journey and most people will stumble on stuff like this from time to time.
