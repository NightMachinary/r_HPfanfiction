Does Harry being a dragon for comedy reasons count as an OP Harry?

linkffn(13230340) Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay. Pettigrew gets discovered during second year because of a pair of prankster twins (not the Weasleys!) discovering a rat reading advanced literature. This then leads to Sirius Black being freed.

linkao3(13760487) The Dogfather. 4-chapter fic with Sirius/Remus shipping. The Dursleys, instead of taking Harry in, hand Harry to foster care. Sirius breaks out pretty much immediately after getting put in Azkaban.
