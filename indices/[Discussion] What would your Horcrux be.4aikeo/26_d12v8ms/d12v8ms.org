I'd pop it somewhere thoroughly muggle, maybe in a bank deposit. Seems to me Horcruxes have some sort of aura around them of dark magic, enough that a relatively competent adult magicker would be able to sense they probably had a dark artefact of sorts. Then pop a muggle-repelling charm on it, so that any muggles who happen to rob banks would overlook it and leave it behind.

As for what it'd be, I have no idea. A crucifix would probably be funny in some deep, dark part of my brain, but I probably wouldn't want to blaspheme as well as soul-rip. Maybe I'd take a selfie, and horcrux that haha.
