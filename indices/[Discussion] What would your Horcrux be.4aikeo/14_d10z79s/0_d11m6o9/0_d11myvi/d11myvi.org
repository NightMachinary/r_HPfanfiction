True.

A horcrux is a piece of your soul trapped inside an object. Therefore if I made a horcrux my piece of soul would know that I intend to keep it a secret therefore it would hide it's true nature to the best of it's ability and in the rare chance that it is found the person who finds it, unless they are a truly skilled and knowledgeable wizard would never suspect that the simple stone they are holding would be a horcrux.

I would not be so arrogant and foolish as Riddle, the best way to hide a horcrux would be not to draw attention to itself. ;)
