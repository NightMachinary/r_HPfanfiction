To be fair, that isnt really addressed in cannon, so it is possible (though admittedly unlikely) that dark magic is intrinsically distinct and detectable by relatively common means. However, since people get away with dark magic all the time (like storing not one, but /two/ horcruxes at Hogwarts, one in the /fucking students quarters/ and one in the room that Dumbledore knows about and has visited on occasion, even if not in that particular configuration) then you could probably conceal the dark magic without too much trouble.
