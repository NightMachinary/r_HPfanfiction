A golden snitch, enchanted to be invisible, roaming around the world freely but keeping away from people (including goblins, veela, centaurs etc.) and other living beings (dragons etc.)) and way faster than the original (with charms making it so unbreakable that if say a Volcano would errupt near it it wouldn't be damage or that if it's sucked into a planes enging the plane might be damaged, but the snitch would survive!), this way the thing would be save without needing a guardian or clever traps that scream:

HERE IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT!

ps: Better idea: Cast the FIDELIUS on the snitch (I am my own secret keeper - or do it with a friend if you can't do that, you keep his secret an he keeps yours while the snitches are still tied only to the soul-piece owner (recall enchantment in case you might truly want to die or you have another form of immortality and don't need the horcrux anymore!), so even if the other person knows the secret actually getting hold of the other's snitch is nearly impossible with all the other enchantments on it! Also: Make an Unbreakable-Vow not to try and destroy the other person's snitch and keep their secret :) (so you have the ultimate protection because the secret keeper CAN'T betray the secret because the vow would kill them before they can divulge ANYTHING and they also can't destroy your snitch themselves because, again, the vow would kill them or at least make them into a wraith!)

pps: Should earth be destroyed the snitch would follow you should you make it off world :)
