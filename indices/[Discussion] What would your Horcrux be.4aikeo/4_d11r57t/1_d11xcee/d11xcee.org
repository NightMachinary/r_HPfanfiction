that could be a good idea. making a horcrux into something useful and not appear overtly dark. perhaps something useful and coveted so people would use and protect it for you: even if they find dark magic they might assume it's just a necessary part of the spellwork. things like, a quill that makes you a better writer, or, a devices similar to dumbledores deluminator. i wonder if ravenclaws diadem still had it's original properties.
