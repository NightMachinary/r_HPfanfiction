D&D nerd here, y'all ain't got nothing on the munchkins of 3.5 and pathfinder. The real trick is to make your horcrux (phylactery) into the only thing holding back a greater evil, and then you tell everyone exactly what it is. Now they have the choice of being able to kill me or unleashing a million dementors or something suitably world ending. Bonus points if you are the only one capable of stopping and sealing the evil thing in the first place, so then if they get rid of you they not only unleash crazy evil but get rid of the guy who could take care of it. Now they don't want to kill you. Much better than trusting that the merfolk in the marianas trench don't know how to destroy horcruxes. I win.
