In the HP World? My wand. And I'd have instructions in my will to be buried with my wand (assuming I've got a body still ...) because then boom, resurrection, and I've got a wand already in my hand. But if I'm evil they probably won't follow my will ... ? Plus, since Horcruxes are near indestructible, that means an unbreakable wand so I probably wouldn't die that quickly (unless I'm really terrible at dodging and blocking hexes).

Otherwise ... uh, probably something really mundane, like maybe a fancy emerald ring, then locked up in Swiss bank somewhere.
