Ya. But that weird baby thing wasn't a horcrux. That's his original soul that got forced out of his body when he attacked Harry in 1981. He wanted around as a shade until the created that temporary body he was inhabiting. His horcruxes just stopped his original piece of soul from "passing on." They didn't use any of his horcruxes in the ritual at all so you could technically send your horcrux to space because if u were killed your original soul shade thing would be wandering around in earth still.
