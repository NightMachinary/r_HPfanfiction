Good one, I still like my snitch more though :) as Phoenixes do move around (sure: Killing them is probably impossible, but: Do horcruxes survive a burning day because essentially the phoenix dies, but it's reborn...does the reborn bird still have the horcrux?), they like to eat and to fly :) (not to mention flame-travel!)
