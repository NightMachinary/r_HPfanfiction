Ehh, the only thing we know about the afterlife is that it exists, not that it is better or worse than the current version of reality, wherein you are a powerful wizard here in this reality, so wanting to make a horcurx is entirely sensible. Additionally, you only need to murder someone in order to split your soul, there's nothing saying you cant murder a death row inmate at a prison, or an eighty year old with cancer.

It isnt explicit in cannon that horcrux making leads to insanity though is it (or that making more than a certain number does)? Is their a WoG on this?
