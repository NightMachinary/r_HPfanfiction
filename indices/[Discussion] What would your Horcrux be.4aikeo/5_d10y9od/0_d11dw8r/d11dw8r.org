I think the process of turning an object into a horcux is both dependent on the object being solid (you cant transfigure objects into gasses or liquids for instance) and makes it nearly indestructible, like if you turned a soap bubble into a horcrux it would be the most resilient soap bubble in history. So the bowl of water would probably target the bowl, and the dry ice would never melt (remember that snakes and gold are molten under certain conditions too, their is no privileged reference frame for standard temperature and pressure as it exists on earth).
