Thats a good idea, but not at all impossible to [[http://qntm.org/destroy][do]]

also, the ritual for horcrux generation presumably requires a relatively small object so that you can put a ritual/rune circle around it, building one of those large enough to encompass the earth might be counterproductive. You could probably turn a modest sized cometary body into one though, hard to get to and hard to destroy. (though its possible that any damage significant enough to mark a horcrux is enough to destroy it since they are nearly invulnerable to begin with; the soul might be tied to the /concept/ of the object as a singular entity rather than merely housed inside its physical structure so any modification of the object vis a vis damage could destabilize or destroy your soul anchor)
