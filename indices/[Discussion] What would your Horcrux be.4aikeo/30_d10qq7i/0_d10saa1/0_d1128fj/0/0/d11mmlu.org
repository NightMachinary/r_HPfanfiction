A horcrux has as it's primary purpose the permanent affixation of your soul to the material plane. It is implied that voldie thought it would actually make him literally immortal, like immune to the killing curse and age immortal, but mostly it just prevents you from becoming an actual ghost (which is fixed in location, as opposed to a wraith like voldie became) and from entering the afterlife. It does seem like it would be easier to be revived if someone has easy access to your horcrux (though that is obviously a security risk) but you are immortal and at least somewhat motile so who cares if it takes you a century or two to find a willing victim to posses? Bonus: taking a century or two to revive means all your old enemies are dead and no one is around to stop your rise to power!
