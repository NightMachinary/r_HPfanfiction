  It does seem like it would be easier to be revived if someone has easy access to your horcrux

Only, it doesn't revive /you/, it revives a separate piece of your soul, which is not a completely "developed" "you" - like Diary!Riddle didn't have the skills nor the knowledge and memories of the original Voldemort past age 16. And I don't think Voldemort would like it very much if his 16 year old self is alive while the original is piggybacking rats in Albania. /He/ wants to be alive, not just have a copy of him alive.
