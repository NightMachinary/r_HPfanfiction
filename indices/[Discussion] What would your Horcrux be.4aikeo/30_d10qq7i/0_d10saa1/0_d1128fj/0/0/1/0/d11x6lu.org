i think in an interview she said tom riddles wouldn't have been revived but it would have made voldemort stronger. i don't remember her saying specifically how, but she implied that the diary tom wouldn't have become alive and started on his own.

as for the rest, above, you're probably right, the language used seems a bit confusing.
