i don't know if voldemort was normal, something went wrong when he died. a horcrux is suppose to hide a piece of your soul, not anchor you in a ghost like state. i imagine normally you'd have to have someone with access to it so they could resurrect you. toms diary was probably the only successful one. i guess his body was killed but the soul inside him wasn't.

i always wondered if the somewhat sane tom in the beginning hid his horcrux in important places for a real reason. i'd probably steal a statue from a museum, something nice. hide it in some kind of underground maze full of infiri and traps and enchanted muggle gun spider type shit. with the entrance to some old castle broom cupboard.
