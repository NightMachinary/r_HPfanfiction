Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) is completed with a sequel. Unfortunately, said sequel has been on and off hiatus for a while now, and even when the author's actively writing it, it doesn't exactly come out at a blistering pace. That said, I won't be satisfied until literally everybody has read this fic, and I'm never gonna miss a chance to recommend it.
