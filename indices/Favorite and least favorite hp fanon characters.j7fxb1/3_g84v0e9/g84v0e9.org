I've read a few fanfics that really fleshed out the teachers that i have really enjoyed. With lives and backstories that operate outside of the students and Harry. If well done its fun to read about their interpersonal relationships and how they interact in the teachers lounge. One fanfic i read took the time to give Charity Burbage a backstory and personality. I enjoy a perspective that paints them as more than the 2D view we get from just Harrys perspective.
