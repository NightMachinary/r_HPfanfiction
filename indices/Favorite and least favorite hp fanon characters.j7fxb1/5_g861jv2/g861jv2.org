"Daphne Greengrass (not the Ice Queen clich√©). There's still more you can do with Daphne even in 2020 onwards."

I wish more people would come up with different things with Daphne. Like the way people sometimes write Tracy Davis. Bubbly, outgoing and all that jazz. Just make it Daphne instead. Super short girl, bubbly, a Hufflepuff in Slytherin, short dirty blonde hair with brown eyes.

Edit: I don't know why I can't get the quote thing to work. So, I'll just do quotation marks lol
