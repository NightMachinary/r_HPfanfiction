I like needs-a-hug Draco, strong/confident Harry (not an asshole), nice/polite Remus (didn't really come as such in canon although he was still polite. fanfics make him uber polite and I like that.

from the other kind, I like Justin. he is really rare in fanfics as well. and I only like him if he is a nice hufflepuff in it. cause sometimes he is an ass.

Aberforth as well. very rare.

from Slytherin Blaise.
