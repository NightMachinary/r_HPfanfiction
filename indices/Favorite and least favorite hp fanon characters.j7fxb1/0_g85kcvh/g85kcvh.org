I like fleshed out fanon Pansy who's undeniably selfish and bitchy, but not evil. I would say I like her as a mix of Ginny and fanon Daphne. More relaxed and less proper than Daphne, but more high-class, expensive and choosy than Ginny.

Fanon Theo when he's this quiet, smart student that keeps to himself. But also when he's not overdone on being super tolerant and hating pureblood rhetoric.

Regulus when he's more polite, proper, classy and tempered version of Sirius. I like when Sirius and Regulus are written as more similar than either would like to admit with Sirius being more brash and openly rebellious, while Regulus is more private in that sense and adheres to social expectations, while keeping his critical thinking to himself.

I like fanon Patil twins when they're more than two dumb bimbos. My favorite fanon interpretation of them so far is both of them being Mind Healers.

And as far as canon characters with clear canon characterization go... I'm ok with almost anything as long as it a progressive well-written change and not abrupt â€˜personality AU'.
