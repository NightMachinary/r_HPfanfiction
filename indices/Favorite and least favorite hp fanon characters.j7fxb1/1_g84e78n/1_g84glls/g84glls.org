  Daphne Greengrass (not the Ice Queen clich√©). There's still more you can do with Daphne even in 2020 onwards.

I actually have an idea for a different take on Daphne Greengrass that may or may not borrow elements from the backstory of Asuka Langley Soryu, with the goal of setting her up as the primary rival for Harry Potter, possibly with Daphne viewing Harry in a similar manner that Asuka viewed Shinji.
