Was it Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by Temporal Knight?

I know the story you're talking about, I read it on FF though. The future Harry/construct thing talks about using the rune tattoos to anchor his soul to his body, making him immune to the terrible shit? He ranted about Hermione being the last of his friends that stayed with him, but then even she had to go or something? And the construct wanted to use the runes to take over Harry and switch places?

I can't say for sure if it's Rune Stone Path
