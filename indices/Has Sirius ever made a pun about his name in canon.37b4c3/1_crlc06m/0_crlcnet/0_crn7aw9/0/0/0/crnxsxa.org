Not sure, to be honest. There is a provision for using magic in front of muggles in life threatening situations, which I feel like excuses lifting up the police car. I don't think the motorcycle would qualify, but at that point the policemen already seen the Death Eaters fly in on broomsticks. So the cat's already out of the bag.

However, the magical world does not seem to view witnessing evidence of magical activity/objects as harshly as it does performing actual magic in front of or on a muggle.

I'm also not positive that the expectation is that the perpetrator will be the one to perform the obliviate. The Ministry does seem to have a way to detect magic performed around muggles, and they have trained Oblivators. I doubt everyone knows how to perform the obliviate, and you could do quite a lot of damage if you do it wrong.

So obliviating at the scene might be common for wizards, but I'm not sure its Ministry-recommended.
