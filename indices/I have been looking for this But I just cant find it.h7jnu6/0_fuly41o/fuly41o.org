Dragons, Snakes, and Secrets Demondog136, EllianaNarna Summary: Harry Potter thought his fourth year was going to be peaceful, where he wouldn't have to worry about anything (except the Dark Lord out for his blood, as per bloody usual). The Tri-Wizard tournament was here at Hogwarts and he was not old enough to take place. How wrong could he turn out to be? When his name is called from the goblet, a plethora of changes and secrets are on their way. How can Harry defeat dragons and handle deceiving headmasters, while also learning things about the past that will change not just his life, but the fate of the Wizarding World?
