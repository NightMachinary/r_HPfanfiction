One thing I don't see brought up often enough is the idea of having classes 7 days a week.

- Even today, 7-day a week boarding schools aren't unheard of, especially for more traditional boarding schools.

- The idea of having off on weekends is a relatively new concept, especially compared to a culture that separated themselves hundreds of years ago.

- Things fall in line much easier if the core teachers have 7 days a week to teach 7 year groups

- Light weekends can still be a thing (hogsmeade / quidditch weekends) because the prerequisites for newts can easily cut the number of students needed to be taught for two year groups in half. Also, first and second years don't have electives.

Overall it's not perfect, due to other reasons mentioned in this thread, but it does certainly relieve the pressure.
