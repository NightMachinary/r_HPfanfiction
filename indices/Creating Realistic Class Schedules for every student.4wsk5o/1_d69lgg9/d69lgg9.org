[[/u/yarglethatblargle]] is right -- with the canon teachers (1 per subject) and the class forms posited in canon (divided by house in most subjects) it's literally impossible to create a working, school-wide timetable. I've tried. The best I could come up with was a schedule wherein each year group was all in the same class (i.e. all the 1st years together, 2nd years together, etc), but that's implausible because the class sizes would be too large, especially if you're making a larger student population.

That said, I was making timetables because I was trying to figure out a practical working Hogwarts for an essay I was writing, and I did make one working timetable, but it's based on a two-week schedule, has Saturday morning classes, and includes 4 non-magical subjects. It was a while ago, but assuming I'm remembering my methodology correctly, it keeps only the canon teachers and while it works in theory, it'd be shit in practice because the core subject teachers (transfig, potions, charms, etc) get no free periods, so they'd be worked off their feet and stuck up all night marking homework and preparing for classes.

So at the very least you're going to need some OC teachers (doubly so when you've got a larger population), you might want to consider Saturday morning classes, and give some thought to the idea of a two-week schedule. (That is, one schedule for week one, another for week two, then the third week you use schedule 1 again, and so on.) I personally built mine on Excel, but you could do a search for timetable building software/websites. I tried, but I couldn't get the hang of any of them.

You won't need to make individual timetables for each student, just each class group. I split each year group into two, except 6th/7th years because NEWT classes are generally smaller, so while half the first years were doing one lot of classes, the other half were doing a different lot. Therefore you only need to make a timetable for each class group and then decide who's in which group. From there, just decide which teacher takes which class, and if you've got more than one teacher per subject then you can have two class groups taking the same class at the same time. (Which is par for the course in the real world, even if JKR seemed to ignore the fact.)
