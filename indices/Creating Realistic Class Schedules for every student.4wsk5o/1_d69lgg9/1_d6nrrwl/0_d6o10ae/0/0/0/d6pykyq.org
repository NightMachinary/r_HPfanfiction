Well, we have evidence in canon of at least 2 of the core classes divided with 2 houses in each. We have no solid evidence of any of the core classes being different than the ones we do know about. I'll interpret that to mean that the ones not specified follow the pattern of the ones specified. You can interpret it to mean no mention equals they don't share, if you wish.

Somehow, I doubt JK Rowling took the time to write out the course schedules, even for the one book where it matters at all, Prisoner of Azkaban.
