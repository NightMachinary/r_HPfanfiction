Canon didn't have two houses in Yrs 1-5 classes for Transfiguration, Charms, History, Defence, Astronomy, or Divination. From what we saw, the Gryffindors were all alone in those lessons, unless you make the argument that the second houses were simply never mentioned, which is possible but not guaranteed. The only ones that are confirmed as shared are Potions (Gryffindor/Slytherin), Herbology (Gryffindor/Hufflepuff), Magical Creatures (Gryffindor/Slytherin), and Muggles Studies (Gryffindor/Hufflepuff). We don't have information on Arithmancy and Runes, so no idea if they're shared or not.
