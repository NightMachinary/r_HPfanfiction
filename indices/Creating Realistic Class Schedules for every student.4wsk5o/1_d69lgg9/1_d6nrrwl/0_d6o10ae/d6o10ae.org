Like [[/u/jfinner1]], you mixed houses on ALL classes. It makes sense, but it's not canon (where only Potions, Herbology, Magical Creatures, and Muggle Studies were mixed, for years 1-5 [although there's the possibility for Arithmancy and Ancient Runes as well]). When I said impossible, I meant under the conditions imposed by canon. But your timetables are good and thanks for sharing!
