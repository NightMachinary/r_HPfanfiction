I was running on the expectation that classes would probably actually end and start five minutes before/after the indicated time, giving 10 minutes to get between classes. Ten minutes might be pushing it, especially if you get caught by a moving staircase and/or are going dungeon-to-tower, but 5pm seems like a late time to finish classes, at least by my experience and understanding of UK schools. I know I was always done with it by 4pm and glad for a 3pm finish instead once I hit sixth form.
