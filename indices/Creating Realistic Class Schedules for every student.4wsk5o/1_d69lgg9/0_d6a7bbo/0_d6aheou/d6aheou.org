08:45-16:00, six periods at 1 hour each, plus one night a week for Astronomy (classes at midnight, according to the first book, and no indication of daytime classroom-based lessons), based on what I recall of my own school days:

In the "whole year in a single class group" timetable I managed, it was a Mon-Fri, one-week schedule, and 3rd-5th years could feasibly take up to four out of the five optional classes without the need of a time turner; if you were only taking two or three, you'd have free periods during the times of the other classes. 1st/2nd years don't actually have any free periods, while 6th/7th years obviously get free periods based on their subject choices. Core subject teachers are teaching for 25/30 periods a week; optional subject teachers are teaching 15/30 periods a week.
