I think, in its most simplified form, it is possible. But, it would have to be in an ordered fashion, rather than the chaotic jumbled mess of randomness. First, there's a few things we have to figure out, such as how long is a class? I'm pretty sure it's never explicitly said in canon, but it would have to be long enough to make it worth wandering all around the castle, and to make up for the fact that they don't have the same classes every single day.

That being said, some liberties have to be taken. But, we have to start with known information. There are a set of core classes: History, Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology, DADA, with astronomy happening after dinner. Then there are electives, and the optional newt classes. So, six main classes.

Then, we have to figure out how many classes a teacher has to teach. Years 1 through 5 are split in half, so you have Ravenclaws and Slytherins for one classes, and then the other two for the other half. That's ten classes, plus two more combined classes for the 6th and 7th years, so twelve classes total. IIRC, elective classes were also split up (I think Care was just slytherins plus gryffindors for example? might be wrong).

So, we can make it so group A has classes on monday and wednesday, and group B has classes on tuesday and thursday. But then you ask yourself, how do you fit seven years int six classes?

Mondays: years 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A Tuesdays: years 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 7A Wednesdays years 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A Thursday: years 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 7A

So, that's fine and all. But it all depends on how long the classes are. I think it's easiest to assume that classes are in hour long blocks, with some of that time used to travel between classes.

lets assume breakfast is from 7-7:45. that leaves 4 blocks of 1 hour each until noon. Perhaps lunch is at 1, leaving an hour in between. So, classes begin at 2:30, and go to 6:30, and then dinner some time after that. That leaves 8 classes during the day (perhaps it could even be 3 classes before lunch, 5 classes after). That makes it so someone like Snape has 6 classes taught, and 2 free periods, and then whatever after dinner. This also leaves slots for electives for the students, but trying to fit in each elective year with each core class is a puzzle in of itself, like a rotating tier or classes. I think it works, but I don't want to map it out.

That just leaves the double classes, which I would assign to Friday. For twelve different classes, a teacher would need to have three double classes a week, which would make it so each class would have one double period a year.

Of course, this leaves almost no time to grade papers, have quidditch practice, manage detentions, time for students to do homework, etc, except on the weekend.

Yeah, it's fucked.
