For the student-teacher ratio, it depends on what you mean by 'good'. Students tend to work best in small groups at 5:1 or so. Teachers can usually handle 20:1 effectively. Muggle highschools range from 20:1 to 30:1. Magical schools are probably more chaotic and difficult to manage than muggle ones, though (accidents, dangers, chaos etc.) so I'd try to avoid large classes.

What is a /plausible/ teacher-student ratio? It depends what kind of school you want Hogwarts to be. If it's the single most prestigious school in Britain for the high society, they'd try to maintain 20:1 or less. If it's the beleaguered public school handling the load of all Britain, they probably can't manage better than 25:1, maybe up to 35:1.
