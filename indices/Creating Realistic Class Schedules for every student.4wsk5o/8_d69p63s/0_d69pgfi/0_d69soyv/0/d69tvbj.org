I was curious how you managed this, but I see you mixed houses on all classes, not just those that it shows in canon, which does make more sense. JKR only did it when she wanted to create tension, which is fine from a literary standpoint but not so much from a practical one. (And might also suggest she doesn't think the Ravenclaws are any good at creating tension (with the Gryffindors), but maybe they're just too clever to get caught up in that kind of rubbish.)
