Yes, mostly I was going with appropriate class sizes. It seemed silly to have a class with only 10 students, so two houses in each class made more sense to me. Also, Harry lives in such a bubble, he doesn't really talk about who he has classes with, unless it's another Gryff, or Malfoy, lol. So maybe they did have Herbology with the Hufflepuffs, and he just never interacted with them.
