Realistically, you would need ~1500 teachers to teach a population like that. Hogwarts would be bigger than most colleges. You would need to work backwards and explain where the other 400+ Gryffindor boys have been hiding all of this time.

Here's the math:

| Statistic                                                  | Venti   | Grande | Tall |
|------------------------------------------------------------+---------+--------+------|
| Total Population                                           | 400,000 | 20,000 | 4100 |
| Population under 18 (assuming about 18% of the population) | 70,000  | 3,500  | 740  |
| Hogwarts Age Population (38% of the under 18 population)   | 25,000  | 1300   | 280  |
| Students in Gryffindor                                     | 6250    | 340    | 70   |
| Male Gryffindors in Harry's Year                           | 446     | 48     | 5    |
| Teachers Required (assuming a 15:1 ratio)                  | 1700    | 87     | 19   |

But if we move the decimal on your original number and cut that number in half, then we have a population of 20k. This gives us 1.3k students at Hogwarts, with 48 students per year/house/gender. If we take Harry's year as the norm, then Hogwarts has about 280 students, with 5 students per year/house/gender. This number is obviously even more managable, though might be too small for your needs.

If we assume that all class schedules are doubled up (which they're not) then the canon schedule just /barely/ works (though the teachers would be incredibly overworked).

The best way I've found to make it work is:

1. Assume all classes are doubled up (even though we know they're not)

2. Assume 7 class periods per day, with 35 in a given week.

3. Assume that years 1-2 have each of their 7 core classes 4x a week each. Two of these are stand-alone lessons, the other is a double-length lesson. This gives them 28 classes and 7 free periods per week.

4. Assume that years 3-5 have each of their 7 core classes 4x a week each, plus ~2 electives 3x a week each. This gives them 34 classes per week.

5. Assume that years 6-7 attend their chosen classes 4x a week with all other students in the year taking the same subject, regardless of house. A student taking 7 N.E.W.T.s would have 28 classes per week, while a student taking 3 N.E.W.T.s would only have 12.

For reference, classes start at nine and end shortly before 5, and include a morning break. A schedule might look something like:

9:00-9:50 1st class

10:00-10:50 2nd class

10:50-11:10 Morning Break

11:20-12:10 3rd class

12:20-1:10 4th class

1:10-2:00 Lunch

2:00-2:50 5th class

3:00-3:50 6th class

4:00-4:50 7th class
