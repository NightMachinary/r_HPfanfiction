Take a normal school schedule. 8-9 9:05-10 10:05-11 and so on, mon-fri. You've now got a 40 square schedule. That's forty hours to fill. Then take all the courses they have on the harry potter wikia for classes. Then take Hermione's 3rd year schedule where she's taking all classes and shoehorn them into that schedule(I did mine when I did this with core classes mon/wed/fri and electives tue/thur). It doesn't work. Oh, sure, for one student it does but when you have seven years of students and only one teacher for each class, it's impossible, even if the staff are using time-turners like crazy.
