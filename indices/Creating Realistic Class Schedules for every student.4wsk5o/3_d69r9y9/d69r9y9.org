If Hogwarts gives Time Turners to /students/ because they can't fit their work into their schedules, why in the name of all things wrinkly would the /teachers/ not get one.

Use a time turner as a plot device to make your story more interesting and unique. No need to make it a /central/ plot device, just meld it into the worldbuilding.

Makes sense to me.
