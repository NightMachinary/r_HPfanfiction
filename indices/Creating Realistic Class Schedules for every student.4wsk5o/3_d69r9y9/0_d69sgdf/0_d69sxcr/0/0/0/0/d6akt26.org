Considering the OP is quadrupling the Wizarding population(At least as my memory recalls, it is in Canon estimated to be 100K), therefore each House in each year will have around 40 students. As said in another topic, a good Student to teacher ratio is about 20:1. So, yeah they'll need a few extra teachers in the Core subjects. Even if they were to do it by each house in each year. They'll by that standard need at least two teachers.

The Elective teachers may not deal with as many students. But they explain and deal with a lot more advanced material, at least in most cases.

Also, Pomfrey is the healer, who you're most likely thinking of is Sprout. Though, that said. I do not doubt that the increase in Student population will mean that Hogwarts needs another Healer or two.
