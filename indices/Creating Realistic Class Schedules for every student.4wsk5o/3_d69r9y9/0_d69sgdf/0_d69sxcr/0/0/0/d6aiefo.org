You wouldn't need that much, to be honest, just a second teacher for each of the core subjects. They only need to lighten the load a bit for McGonagall, Flitwick, Snape, Sprout, and Binns.* If anything, from my adventures in class scheduling, the optional class teachers are a little underworked. You could always run the idea that those teachers actually take some of the core subjects as a secondary class, perhaps teaching theory classes instead of practical, or just teaching the lowers years (given the expectation that they're not as skilled in the subject as the primary teacher).

*I know Astronomy is a core subject, but canon implies they only have one class a week, at midnight, so Prof. Sinistra is even more underworked than the optional subject teachers.
