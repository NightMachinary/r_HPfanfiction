I was just offering a solution to this particular dilemma. But yeah, I think separating the teachers between First- Second year. Third-Fourth yeard. Fifth year. And Newt. Should be possible, and not all that unreasonable. Maybe too over the top, but I don't know. Maybe even just have it be teachers for each house/Class group instead.
