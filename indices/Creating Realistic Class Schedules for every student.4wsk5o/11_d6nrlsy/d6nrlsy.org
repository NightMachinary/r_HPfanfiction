I made two versions of the schedules for each teacher for the core classes, not for any electives. The versions were dependent on whether 6th and 7th years have non-NEWT basic classes available. Canon would point to no basic classes, but either is usable. I sourced any reference to the day of the week for a class in books 1-5, iirc. My main resource was the HP-Lexicon.
