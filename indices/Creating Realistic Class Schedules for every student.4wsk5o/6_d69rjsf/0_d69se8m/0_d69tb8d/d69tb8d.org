I did the math a while back, and if you base the wizarding population of the UK On a 40 students per year system, it works out to about 6k wizards/witches in the UK. So if you want to increase the population, you should work with that ratio. Also, if you look at the movie, the great hall actually holds about 250 students, which is a fairly accurate visual representation of the school size. (Yes, I sat there and paused and counted...)
