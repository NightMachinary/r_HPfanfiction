To estimate the number of wizards & witches in student age, take a look at the UK population pyramid for 1991 ([[https://populationpyramid.net/united-kingdom/1991/][link]]).

According to this, in 1991, 5.9% of the UK population was in the 10-14 age bracket, while 6.5% was in the 15-19 age bracket. Given that the typical Hogwarts student attends from ages 11-17, break this into 11-14 and 15-17 groups and take a proportional share.

- 11-14 = 4/5 * 10-14 value = .80 * 5.9% = 4.72%

- 15-17 = 3/5 * 15-19 value = .60 * 6.5% = 3.90%

So, we can guesstimate that in 1991, 8.62% (4.72+3.90) of the UK's population was in the 11-17 age range. The UK wizarding population is largely drawn from the UK non-magical population, so the percent of all wizards in the 11-17 age range should track the non-magical value /but/ because wizards have a longer lifespan and (anecdotally) seem to have a lower birthrate, the value for wizards should be lower than that of non-magical people. As a guesstimate, I will say that the value for wizards will be 3/4 that of the normal rate, or 6.465% in the 11-17 age range.

I have no clue how to adjust the population pyramid to account for the effects of the first Voldemort war, so I will leave as is with the 6.465% figure.

For a population of 400,000 this suggests 25,860 students in the 11-17 age range.

Based on the estimates I've frequently seen of roughly 40 students per year, 280 students total, a wizarding population of 400k would imply a student body 92 times as large as what canon Hogwarts appears to include.

So, either you'll need to account for several other schools in wizarding Britain to account for this size increase, or you'll need a Hogwarts with 92 times the space, 92 times the faculty, 92 times the staff, 92 times the resources, etc. plus likely 92 times the space on the Hogwarts Express.

That's one hell of a lot of OCs, or one hell of a lot of unnamed and unmentioned characters.

IRL there are lots of universities that have 25k or more students, but they're all massive in terms of space, buildings, faculty, staff, and general resources. I don't think many of them even have close to all of their students living on campus.
