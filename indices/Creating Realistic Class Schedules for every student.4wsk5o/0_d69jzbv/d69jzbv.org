The problem isn't the schedule for the students, it's for the professors. There is not enough time in a week for them to teach all their courses. The way it is with Canon teachers up until the NEWT years is: each of the five years has two groups (outside of electives and NEWT courses, two houses in a classroom), each has multiple lessons per week (at least two, though Astronomy might only have one). Some classtimes are two periods long, in the same week as a one period long time for the same course. At best, that's 10 hours a week for each teacher (assumes a period is 1 hour, and two normal periods a week per class). Assuming one single period and one double, that's 15 hours a week. I seem to recall some times where Harry had double potions twice in a single week. That'd be 20 hours a week. Add in NEWT courses, the need to grade all the homework (*all* essay work), any tests/quizzes/exams, staff meetings, the need to oversee detentions, and the possibility for teaching one class three times a week, things just don't make sense.
