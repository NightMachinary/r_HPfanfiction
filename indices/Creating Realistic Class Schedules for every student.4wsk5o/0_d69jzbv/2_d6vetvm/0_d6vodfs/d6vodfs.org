I think my numbers are low by a factor of two. Weird, that's not usually the kind of math mistake I make.

I was thinking: 2 groups per year * 5 years * 2 one hour periods a week = at best 20 hours, minus NEWTs. Adding in 1 NEWT group a year * 2 years of NEWTs * 2 one hour periods a week would give at best 24 hours. But like we've both said, the issue seems to be when a teacher has more than 2 hours a week for a particular class (such as 1st year Ravenclaw/Slytherin History of Magic) that things really begin to break down.

But the big thing is that most classes end with essay work given out. That's a lot of fucking essays, especially with how long they start getting in 5th year plus. I don't know about you, but I've spent time throughout my education grading lab reports (many journal article form [abstract, experimentation, results and conclusions, etc.]) and worksheet form (which is almost worse because of the need to see if math errors carried through or not)^{1,} grading takes forever, and I only ever really had to deal with class sizes of about 70 at most. I can't imagine what it must be like for for the core Professors of Hogwarts with about 5 years worth of classes 40ish in size at once.

Add in the fact that they are the disciplinarians, security officers, partially counselors (Heads of Houses, etc.) is when it /really/ really becomes hell.
