20 hours a week of teaching isn't unreasonable, if we assume there are 5 periods a day, then they would teach 4 periods and have 1 free each day. If there are 6 or 7 periods per day, then its even more reasonable with 2-3 frees per day. This would be comparable to a high school teacher hours wise, though they obviously teach fewer classes for more hours each.

Your numbers are a bit off though, as the classes are only half the year since only 2 houses appear to be in each one below newt level.

so 5 years x 2 classes per year plus 2 years with 1 (newt seemed to be all 4 houses combined) makes 12 different classes(sets of kids not individual lectures). At 2 hours per class that's 22 periods worth if there are only 2 hours per class per week.

However if you assume there is more than 2 hours of class, such as if there are 2 double potions per week, for each subject then it stops working. 2 hours does seem a bit low. 7 periods per day would be 35 periods per week, at 3 hours per class and 12 classes that's 36 so it already doesn't work.
