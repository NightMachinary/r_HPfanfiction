No you're not. I dislike Hermione a great deal for her personality and the way some people maker her out to be some kind of Godess but she is talented without a doubt. In potions she's the second best (6^{th} year) in the class, maybe tied with Malfoy but second. Slughorn is ready to hand over the liquid luck to her before he sees Harry's potion. With regards to the defense. I know she lost to the Boggart in third year and didn't complete the DADA practical at the end of the year. She also went down reasonably early in the Department of Mysteries. Neville, Harry and I think Luna were the last ones standing. I can't remember off the top of my head if she got an O or an EE on her OWLs for Defense but its wrong to say that she's weak as much as I dislike her.
