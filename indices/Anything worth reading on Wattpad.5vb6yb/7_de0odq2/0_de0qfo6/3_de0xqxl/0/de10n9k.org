One one side you could argue that some scribbles in a book is not the safest thing to abide by. Given that a simple Boil Healing Salve can become a extremely volatile concoction that can melt pewter just because some ingredient was added the wrong way, Harrys casual use of the Prince's notes was downright asking for disaster. It was just dumb luck that the Prince turned out to become a Potion Master and was a prodigy.

On the other side, it is no surprise that Hermione hold books and their content in highest regard. Being trumped by scribbles on the side of a book - a desecration in and of itself - probably caused some logic in her brain to just have a meltdown.
