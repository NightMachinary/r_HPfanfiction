Going straight to murder sounds over the top. Original Tom only started murdering in fifth year, after all. I bet there's all sorts they could try before murdering anyone.

On the other hand, Tom was "making people do what he wanted" before Hogwarts, so his advice for a first year might be more like, "do accidental magic", which isn't helpful.

I read a fic where Pansy comes across Luna with no shoes and gets frustrated with her for being so passive about it, so teaches her to hex the shoes to bite anyone trying to steal them. Maybe Ginny could do that sort of thing?
