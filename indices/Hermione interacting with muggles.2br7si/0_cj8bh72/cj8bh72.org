  I kind of think she would have continued to be the unpopular smart girl, gone to a good university, gotten married late in life to some tweedy intellectual, stayed on the straight and narrow, and generally had the most dull and uninteresting life ever.

I highly disagree. A person's character isn't tied to whether or not they have magic.

Hermione is an activist who uses her brain to make the world better for everyone and who isn't afraid to get her hands dirty and tackle controversial topics. deep down she is a Gryffindor and not a Ravenclaw.

Even a muggle Hermione wouldn't just get married to some tweety intellectual without passion.
