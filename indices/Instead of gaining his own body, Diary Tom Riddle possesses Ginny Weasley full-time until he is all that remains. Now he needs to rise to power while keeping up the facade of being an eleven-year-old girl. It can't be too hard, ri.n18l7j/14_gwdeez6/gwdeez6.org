[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13680116/1/White-Knight-Grey-Queen][White Knight Grey Queen]] has a memory of the Diary Horcrux within Ginny's mind try to take control a few years after the original Diary was destroyed (last chapter), thanks to her getting a huge infusion of magic that wakes it up. Since Harry and Pansy (basically the author used Pansy and Daphne where Haphne trope fics use Daphne and Tracey) help her fight and destroy it I'll grant it might not really fit but still worth an honorable mention methinks.
