THANK YOU SIR!!!! This looks so good so far!

Edit: Tom is so bad at pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl this is all I ever wanted.

/“Ginny!”/

/Tom's head wrenched at the angry interjection. Across the table from him was none other than Ronald Weasley, Potter's pasty sidekick. He was frowning quite heavily./

/“I've said your name at least six bloody times! What's up with you?”/

/...Ah. In Tom's defence, he wasn't trained like a common dog to respond to such a plebeian name as Ginny. The girl had such a unique, powerful name- yet instead, she had screwed Tom over with her terrible choice in pet names for herself./

/“Ginevra, if you would. And what seems to be amiss with you, dearest brother?”/
