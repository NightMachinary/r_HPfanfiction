There was a crack fic about Ginnymort that was sadly deleted a while back. I found it on the WayBack Machine though!

*The Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort* by Respitini

Dedicated to my friends in the Teachers' Lounge. Lord Voldemort's attempt to possess the soul of Ginny Weasley was successful, but his triumph was not without consequence. Find out how our favorite arch-villain deals with the pitfalls and pratfalls, the laughter, loss and love of a teenage girl's life at Hogwarts.
