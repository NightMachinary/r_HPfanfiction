Thanks!! I do not know how it happens, but in my dream-fic Tom and Luna become pals. If she says "Oh by the way Ginny is secretly a soul-vessel for you-know-who!" most would just place that thought along with her other strange claims and ignore it.

Tom/Ginny still carries SO much resentment and fear of dumbledore, sometimes convinced he knows the truth. (Albus does not!...or does he???)
