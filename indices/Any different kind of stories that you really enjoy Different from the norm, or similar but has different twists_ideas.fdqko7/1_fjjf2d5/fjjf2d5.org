Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is always a good recommendation for something different - it's a traditional hero's journey story (as opposed to canon which eventually turns into a Christ allegory) and was written between GoF and OotP, so it takes the HP culture, world, and system of magic in a very different direction from canon. Unfinished, but it has a very strong Act 2 ending in the last couple chapters.

Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels do a TON of world-building beyond canon, especially in regards to the magic system. I knew nothing about the Alanna the Lioness universe prior to reading it, so don't let that be a deterrent.
