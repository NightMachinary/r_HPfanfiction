linkao3(19381933) for a Tom obsessed Ginny, it has got a lot of Weasleycide. Pity that it got over.

linkao3(21309898) After the Battle of Department of Mysteries, Ginny ends up in the Wool's Orphanage as a 6 year old. Ginny and Tom fluff.

linkao3(12360399) Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy have to deal with a teenaged Lord Voldemort that came out of the Diary. It's quite humorous.
