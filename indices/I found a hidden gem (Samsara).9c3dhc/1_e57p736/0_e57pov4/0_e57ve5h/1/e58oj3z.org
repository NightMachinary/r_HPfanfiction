I agree completely, what you write really does hugely affect the amount of favourites/follows one can receive.

I've seen plenty of stories that are just an absolute hodgepodge of plot ideas, weirdly tacked on harem romance, and top level edge-lord writing that easily breach the 5000F mark. It's a matter of balancing what you want to write versus what others want to read, and know that if you want to write something more niche that you'll most likely receive less attention than something more common.
