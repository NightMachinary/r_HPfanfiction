It's all about exposure. Updates on Weekends (especially Saturday evening) get you far more views than if you publish the same chapter on a Wednesday morning. If you pair Harry with a background character you don't get much attention. I openly admit that "Call Me" is a better fic than my own "No longer alone". Both have Harry/Lisa Turpin as pairing, but since I had included Andromeda and Nymphadora Tonks in the tags I got far more attention.

If you have an interesting premise, avoid the common pitfalls, have somewhat decent language skills (and promote it here as well), getting that amount of attention isn't particularly difficult. Regular updates go a long way in that regard.
