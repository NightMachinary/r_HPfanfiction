I get at least a thousand views more if I update on weekends (spread out over the following days). Apparently we've made very different observations when it comes to getting attention. And while I admit that I'm staying away from common plots and tropes as much as possible, I'm nowhere near the literary skills of, for example, TE7 (although my eventual endings can't really be worse than Letters).
