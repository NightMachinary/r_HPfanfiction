I have no network, no beta and looking back, the first few pieces I published sucked. Far too many dialogue tags, I had no idea how to use commas in the English language (and still struggle with that), use far too many adverbs and -ing forms... The list goes on. Admittedly, I've fixed as many of those mistakes as I could find (basically rewriting my first ever story and large chunks of the already published chapters), but compared to a lot of other authors, even those who get far less attention than me, I suck.

I have written roughly 132k words in the past year, most of that since last December, and I am roughly in the middle when it comes to exposure. Stuff like Adversary breeds excellence has me beaten by miles even though it sucks while stories like Call Me or Headsman's Hostage have far less exposition despite superior writing quality. And the reasons are obvious. Cho isn't well liked and Lisa Turpin is a complete unknown with no fanon base like Daphne.

I mean, it's pretty obvious that including popular characters gets you more attention than not doing so.
