I've published over 150k words worth of fiction over the past two years. Language is pretty much flawless after thorough beta-ing, pairing is Harry/Ginny (the most popular pairing, going by many polls), and I've received nothing but positive, even lauding reviews for my latest stories. But it's just not happening in terms of exposure.

Your belief that it "isn't particularly difficult" is just not true. You have to have a good network, your premise has to grab enough attention, and most of all you have to be lucky. You are lucky with your amount of exposition and readership, and I hope you realize that.
