Interesting read so far.

A couple comments:

- One nitpick: I don't think the goblins would be bowing to the wizards because of their animosity.

- So far you followed canon mostly, but I hope that was just to show the divergence from canon. Please don't write a Canon rehash. Change the events, do something new. Don't follow canon too closely.

Just my two cents. If you ever need a beta, PM me.
