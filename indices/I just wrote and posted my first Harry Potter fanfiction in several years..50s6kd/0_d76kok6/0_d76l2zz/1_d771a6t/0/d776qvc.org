Okay, first let me tell you that I get you. Getting critic can be pretty harsh on the self esteem and on ones confidence. I get that, I really do. I'm an artist myself and this specific form of anxiety is basically job description.

/However/, and this is a big however, you /did/ post your story on a public platform that is specifically designed so that stories can be shared throughout the internet. So my question is: What the hell did you expect? Yes of course someone finds it and posts it. Yes of course people are going to tell you what they like and didn't like about it. The thing is, this is something you /already gave your consent to/ by posting your story on Fanfiction.net. You published your story. Public critic, sharing of the story on public forums and a certain lack of control over it is what you consented to the moment you pressed the "publish" button.

If you wanted to keep it private, send links to a google doc for interested people. Something that /isn't/ a worldwide, public platform.

The next thing: You received /nitpicks/. Take a moment and realize this. Nitpicks, small details people found odd or didn't like - a lot of them purely for subjective reasons. As far as critic goes, you got the /very/ good end of it. And not undeserved I might add. I did favorite/follow your story and hope for updates. Because it is among the good stuff out there. But even professional-tier fanfictions get criticism. That is something you simply have to accept when you publish Art of any form.

You specifically took out [[/u/ReadsABitTooMuch]]. But read his reply- really read it and analyze what he is saying.

I quote what he says after his many points of criticism:

  All told, it's a good start. Strong writing style with few - largely ignorable - errors (some formatting and a couple of Americanisms) that I saw. It's an interesting premise. Characterisation seems on point. The only other issue is an over-reliance on ellipses... Apart from that, I like it. I've followed you and look forward to reading more

So what he is saying is "I found some details amiss, but your story is pretty damn good". That is incredibly positive feedback.

So, if you may have hoped for an apology, you ain't gettin' it. What I can offer you is a "well done, good chapter" and "I hope for more".
