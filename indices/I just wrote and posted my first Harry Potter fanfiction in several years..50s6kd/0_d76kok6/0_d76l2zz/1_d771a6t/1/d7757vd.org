Please don't feel uncomfortable. I'm a person who constantly changes the pace of her own story because of what I read on reddit. It's been over two years and 100k words already written, but I can't write the first chapter. (A year ago, I managed to write it. I published it only because I was very, very drunk. 12 hours later - /poof/ gone. Why?) I take posts on reddit siriusly. Every time I read a discussion on OCs, I think something along the lines of, /"Wait wait, does my character do this? Will people dislike it? Did I explain it right?"/ or /"Well yeah, that plot-hole inspired me to write this fic in the first place. I figured out in an unique way to fil, but will people be willing to read it? Will this satisfy them? Will they find it weird or reasonable?"/

My point is: I admire you. You already wrote and published your stories, got flamed, stopped writing, BUT you *came back*. So don't feel bad. It takes courage to write /and/ publish. You're awesome. Keep up the good work.
