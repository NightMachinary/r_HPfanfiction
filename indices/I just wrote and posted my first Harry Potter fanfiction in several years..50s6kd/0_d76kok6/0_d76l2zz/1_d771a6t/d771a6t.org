Okay, this made me feel /extremely/ uncomfortable. I would have liked to share it on my own, preferrably privately. I didn't request critique publicly for a specific reason, I got horribly flamed the last time which is /why I waited so fucking long to even write anything/. That's why all my other stories are deleted on my profile.

Now, one of the first things in my inbox is a a bunch of - /public/ - nitpicks / critiques /that I didn't ask for or consent to/. The whole reason I posted was because I finally felt confident enough to post again, and now I feel like my confidence is destroyed all over again.

As an edit, to clarify, I've been actively doxxed and stalked on my other accounts, because my work was shared without my permission before - with the express purpose of making fun of it. I asked them to stop; they refused. It's why I removed all of my other stories from my account.

Tagging [[/u/UndeadBBQ]], [[/u/ReadsABitTooMuch]], and [[/u/Taure]] too, because I want to share why I didn't post the link to my fic straight off the bat.

So, thanks. Thanks, so much. /s
