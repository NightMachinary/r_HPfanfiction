That's amazing!

Also, if you need someone to go over your story for editing, I'm glad and willing to help. The reason I mention that is because while reading something you've written by yourself, you're always bound to miss something or the other.

It's always happened to me while I wrote fan fictions, and when everything seemed perfect when I uploaded it, I literally cringed when I read it years later and found all the grammatical errors I'd missed.
