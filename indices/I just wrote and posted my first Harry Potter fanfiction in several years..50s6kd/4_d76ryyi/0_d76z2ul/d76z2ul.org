  Why are you using Mr and Mrs Granger when the fic is from Hermione's POV? Dad and Mum would be better. Even if their relationship isn't great, I don't see why Hermione would refer to her own parents so formally. It just feels a little stifled

I disagree with this one. It's in third person limited, not first person. That means that while the story is told from the perspective of Hermione, including giving us a view into her thoughts, the narrative voice isn't itself Hermione's. It's a hypothetical observer who has attached themselves to Hermione's mind. If Hermione's parents were referred to as "Mum" and "Dad" in the narrative it would sound odd. The meaning of "Mum" and "Dad" as proper nouns is relative to the speaker, so would only make sense if the narrative voice were Hermione's own. But if the speaker was Hermione then the pronoun being used to refer to herself would be "I" (and she certainly shouldn't be referring to herself in the third person).
