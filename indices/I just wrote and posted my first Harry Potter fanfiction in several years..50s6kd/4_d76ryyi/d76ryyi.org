Reading through and I'll write my thoughts here as I go. Unfortunately that probably means this comment will be biased towards negatives as they what I'm most likely to comment on while I read through. Should get better at the end (or I just won't post this):

- I rarely consider stories with a quote in their synopsis as a good sign. I'm fairly sure I'm not alone on this, and I'm not sure everyone will realise it's a quote from "The Mummy," so that might bias some people against your story
- Typically, I prefer Harry-centric fics. It's a personal thing, but I'm willing to give most stories a chance
- Interesting premise though, and enough to convince me to give it a shot
- Why are you using Mr and Mrs Granger when the fic is from Hermione's POV? Dad and Mum would be better. Even if their relationship isn't great, I don't see why Hermione would refer to her own parents so formally. It just feels a little stifled
- "Whether or not whatever methods they used were illegal" is a double negative. It's a small thing (I'm being nitpick-y here), but I'd prefer "legal." Part of this is also because the previous sentence is, more or less, "they wouldn't do x" and I think this is better followed by "However, the methods used wouldn't necessarily be legal." This just helps imply that the most common course of action taken by a person in that situation would be legal
- "Hamburger shops" should probably be changed. For one, most people in Britain go for "burger" most of the time, or "beef burger" if they're specifying the type of burger. "Burger shop" wouldn't be used either though. "Burger bar," "fast food places," "takeaways," "chippies" or "fish and chip shop" would be more common. In this context, I'd probably go "fish and chip shop." I'm not as fussed on this because it isn't a character speaking, and Americanisms aren't as out of place there, but it's probably important if you're trying to inject as much of Hermione's character as possible into the writing.
- "'Well, aren't you turning into quite the young lady?' said Tom." It's a question, so you still use the question mark. When used at the end of someone's dialogue, it doesn't necessarily mark the end of the author's sentence.
- Roles such as prefect shouldn't be capitalised, especially when used with the indefinite article. It's not a proper noun, so it works the same way as "You could be a teacher." Later, you actually don't capitalise it. Annnnnd then you do. You seem to capitalise the singular, but not the plural, so at least you're consistent
- Again, it's not used in dialogue, so it's not too bad, but "trash can" = "(rubbish) bin"
- "'That sounds absolutely fascinating...'" The ellipsis isn't needed. Ron doesn't trail off, or pause, and it reads as if Percy cuts in pretty quickly
- On the subject of ellipses, Percy's dialogue has four within two sentences. That's too many
- Lucius Malfoy's dialogue has four ellipses within one sentence. Then three in a shorter sentence
- There's a couple of paragraph breaks out of place in Mr Weasley's and Mr Malfoy's scrap

All told, it's a good start. Strong writing style with few - largely ignorable - errors (some formatting and a couple of Americanisms) that I saw. It's an interesting premise. Characterisation seems on point. The only other issue is an over-reliance on ellipses... Apart from that, I like it. I've followed you and look forward to reading more
