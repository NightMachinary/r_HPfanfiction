Canon!Harry: "Right, so, how much do you know about wand lore?"

Indy!Harry: "Not a whole lot, why?"

CH: "You might want to ask Mr. Olivander a lot of questions about wand lore, specifically about a wand known as the Elder wand. While we're on the topic, do you know what the Deathly Hallows are?"

IH: "They're part of a children's story aren't they? Look, I thought you were going to teach me some cool spells or something."

CH: "Okay fair enough, Expelliarmus is really useful, master that one."

IH: "...How did you beat Voldemort exactly?"

CH: "Luck, lots and lots of luck."
