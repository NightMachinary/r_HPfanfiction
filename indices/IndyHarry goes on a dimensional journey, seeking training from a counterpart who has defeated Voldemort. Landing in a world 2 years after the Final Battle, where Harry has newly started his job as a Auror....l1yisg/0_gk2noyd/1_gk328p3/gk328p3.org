Isn't that the point of this prompt? Smart, driven Indy!Harry runs into canon Harry who's a bit of a damp biscuit and whose method of victory was so convoluted if he'd sneezed at the wrong moment he probably would have failed. Indy!Harry slowly realises that canon Harry has absolutely /nothing/ to offer him, and it's a miracle Voldemort isn't currently lounging in Hogwarts' great hall.
