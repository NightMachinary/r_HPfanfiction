Canon Harry only won through a massive combination of Deus Ex Machina, author fiat, plot armors, and most importantly, luck. Bad guys were also dumbed down into oblivion at key moments, so good guys could pull off a Pyrrhic victory in the end.

No, canon Harry is a very bad example.

I also would like to remove the time travel part.

But he/she may end up in other fanfic universes, and I think it would be very amusing for him/her to meet the Harrymort from "Seventh Horcrux", Bellatrix from "Delenda Est", and Hermione from "Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying". "That fucker" from "A Black Comedy", Sirius from "A Marauder's Plan", and the crew from "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider" are worth considering too.
