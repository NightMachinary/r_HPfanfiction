Good point, but if things differ, then what?

Absolutely no guarantee that events in two different worlds will play out the same.

From the examples I gave, people from other dimensions will also have their own approaches and goals:

- Harrymort is most likely happy just to train the newcomer
- Bellatrix will be thinking about how to profit from the whole situation. She might offer an intervention for significant amount of gold and full access to their DoM
- That crazy Hermione (and the rest of the gang) will be all about "liberating oppressed people" and "requisitioning important war supplies". If the dimensional traveling Harry becomes public knowledge (among Storm Wizards), you can bet there will be a full inter-dimensional war happening
- "That fucker" should take a similar approach as Harrymort
- Sirius will no doubt exact revenge for his dead counterpart (I assume the other Sirius is dead) and involve all kinds of lordship stuffs
- Petunia and her party are definitely going to intervene. They have a unique way in dealing with Hocruxes, which may or may not work in other dimensions, but they will certainly bring their heavily armed and armored flying Land Rover along
