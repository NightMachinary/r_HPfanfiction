I'd like to read your AU.

Unfortunately, I usually happen across the works where the general populace varies from bipedal sheep (no offence meant to the sheep) to "cartoon evil (lesser)". Saving those people instead of just taking your family, friends and tolerable acquaintances is not kindness, it's an extreme lack of self-preservation instinct and/or assertiveness.

Add in to that my burning hatred of "Messiah" trope...

“Non est salvatori salvator,\\
neque defensori dominus,\\
nec pater nec mater,\\
nihil supernum.”
