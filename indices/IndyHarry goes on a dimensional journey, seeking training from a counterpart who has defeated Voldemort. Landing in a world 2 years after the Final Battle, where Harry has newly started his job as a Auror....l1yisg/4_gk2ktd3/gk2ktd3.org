Harry looked across the ritual room they had finally found the location to. Hidden deep in the mountains of the Alps was the fabled Verdün cave. Lost for over a millennia they had spent the last two years desperately trying to find it.

After they had raided the Ministry and nearly emptied the DoM a journal had been found with a reference to it.

The location from where all the Sands of Time had been found. Hermione was sure it was a Convergence. Which meant the laws of magic and physics went sideways.

There were seven of them left now as he looked around the room, a magically powerful number indeed.

Ron stood at the apex, covered in burn wounds that still had flames burst from them on occasion. Neville was more plant than man anymore after his many horrific wounds had been slowly replaced with magical plants he could control.

Lavender stood there all of a foot tall and looking like a Muppet. At least she could freely move and talk now. Being hit with four spells at once had done her no favors.

Luna Lovegood, Queen of the Stars. She stood there proud and aloof, even as n-dimensional beings faded in and out around her. Not a death eater or snatcher one would even stay in the same town she was spotted in. Not after Bristol stopped existing the last time they tried to attack her.

The Broken Twins stood nearby, Padma Patil and Fred Weasley. Each missing their other half, each driving the other forward in a twisted ball of grief and rage. Both far more intelligent than any had given them credit for before the second war.

Lastly stood the only one untouched by the horrors so far. Yet also the one most deeply touched as well.

Draco Brown, he had thrown away his name and taken the name of his love. They had been a Romeo and Juliette love story for the ages.

When Voldemort had tried to force him to betray her he had stood firm. His mother had been tortured slowly in front of him for hours until she died. All while his father helped cast curses at her.

This had broken the boy, that while the torture had been on-going a raid that had twisted his love so severely was happening, that had shattered him.

He had reforged himself into a weapon of unstoppable violence after that.

Hermione had died in Gibraltar when the Navy, he wasn't sure which country, had shelled the city. The muggle militaries around the world had taken a swift and violent stance against wizards after the televised UN debacle.

Some Death Eaters had blasted in and began putting them all under Imperios. Thinking they would have full control of the muggle world with this brilliant act.

They had not been aware it was live streamed world-wide. The world had not responded well, to make an understatement of the century.

Still they were ready now, they began casting the ritual they had slowly created. One that would send them to a world where they had been victorious. Where they had found all of Voldemorts Horcrux and would learn all they could before returning to set things right.

"What!"

Fred threw the paper at Draco to read as they all thought over what they had just learned.

The 'final battle' was well documented and they were at a complete loss at what they had learned.

"Expelliarmus... bleeding... just... bloody hell..."

Draco was on verge of tears from grief and rage. It's like this universe was a bloody easy mode run or something.

Even Luna Lovegood, Queen of the Stars (her title was important for your sanity, even when thinking about her, actually, especially when thinking about her) looked put out over the revelation.

They all looked around the room nodding to each other. At least they could learn the locations of the horcrux from this Harry. Even take a break for a week or two so they could restock before returning.

Supplies had been near impossible to get back home. Draco was thinking even further, St. Mungo's was not a smoking crater here so perhaps they could help his love.
