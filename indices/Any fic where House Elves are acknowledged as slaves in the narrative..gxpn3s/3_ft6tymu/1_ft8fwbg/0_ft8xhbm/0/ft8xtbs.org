"Invoke" also means calling upon an outside power, such as a law or authority.

I think it fits better in this context, where the user merely requests the bot's attention and the bot does all the work. Consider D&D evocations, where the caster is supplying the power or at least doing all the work of steering it, vs invocations where they simply ask their deity to do it. This is more like the latter.
