You should check out snipers solve 99% of all problems by silentwalrus !! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20644262/chapters/49023794]]

It's a FMA/HP crossover that's super interesting and funny and has tons of science and scientific analysis of magic and whatnot!

Ed pretty much immediately after he meets Kreacher, realizes the wizards are keeping slaves, and he's /very/ pissed off about it

One of the tags is literally “Ed: what the fuck do you mean you have ELVES and SLAVERY”

Anyways, super good fic, and seems to be along the lines of what you're looking for - you should def check it out!!
