One of the scenes I have running through my head for a fic that I want to write (but will never finish) does that. Sadly I've never read a fic that actually addresses house elf slavery in any way other than "they need to bond to someone in order to live" or "most families treat their house elves like part of the family" neither option is very satisfying IMO.

It's also always struck me as odd that in canon most people just roll their eyes or flat disagree with Hermione about S.P.E.W canon shows a lot of evidence that she's right but until kreature's tale in DH, Hermione's views on house elves are kind of played for laughs.
