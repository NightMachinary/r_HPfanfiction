The symbiotic magical relationship trope doesn't justify slavery either, though it does provide a decent point from which the slavery started.

Assuming two facts about House Elves, they love to cook/clean/do chores (canon) and they have a magical symbiotic relationship with wizards/wizarding homes. Nothing says that a House Elf can't, of their own volition, enter a wizard's home and clean whenever the wizard isn't watching, just for the fun of it, absorbing magical energy however they need to. If the wizard turns out to be a dick, they leave and find a different house. No slavery required.

I can understand an author wanting to keep Dobby, or Winky more involved in the story, or wanting them to directly help Harry. Its unsettling that they all choose to do so by enforcing a magical contract, or binding between House Elf and "Master" when they could just have Harry offer to pay Dobby himself and tell him he can do whatever he wants when he's not taking care of Harry. Having Dobby as a "paid servent" isn't much better than having him as a slave.

The author could have Dobby choose to take care of Harry when he wants and to do other things when he doesn't, without having to make him a servent or slave, even with magical symbiosis involved. They just don't.
