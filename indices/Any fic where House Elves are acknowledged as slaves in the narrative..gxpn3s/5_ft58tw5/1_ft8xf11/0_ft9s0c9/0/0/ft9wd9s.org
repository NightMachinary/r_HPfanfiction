What kind of cockamamie logic is that? So you can't have a discussion about slavery unless it avoids uncomfortable topics? Slavery is terrible, so slaves would have a legitimate grievance against their oppressors. That could, understandably, lead to war if the enslaved class were suddenly freed. That's not 'justifying slavery's any more than saying "dont be an asshole or you might get punched in the face" is justifying 'being an asshole'.
