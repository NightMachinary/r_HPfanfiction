I'd like to see someone explore the idea "if magic can brainwash them into wanting to be slaves, magic can unbrainwash them". Dobby likes to be free, so it cant be a permanent condition. Maybe a love potion keyed to themselves would work. Maybe a master of legilimancy could figure out where the root of their subservience comes from. And maybe this goes horribly wrong and leads to a wizard-elf war.
