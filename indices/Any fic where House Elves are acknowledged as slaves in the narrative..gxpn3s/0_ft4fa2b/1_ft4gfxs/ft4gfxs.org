Then what part would they play into the plot? They seem to be very powerful, loyal and smart. If they were free then they would probably have a society of their own with their own towns and their own culture.

An author would have to create all of that and fit it into the universe in a convincing way (while also creating a convincing backstory) and the somehow fit them into the plot.

It's quite a lot of work for something that most of the time would be a minor plot point (unless the author is also willing to do even more work creating and integrating a new major plot point).
