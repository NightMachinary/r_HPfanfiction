You could do that. It kinda makes them irrelevant but you'd still have to think about and write the consequences of them leaving. For example, how does Hogwarts cope? Basically all the maintenance, including the food creation, is done by the elves.

And I think we can assume that Hogwarts isn't the only one to make use of a large amount of elves doing menial work. It would be, I think, a major upheaval of the way things are done. I think it would be important for an author to keep that in mind if they wish to be logically consistent.
