It's so strange to me that so many authors are like this. Like many creatures in Harry Potter, the house elves have basis in a real mythological creature that has been tweaked to fit into the universe. They are obviously Brownies, creatures that sneak into homes to do household chores and farming tasks, that get extremely offended and leave forever if someone tries to give them clothes or pay them other than in the offerings of things like milk that they wanted.

The fanon practically writes itself. Some wizards liked having a brownie around but didn't like having to leave offerings for it to stick around and didn't want to risk it leaving forever. So they made some magical contract or deal with some Brownies, promising them all the work they could ever want and more in exchange for some small concessions and rules.

A few generations of selective breeding for subservience, plus lack of education about their history. Destruction of their cultural identity by branding them House Elves instead of Brownies. Teaching the Elves that getting clothes wasn't an offense but a dismissal and that no family would want a dismissed elf around (cutting them off from the one thing they love to do). Creating laws to ensure that the wizards "property" is protected. Removing cultural knowledge of the origin of the species.

All a recipe for the house elves of Harry Potter.
