2 fics that come to mind are:

linkao3(Fantastic Elves and Where To Find Them) and it's sequel, house elf stuff is largely in the sequel. Aside from major plot, Harry frees Dobby, breaks his conditioning and then helps Dobby free other elves so they can be â€˜Forrest Elves' like Harry.

And I think it was linkffn(Blindness) Harry and Hermione work to improve House Elf conditions and contracts as part of a major plot point.

I'm new and not familiar with using links, hope it works.
