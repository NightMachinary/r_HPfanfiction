It is sort of sad that in canon, we never had one of the trio who truly seemed to love magic in itself. Hermione, of course, was good at magic, but I feel like she loved the studying and gathering of knowledge more than anything else. For Ron, magic was natural and normal, and he didn't really have the same sort of experimental spirit as Fred and George. And then Harry just loved having friends and a new family.
