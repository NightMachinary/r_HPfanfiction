I'd want Harry to explore more of the world. Whether it is after he graduates, or if Sirius (or anyone else) breaks out of Azkaban and rescues Harry - have them travel the world and explore other areas of magic. Make magic more diverse and mystic.

Also, I want Sirius post-Azkaban to be unforgiving to his former comrades and friends, especially towards Remus and Albus. The guy goes against everything he's known growing up for his friends, and they completely forsake the man and leave him to rot in Azkaban for over a decade - but canon Sirius seems fine with it all, which is just baffling.
