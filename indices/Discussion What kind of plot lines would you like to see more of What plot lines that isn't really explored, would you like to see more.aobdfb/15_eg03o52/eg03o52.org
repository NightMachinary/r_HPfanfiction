Fics exploring some of the more obscure branches of magic. Outside of the traditional fic recs for those categories, cursebreaking/enchanting/healing/advanced transfiguration are all relatively untouched in the fanfic world. Personally, I love fics that focus on the magic, on having Harry build himself up in a field, explores possibilities and takes him on travels/adventures based around those careers. They offer such a cool premise, but there are only a tiny amount of readable fics that have any type of focus on them (and I've been reading for over a decade at this point).
