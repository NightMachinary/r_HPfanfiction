Severus Snape being neither good or bad--- often, fanfictions either make him a really good person (justifying all his bullying and whatsoever) or just a plain bad one (a very flat antagonist). Occasionally, I do come across Snape as a person who is every inch of a bully he is canonically but he still isn't a villain. Just human. Idk, maybe I'm not really going this the right way.
