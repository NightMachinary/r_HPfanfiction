I know it's been mentioned by others on this sub, but I'd love to see an exploration of aurors that doesn't make them bureaucrats or magic!cops.

I know that's what canon eventually turned them into, but seeing aurors as badass bounty hunters, tracking down dark wizards, disrupting dark rituals, fighting beasts and ghosts and dark creatures....all that would be really cool.

I would love to see the aurors as a small, exclusive, and rather disparate group. They're technically part of the ministry--they're on the payroll--but they're not reduced to guard duty or desk work. Aurors have got shit to do. Let the DMLE or Hit Wizards take on the magic!cop role and be the cogs in the Ministry machine.
