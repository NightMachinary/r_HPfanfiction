Northumbrian's series (most of his stories are in this series) is a post Hogwarts cannon compliant (up to end of book 7) shows the auror corps as more of a "hunting the dark wizards" and not a basic policing force (even goes into some detail about the differences in one of the stories). You might enjoy that series for that, however be warned, its long, and can be boring if you don't like "slice of life" fics.
