lately Ive wanted to see stories that have people reacting to typical indy harry story events.\\
Like people trying to find a weekend date only to find out that everyones a member of potters harem, a family dealing with the fallout of finding out they're only together because evil dumbledore was dosing them with potions, or a bunch of people figuring out that if they're nice to goblins they can get amazing investment advice and completely disrupt the economy, things like that.
