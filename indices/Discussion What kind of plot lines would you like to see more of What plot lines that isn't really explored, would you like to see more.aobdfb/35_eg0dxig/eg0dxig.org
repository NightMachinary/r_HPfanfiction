The Statue of Secrecy. Magic can break so many established limitations of the muggle world. Some wizard and/or squib has to have had a get rich quick scheme. More sinister alternatives exist. Magical hitmen etc.

I'd love to see a crime thriller around an ICW task force as they work to maintain the Statue of Secrecy.
