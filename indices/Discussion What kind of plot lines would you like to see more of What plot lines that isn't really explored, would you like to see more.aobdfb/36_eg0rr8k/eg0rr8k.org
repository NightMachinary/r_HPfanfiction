A character inserted from our world to some time between harrys parents and harrys time in hogwarts; that goes on to live their life not involving themselves in the second or third wizarding wars. I wrote a short on the premise, that's crack filled and bad, but I'm a bad writer in general, so that's not saying much. I'd like to see someone write it well.
