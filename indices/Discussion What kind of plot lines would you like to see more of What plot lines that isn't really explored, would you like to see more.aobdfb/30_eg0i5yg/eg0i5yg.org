Harry after the books. Disregard the epilogue. Then put him in a bit of extreme. Not just happily ever after auror boring blah... Let them grow again, because they have to. Let him grow to an adult who is capable and cares. Maybe let him turn the world upside down. Give them purpose and an adventure and not something old from the boom that comes again (find all the deatherters...)

Second. A well done anti hero. Not a necessarily as a villian, just bad person fighting for the good. A brutal fighter. Not for the sake of brutality but the effectiveness in combat.

Third: Hermione gone mad. Always thought the following could be a very cool story (maybe short) Hermione went crazy mad for something (maybe Ron dead?) And tried to develop something ill convinced (like world breaking time travel). No one can or dares to stop her. Then Harry as an now older auror walks in, stepping around the aurors Hermione already killed and talks calmly to her. In the end creating an understanding that no one will stop. And he can and will take her down... Such drama ! ;-) Hope you get the idea...
