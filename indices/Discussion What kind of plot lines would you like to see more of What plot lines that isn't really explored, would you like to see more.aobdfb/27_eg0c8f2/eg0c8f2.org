There are a ton of things that I personally would like more of or hasn't been explored by good writers much.

- Time/Dimension travel that focuses on Harry establishing relationships with people that died. Bar almost none these sort of fics always start of from the premise that Harry keeps his true identity a secret from Lilly/James, friends, etc. With broody, powerful Harry working alone to kick ass. While those fics can be a lot of fun, they also largely stay away from the relationships (aside from a ton of angst). Give me Harry meeting Lilly and instantly approaching her and establishing a relationship. I am anxiously awaiting to see if linkffn(From Ruin) will finally end up taking this route.

- Year 8 fics where they go to Hogwarts without slash or Dramione is rare. I'd like to see more Harry/Daphne or Harry/Hermione in this category. There are some good oneshots and shorter stories in that genre, but I feel there's unexplored territory there.

- In general, stories where the fighting becomes more gritty from both sides. We, of course, have plenty of stories where Harry decides to fight fire with fire, which generally leads to protests from the "light" side. I can imagine a fic where after the ministry has fallen the Order/remaining Aurors adopt the guerilla style warfare that the Death Eaters used before officially establishing themselves in the government. And through that style going for raids and assassinations on high profile targets without taking prisoners.

- Also more a general thing I want to see in fics is interesting magic. Too many fics, in my opinion, take the route of them casting reducto, stupefy and protego 90% of the time which makes magical duels very boring to read. Sectumsempra is too often the most powerful spell used. There is so much you can do with magic (and a ton of inspiration you can get from pop culture) to make it interesting. Have Harry (and Hermione) explore new branches of magic and make creative use of it. I often find myself skimming dueling segments because they simply are repetitive and boring.
