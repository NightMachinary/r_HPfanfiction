There were actually departments, like the department of charms, and transfiguration, and the castle was huge. However, if Rowling is right and there are 1000 students in Hogwarts then it's really understaffed. I always thought that there was other staff but after the war the number of students decreased and so did the need for that much staff.

Unless they use time turners to manage their classes.
