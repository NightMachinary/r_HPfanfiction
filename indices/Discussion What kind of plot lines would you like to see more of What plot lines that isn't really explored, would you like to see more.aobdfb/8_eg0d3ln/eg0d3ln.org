These are mostly fanfic related "wants." Some are more serious than others, and there's no particular order.

- More Founders fics. It's got pre-built drama, but other than the few bits of info there is about that era, it's wide open for exploration. (There should be some backwards-aging Merlin thrown into the mix, because that's my favorite kind of Merlin.)
- Harry in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. (Who doesn't befriend his canon friends.)
- Slytherin Ron fics.
- Slytherin Harry fics where he's not a complete edgelord. (Who doesn't befriend his canon friends.)
- Post-war fics that ignore the epilogue.
- Marauders era fics that aren't full of shipping and "but I am Sirius!" jokes, but actually follow the damn war going on.
- More "elsewhere" fics, stuff that takes place at different magical schools or in different magical countries.
- Related to the above: overhauled world-building AUs.
- More fics where the Bad Guys Win.
- Fics where someone other than Harry or Neville is Voldemort's equal. Candidates I'd like to see: Dean Thomas (his backstory would def. make this interesting), Luna Lovegood (her birth year isn't right, but it's AU, so ...), Draco Malfoy (talk about awkward), Ron Weasley, Percy Weasley (he's my favorite Weasley), Cho Chang (she's completely under-explored in fic and canon did her dirty).
- Goblin fics. Full of mean goblins.
- An AU where Tom Riddle is psychologically sound, but still terrifying and ambitious.
- That Trump-as-Ginny AU that someone on this sub promised to write.
- (I'd read Trump-as-Harry, too. Or Ron.)
- (Fuck, I might actually write one of those.)
- (I'll probably have zero time to update it past a few chapters though.)
- (So someone else do it. Pretty please?)
- Probably controversial, but I'd love to read a fic where Grindelwald was right about Muggles and ruling over them. It'd be difficult to pull off, and people would probably claim that the poor writer is somehow supporting fascism (because apparently writing something means you support it or have done it, and aren't just using your imagination), but my God, it'd make for an amazingly dark AU.
- Hermione being in-character.
- Gen fics.
- Sci-fi fics.
- /Star Wars/ crossovers. (Preferably Potter characters go into the Star Wars universe, not the other way around.)
- A well-written, in-character romance fic with a pairing involving a Death Eater and a most-definitely-not-a-Death-Eater character. That's not a popular thing around here (or on DLP where I lurk), and I *actively avoid* those types of fics since they're crap ... but if one was done well? If it actually explored all the juicy psychological stuff and character development that would be necessary? If it showed the ugliness and desperation with such a dynamic? It might actually hold my attention for more than half a chapter.
- SI-OC fics where it doesn't feel like the main character has memorized the contents of the books.

Edited to add:

- Competent Lockhart. But still egotistical.
