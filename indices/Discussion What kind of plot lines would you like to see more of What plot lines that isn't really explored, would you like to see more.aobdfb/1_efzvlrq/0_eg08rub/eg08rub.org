  I'd love to see more fics where the fantasy aspect gets dialed up to 11. More world-building, more inventive spells and artificing, going out on dangerous adventures to exotic and fantastical locales; basically I'd love to see someone write their HP fic as a D&D campaign.

It's why I wish Lords of Magic linkffn(5755130) was not abandoned. The world building in that spoke to me pretty hard core.
