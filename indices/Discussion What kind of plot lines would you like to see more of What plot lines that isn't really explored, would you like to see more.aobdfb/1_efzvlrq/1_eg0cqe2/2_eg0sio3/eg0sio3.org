I've seen this recommended a lot, but have always been a little hesitant to read it, partially because it uses 3.5e rules and I remember almost nothing of it beyond the fact that 3.5e is crunchy in the extreme. Is the fic as noodly as I remember 3.5e being, or am I just being tentative over something that really doesn't even matter?
