Quite possibly my favourite fic of all time is an HP/D&D crossover called Harry Potter and the Natural 20. The protagonist is one of the biggest munchkins to exist, and the plot is really engaging and doesn't stick too closely to canon like other fics (especially with a big twist at the end of book 2). There's a sideplot involving a Muggle policewoman who discovers she was obliviated multiple times which could very well be a story in its own right, it's that good.
