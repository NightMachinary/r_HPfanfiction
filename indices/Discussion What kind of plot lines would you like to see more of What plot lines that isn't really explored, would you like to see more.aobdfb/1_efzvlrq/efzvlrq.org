I'd love to see more short-form mystery fics that could take place during the weeks or months that Rowling skips in canon, a la The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks. I've always felt that canon was a lot more engaging when it revolved almost completely around the yearly mystery, rather than the increasing war stuff in the later books, and the idea of the trio getting into little mini-mysteries during the "down-time" in canon is pretty cool.

And in the exact opposite direction, I'd love to see more fics where the fantasy aspect gets dialed up to 11. More world-building, more inventive spells and artificing, going out on dangerous adventures to exotic and fantastical locales; basically I'd love to see someone write their HP fic as a D&D campaign.
