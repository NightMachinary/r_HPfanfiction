The King of Limbs, imo, needs a complete rewrite. I like the fic as it goes on, but the beginning is so slow and clunky, and absolutely reeks of my re-entry into the fandom after a long time away from it. Plus, I think I bit off way more than I could chew with a pretty dense plot about wizard drug dealers, Department of Mysteries spycraft (which was lifted wholesale and transplanted into Midnight Blues), and melancholy postwar romance angst. As for Midnight Blues, I want to get back to it, but that requires getting into the right headspace: as you might have assumed, I'm a massively boring cunt in real life and MB's humour doesn't come natural.
