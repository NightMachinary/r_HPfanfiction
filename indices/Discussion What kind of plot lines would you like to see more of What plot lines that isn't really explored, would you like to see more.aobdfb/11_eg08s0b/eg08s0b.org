I absolutely love fics that have Harry travelling to an alternate dimension and discovering he has a family there. Especially when he has siblings.

I really loved The World as We Knew It, and I have been searching for something of at least similar quality for a long time.

Another type of fic that I love, which I also see mentioned here, is one with a focus on some particular advanced branch of magic, and the protagonist mastering it.

Finally, I would love to read a proper horror/thriller set in Hogwarts. There was one fic that was a crossover with Hellraiser....Harry solves the Lament Configuration and calls Pinhead and his kind to Hogwarts, then offers the souls of Voldemort and his Death Eaters to them.
