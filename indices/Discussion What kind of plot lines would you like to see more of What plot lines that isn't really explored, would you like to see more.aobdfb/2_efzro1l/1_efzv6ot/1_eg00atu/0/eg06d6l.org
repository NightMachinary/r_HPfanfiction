Thank you for writing this, it completely and absolutely justifies everything Dumbledore does in the series, because it proves that his methods create viable results. The "end before the means" is the correct way to handle every situation. Machiavelli may have said it first, but Albus Dumbledore had the last word. Just look at Dumbledore's track record: if real life was one of his ten-pin bowling games, he'd be scoring 300.
