I actually want more Dumbledore just being a Headmaster. In most fics he in one way or another is central to the plot, whether that's Greater Good Manipulative Dumbledore, Evil Dumbledore or Good Dumbledore. I would like more fics where Dumbledore is burdened by the pressure put on him by the wizarding world and he just wants to be a good headmaster (and no political functions or being a prominent leader in a war).

Everyone always looks to him because he involves himself in everything, but what if people look at him and he says "sorry what does that have to do with me?"
