A mixture of the best ideas from Canon and fanfictions. I feel Harry should have the same potential as Voldemort. A well-meaning Dumbledore. A Hermione that suddenly doesn't become a hypocrite through hormones. A strategist Ron. A Luna that's Hermione's equal in different ways. Sacrifice being a theme but not killing off every link to Harry's parents. Subtle propaganda as well as fighting corrupt officials. Alchemy taking a place, as well as discovering lost magics through trial and error. Neville getting his out of his shell in his first Hogwarts years rather than after his father's wand is replaced. Accountability for all authority figures in the end.
