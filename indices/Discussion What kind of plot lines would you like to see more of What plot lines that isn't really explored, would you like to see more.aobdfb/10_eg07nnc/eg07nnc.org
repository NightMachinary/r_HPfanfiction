Harry verse Magical Monsters - With a world that has Trolls, Chimeras, Manticores, Wampus Cats, Horned Serpents, Vampires, Werewolves that follow Greyback's every command. How is it that this bit of flavor from the first few Books has all but Vanished where Harry would get into sticky situations with magical monsters. Hell you can have this happen in Potter/Superhero stories, maybe Voldemort sends Dark Creatures after Harry during 7th year, maybe a post Canon story where Harry travels the world and takes out dangerous creatures

Traveling the world with Harry - Cause yay
