I think something that could be cool is to have Harry and Hagrid develop a much closer relationship, and Harry becomes fascinated with Magical Creatures. And then you could have Harry become Hagrid's apprentice in a way; helping wrangle creatures in the forest, raising skrewts, grooming hippogriffs. I could see potential in that.
