Same. Though I understand that it's unappealing to write as that kind of story demands a lot of world building and original characters. It ain't easy.

I picture Harry, freshly done with the war and the immediate cool down period afterwards, just deciding to get out of Britain for a bit. Nothing dramatic, he says goodbye to everyone and he keeps in contact, but he needs a break from the Ministry and being the Boy-Who-Lived and all that.

It starts simple; he visits places that are off the beaten path and less likely to recognize him at a glance. A little while passes by and honestly he's getting bored - considering going back home to settle down - when he hears something interesting. Whatever it is, it seems fairly innocent, but digs up a different shade of the curiosity that drove him to try and solve mysteries when he was 11. It's a bit dangerous but not much, rather thrilling, and he ends up encountering something really cool. His interest in traveling is revitalized.

This sort of thing repeats a couple of times, and he begins to run into more dangerous and challenging obstacles. He reaches out to his good friends Bill and Fleur, who are more than happy to give advice and show him some of the cursebreaking ropes. Maybe if he finds something particularly interesting they'd join up with him for a bit. I can imagine him doing the same with a more grown Neville, if exotic and dangerous magical plants are particularly relevant. Hagrid too, come to think of it, but obviously for magical creatures not plants.

Other times Harry may be stuck in a way that they can't help him, so he consults with the deviously creative geniuses that he knows - Fred and Hermione (and maybe George, you wouldn't find me complaining if he survived). Over time they end up providing him with a variety of interesting and unique magical tools, and he reciprocates by telling them all about anything he finds.

Harry's saving people thing flares up from time to time of course, just to spice things up. I basically imagine him becoming something that resembles a magical Indiana Jones.

I'm not sure where Ron would really fit, because I don't imagine him wanting to leave Britain and Hermione behind, nor does he have the expertise to be relevant to the story. I suppose I'd probably keep George alive, have Ron die in the war, and use his death as one of the factors that leads to Harry choosing to start his traveling.
