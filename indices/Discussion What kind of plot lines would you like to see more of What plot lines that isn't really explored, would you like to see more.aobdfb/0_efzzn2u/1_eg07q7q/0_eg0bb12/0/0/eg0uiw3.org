Now you have me thinking of a fic that in his truest moment of despair, Fred saw his brother George lying there dead, but rather than admit that his twin dies, he pretends that he dies, calling himself George and pretending it was Fred who died- because in a way, losing his twin brother really does kill him, and he'd rather live on as George than as a broken Fred...

I mean, the idea is shot to hell because others know he's Fred during the moment of his death, plus the whole missing ear part, but I guess you could AU those out of the universe.
