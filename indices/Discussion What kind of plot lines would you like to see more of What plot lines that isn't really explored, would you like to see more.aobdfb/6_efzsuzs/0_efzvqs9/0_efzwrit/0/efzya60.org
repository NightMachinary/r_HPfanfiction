I mean, yeah, the other primary adult characters lose a lot of faith/trust in him after Harry's situation is exposed and make their displeasure clearly known to Dumbledore, but I didn't think their reactions were unwarranted or unrealistic. Also, Dumbledore is old and set in his ways. He /wants/ to do better, but changing decades long behaviors is hard, and he does backslide sometimes (and get called out for it by the aforementioned adults when caught).

If you're the dude in charge of /all/ of society's children and it comes out that you left the most famous of them in an abusive home, never checked up on him (or allowed anyone else to), and then missed/ignored the signs of abuse for /three years/ after he was your direct responsibility, I don't think you /should/ be let off more lightly than Dumbledore was in the story. Ultimately, Dumbledore fell into the trap of starting to believe that he was smarter and wiser than everyone else after being praised as such for so many years, and it came back to bite him in the ass when it turns out he's human after all.
