Part of the problem with fics as in-depth as this is that sometimes it feels like an entirely different story. If the setting is unique, why not just write a unique story with your own characters? I imagine that is why there aren't many fics that diverge from canon settings, either in crossovers or otherwise.

HP-style magic isn't all that unique to begin with, it's just presented in a way that feels unique. It's basically urban fantasy told with a fairy-tale-esque reverence. There are a lot of stories like that.
