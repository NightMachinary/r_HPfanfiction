Yes, and it's a good one.

On the other hand, it's a crossover in which the only existing person from the HPverse is Harry. That's not what I really want.

I want a non crossover Wizards in Space fic with the full cast from the HPverse. I don't want to see Stargate, Star Destroyers, Hataks, Battlestars, and etc. I want to read how they build their spaceship in a combination of HP magic and existing Muggle technologies.
