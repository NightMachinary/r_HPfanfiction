Do yourself a favor and watch Firefly! It's fantastic!

That fic is also wonderful and captures the characters post-Serenity (the feature film that wraps up the disappointingly-short-run-series). Not everything is hunky dory following the events of the movie, so Harry's presence really changes things.
