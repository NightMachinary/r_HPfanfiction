- More Wizard in Space fics. “Starship Hedwig” is disappointing, and “Invincible” no longer looks that promising.
- We often have dimensional travels in which (canon) Harry kicks some asses in an alternate universe, while Lily is reduced to some passive observer. I want to read the reverse of that. I'd like to see a ass-kicking Lily Potter from another world build an ass-kicking team with his newly found son, very much in the John/Sarah Connor style.
- Epilogue compliant fic about Hermione's rise to the Minister, in the “House of Cards” style.
- Harry/Hermione time travel to the early 1970s, but instead of the usual shenanigans with Marauders, they first used to their advance knowledge to make billions in Muggle stock market, while building a massive paramilitary organization at same time. In 1978, after the Marauders finally graduated, they made their moves.
- The sequel of “The Sum of Their Parts”
- After viewing Snape's memory, Harry sneaked upon his enemies as in canon, but instead of offering himself for execution, he brought along at least a ton of C4 explosives in his enchanted bags and blew himself up in a blaze of glory, killing every Death Eater within a radius of 100 meters, Nagini, and Voldemort.
