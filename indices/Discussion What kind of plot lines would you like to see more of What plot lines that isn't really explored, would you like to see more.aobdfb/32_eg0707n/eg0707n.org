- Talented Harry fics which draw on his strengths and characteristics as shown in canon to depict his development into a wizard of the same kind of calibre as his parents/Snape (think Patronus Charm writ large). There are lots of talented Harry fics out there, but they tend to completely abandon his canon characterisation.

- Magical genius Harry fics which understand the difference between intelligence and maturity, where magical talent doesn't entitle Harry to undermine the authority of his teachers (and the author doesn't reward him for trying), and which take a path of magical development which avoids Harry casting NEWT-level magic by second year.

- Political elements which are about leaving behind the naivety and rebelliousness of youth and which take as their central theme the adult discovery that problems are complex and there are often good reasons why people haven't been able to solve them before.
