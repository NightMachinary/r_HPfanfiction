I think the ones I've enjoyed but not seen much are where Harry is dark not because he's a Slytherin, but because of the circumstances in which he has grown up. Most of all, he is not OP. A lot of Harry Potter's popularity is that he is average, but given the circumstances, he does his best.

I like stories of Tom Riddle, but I believe it is difficult to write about him. Most of the time, people make him too human, which takes away from his character. It is only in being outmatched by Dumbledore, for example, that Riddle suddenly becomes human. But I don't think he should care about Harry or want to protect him or etc just because of how Harry makes him feel.
