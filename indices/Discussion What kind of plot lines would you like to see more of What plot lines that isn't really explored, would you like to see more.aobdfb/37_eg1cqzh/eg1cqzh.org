Harry and Ron as auror buddies at some point soon after Voldemort died, except that after dealing with /him/, regular everyday criminals seem hilariously petty by comparison. As a result, they have a skewed sense of danger and alternately shock, horrify, and impress their coworkers (and criminals) with how casually they react to even the most life-threatening situations.

Would almost certainly involve an OP Harry/Ron, all played for comedy.

Bonus points if someone thinks to get at them through Ginny or Hermione instead, only to deeply regret their life choices when they try.
