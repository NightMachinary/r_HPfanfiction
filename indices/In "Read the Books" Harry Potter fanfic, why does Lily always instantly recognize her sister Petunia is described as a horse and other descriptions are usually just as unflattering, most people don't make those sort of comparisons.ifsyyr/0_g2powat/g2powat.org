Even if Lily wouldn't use those sorts of descriptions herself, she could easily have heard other people make them. Snape in particular seems like the type of person to say that sort of thing, and we know for sure that he knew Petunia.

But even if that weren't the case, there are plenty of clues in just the first chapter of PS:

#+begin_quote
  Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive
#+end_quote

Literally the first words in the book. Petunia is the older sister, so depending on when the reading takes place, Petunia could already be married to or dating Vernon, and could even be living at number four, which would make this a pretty big hint. Of course, Petunia probably also wouldn't have any contact with Lily, so it's plausible she might not know about Vernon, especially if their parents are dead by that point. But if the author wants to, they could easily justify Lily knowing about Petunia and Vernon anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours.
#+end_quote

That's the only physical description we get of Petunia in chapter 1. It's not particularly distinctive, but it's also not so unflattering that Lily couldn't realize it sounds like her sister.

#+begin_quote
  Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister
#+end_quote

Depending on when the reading is happening, this could be a dead giveaway. But even if Lily and James aren't dating yet, it does narrow down her identity quite a lot.

#+begin_quote
  â€˜Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?'
#+end_quote

And there, on page 7, we get Petunia's name. At that point, Lily has either figured out who Petunia is or is in denial.
