By the end of chapter 1, sure. The fact that Lily, James, Sirius, and Petunia are all named should make it obvious. I was looking specifically at the parts focusing on the Dursleys though to see if Lily should be able to identify Petunia based solely on how she and Vernon are described, which only takes us about halfway through the chapter.
