I don't think the description alone would be enough for Lily to identify her sister, especially since she is only called "Mrs Dursley" in this part of the chapter. Petunia may correspond to the description ""/thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck/", but so does a lot of woman in the UK.

The informations given by Vernon pov should give her some very big doubts: the name "Potter", Mrs Dursley is called Petunia, bad relation with her sister, colored robes and owls, magic . . . but maybe not enough to be totally sure.

And as you said, the end of the chapter make it obvious.
