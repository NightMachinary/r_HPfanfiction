  Petunia probably also wouldn't have any contact with Lily, so it's plausible she might not know about Vernon, especially if their parents are dead by that point. But if the author wants to, they could easily justify Lily knowing about Petunia and Vernon anyway.

In the chapter 1 of PS, Vernon know about "/the Potters/" and "/these people/". So unless he blindly believes everything his wife says, it is very heavily hinted that he met the Potters at least once even if they do not have regular contacts. Rowling also said in an interview that they had a meal together, that went wrong (I think James used Magic), but that's not really canon.

Anyways, Lily should be able to confirm that the "book" talk about her sister in 5 pages max, with all the "hints" in the first chapter.
