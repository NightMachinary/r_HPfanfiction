I wonder whether even that narrator is not that much godly, but somehow reflection of Harry's memories. Notice, how we have very limited point of view of them. For example, we never see more than what would Harry see (or hear from the later recounting), we never find anything about their background thoughts, assumptions, or feelings. We just get the same what Harry would get.

If you tried to write any story involving Dursleys, you soon find that what we have in books are not real humans, but really just caricatures of humans, and you have to work around that (that is not to make them better but more real).
