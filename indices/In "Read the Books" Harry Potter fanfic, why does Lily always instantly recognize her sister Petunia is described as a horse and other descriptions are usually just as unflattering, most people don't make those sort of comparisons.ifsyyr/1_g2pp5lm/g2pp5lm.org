First of all, whenever we think about the portrait of Dursleys in the books, we have to remember that we see them through the eyes of teenagers who was previously abused by them. The portrait is quite certainly not faithful to reality (that is not to say they were nice people or that they didn't abuse him).

Technically I liked these [[https://www.deviantart.com/lanermahaner/art/Witch-Weekly-Magazine-Cover-Petunia-Dursley-2-605080691][two]] [[https://www.deviantart.com/loonalucy/art/Petunia-Dursley-527038990][portraits]] of her. Certainly not a candidate for Miss Universe (or Mrs Universe in her case), but with some care she could look more or less representable.
