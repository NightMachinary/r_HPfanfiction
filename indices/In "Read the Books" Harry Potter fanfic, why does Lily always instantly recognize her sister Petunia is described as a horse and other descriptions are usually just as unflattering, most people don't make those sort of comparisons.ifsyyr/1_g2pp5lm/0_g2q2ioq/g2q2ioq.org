In my opinion, Fiona Shaw was a good cast for the character, and comes very close to the appearance I imagined for her. If she was blonde and younger (Fiona Shaw was 43 when she did PS while Petunia in 33/34 at that time), she would be perfect. And since they aged pretty much all the adults in the film, I can't really complain about the 2nd point.

Also, Harry had riddiculously high standards when it comes to appearance. Even in his head, I don't think he considered more than 10 people attractive in the 7 books.
