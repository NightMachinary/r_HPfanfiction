Yeah this one sound really edgy. Thought depending of the context I can kinda understand it. I mean, dueling (as in professional dueling) as rules, unlike fighting. I'm pretty sure Dumbledore style in his duel against Voldemort would not be accepted in the professional circuit.

There was one cracky fic where a full cliche Indi! Harry confronted a manipulative Dumbledore where Dumbledore told him Dueling was useless in a battlefield because you are used to one opponent in front of you and to hold back while in a true battle you can be killed by behind and should not stop until your enemy is dead or completely controlled.
