I don't know how to use the bot but "Harry Potter and the Daft Morons" should work for you.\\
The fic is a harem and scream wish fulfilment (with the good old family alliance and veela bond clich√©s) but yeah, Harry is pretty much mister perfect there.\\
Even remember a line where Harry say he doesn't cook, but chef.
