Just for clarity: I am not a fan of Lucius Malfoy (I am really not a fan of ANY Malfoy, and I won't get into details to avoid contact with the Godwin's Law), but Lucius trying to curse Harry with the Killing Curse in the open is one of many nonsenses in films. In books it is more limited:

  Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at Harry.

  “You've lost me my servant, boy!”

  There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.

  “You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”

  Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
