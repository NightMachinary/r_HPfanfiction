Daphne's so popular because she's a blank-slate female character from Slytherin and she's in Harry's class. I think the Slytherin part and from Harry's class are really important. Really only leaves her or Tracey Davis, and I think she's chosen more because we have a /tiny/ bit more backstory with Daphne just because we know in canon her sister goes on to marry Draco. Having the sister, plus a more interesting name, makes her a more appealing character to start with.
