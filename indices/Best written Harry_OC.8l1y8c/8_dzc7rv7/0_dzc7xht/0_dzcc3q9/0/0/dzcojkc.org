At this point I think Daphne has been pretty filled out in fanon, and I wish the fandom would move on to somebody we haven't really seen done, like Marietta Edgecombe or Romilda Vane or Seamus or something. Characters that have almost no backstory to them and no 'established fanon' so it would essentially be a new person.
