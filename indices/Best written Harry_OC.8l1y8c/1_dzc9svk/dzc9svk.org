Wouldn't say its well written, but it is interesting and the character is well developed. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power)

Another one that I found was nice and sweet is linkffn(You and I by emilyherself)

I think linkffn(Blood of the Phoenix) is also quite good, maybe not so much as well written, but the story itself is interesting.
