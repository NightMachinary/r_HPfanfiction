I enjoyed it, but just skimmed over the smut. It really wasn't great romance wise, but I liked the way things played out in this story better than the real seventh book as far as the ending of the war. There are times you have to suspend your disbelief, at times things fall together a little too neatly considering the characters baggage. Give it a try, you might like it.
