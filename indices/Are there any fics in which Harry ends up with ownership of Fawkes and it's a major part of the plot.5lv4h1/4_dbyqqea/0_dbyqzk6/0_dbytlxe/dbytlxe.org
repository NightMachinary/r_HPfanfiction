I don't really recall the smut but it's rated M so I figure that's for a reason. If you usually avoid slash, I really wouldn't recommend this. I LOVE slash fics, but this one just isn't great (even though it's highly praised in the fandom). It's really long too and for me was a slog at the end.

If you're just interested in Phoenix fics more generally (rather than fawkes specifically) I really liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][Cartographers Craft]] . Harry hatches a Phoenix egg in that fic and has it as a pet/familiar to help in the horcrux hunt.
