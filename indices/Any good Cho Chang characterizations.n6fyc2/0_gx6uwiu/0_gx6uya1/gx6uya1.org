  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.
