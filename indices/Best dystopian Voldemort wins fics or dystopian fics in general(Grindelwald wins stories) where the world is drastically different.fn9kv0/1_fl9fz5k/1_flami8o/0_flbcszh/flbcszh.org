The fic starts slow, and it may be difficult to feel invested in the characters in the beginning, since the plot basically launches after a lot of import backstory has taken place that you don't learn about until later.

Personally, I'd say the story starts to get really interesting at the end of chapter 4, and the suspense stays pretty intense from then on.
