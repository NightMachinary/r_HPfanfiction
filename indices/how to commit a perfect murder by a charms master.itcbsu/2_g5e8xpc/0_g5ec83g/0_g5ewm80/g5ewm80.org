Well, it does both. Harry literally can't see Number 12, Grimmauld Place in OotP until he's given the secret. And the secret only has the fact that it's HQ to the Order, so it's not even that the location of Number 12 is the secret. So a Fidelius, at least when applied to a location, removes exact knowledge of the location (you would likely remember there being a house between 11 and 13 if you lived there, but not anything exact), removes the location's existence from anyone's perspective who isn't in on the Secret, and removes the knowledge contained within the secret (even if you knew of Number 12's existence prior to the Fidelius and that the Order HQ was there, you might have vague memories of something being there but wouldn't remember the Order being there).
