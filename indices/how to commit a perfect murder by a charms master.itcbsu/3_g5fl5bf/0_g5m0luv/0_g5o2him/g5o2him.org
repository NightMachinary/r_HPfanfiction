Well, I don't think it is in canon, but if it isn't the charm is way to powerful.

My head-canon is that any preventative measures that show a lack of trust in the secret keeper break the charm, which includes using yourself, and having the keeper hide under the charmed area.

Although your method /does/ work if you have an accomplice... *wink wink, nudge nudge*
