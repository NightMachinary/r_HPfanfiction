ah, well ive got you there - it is the unlikely murder that always escapes - if you were to murder with a pre-abrihamic ritual sacrifice then you cant be pinned because nobody will be able to guess the correct cause of muder other than the individual injuries and of coarse 'who would use a unknown pre-abrihamic ritual sacrifice to murder someone'.

sorry lad i have a really twisted sense of logic sometimes which although twisted worse than a bent spoon is also some of the weirdly correctest logic a person can have. have a good day.
