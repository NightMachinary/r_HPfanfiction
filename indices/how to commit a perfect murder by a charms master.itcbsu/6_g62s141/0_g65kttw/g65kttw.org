im pretty sure the limit is it has to be a tangible, at the very least semi material (im thinking ghosts) thing, so you cant hide a concept or an idea with it but hiding something say a person should be within the bounds of it.

and the reason why is because we dont talk of thank.... 'hint hint nudge nudge plot hole nobody fought to fix or truly exploit in the creation of the story (which really annoys me, this spell to me is like the reparo charm - so broken and yet so grossly underappreciated)

so to answer your question he could of 'but harry had to have some way to defeat voldi RIIIIIIGHT' so it was completely ignored and used as a plot devise for the potter murder and that was it i believe in cannon.
