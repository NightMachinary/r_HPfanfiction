I don't know about others, but I have this headcanon based on how the Potter murders happened that there is a trade when you set up a fidelius. As it's literally 'trust' and you bind the secret in their soul magically, any sign of distrust or lack of faith in the secret keeper will destroy the secret.

Things like additional wards or obliviating the secret keeper shows lack of faith. It is explicitly stated multiple times that in magic, belief that it works is a core component. It is also my headcanon of why James and Lily couldn't be their own secret keepers, when it works at other times. They were told about the prophesy and it tainted their subconscious, making them believe they couldn't keep themselves protected...requiring them to choose someone who didn't know not to believe. Also answers why Dumbledore couldn't do it.
