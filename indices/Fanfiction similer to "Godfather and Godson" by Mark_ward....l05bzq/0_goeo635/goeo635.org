By far the fanfic that feels the most like Godfather and Godson is "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold" this was on my to-read list for a long time because it sounds ridiculous and insanely long, I didn't get to it until Covid gave me free time. It is one of the most unique wbwl stories out there, and one of the best. This Harry essential has to build his political and business empire from just the Slytherin name alone after being sent back to his child self's timeline (kinda confusing to describe, but that's the Harry from a second timeline being sent to a third). During all of this he takes revenge on his brother and parents for making his lifetime in three timeline so shitty, and to seduce the harem of his brother from the second timeline before his brother was sent back (brother from the first timeline sent back to second where he messed up and Harry was sent back before him in the third so neither have actually technically even met, it's not that hard to understand really lol)

Zaxarus's Second Chances Series feels more serious and is very well written, it is a story where Sirius contacts Harry's godmother Roxanne Green grass to get him between third and fourth year. It deals with the family background a bit and new ideas like church involvement but not a big emphasis on houses.

Teufel1987's Rise of the Wizards has a Harry who comes into his own culminating in becoming emperor of the world by taking tropes and bashing in an original way, even explaining how wizards had to listen to muggles until Harry subverts that too.
