  On a raid Kaien makes a disturbing discovery in a basement, an entirely new species of vampire, one that can be temporarily stabilized with... a certain bodily fluid, and descends to an animalistic level E when starved, returning to sanity and humanity only after being... ahem fed.Romance eventually, yaoi, het, nightmarish fetishes you probably don't want to think about.
