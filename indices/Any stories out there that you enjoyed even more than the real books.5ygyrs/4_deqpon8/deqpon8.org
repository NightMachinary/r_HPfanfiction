I'm only comparing fics that go through all or part of their 7 Hogwarts Years. Postwar, Marauder-Era, One-Shots and Time-Travels are not included. In that case, there are still several fanfics I prefer over Books:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Now, that's how I expect wars against genocidal terrorists would be fought.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: I like this story far more than canon Series. Dumbledore, the Order, and Harry were actually bloody dangerous here, but Riddle had some serious advantages. Fortunately, Hermione and Ron picked up the slack.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Obviously

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(9863146;12088294): World building is so much better in this fic, and adults were NOT useless.
