In response to your first question, quite a few. linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) is my favourite comedy, while linkffn(Looking Beyond by shinigamigirl196) is my favourite canon rehash (I read it more than the actual books, so that should tell you how much it sticks to the stations of canon). linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) is /probably/ my favourite dark story, though it does seem to try too hard to be dark and edgy every now and then.

No to your second question.
