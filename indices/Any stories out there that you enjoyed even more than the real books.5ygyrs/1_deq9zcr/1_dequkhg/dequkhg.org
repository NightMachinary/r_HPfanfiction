I disagree. I think that, while its premise is good, and it even does some tropes well, overall the plot is way too convoluted and boring. I think I stopped about 75% of the way through the first year, simply because of the constant collecting of friends and the overcomplication of magic. From what I read about the later part of it, it only serves to get more convoluted.
