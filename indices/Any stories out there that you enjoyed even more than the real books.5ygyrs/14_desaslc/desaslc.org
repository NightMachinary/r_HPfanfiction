Considering that I majorly dislike the books and think that Rowling is a mediocre writer, the bar for fanfiction I like more than the books is pretty low.

Yes, she made billions. No, I have not. Doesn't mean she didn't completely miss on the potential of her idea, *in my opinion*. Plot holes, ridiculous scenarios, constant duex ex machina, fundamentally unlikable characters, the list goes on and on.
