To be fair you tend to take a pretty negative view of most stories. I actually don't recall you ever recommending anything so I'm not sure what you even like.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not disagreeing with you in this case. HPMOR better than the books? Seventh Horcrux? The latter is competent but groundbreaking it is not.
