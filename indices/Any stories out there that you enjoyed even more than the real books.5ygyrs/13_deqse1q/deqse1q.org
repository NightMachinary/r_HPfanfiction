Yes, I didn't like books 5 and 6; I actively hate book 7. For that matter, not too chuffed up on book 1. I have only watched the first three movies.

Series I've enjoyed more than the books:\\
Linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the thorn circle; The Seventh Horcrux; Too Young to Die; G is for Gabrielle)

There are more, but my memory isn't amazing so those are the ones that come quickly to mind.
