It's a somewhat popular complete Harry Potter fanfic called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Noteworthy for its annoying main character, various attempts to criticize JKR's worldbuilding, and author tract for his brand of rationalism, it garners a lot of criticism in most HP fanfiction communities, including this one. It is very long. I'd characterize the writing as technically middling, which is above average for fanfictions in general but below average for /good/ fanfictions.

People tend to have strong opinions pro- and anti- HPMOR.
