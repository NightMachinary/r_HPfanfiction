Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. A rather contentious story around here. It wavers between serious and crack with abandon, suffers from a "Harry is the only smart person around" syndrome and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster][author filibusters]], features a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge][fridging]], and ends with an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][idiot ball]].
