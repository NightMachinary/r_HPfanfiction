Skyehawke was an archive. In the old days, it was THE place for quality fiction because authors had to be invited, which meant they could be choosy and only pick those who wrote quality stories (as opposed to FFN who let anybody join and upload, as long as they claimed to be at least 13).

One of the things they had was "top 100" lists of stories, authors, etc. I discovered a lot of authors by reading through those lists, and also checking the favorites of the authors I liked.
