Canon Harry as in Harry that has already been to the wizarding world and through school suddenly going back to fanon Slytherin house? Canon Harry that has only been to the wizarding world once with Hagrid, being sorted into Slytherin house? Logically I think these two would be vastly different. I can't immediately see why the Harry who has never been to the wizarding world would be uninterested in politics and titles if his peers told him he needed to know these things.
