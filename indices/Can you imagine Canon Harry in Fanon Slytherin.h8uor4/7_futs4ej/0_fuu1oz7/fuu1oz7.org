Possibly, but he's also used to being completely ignored and doesn't really seem to mind it.

As is also often pointed out, Harry is often a sarcastic little shit with 0 compunction about breaking rules for any kind of reason.

As we see with Lily and Snape, cross-house friendships are also possible during the Voldemort years, and Harry's obviously at school after most people have given up on Voldemort.

It's Chamber of Secrets where I can see things becoming a Big Deal unless Harry has alienated everyone in Slytherin totally.
