Er, what are you arguing here -- that this doesn't make sense and isn't the case in Canon? Because that's obviously true, and ends any argument from the get-go. But it's also irrelevant, if you construct an AU premise where (certain) Purebloods /are/ the wizarding equivalent of nobility. I thought we were arguing about the latter.

Further, I was talking about growing up in a way where 12 or 14 was considered, in many important ways, the begin of adulthood. The theory of regarding children wholly as "little adults" in mediaeval times is nowadays controversial (cf. the Ari√®s-Orme debate), but the fact that duties could begin a lot earlier than today is not. I'm not an expert by any means, yet it strikes me as not an unreasonable outcome that such an upbringing could lead to behaviour as is typical in trope-y Slytherin; but at any case, you don't have to make an /historical/ argument, just one that can plausibly suspend disbelief, and IMO, that it does by any means.
