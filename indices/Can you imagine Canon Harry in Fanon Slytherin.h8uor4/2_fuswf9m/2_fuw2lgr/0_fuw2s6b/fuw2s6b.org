I've actually spent a significant amount of time with children who went to Arthurian Schools in the UK.

Absolutely none of them act like that. It is completely absurd, not to mention the school is at best 1/4 like that.

Furthermore there is absolutely no evidence of them being nobility, or anyone respecting anything close to the concept outside of the Blacks.
