Well, the entire premise is people in (Fanon-)Slytherin /aren't/ just any normal British student, isn't it?

Whether you like that is a matter of taste, but I would argue it's internally consistent. They are raised as heirs to 1,000 years of lineage, quasi-nobility in a mediaeval sense where 12 year old children must be "grown up", and the result is you get lots of children that are miles away from what you'd consider children today. And those people you then toss into one closed setting, and of course they're going try out what they were raised to be, imitating the adults they saw, leading to self-important bartering over Transfiguration essays in the first year, and alliances to last a lifetime in the last.

As far as I'm concerned, that's the appeal: If it /were/ just any normal students, it'd hardly be necessary to write such AUs, because there's plenty of that Canon.
