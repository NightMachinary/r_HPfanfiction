Or maybe some Slytherin students (not nessesarely just Draco) would have lived in kind of isolated place with lot of people who acted inthat way, that they never knew that it wasn't the normal way of conduct in modern times, as they crew up believing that's polite way to behave. So when they arrive at Hogwarts they are tought by the older students about how things really are and how the way they behave only really fits in with the super snobby pureblooded circles, but among everyone else they would seem odd.
