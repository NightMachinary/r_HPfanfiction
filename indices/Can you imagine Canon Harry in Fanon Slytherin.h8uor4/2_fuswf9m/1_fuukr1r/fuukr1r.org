NOTHING turns me off a fanfic like the "well met, Heir Malfoy" shit.

Yes, the Slytherin's are generally privileged. Yes, their parents are probably political animals if they were Slytherin themselves, and I'm not opposed to the idea of wizard aristocracy, I mean it is the UK after all and we are collectively up the class systems arse.

But no one, absolutely no one, talks like that. It makes the kids sound like they're actors from Georgian times doing a shit play about medieval knights. Do we think Malfoy will have posh manners that he can use when made to eat dinner with posh mates of his dad's? Yes absolutely. Do we think he'll use that at school when talking to, for example, Neville Longbottom? Hahaha no. Kids are still kids, and even ones who know how to behave in "high society" are still little arseholes once no adult is watching.
