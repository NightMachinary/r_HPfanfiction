I always figured it was thanks to wanting Slytherin House to be a house with people who aren't just cookie-cutter bad guys and bullies. After all, it's supposed to be the house of the ambitious and filled with little lords and ladies. Surely they'd have at least a bare minimum of political savvy, right?

J.K. Rowling simplified them into being easy villains for everybody to dislike, but a lot of fanfiction writers think that making a fourth of the population into stereotypical bad guys is stupid.
