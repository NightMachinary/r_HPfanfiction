Well yeah, but Malfoy's also a shit Slytherin. The only thing he has going for him is ambition, and he's so spoiled that he has no sense of how to achieve his goals.

Honestly I've always assumed most of the *smart* Slytherins of Harry's parents' generation left Britain so as not to get dragged into Voldemort's little tantrum. Why else would there be about the same number in Harry's years as the other houses when the rest of the families who'd usually sort to other houses got decimated in the war?
