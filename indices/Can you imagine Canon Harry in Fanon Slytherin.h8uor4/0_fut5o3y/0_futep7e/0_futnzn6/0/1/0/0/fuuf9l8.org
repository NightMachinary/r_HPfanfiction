Then again, you do not have to have a lot of O.C. and flesh-out a lot of characters.

If you follow a character in Slytherin, and telling their story, you get to show a lot about the house, without having to flesh-out all the character in said house.

Many of Griffindor's students aren't that flesh-out. Oliver Wood must have been more than Quidditch. And yet, that's the only thing he does or care about on-screen.

I think a lot of author mistake is to want to flesh-out all of her O.C.

Sometimes, you need a character to drive the plot, a point, or just to show that it's a general attitude in a group, and that's it. Give him/her 2 or 3 traits so they are recognizable a bit more than by name, two lines, and it's enough. Let the reader imagine what they want after that.

Or make the O.C a counter-example of what is the general attitude. If I'd imagine Slytherin mostly reserved in showing their emotion, create Johnny McDought, from the McDough family, and show him here and there overreacting to stuff, and that being frown upon by others, nameless background characters.

"Johnny started to jump up and down in excitement. But the glares of all the other students present made him stop immediatly".
