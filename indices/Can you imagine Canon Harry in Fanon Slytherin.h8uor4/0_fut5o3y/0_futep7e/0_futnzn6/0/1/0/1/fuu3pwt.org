I'm hoping that using a Muggleborn with close friendships outside their house will allow me to explore some of the headcanons I have about Hogwarts, while at the same time allowing for some world-building and plot.

I don't plan to have a full ensemble, but to have a core group of main characters, and limited interactions with other "minor" characters. With all the fics I currently have on the go, I am challenging myself to keep to the limitations and "feel" of the main character filter (Harry in most cases, but my OC in this non-Harry-centric one I'm writing).
