As someone writing a fanfic with a muggleborn whose first year is starting maybe 2 years after Harry's victory over Voldemort, I totally agree with this interpretation!

Canon Slytherin isn't full of these Machiavellian masterminds, it's mostly kids who want to get a short-term payoff against people they're prejudiced against!

Having said that, it's ripe for a bit of rehabilitation (hence me sending my poor muggleborn OC there!)

I think the fanon needs to take the Sorting Hat's warning more seriously... let the houses of Hogwarts mend their differences!
