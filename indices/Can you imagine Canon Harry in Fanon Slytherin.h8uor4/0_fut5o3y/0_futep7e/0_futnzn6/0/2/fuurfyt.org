Good to see I was not the only one to find it strange to have 11-year-olds being small politicians and playing power games in some version "Game of Thrones KIDS" before puberty.

I can see older students doing something like that, making connections and all, but eleven-year-olds? Get that shit outta here, most lack the emotional maturity to not throw a tantrum, what's to say of masking emotions, lol, and if they can do that, well, they are not regular children.

If I wanted to write something like that, I would probably skim through years 1-2 and start all that drama around the later part of 3 or the beginning of 4 where puberty kicks in and some can already show some adult maturity depending on how they were raised.

Before that, I would expect them to be like kids from aristocratic/rich backgrounds, overly polite, with above-average vocabulary, and more than likely emotionally stunted, that when left to their own devices may go overboard.
