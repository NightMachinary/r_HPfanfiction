I have to tell you, I'll be interest in a Slytherin written by you, or someone who have the same outlook than you.

I don't dislike slytherin in Canon. I'd be interested how the Slytherin traits (cunning, ambition, self-preservation) translate for teenagers, in an house full of them, in a world where they arguably can be the ones to fight against discrimination (because too many other people in hogwart are thinking Slytherin = Dark Wizard and that had to hurt, and be infuriating), while they are discriminating themselves.

I do like the idea of grey, in the context of achieving their goal, and where each character would put the line on how much they can bend a rule (of law, morality, etc) before it's too far.

But my idea of grey is "it's not good, but it doesn't hurt anyone/it will help more people than it will hurt". However, the idea of most auhor I read of grey is "It hurt people even kill them, but I don't care they were mean to me, once in 1st year".

So, in the end, Fanon Slytherin become Evil!House, at least to me. It feels like authors don't want to show us a different side of Slytherin, they just want to excuse and justify Evil!Slytherin.

Plus, I found it utterly ridiculous that teenagers would be that involved in politics. Not even Prince William (IRL) was that stuffy and exposed and involved when he was a teen (according to everything I read about English Royalty), and the guy is going to be the King of England.
