Honestly it's probably bc they're supposed to be the ambitious house and imo have some of the more interesting and politically minded traits. I get the “political mastermind 11 year olds” is a bit much, but 4th year and up coming into politics seems more realistic. Plus you'd think the rich/elite of society would teach their kids manners and some tact.
