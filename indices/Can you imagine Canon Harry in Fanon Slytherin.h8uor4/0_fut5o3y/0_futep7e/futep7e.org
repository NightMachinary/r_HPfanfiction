My guess? It came about due to:

Tom Felton = hot, Alan Rickman = hot, Daphne Greengrass (or random blonde Slytherin) actress = hot. Jason Isaacs = hot. Helen McCory = hot, etc.

Hot people = suave and savvy, supposedly.

Slytherin house = home of pure-bloods and the like who are all a bunch of haughty scoundrel --- ahem, 'misunderstood people'.

Put 'em all together, whitewash most of 'em, and add in some Lords and Ladies stuff, too, just to make everything seem 100% more suave and political --- and thus the best house in the school.

This would totally complement the idea of making Slytherin into this tragically misunderstood house that Dumbledore just hates, for whatever reason.

Insert 'Light', 'Dark', and 'Grey/Neutral' faction system to add even more political wank to the whole thing.

Right, what's next? Ah, let's add the occasional marriage contract or two to make things even more suave, sexy, and dramatic in the politically fuelled house.

It's like one idea linked up with the next, and so on so forth. Perhaps things like the Draco in Leather Pants trope also played their part in shaping fanon's perception of Slytherin as well.

Oh, and add a pinch of Edgelord-ness to the whole thing, too. So fanon Slytherin is the go-to house for angsty, authority-hating writers who want to make super-smart eleven-year-old political minions. Because a bit of 'Occlumency shields' trained from their families can totally trump the Manipulative Old Cootâ„¢, right?

Sorry if this post seems offensive to anyone.
