I think it doesn't help that all we know about Slytherin House in canon comes from very few sources.

The characters that appeared more than once where Draco, Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy.

And we know that with Slughorn some of the House returned and fought against the DE in the Battle of Hogwarts.

If we go a bit by the movies, we see them mingling with the other Houses like normal most of the time. And Rowling herself said a lot, after the books came out that Slytherin did automatically meant evil. I mean, /Merlin./

My opinion of the House? I think Slytherin has those that have the determination to achieve their goals almost over everything, they study because of a goal, not for knowledge's sake. They want to be the Wizarding equivalents of doctors, lawyers, judges, astronauts, politicians, etc..

I've met some people like that at school, and my impression of them is that they keep to themselves, only having a close-knit group of friends and not wanting to be involved in anything that would hamper their goals(like school fights or terrorist groups initiation).

So I think that in an environment like Hogwarts, with all the rivalry and stuff, they would just duck their heads and try to avoid all that, to not associate with any "side"

This would make the House be mostly divided between the vocal Supremacists(Draco and Co.) and the ambitious, generally self-serving people who see the school as a way to advance in life, not as somewhere to spout their beliefs(think Slughorn), the former seems to be more vocal than the latter.

Harry's perception of them seems to be colored a LOT by four members of that house(Draco, Tom, Lucius, and Snape), and he has little contact with anyone else.

Seeing Harry on canon Slytherin would probably make him an outcast or someone who would learn to keep his head down with a few friends.
