I actually love fanon Slytherin, especially linkffn(Travel Secrets: Third). And you are totally spot on. I kinda hate how Slytherins are portrayed in the books and the movies. I find it completely /ridiculous/ how all of these /purebloods/ raised in bloody /manors/ by /rich people/ don't have at least a little bit of manners.
