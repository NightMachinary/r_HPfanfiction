Helen McCory was a Bond Girl.

However, I always thought fanon Narcissa>>>>canon Narcissa, especially in the books.

Fanon Narcissa would probably be Lena Headey.

Most people always portray her as grown-up Daphne Greengrass.

I have no opinion on Alan Rickman, other than I think his portrayal of Snape is responsible for 90% of Mentor!Snape or Redemption/Secretly good stories out there.

Book!Snape was an A-class asshole.
