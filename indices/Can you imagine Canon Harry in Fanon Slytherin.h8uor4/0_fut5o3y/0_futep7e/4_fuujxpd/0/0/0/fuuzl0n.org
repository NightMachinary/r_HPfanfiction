Yeah, proof he was an asshole, and all the other times, like when he threatened to have Nevilles's toad poisoned and many other times.

Still, the actor was likable enough, and many times his portrayal entered more into being a sarcastic cynic rather than a man full of hatred.

Believe me, I was baffled when people started crying over Snape and how he was misunderstood. But the truth of the matter is he could've kept his cover without being an asshole and making children cry or hurt themselves all the time.

His character is complex, in the manner that his motivations were somewhat unclear until that last reveal, but more on the fact his behavior confuses a lot of people.

Also, dark edgy bullied guy with unrequited love is a common underdog trope, except for the fact Snape was in the equivalent of Hitler Youth of the time and called his "unrequited love interest" the equivalent of whatever disgusting name the Nazis had for the jews at the time, to her face.
