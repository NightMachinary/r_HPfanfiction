  I also don't think James and Co. were as bad as some of what you are describing

They clearly weren't.

Also, they weren't bullying Snape just to show how much stronger they were. They were bullying Snape for his views. At first, they completely ignored him (and Lily), until Snape came out as someone who wanted to be in Slytherin.

Not that it is good reason to bully. Of course not. But I'm tired of reading that they bullied him because he was quiet, and weaker, and for his appareance and so they could show how stronger they were. It wasn't it. It was the whole Slytherin thing, and then Dark Magic and "let's hang with future Death Eater" thing.
