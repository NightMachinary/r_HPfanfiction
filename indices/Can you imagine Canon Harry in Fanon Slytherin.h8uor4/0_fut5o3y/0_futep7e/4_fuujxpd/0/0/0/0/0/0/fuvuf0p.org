The thing is, I can relate to Snape to a point.

I was bullied at school. I now work at the same middle school I was bullied at. There's a few of my former bullies that had kids early and I get to see those kids everyday. I'm not a teacher, but still have to interact with those kids. Also, I'm 35 so close in age to what Snape was in the book.

I am in the position to have to guide and interact with the son of the guy that seriously told me to kill myself. (And the kid do look like his father, like a carbon-copy). Or the son to the girl that told me that my Dad must have died because he was ashamed of who he sired.

You know what I do with those kids ?Nothing differently than I treat every other kids. I'm more than old enough to understand that kids are not their parents and shouldn't be punished for what their parents did to me.

(I also did not joint the local far-right groups, nor ever insulted anyone who would try to help me out).
