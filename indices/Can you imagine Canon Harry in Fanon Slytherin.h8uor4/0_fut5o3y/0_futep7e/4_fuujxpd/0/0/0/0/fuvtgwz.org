I don't buy the "it's for his cover".

Say, I'm Malfoy Senior. I hear Draco telling all the stories how Snape bullies the other student.

I go to Snape and tell him "Dude, you're supposed to play the part of having switch to Dumbledore's side. Keep doing things like that, and Dumbledore and co will be suspicious and won't believe you switch side, and won't tell you anything. What kind of spy are you, really?????".
