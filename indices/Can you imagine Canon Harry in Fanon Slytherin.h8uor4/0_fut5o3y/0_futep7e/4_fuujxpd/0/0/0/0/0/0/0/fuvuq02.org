I can completely understand Snape not wanting anything to do with Harry, or having bad thoughts linked to him.

I also don't think James and Co. were as bad as some of what you are describing(honestly what the fuck is wrong with some kids, I saw some bad stuff at school, got in some fights with bullies, but nothing on the level of what you are saying).

But Snape brought it to a whole new level, he went out of his way to hurt Harry, and other kids too, in many ways that would have him be fired even from an American school.

And congratulations for being the bigger person.
