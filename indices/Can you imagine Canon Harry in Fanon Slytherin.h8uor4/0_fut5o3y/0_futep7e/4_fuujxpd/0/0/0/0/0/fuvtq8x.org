My thoughts exactly, what kind of double agent who's supposed to be playing for the light side acts as if he's on the dark side?

Especially when the dark side already expects him to act like he's on Dumbledore's side?

He was just being an asshole for being an asshole, and a childish one at that, making Harry suffer for whatever his father did to him, just ignore the guy and your cover would be safe. Harry was perfectly polite until people where pricks with him.
