Honestly that's a beautiful idea. We don't get to see many Slytherins actually having conversations in canon anyways, so it would be hilarious if Harry got re-sorted into Slytherin through some bullshit plot reasons, and he bonds with Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson and fucking Marcus Flint because they are the only sane people around.
