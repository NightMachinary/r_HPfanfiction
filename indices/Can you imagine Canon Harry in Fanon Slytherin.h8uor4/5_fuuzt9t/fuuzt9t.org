No, which is why Canon!Harry /isn't/ in Fanon!Slytherin. I'm not sure he'd survive the first year ... unless he became not Canon!Harry, fast.

So, conversely and more importantly, if I do pick up that bag of tropes, I can be sure I get the character traits I like with it. This makes it a rather handy shorthand filter to search for reading material, if you feel so inclined.

I wouldn't limit it to the typical trope-y Slytherin, though. Canon!Harry is a bad fit for any kind of Slytherin. He's very much the epitome of Gryffindor; without giving him a major overhaul, you just can't get around that fact. /Percy/ was more of a Slytherin than Harry. The line by the Sorting Hat is just nonsense, it's contradicted by the entirety of PS.
