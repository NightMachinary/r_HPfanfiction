Wow, I can say I never saw that crap, the most I have seen is they have Dueling Pit for settling disputes, but in most where they have this kind of thing, they just clear out the common room center and cast some charms to shield the other students and let them go at it.

I also could totally see Hogwarts having a secret inter-house Duelling Club.
