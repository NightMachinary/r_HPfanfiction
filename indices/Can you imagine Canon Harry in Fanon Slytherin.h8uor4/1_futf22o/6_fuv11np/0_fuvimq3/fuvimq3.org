It's not that I don't think Slytherin would totally love to one-up the other Houses if they could; it's that I can't believe that the other staff, under Dumbledore, would allow it. If the Slytherins got all the things listed while under Death Eater control, that's fine. But to be told that it's always been that way while under a Gryffindor Headmaster and Deputy Headmistress, I can't believe.
