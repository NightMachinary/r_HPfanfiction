Well, structural stuff (special rooms etc.) are a bit harder to change, so you'd think that if they are already there, even Dumbledore wouldn't bother getting rid of them just make things fair. All that is required that under, say, Phineas Nigellus-Black, they were created.

Then again, getting rid of supposed advantages in the name of /fairness/ is precisely the way (Fanon!)Dumbledore works, so it makes actually for a great plot! Slytherin had all this, and then in comes Dumbledore and takes it away -- dang, that must create resentment. Now I actually wonder if I could use this. Thanks for the ideas :)
