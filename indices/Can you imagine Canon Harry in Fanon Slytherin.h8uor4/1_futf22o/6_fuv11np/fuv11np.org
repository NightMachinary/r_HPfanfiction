  What I hate about a lot of Fanon Slytherin is how unfair it is to other Houses.

So ... in other words, it's exactly what you'd expect Slytherin to be?

Not that I agree with the premise, if Slytherin is the house of the elite (as the trope goes ...), then naturally that must be reflected in its structure, and that's not /unfair/, that's being resourceful in a very literal sense -- but if you already pull out the Hufflepuff values (/s), then you might as well play it straight.

And, of course, from a writer's perspective, the /unfairness/ is a great way to create the necessary tension in a plot.
