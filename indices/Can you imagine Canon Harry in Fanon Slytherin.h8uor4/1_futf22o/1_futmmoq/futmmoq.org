It makes sense if there are school-wide CLUBS for these things- toastmasters, ballroom dancing, strategy, book club, model wizengamot- but having them limited to a certain house is bound to get you in A LOT of trouble with the faculty. I'm surprised (but also not, I mean slytherins are all evil, right? (Sarcasm)) there wasn't more talk about how the DA didn't have a single slytherin in it and how that was exclusionary.
