I've seen some fics where the characters are all a little messed up in their own ways. Most of these are fanon depictions, but they seem common enough;

Ex. Draco Malfoy wasn't raised by his parents, but by the house-elf.\\
Harry Potter suffered 10 years of abuse at home + is an orphan\\
Hermione Granger was bullied all through school.\\
Ron Weasley suffers from self-worth issues; he wants to be noticed by his family, and all his brothers are super cool.\\
Daphne Greengrass is some misunderstood child that has to be cold to everyone for some reason, and she has almost no friends\\
Neville Longbottom suffered abuse from his relatives who wanted to activate his accidental magic\\
Luna Lovegood - bullied like all the time. Has no mum\\
Theodore Nott suffers abuse from his death eater dad, and his mum was murdered by his dad (and he saw it)\\
Lavender Brown is some girl that's only obsessed with looks/appearances and is super shallow/has no real friends.\\
Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle are actually intellectuals and kind people, but everyone treats them like shit.\\
Pansy Parkinson had a terrible home life, and she grew up modelled to marry Draco (???)\\
Millicent Bulstrode is the female equivalent to CRab and Goyle, but instead of dumb, she's ugly.\\
Tracy Davis suffers because she's a half-blood in Slytherin(??)

There are probably more, but I can't think of them rn.
