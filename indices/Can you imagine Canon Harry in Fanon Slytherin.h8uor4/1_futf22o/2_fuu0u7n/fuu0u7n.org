Or cave bathouse with hot springs under the lake, that connects to Slytherin dormitory, so they don't have baths within their common rooms and have to go to bath with all sexes together, at the same time Slytherins don't mind seeing opposite sex naked or opposite sex seeing them naked as it's Wizarding culture.. Like honestly as you said, their common room shouldn't be anythng special (or maybe all houses has one special thing), and any teens would be flustered with opposite/same sex and not want to been naked by them, and if SLytherins are supposed to be old fashioned, they should be even more so in most casees, at least I think in UK..
