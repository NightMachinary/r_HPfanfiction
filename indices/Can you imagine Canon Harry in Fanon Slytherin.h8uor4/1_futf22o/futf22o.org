What I hate about a lot of Fanon Slytherin is how unfair it is to other Houses. Slytherin students get private bedrooms, a ballroom, special ballroom dancing lessons, private potions labs and dueling rooms and a private library? REALLY?

Like, fanon Hufflepuff often have a sign-up sheet for tutors and student-mentors. I can believe that, and that somehow Gryffindor wouldn't take it if offered. (Maybe they're more free-wheeling). Or that Ravenclaw have a little mini-library that is just students sharing their books out voluntarily. But all this extra stuff for Slytherin is like they're living a different school life - and that the teachers allow it.

Oh, so no one knows what's going on in Slytherin except Slytherins? Even more unbelievable.
