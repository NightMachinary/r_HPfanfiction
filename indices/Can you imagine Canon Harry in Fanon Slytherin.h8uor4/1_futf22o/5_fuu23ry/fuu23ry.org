Ravenclaw has a private library. I do agree that the private bedrooms and ballroom and stuff is a little too much. Perhaps just extra etiquette lessons or whatever. I read a fic where McGonagall feels that her lions don't need etiquette lessons but all of the other houses take them. I'm more geared toward the older years only have to share with one other person or whatever, though. I'm doing a fic where Crabbe and Goyle share a room, Nott and Zabini share a room, and Harry and Draco share a room.
