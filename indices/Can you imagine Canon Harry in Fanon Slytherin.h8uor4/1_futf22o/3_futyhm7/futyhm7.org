Ooh, see I disagree about /some/ of this. The houses will have slightly different school experiences, because of their history and because of the views of the founders.

So the private bedrooms for Slytherin (and, in my mind, Ravenclaw) I can 100% get behind, because I think the founders would consider that the optimal environment for learning. Whereas Godric and Helga would have considered the team-effort approach more valuable.

Private lessons though, no. That may have been the original school setup, of a four schools in one type, where each founder taught their own apprentices separately, but that wouldn't have lasted to the modern day.
