  So the private bedrooms for Slytherin (and, in my mind, Ravenclaw) I can 100% get behind, because I think the founders would consider that the optimal environment for learning. Whereas Godric and Helga would have considered the team-effort approach more valuable.

I don't agree, because Hogwarts is supposed to have been founded in the 10th century. Even the existence of separate rooms for sleeping came after the medieval era (unless you were the lord of the castle, I think). Beds weren't that common, and they were frequently communal. Hogwarts students having their own personal beds would already be luxurious by early medieval standards.
