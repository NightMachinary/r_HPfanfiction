Bu muggle standards, when you have magic this can change.

And most monasteries/universities and other places of study did private quarters whenever they could.

Hogwarts has a lot of high-class stuff and in a world where they can conjure things and increase the size of rooms, I don't see why private quarters would be such a problem.
