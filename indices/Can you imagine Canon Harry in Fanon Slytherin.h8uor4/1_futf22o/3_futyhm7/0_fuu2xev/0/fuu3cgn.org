Well, some of the oldest monasteries (though admittedly these are 14th C) in the UK had individual cells for sleeping in, so this is what I have modelled my vision of Slytherin and Ravenclaw on.

A lot of what we see in Hogwarts is more modern than 10th C would suggest, so it doesn't seem terribly incongruous, and it lends each house its own character.

YMMV though, I'm not offended by people having different visions for the houses.
