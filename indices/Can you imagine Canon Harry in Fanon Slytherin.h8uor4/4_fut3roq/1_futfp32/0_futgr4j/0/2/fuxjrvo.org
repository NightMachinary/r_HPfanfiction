Possibly it got spread through the quidditch team. Draco mocks Ron to his team mates - there's enough of them to spread it to their mates (each house seems to have approx. 10 pupils per year). It starts with him saying something like 'Weasley's so shit, all we need to do is tell them and he'd let the quaffle in'. Then comes the joke about how he'd be their king and bam, you've got a song. Or, I guess, the Draco slaving over the idea.

They don't need to like Draco so much as want to take Gryffindor down, not to mention that it's catchy enough for people to remember.
