Crabbe and Goyle are his bodyguards and Pansy is more of a bully to Hermione than anything else.

That being said we never see any Slytherins roll their eyes at Draco's behavior or shake their heads at his antics. They always laugh along to his jokes and add their own jeers to the mix.

Also, it's implied that Lucius threw all that money around A) because he can, and that's a simple way to remind people of the Malfoy wealth, and B) because Draco really wasn't anything special when it came to Quidditch.

Also keep in mind that it was the worst kept secret that Lucius Malfoy had loads of money that he used to influence the Minister of Magic to pass laws /he/ wanted, and to install /his/ people into positions in the Ministry.

Oh, and let's not forget that Lucius was literally on the board of governors for the school, and managed to oust Dumbledore from the school at one point.

And of course, Lucius and Snape were always good friends.

If Voldemort had truly died on Oct. 31, 1981, Lucius Malfoy would have had a tight hold on the Wizarding World for decades to come, and everybody and their mother knew it in the Slytherin house, so they all sucked up to Draco.
