Yet, when he was arrested they had to break him out.

And Arthur Weasley punched his face in with zero consequences. In the middle of a crowded store.

Dumbledore said the next time he did something funny like the Diary he would kill him.

He ousted Dumbledore because he threatened to attack the other governor's families. Dumbledore returned as soon as things were sorted.

It took accusations of High Treason and Sedition with a lot of proof to even try to arrest the guy.

And Fudge would answer to anyone who had the money.

We see Slytherins following along because JK had no interest in developing the House, something she tried to correct, and most of this is seen from Harry's arguably biased perspective. We never see any other Slytherin not of his clique taunting him.

We also know Slughorn returned with a good number of them to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts.
