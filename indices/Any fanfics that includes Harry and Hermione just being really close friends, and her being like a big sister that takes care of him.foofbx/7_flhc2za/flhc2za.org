um I remember this in the linkffn(The problem with purity) but while I liked that fic when I was younger, its weird to read as an adult (how the story approaches sex and virginity, a snape/hermione pairing that's super toxic imo). But the harry part was nice? A lot of harry/draco fics have hermione friendship vibes.
