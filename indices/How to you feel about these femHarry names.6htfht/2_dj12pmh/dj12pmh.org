Gonna be a lot of opinions on this topic, but here's my two cents:

- "Harry" was chosen in part because it is a very normal and average name. A lot of canon focuses on how normal Harry is, honestly. Athena does not fit this trend.

- A sizeable part of fanon has decided that female Potters (fem!Harry or sisters or daughters) should continue the Evans family tradition of flower names. (Given that we only have two data points, it's a bit presumptuous to assume that this is a tradition, but this /is/ fanon...)

- Another part of fanon has decided that fem!Harry's name should be something that can be shortened to "Harry" as a nickname. I'm actually not personally a fan of this one, mostly because I think calling a woman "Harry" is odd.

Obviously, you're not going to be able to please both of the last two groups, but I personally fall into the normal flower name group.
