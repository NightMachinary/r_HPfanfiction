On a random note, not like you can't give someone pretty much any nickname that you want (for as long as it's not so bad that they tell you to go die in a fire, that is), and even nicknames that are based on names can get really ... stretchy, yes. As such, while it is not something you would normally call a girl, I can see /someone/, not everyone but at least someone, randomly deciding to do it.

Though, of course, for many people writing stories where characters have nicknames is too much of a hassle because sometimes the readers have problems with following the connections between characters and nicknames.
