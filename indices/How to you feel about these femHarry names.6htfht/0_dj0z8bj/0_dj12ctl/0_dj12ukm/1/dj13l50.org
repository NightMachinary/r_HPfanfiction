Yennefer is odd but not bad by any means. Most people who would like it are probably witcher fans, though. Otherwise I would do the more common Jennifer, but that wouldn't really fit a fem!Harry.

Evelyn is ok, but I don't like Athena. Always seems a bit arrogant, naming your kid after a god.

I personally prefer the names Hyacinth and Terra (Terra Potter. Earth Shaper. HahahahaI'llstopnow). Iris is another favorite, and I'm planning to use Daphne as a nickname for Daffodil in another fic.

Lotsa flowers out there, OP, go look 'em up.
