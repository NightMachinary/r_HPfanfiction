Two sides. You can either go with the Evans naming scheme, using flower-names, or you can use the Potter"-wifes" naming scheme which seems to be using rare and obscure names.

From the three, just by sound, I like Athena best. Athena as a mythological character is pretty interesting, and given her status as a warrior god with morals and ethics, rather than Ares, I think it would fit somewhat.

Iris would fit just because of the naming scheme, really. I'm not a big fan of Evelyn.

Names I like that are named in the Potter family history: Iolanthe (Link to the Peverell family), Euphemia (wife of Fleamont Potter).

Names that I like in general: Virgo, Freya, Imogen, Aria, Makena, Niobe, Gabriella, Damaris, Farah, Skadi, Laufey, Ambeth.
