  the Potter naming sheme which seems to be as stupid as humanly possible using rare and obscure names.

Uhh AFAIK we don't actually know any female Potter names that are canon. Euphemia married into the family and even Fleamont Potter was named like that because his own mother was the last of the Fleamont family or something. The only other names we know his James grandfather (Henry) and Hardwin (who married the Peverell girl).
