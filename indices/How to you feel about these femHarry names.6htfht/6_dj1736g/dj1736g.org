"Iris" could work, since it ties into the "flower name" theme from Lily and Petunia... but it's a little peculiar.

"Harry" is a very common name, and I don't think a Fem!Harry would have an uncommon or "special" name. I always cringe a little when I read Fem!Harrys named things like "Amaryllis" or "Monique" or, yes, "Athena." I don't think Lily Potter would have given her daughter a name like that.
