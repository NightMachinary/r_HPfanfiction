I'm not a fan of Yennifer, but I could see a wizarding couple naming their kid that. It wouldn't stop me from reading a fic, but I'd probably roll my eyes at it until I saw an author's note about it being the name of a character they like in a video game. Then I'd roll my eyes, go okay, not feel the need to roll them again, and get back to enjoying the story.

The only name that has ever so completely turned me off a fic that I couldn't get past the summary because of said name was Harribelle.
