My take:

Iris is good, since it fits with the Evans family naming theme of flowers. It's a bit obscure, but still good. The symbolism is good, too.

Athena is a pureblood wizard name, and not one the Potter family would have used either. It's a good name for the setting, but not for that character. (Since Harry isn't very wise or a paragon of civilized-ness.) It would be an interesting alternate name for Hermoine.

Evelyn is an interesting choice, but doesn't really fit with her parent's naming conventions. Plus the symbolism is... odd for Harry (but good for a fem!Ron, actually)
