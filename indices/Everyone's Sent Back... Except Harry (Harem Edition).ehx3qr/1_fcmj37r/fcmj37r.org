Plot Twist: Ginny has a moment of brilliance and realizes that seven people with the walkthrough is better than one. And that if you can't beat them, join 'em. And Daphne is hot.

I would read this. For the Sisterhood of the Little Brother. That seems like it would be hilarious. Especially if they have a Bravehart like scene where they all charge #4 Privet Drive to free their little brother from the wretched abusive muggles. The funny part is, they don't even have to be /that/ abusive. In the Sisterhood's mind, anybody who doesn't recognize the greatness of their Little Brother is worse than Hitler. That's why Dobby is their official House Elf.
