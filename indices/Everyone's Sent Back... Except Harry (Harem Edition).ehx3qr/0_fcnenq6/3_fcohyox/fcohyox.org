The name of the only story I've found that comes close to this escapes me at the moment, but basically all the standard Hogwarts harem girls Tracey/Susan/Daphne/Luna/Ginny etc. realize that they all want Harry and compete to win his affections. I think Ginny tries to team up with Hermione but Hermione betrays her so Harry ends up with Hermione and Daphne
