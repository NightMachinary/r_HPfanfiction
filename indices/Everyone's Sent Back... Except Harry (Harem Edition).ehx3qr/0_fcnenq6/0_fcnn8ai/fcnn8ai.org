A lot/most harems have this outside of fanfiction. For instance, in Fate: Stay/Night, if Rin is closer to Shirou, she's fine with sharing him with Saber, but if Saber is closer, she doesn't want to share. Neither of them want to share with Sakura, but Rin won't compete with Sakura, and Saber's feelings vacillate between platonic and romantic a lot. That's not getting into Ilya or Mitsuzuri.
