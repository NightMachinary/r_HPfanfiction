This got me thinking. You know how in most harems, the girls are somehow totally fine sharing the man?

I want to read one where they still have the hots for him, but are not-so-okay with sharing. At least not with so many others. Since they understand they might not win him over alone, they form alliances and compete to be his #1. Cue lots of backstabbing and intrigue and thinly veiled insults and catfights.

Basically, harem politics.
