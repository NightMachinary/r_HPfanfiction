My usernames are usually a 'mask', I guess. for this username it's usually socializing in forums, and video games. For another username it was for programming talk, and chat rooms. Then for another it was for Minecraft(when I was really into it).\\
I have noticed I generally act different when I have a different username, or maybe it's just the situation.
