Personally, I don't think too hard about people's usernames. It can be hard to be original when so many have come before you and picked the good ones already.

Though, if you give yourself one like RonMione4ever, I do feel you're limiting what people expect out of you. A username like that does cause one to think you'll only ever write Ron/Hermione as a pairing.
