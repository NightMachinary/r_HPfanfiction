I've been ScottPress since my CoD days. I usually give a bit of thought to a new username when I'm creating it so that I don't end up hating it in a week. Atm I'm using two primary ones, though there's a third one that I dust off on rare occasions. I quite like the nick ScottPress. It's neutral enough that it'll fit anywhere, but with a bit of uniqueness to stand out just a bit.
