I don't notice usernames at all when considering reading a fic. I can see why an author might consider it carefully! But coming up with a username can be a stressful and frustrating experience-trying to find something that's not taken but is still clever and good... I hate it. Plus, people change so their username might not reflect them any more but they may want to keep it because that's how others know them.
