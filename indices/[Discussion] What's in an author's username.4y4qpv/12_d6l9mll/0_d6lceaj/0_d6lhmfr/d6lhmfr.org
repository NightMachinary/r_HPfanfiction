Cole Pascal loves contemporary westerns and has an idea for a paranormal contemp western---longmire meets dresden files. CB Pascal has an idea for a police procedural taking place in a dystopic future, in fact---CSI meets Shadowrun, basically. I do write romance. And occasionally lesbian erotica. (Male)
