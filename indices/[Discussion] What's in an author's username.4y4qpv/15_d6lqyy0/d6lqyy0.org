I chose my pen name from a phrase in a song that was playing while I was creating my account: asecretchord. As far as I know, the site where it was created was not case sensitive at the time or I was just too lazy to make it upper and lower case. /shrugs/ At any rate, I like it and it's easy to remember. I have no idea what it might connote, but readers seem to like my stories, even if my ship is "problematic."
