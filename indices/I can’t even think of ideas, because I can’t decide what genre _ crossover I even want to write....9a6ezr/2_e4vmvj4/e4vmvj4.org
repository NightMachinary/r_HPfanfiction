Go to [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]] and write stuff in response to random requests, and when you find something that you liked writing and that would be a good match for a HP story idea just go from there. I've seen stuff like that happen, though not necessarily with fanfics: one of the authors whose snippets I liked and followed went on to make one of them into a whole series and then into a book that's actually being sold and that I think is worth the money.

Alternatively, just pick whichever idea and start writing, even if you start at some random scene that's twenty chapters into the story, and let actually writing it speed you up to the point where you can write your chapter one.
