Start writing these. You will realise that most of these ideas aren't feasible, the novelty wears off or you don't have more than one or two scenes thought out either way. Keep these fragments around and sorted (give each a descriptive name, 1 folder for crossovers, one for Harry Potter stuff, one for each other fandom) because you might get some inspiration for one of them half a year later.

That is pretty much the thing I do, and I have like 30 of these plot bunnies on my GDrive, and maybe 5 of them will eventually be published. You will eventually notice which ideas have merit and which are just some random thought which went nowhere.
