  Why did Dumbedore tell not only the students but Quirrell that the 3rd floor corridor was forbidden? Why didn't he create a age line so that no one under the age of 17 could get in?
#+end_quote

The dead troll is precedent for having obvious traps in the way that Voldemort had bludgeoned his way through. It would have cost little to show two or three more of those, but more obviously dangerous. An age line might not have been appropriate -- unless it were set to something greater than Quirrell's age, or unless it were bound with other protections that Voldemort would have needed to remove.

Doesn't alter the result, does underscore how dangerous the situation is and how powerful Voldemort is, takes /maybe/ two extra pages. But it's the sort of thing that you likely wouldn't notice even after editing.

  Why would you allow Dementors at the school?
#+end_quote

They were allowed at the border of the school grounds, officially, but they exceeded their mandate.

  I get that they were hunting for Sirius Black but did they really need Dementors?
#+end_quote

This is actually a pretty believable part of the story. It was Minister Fudge employing the age-old syllogism: something must be done, this is something, therefore we must do this. The Dementors didn't help. It was obvious they wouldn't help. But it was a simple thing for him to order, and it was a public sign that he was responding to the situation.
