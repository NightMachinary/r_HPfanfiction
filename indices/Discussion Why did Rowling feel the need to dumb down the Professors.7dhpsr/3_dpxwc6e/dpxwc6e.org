  Why did Dumbedore tell not only the students but Quirrell that the 3rd floor corridor was forbidden? Why didn't he create a age line so that no one under the age of 17 could get in?
#+end_quote

Because she wouldn't think of an age line for another 3 books.

  Why didn't McGonagall do anything when Harry, Ron and Hermione told her that they knew about the stone? Even if she didn't believe that anyone was after the stone she should have done something about the fact that three first years ended up finding out about the stone.

  Why did Dumbledore have Hagrid get the stone out of Gringotts? Especially when he was with Harry, eleven year olds are naturally curious, Dumbledore should have had anyone else get the stone, either Snape or McGonagall would have been good. And it definitely shouldn't have been when Harry was there at Gringotts to see it.

Convenient timing. Or children's boarding school story. Take your pick.

  Why did McGonagall send first year students to the Forbidden Forest for a detention when there was something out there that could destroy unicorns?
#+end_quote

Because Hagrid knows his shit about the Forest, and nothing out there is gonna mess with him. Or children's boarding school story. Take your pick.

  Why was it that Harry, Hermione and Ron were able to get through the traps that were hiding the stone? Harry was the youngest Seeker at Hogwarts in a century, Hermione was one of the brightest witches, Ron was great at Chess. And the Troll; if the troll had still been up the gang would have likely been able to attack the troll since they did it before.
#+end_quote

Those weren't traps guarding the Stone. They were there just to slow down the thief over the school year, so the attempt would take place both after the Stone was placed in the Mirror and hopefully after the school year finished. Or children's boarding school story.

  Did Dumbledore never ask Myrtle how she died? Obviously he knew or at least guessed that Riddle did it, but he never asked her how she died once she became a resident at Hogwarts. It took a twelve year old boy (Harry) to ask her. And it took a thirteen (I think she was thirteen) year old girl (Hermione) to find out what the monster actually was. If she could find out what the monster was why didn't the Professors?
#+end_quote

Dumbledore wasn't Headmaster when Myrtle died, Dippet was. Or children's boarding school story.

  Why would you allow Dementors at the school? Creatures that could suck out your soul; that is extremely dangerous, I get that they were hunting for Sirius Black but did they really need Dementors?
#+end_quote

Not Dumbledore's decision. Or children's boarding school story.

#+begin_quote
  And other similar things that just feels that Rowling dumbed down the Professors for plot convenience.

CHILDREN'S. /BOARDING./ *SCHOOL.* =STORY.=

  Harry was the hero of the story

That.
