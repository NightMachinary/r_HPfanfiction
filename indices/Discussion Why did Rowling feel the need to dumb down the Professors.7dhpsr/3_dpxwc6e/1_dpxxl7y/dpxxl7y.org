I get what you're saying, I do; it just seems like poor writing or just plot convenience as I said that the Professors didn't do anything to be more helpful.

Yes Harry was the hero of the story but heroes can have help, Dumbledore was a very quiet man, he didn't like telling people his plans even though he probably should have.

Why did he take the stone out of Gringotts? If he wanted it safe he could have been carrying it. Or kept it in his office heavily guarded.

I don't know when Dumbledore became suspicious of Quirrell but the fact that Gringotts was broken into should have made him think of a better plan for the stone.

Dumbledore wasn't the Headmaster when Myrtle was killed, but he was still a Professor. A professor that was skeptic of Tom Riddle, and didn't believe that Hagrid was guilty of killing Myrtle. If he was truly curious and suspicious he could have still checked things out. Hermione found out what the monster was, if Hermione could have done it Dumbledore could have as well and Hagrid wouldn't have gotten his wand snapped.

That is fair about the age line, it seems like some things she just thought up on the fly; but even so there could have been something else if not the age line to stop the students from going to the 3rd floor corridor.

And yes I get that it's a children's boarding school story and there are going to be things written in a way that's meant more for children then adults but the adults could have still helped protect the school and protect Harry and everything better. I don't know, maybe it's just me.
