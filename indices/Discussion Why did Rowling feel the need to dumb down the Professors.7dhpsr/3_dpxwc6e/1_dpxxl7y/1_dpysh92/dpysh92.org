i could extend your List. While i do "eat" some of your Points, because "its a childbook series" (my favourite excuse for the Plot holes in the Books, atleast until 5, anything above that is argueable).

Year 2: Looking at it as an "adult" its really unbelievable, that the Teachers would trade Lucky Charms after the Heirs Attacks, they are the most powerful People on that Grounds and the Attacker might be just an adolescence, tops, but he would be noticed, i guess. But from a childs perspective, it has something funny on it. Still, if Dumbles didnt do anything to stop, but trusted like in Year 1, that Harry and friends solve this Puzzle, than he was taking a risk in offering the students lives and THIS was something he didnt tolerate at all, atleast if you take him serious in Book 5 and 7.

Year 4: nobody was thinking about Harry disqualify the Tournament. It was mentioned once by Hermione speaking for the solving about the Lake riddle, but thats it. Why did Crouch waited a whole Year for the Tournament, while he could take Harry outside of Hogwarts and let him take the Portkey?

Year 5, ignoring the fact that Harry should keep himself calm (he seems to really think that everybody thinks, he is lying. Its not even enough that his Friends believe him, No, ALL People in the World have to believe him so that he can die in piece -.- He is like Hagrid in Year 4, but unlike Harry, Hagrid pulled himself together). Nobody was thinking about the Mauraders Map, when Harry wanted to check on Sirius, not even Hermione....oh, not to mention that i still miss an Apology from Harry after the Ministry fight. The fact that Rowling "cut" this out makes me think, that Harry is a stupid brat and he doesnt need to apologize to his friend for leading them in a live-threatening situation because he was to thick to think rationaly (not that i blame him fully, but still. Im really glad that he regretted it in th end), because its naturally, that he doesnt need to apologize.

Year 6, Ouch. Everything is broken. Nobody is believing Harry that Voldemort could choose Malfoy as a Deatheater, not even thinking about that Voldy only uses Malfoy. "Harry, i dont think, Voldemort would do such a thing", "By all respects! Does ANYBODY know, what happens in Voldemorts Head?!" (<<<THIS, great Job, Harry, wonderful, both Thumbs Up for you). The Fact, that neither Hermione nor Ron do believe him and just focus on their envious feelings is just for the Plot sake.

Year 7, one of the Things that annoy, no DISTURB, me most is that Rowling made a correction about the Fidelius charm, just like that...out of the Blue. Clearly because she had to solve the "Secret keeper is dead, what now" problem...Oh, and again Ron and Hermione dont believe in Harry about the places, the Horcruxes could be, just for the stretching of the Books sake.

And why doesnt anybody thinking about calling Kreacher to get rid of the Deatheaters in Grimmauld Place?! Because it would be Boring, if the Trio isnt in a permanently Life-threatening Situation that "Testing" their Friendship.

Lets not forget, that Rowling makes Harry into a Cheater, since he gains the Firebolt. WHO of the other Pupils parents has enough moneys (or is willing to) to buy such a High prized Item, just for School sport purposes? No one of the others Teams Seekers has a chance against him. It might be that Harry and the Enemy seeker are "Head-on-head" on some situations, but that is a mockery to the Enemy in my eyes. And in year 6 he becomes a cheater because he has access to better Knowledge about the Potions brewing (note: Harry NEVER admits, that its not HIS doing, just his Friends know about it). Hermiones bigotry and intolerance are argueable (i think)....hmm, she wont believe anything thats not written in Books.....but what about her Speech at Year 1 "There is more than learning and Books", if i take her by this, her Friendship isnt true.

But we do expanding this Thread to a High level, the Title of it was for the Professors and not for the Plotholes.
