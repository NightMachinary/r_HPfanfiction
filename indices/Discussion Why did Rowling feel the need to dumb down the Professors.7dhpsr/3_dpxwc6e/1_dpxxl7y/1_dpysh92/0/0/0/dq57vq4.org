Lockhart is only a witness because he's forced to be, and Ron ... well Ron might just be hardheaded enough to ignore a charm for Harry.

Sorry, I was thinking of the mirror Sirius gave Harry to talk to him at Christmas ... and which he forgot. If he'd used it the whole problem could have been avoided. I'd forgotten that they hadn't used the map. :(

Definite plothole, though maybe he thought that a bunch of Death Eaters were just sitting on Kreacher waiting for him to be summoned or something of the sort. Harry was never particularly sane, or logical. Maybe Hermione was on to something when she mentioned many of the greatest wizards weren't logical, perhaps magic impedes logic.
