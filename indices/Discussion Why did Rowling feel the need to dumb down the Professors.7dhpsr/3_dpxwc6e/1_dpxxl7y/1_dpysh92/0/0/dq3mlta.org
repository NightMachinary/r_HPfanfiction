Hmm, a Confundus Charm for the chambers Protection....But Ron and Lockhart are Witnesses as its opening.

Oh, right. If i remember Voldemort mentioned in the Beginning that it was yet to early to perform the Ritual and in the end he revealed that he was preparing for this Night to be "revived". Or that Voldemort had to get stronger by Wormtails "feeding" or he would be to weak to become as strong as he was before he vanished or to die during the ritual.

Mirror? I mentioned the Mauraders Map...Ginny and other DAs took Guard but was taken down by Umbridge. With the Map, they would had an alerting system.

True, the Fidelius was only mentioned in Year 3 and 5, but it was precise enough. If the new Rule was that any "keepers" became Keepers after the Mainkeeper dies, thatn the Guardians in Year 5 actually had to drag Harry into the Black House, instead of giving him the note. Nah, i dont believe the Trio suddenly dismissed in House-elf magic....remember, after their escape Harry was thinking about the Meal, that Kreacher had prepared and would now be cold untouched, HA! Plothole, Harry WAS thinking about the Elf, but the idea to use him for help wasnt coming to his mind, not even Hermione and Ron. The Intruding DEs would just be memorized to forget they visited and entered the House. I doubt there would be many Legeilimentics Among them. An obvious Plot hole just for the Thrilling sake, like i mentioned: it would be boring (would it really be?) if the Trio would have had a save place to return. Oh, nor that i think about: Kreacher wouldnt be alone, Harry could have ordered Dobby for Help. Jesus, Harry now that you are good friend with the Grumpy, you dont think about using him.
