While you're perfectly right it could be fun to come up with some (non-canon) explanations.

Year 2: Imagine you're Salazar Slytherin (a man with a known penchant for snakes). You expect it's going to be quite easy for anyone to work out what the monster you've left in the school is. However, you're a wizard who as a founder of Hogwarts has at least some notable power over it (enough to include a massive hidden underground chamber). Why not work in a self perpetuating confundus charm into the castle so that when the chamber is activated those who should be able to combat the threat are neutralised? Harry (as a parselmouth) is somewhat immune, and he always gets the right answer through the wrong steps anyway, so it's hardly the charm's fault if he gets there anyway.

Year Four: Similar to year 2, powerful magical artefacts change people's perception of reality, around their sphere of influence you actually CAN'T defy their intent. So, the Goblet of Fire binds Harry to the task no matter what. As for the abduction date, apart from Voldemort's insane melodramatic sense of fair play, it's approximately six months after his death-date, thirteen years after his defeat: there may be some arithmancy coming into play. If Voldemort captures him earlier he may fear that Dumbledore and co. will find Harry too early.

Year 5, are you actually talking about the mirror? I suppose you could suggest that Voldemort could have put in a subtle block about doing the sensible thing when sending him visions. He's certainly implied to have had that level power.

Year 6: I'm just going to abandon that one. It's a bad year.

Year 7: Maybe there have been advances in the charm theory for the Fidelius charm ... I guess that's possible. Maybe this is Fidelius Mark II. IT's about the only way I can even bear the disaster that that makes of James and Lily's attempt at hiding.

People seem very dismissive of house-elves powers, a bit bizarre, but it could just be cultural problem that even the main characters aren't free from? Also, getting him to do that wouldn't solve the problem permanently as long as any Death Eaters knew the secret, and at some point he might get killed like Dobby.

Anyway, that's all just for fun.
