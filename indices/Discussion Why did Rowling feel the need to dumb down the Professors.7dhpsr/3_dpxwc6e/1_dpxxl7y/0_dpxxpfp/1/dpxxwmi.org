I suppose, I just wish I don't know; that the Professors had been able to help more. But yes I get that it was a children boarding school story and that the professors had to be a little stupid for the plot, they just feel really stupid compared to the main group. Which is unfortunate. Wonder if there are any stories with the professors doing a better job; could be interesting, mhm. That could be an idea.
