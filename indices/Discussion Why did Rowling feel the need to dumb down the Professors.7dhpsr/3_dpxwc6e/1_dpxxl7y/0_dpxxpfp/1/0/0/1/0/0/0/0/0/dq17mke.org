Oh well in that case I can't really help you, that seems purely like a matter of opinion to me. I don't think it's fair to say it's a bad story just because you don't like the title or the concept. It teaches some really good lessons about morality and taking things (e.g. magic) I'm the world for granted and how not to do that. Its also a really good deconstruction of hp canon and all the silly things wrong with it.

Plus Dumbledore is freaking awesome . have you read it or were you just put off by the authors attitude? He's unapologetic about trying to make a controversial story.
