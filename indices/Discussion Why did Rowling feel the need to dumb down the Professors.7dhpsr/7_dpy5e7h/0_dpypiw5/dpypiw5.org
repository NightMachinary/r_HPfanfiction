oh, i wouldnt say, he "trusted" Fake Moody....well, ok, he felt "save" in his presence, because Crouch perfectly doubled Moody (not so obvious for the viewers sake in the Movie) and not even Dumbledore had any suspiciouns about his Friend, untill the End at least. So where is the Reason for NOT trusting this Man...or feeling Save in his Presence.

And About Sirius....you calling Harry a subjective Narrator, but there were also Hermione and Ron, not to mention Lupin. All of them were listening to the Confession Wormtail made. Harry was just happy that atleast one part of his "past" was still alive and he could asked Sirius anything about his Parents live. Maybe it would be an awkward situation since Harry believed a whole Year that Sirius was a Murder, but its just that he only known him before the Year began, because Sirius escaped.
