I like to imagine that the reason the professors seem so dumb is because they're worrying about bigger things and you literally don't see all the different things that the adults are doing to protect the kids because it's from the kids' point of view.

Highly subjective narrators, like Harry, artificially distort the motives and actions of others. It's important to realize that while reading any story, but especially the HP series where Harry does things like trust Fake Moody all year long and nearly die or go from wanting to murder Sirius to wanting to move in with him in ten minutes.
