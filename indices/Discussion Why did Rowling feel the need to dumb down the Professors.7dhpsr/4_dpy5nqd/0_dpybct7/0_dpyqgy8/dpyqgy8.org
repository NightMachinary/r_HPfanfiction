"Plans are everything, Plans are my live....I couldnt even go to the Loo without a Plan", seriously, thats what i disliked about dumbles. He doesnt recognize that plans could fail and the Fact that the 1. Detail that didnt fit into his Plan would break it, but he "assured" himself, that his Plan would still work, proves that he ignorant. He and Grindelwald were thinking about plans for the Greater Good and now see, where they ended. He decided again "for the better good", see where he ended. Actually anything since Year 6 was more or less pure Luck, beginning by his cursed Hand what definetly wasnt a detail about his Plan. Rowling needed Dumbles to die or else she would make Harry into an obvious martyr for Dumbles sake
