...Harry was always meant to try and get the Stone, Dumbledore deliberately dropped all those hints.

Dumbledore never thought to ask Myrtle because Dumbledore, for all he was a great wizard, didn't ask others for advice, or try to think of things outside his preconceptions. And to be fair. All she could tell Harry and Ron was that she saw a big pair of eyes. Most animals have eyes. An Acromantula could have stung her fatally before she got a look at anything but its huge eyes as it beared down on her, if she was caught by surprise by it.

As for Dementors, wasn't it in-text that Dumbledore was railroaded into having them at the school, it wasn't his idea?
