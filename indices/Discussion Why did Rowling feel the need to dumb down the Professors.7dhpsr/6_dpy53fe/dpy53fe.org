Bah writers using random acts of character stupidity to cause plot is a blight on good storytelling. And yet all the supposedly good writers (bookes, movies, games, doesn't matter) are apparently all lazy hacks.

I really think the story telling world would be better off if any would-be-writers were forced to DM a game of DnD first, hence being introduced to how to tell a story where you can't rely on characters being dumb just for your convenience.

With HP the problem is that is started as the so called "Children's boarding school story" or some such, where the tropes are expected, and because they are expected they are also accepted, and nobody looks too much into them.\\
But then it kept going into at least the young adult genre, which has ENTIRELY different accepted tropes. Looking back at especially the earlier books, well.... most of those tropes are really bad and have some rather unfortunate implications if viewed without the cover of being a children's story.

Personally I don't care for Doylist interpretations, I like my story to be internally consistent as much as possible from a Watsonian view. So when I look and see these implications caused by the wrong trope in the wrong genre, I much prefer the explanations that make some sense in universe, even if they are reaching (manipulative dumbles) rather then the much more boring explanation (Rowling is a shit writer).
