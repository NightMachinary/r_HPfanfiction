Well, Snape is Dumbledores "Spy" in School for the whole Years, despite Dumbledore "Knowledge of Everything" as he mentioned to Harry in Year 5. Dumbledore doesnt have trust (or dont see them capable to use lesser harsh words) the other teachers. The fact that Snape is the best occlumentic performer (besides Dumbles, maybe) proves that he cant read by the enemy on purpose. Still im wondering how Dumbles could "watch Harry in the distance as he fought the Dementors off"....and didnt do anything to help. Yes Snape is the only one that notices, because its his excercise to do this.
