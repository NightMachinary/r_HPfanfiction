I really like reading about Harry having (a few years of) an actual childhood, and a caring parental figure (albeit with his own issues). And Innocent doesn't muddy the waters with Sirius unlocking the uber-magic of the Black family and reclaiming his hereditary seat on the Wizengamot and learning all about Horcruxes from the letter that Regulus left him. Nope, he's just a person who tries to do his best for James and Lily's son.
