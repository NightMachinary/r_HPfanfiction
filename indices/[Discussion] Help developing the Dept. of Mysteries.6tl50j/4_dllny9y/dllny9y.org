I would not count Dementor's origin in their area of expertise, as for me Dementors are just another magical sapient species just like Goblins and Veela. They /would/ be studying their abilities, though.

Generally, I think Unspeakables are the scientists of magic, trying to understand exactly how and why it works, and occasionally build some neat stuff based on what they find. The Department is home both to powerful artifacts they tracked down and are now studying, and to objects they made themselves, like the Time-Turners, for the sake of experiment.

However, the terrifying truth is that most magic is only limited by how good the wizard is. The power an Unspeakable could wield is terrifying, and thus they keep their knowledge locked away, only releasing a finding when they're /really/, /really/ sure it's not going to blow up the Earth or something if it falls in the wrong hands.

An interesting tidbit: because of this approach to knowledge, the Unspeakables both admire and /hate/ wizards who had the talent to become Unspeakables but work solo instead and release their findings. On their "blacklist" are, among others, Nicolas Flamel, Dumbledore, and Herpo the Foul. On a related note, they also hate the Goblins of Gringotts for withholding dangerous artifacts as part of their Goblin ownership laws.

The Unspeakables, as herO_wraith suggests, probably don't care very strongly about Voldemort, or at least didn't before they learnt he had Horcruxes. I imagine with his talent he /would/ be on their "dammit, why isn't he on our side" list, (they'd doubtless be aware of his identity as Tom Riddle, I mean come on), but it's not like he's actually /done/ anything of interest to them with it. His only true creations we know of are the bad-memories-potion, and unsupported flight, and I have a hunch the Unspeakables already knew about the latter.
