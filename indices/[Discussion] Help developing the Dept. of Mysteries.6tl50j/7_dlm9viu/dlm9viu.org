The hall of prophecies is in the department of mysteries and the Unspeakables wrote the convenient signs of whom those prophecies speak of. So even if Unspeakables are anything more than scientists, they would know that Potter must have a go at Voldemort first. And if Potter fails, well i'm sure people have tripped through the veil of death before, provided The Unspeakables even have any real issues with Voldemorts agenda. For all we know they are all purebloods.
