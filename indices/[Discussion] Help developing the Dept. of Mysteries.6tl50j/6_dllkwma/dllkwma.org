I imagine Unspeakables are a little like the cast of Warehouse 13, in that they track down specific world breaking artefacts and solve spells that have more unusual than normal effects.

As for why the unspeakables were not involved in the Voldemort issues, my head cannon is that Horcrux tie you to the earth for your natural lifespan, for wizards that's about 200 years max without outside interference. It may seem heartless, but they might have a 'this too shall pass' sort of mentality when it comes to him.
