Ha! I knew I'd heard the term 'Warehouse 13' somewhere but I couldn't remember what it was referring to. I decided to name the Field team 'Section 13' for my fic. Thanks, I'll look the series up now.

I guess my headcanon where the horcruxes are concerned is that the items have a singular purpose and don't really get out into the wider world once made. On its own, the existence of horcruxes isn't particularly worldbreaking.
