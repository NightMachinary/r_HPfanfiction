  and how there's nobody still kept alive by horcruxes despite of how easy it should be to keep one hidden.

And how do you know that, pray tell? There could very well be some Polynesian Dark Lord or whatnot who's been around for 300 years, and we wouldn't know. More plausible still, there may be several Dark Wizards who have been stuck in "flying spirit" mode for centuries, because after all this time they have no minions left willing to do the "flesh of the servant" ritual; this is in fact my headcanon for the fate of the original creator of Horcruxes, Herpo the Foul, whom I imagine as still being locked up somewhere by the Greek Department of Mysteries, stubbornly refusing to give up the location of his Horcrux despite his abysmal state.
