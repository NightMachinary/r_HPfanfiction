I think that the Aurors are actually capable of handling Death Eaters, so it wouldn't matter how powerful or dark your magical artifacts are. The difficulty is in catching them. Even caught red handed, they can claim to have been under the imperio curse, so your unspeakables would have just released the bubonic plague on upstanding members of society.

That being said, I don't think they exclusively keep dark artifacts. They probably have things from muggle legends. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mythological_objects]]. There's more in that list than I could possibly imagine myself. Some may be suitable. As an example, there's a Welsh myth of a chess set which can play itself, which may have been developed into Wizard's Chess.

They also might have items with various curses and charms on them, either of unknown origin or to help understand and counter them.
