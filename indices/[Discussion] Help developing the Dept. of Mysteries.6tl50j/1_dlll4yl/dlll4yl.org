If you look at what they studied its all really vague. Love, time, death, thoughts, all concepts rather than things. They're searching for higher understanding of magic far beyond the comprehension of the average wizard. Far beyond any practical use. You could just say Voldemort is beneath them. They care not who is in charge, they don't care what people get up to when they're dealing with magic beyond all of that. Voldemort is a domestic political threat. He's a violent alternative politician as far as they care, so long as he doesn't interfere with them they don't care.

Things they would deal with would be keeping the dead dead. They guard the veil and hunt necromancers above all. They are behind the original love potions as they attempt to replicate the power that they have to keep locked away. Love is the only room they say is kept locked. They are the guardians of time. They ensure that time travel is never used in war. With the existence of prophecies they might believe in a pre-determined timeline and do their best to ensure it stays on course. They created the memory charm and legilimency as they attempt to work out ways to transfer thoughts and knowledge so as to be able to teach instantly. Unless Voldemort tried to war against magic itself they wouldn't interfere.
