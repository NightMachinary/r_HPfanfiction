Do you want a reason as to why they weren't involved in the canon fight against Voldemort? Or do you just want to write about something else and be able to give a reason as to why they're ignoring Voldemort?

Eitherway, most simply, the Aurors already exist. They deal with 'common' dark threats who don't deal in the secrets the DoM protect, so it would be a waste of resources to lower themselves to fighting the Death Eaters when their specialist skills weren't needed there, but were in fact needed elsewhere. It's the Aurors' jobs, so let them do it.

So that does all of the Death Eaters. Maybe they might be seconded onto an Auror team when occasionally a Death Eater gets their hands on something more powerful than normal.

Voldemort is a little more tricky. I would assume Horcurxes and his resurrection ritual would probably fall under their remit (though maybe just barely, so he slips under their radar as 'something we should get around to dealing with when we have the manpower). But maybe they could overlook him during the first war as he doesn't seem to rely on anything more experimental than Avada Kedava-ing lots of people, so they book him as nothing more than a more-annoying-than-usual-but-still-ordinary-mass-murdering-dark-wizard.

Basically develop threats that they specifically have to deal with and they'll not have any interest in going after people that the Aurors should be dealing with.
