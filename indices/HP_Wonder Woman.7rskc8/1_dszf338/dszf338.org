I wonder what a crossover between HP and WW would even look like. Like, canonically, how would that work? There'd prkbably be both dimension and time-travel in there. Sure it's out there somewhere; it's just not a pairing you usually think of. Thanks, OP, I'm looking this up now but I can't promise no Gal Gadot fics because she's so recent.
