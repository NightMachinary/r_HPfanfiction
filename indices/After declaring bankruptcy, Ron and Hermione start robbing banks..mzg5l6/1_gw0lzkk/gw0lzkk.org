Robbing Muggle banks is so amateurish and pathetic, considering Hermione could perform [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception][Inception]] level shit at age 17.

Furthermore, beginning in the 2010s, banks are keeping less and less cash on hand, and [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/a-quintessentially-american-crime-on-the-decline--robbing-banks-doesnt-pay-as-it-used-to/2016/09/29/4f54a0a6-e7e9-437c-b484-151a337b0e0a_story.html][average loot]] is dropping accordingly:

  FBI numbers show the average take has dwindled by nearly half over the past 10 years to just $6,500. That's more like trading in a used VW Jetta than scoring a payday that might fund an extended stay on a tropical island.

No, the correct approach is to leverage her expertise in memory charms to get them awarded millions in stock options from those multi-billion USD/GBP/EUR Muggle corporations. As for how to convert Muggle money into Galleons, here are some examples:

- Diversify some of their stock option millions into buying deeply distressed Muggle real estate, and use Reparo to fix them up. Add a few more good wards, which Hermione was already an expert at age 17, they become Wizarding properties that can now be sold for Galleons. Hey, even the Dursley house could be connected to the Floo network!
- Diversify more of their portfolio into precious metals, such as gold. Goblins seem to take physical gold, maybe even Wizards themselves.
- Diversify a small part into exchanging for Galleons directly. Even if you make the exchange 50:1 (vs 5:1 in the Books), [[https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/hermione-granger-london-house-hits-the-market][Hermione's house]] would still fetch 48000 Galleons. Remember the Twins were able to open a big shop in Wizarding Britain's prime shopping district for only 1000 Galleons.
