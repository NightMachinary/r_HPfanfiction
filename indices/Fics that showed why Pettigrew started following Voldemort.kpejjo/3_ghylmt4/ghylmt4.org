Chapter 20 of Remain In Light.

The whole story is amazing but chapter 20 is just Peters angle and it really changed the whole view and outlook of his character for me. It's bloody brilliant.

It really outlines his origins and what happened during the war to force/convince him to change and why he felt like he had to and what he had to do to do it. It's eye-opening and really sad.

Chapter 20 could possibly be posted as a standalone oneshot. Peter thinks he's doing it to keep them together. To keep James safe. He thinks its the only way they'll all survive the war. It's his job. It's just such a good insight into this character
