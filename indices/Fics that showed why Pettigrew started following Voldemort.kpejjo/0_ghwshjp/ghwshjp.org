I haven't read a story that showed things from Peter's POV as to why he became a death eater. But I have read a story that hints at how it may have come about.

The story is a time travel fic where Harry goes back to the Marauder's Era. He basically tries to make things better for everyone including peter. There are a few scenes where you see the initial approaches to Peter. There are also several scenes where Harry helps Peter where you can imagine if Harry had not done that you could see how Peter would go "bad".

The story is called Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence
