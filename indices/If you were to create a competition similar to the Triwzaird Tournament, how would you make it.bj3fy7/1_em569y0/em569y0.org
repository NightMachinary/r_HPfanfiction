A dueling tournament. No killing but maiming is allowed (healing magic can heal splinches and regrow bones, I think they can heal such injuries). Its a thing every four years and a way for schools to show-off their students.

The format can be one-on-one or group fights. The dueling arena is randomly configured to mimic a habitat. Think of Pok√©mon gyms but the theme changes for every fight. It tests the adaptability of contestants and their creativity in using their environment.
