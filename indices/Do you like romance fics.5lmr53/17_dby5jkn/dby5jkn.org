I read almost exclusively romance fics (and Harry/Ginny at that) primarily because its the one part of the original series I felt we didn't get enough of. Or more accurately, it was a part of the series that Rowling chose not to focus on for legitimate reasons but I like to explore. I'm a big Hinny shipper so I like to read stories that build up their pairing better than the books and/or focus on their relationship ups and downs after the war as that is a legitimately interesting topic to cover.

I'm a bit schizophrenic with the types of stories I like because they often conflict with my preferred headcanon of how the couple are after the war. While in my head, I prefer the two to live a comfortable life together where they don't ever break up or suffer during their relationship, I actually like stories that have these plotlines.

I don't like fluff or stories where they fall hopelessly in love in a short period of time and are just the perfect couple. That might be nice, but not realistic and not remotely interesting in a story.

I like the idea that the pair are soul mates but not soul bonded. I like that no matter what, they can't help but be drawn to each other and for better or worse, they simply belong together. I like that obstacles will be thrown in their way and they might lose each other in that, but ultimately come back into each others lives and finally realize they are just meant to be.

I don't like that almost every time I read a fic where Ginny or Harry dates someone else, they can't have them get together without turning the significant other into a villain. Honestly, I'm ok with either of them making a tough and perhaps a bit cruel decision to abandon their current significant other to be with each other.

I'm fine with sex in the story but it isn't required either way. I don't like reading about either Harry or Ginny actually being intimate with another character. Since we all read the series from Harry's POV, it weirdly feels like I'm watching an ex-girlfriend hook up with a new boyfriend whenever an author includes a Ginny/Other sex scene. I might get flak for this, but I don't like reading a story where it is referenced that Ginny had sex or got very far with Michael or Dean. I know, in real life, there might be a good chance it happened, but I like to imagine Ginny only did that stuff with Harry. Conversely, I just can't buy it when stories have Harry and Ginny get back together in their mid twenties but both or either are virgins.

That's my ramblings on the subject.
