I do, but only those that don't focus on marriage/engagement, big romantic gestures (jewellery/ring buying), soul-bonds, pregnancy and over-protective fathers... which eliminates a lot in fanfiction (I blame the young age of the mostly female authors).

I have nothing against marriage personally, but I don't understand what it is with some people presenting it as the ultimate expression of love. Especially considering the ever increasing amount of divorces in the real world. If your characters decide to get married just because they are heads over heels (or worse someone got pregnant) I'll just think they're foolish. Oh and 'magical marriages' aren't a solution, they make it so much worse: Being compelled to stay together or to be in love by magic is the most un-romantic thing ever.

Romance is really important and many people forget in their disdain for it that many of the big successes world-wide in storytelling include some kind of heartfelt romance. It's just difficult to do right (and considering the poor baseline of romance in the source material of Harry Potter it's not surprising that most HP romance fanfics frankly just suck)
