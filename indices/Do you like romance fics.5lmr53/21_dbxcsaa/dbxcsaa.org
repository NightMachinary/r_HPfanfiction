I am pretty much strictly a romance reader and 99.9% of what I read are non-canon pairings. I say that because an author needs to write those two characters who have zero romantic history in canon (say, Harry and Draco) to come from often opposite ends of the spectrum and fall in love.

So that said, the most important thing for me in a romance story is *believable relationship growth* while keeping people in character as much as possible within the plot. Some OOCness is expected as long as it's something that the reader can see the character doing if canon situations were different.

Also, any pairing works as long as /the writing backs it up/!

Now why/how the two opposites want to get together really isn't all that important because I've basically seen the whole gamut of reasons (potion gone wrong, marriage law, trapped together, truth-or-dare games, unexpected bond, one side already is smitten and opportunity presents itself, working in close proximity, etc.). What's important is showing the changing of attitude from what we see in canon to the attitude at the end of the fanfic.

So for Harry and Draco, for example. Based on their history in canon, they SHOULD NOT be in love with each other after a couple of days, regardless of what brings them together in the story in the first place. The author should show the steps forward and steps back that they would go through to make a relationship work between them within the confines of the fic's premise/plot points and not just take plot shortcuts without really fleshing out the reasons they would get together in the first place.

An action plot for me is not a priority because if the author does the story right, the relationship/character development can really carry a story on its own. Some side plot is good to give characters other things to focus on and sex between the characters when they finally get together is a MUST. The reader likely has been waiting for this for most of the story so write something satisfying (for lack of a better word, lol) for them to read.
