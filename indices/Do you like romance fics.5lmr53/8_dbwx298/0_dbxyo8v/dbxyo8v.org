Having kids as a teenager isn't impossible or even uncommon. A story can make this work so long as it is done right. There should be consequences other than a few catty remarks in the hall. Future plans should be changed, relationships should also change. None of the "the Weasleys took care of the baby while the parents went off and did whatever they wanted." While I can easily see friends and family /helping/ that is not the same as "doing all the work while mommy and daddy go continue to do whatever they like."

A baby shouldn't be used as a deus ex machina to both cause and resolve drama. Two characters who are at each other's throats shouldn't put all that aside and become loving parents for the sake of the baby. If they're still in school Dumbledore (or whatever school official you pick) should not rewrite all of the rules to give the couple their own private room and a house elf to watch the baby during classes. The new parents would probably have to leave Hogwarts and pursue the remainder of their studies privately at home. Maybe future careers will be changed, because bills need to get paid and now they can't afford the time Auror training takes. And professional quidditch requires too much time away from home. So if it's a Harry pairing maybe he uses the remaining money from his vault to open a small business instead. Or goes to learn a trade skill.

A baby could actually be an interesting plot point, so long as it wasn't done as a fix-all plot contrivance.
