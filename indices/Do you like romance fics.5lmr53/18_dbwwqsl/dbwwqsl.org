I really don't like fluffy romance. I can count the amount of fluff stories I read on one hand with fingers left.

What I like are stories where the romance is a valuable part of the bigger story, meaning I don't mind, or even like the fact that it contains a few romance filler chapters. I also like Romance where its not "OMFG We're perfect for each other, lets marry!" in chapter 5/30. Well thought out Romances are interesting to read, have great dialogue and make me root for these people to get together through a real challenge.

Three things I also hate:

- I'm incredibly annoyed by the trope of the asexual, awkward, clueless Harry. Harry is a teenager with a fully functioning hormonal system and dick, not the hottest eunuch Hogwarts has ever seen.

- Teenagers having a clue about sex. Honestly, I'd prefer my romance without sex scenes, but if they have to be in there I just keep rolling my eyes when they sound like a production of Brazzers with wands.

- The reason why they can't be together is some trumped up bash-fic reason. The Weasley love-potioneering, or Dumbledore being manipulative, jadda jadda... We know the protagonists are completely in the right, we only see them yell at everybody else who doesn't agree with them 100% and any and all things they do to the "evil Weasles and Dumbledork" are completely fine, even if they amount to murder, rape and permanent disfiguration... because they're the bad guys standing between tru wuv. /Wuagh.../

Three things I love:

- Something in the story makes me root for the protagonist(s). It may be their characters or the challenges they have to overcome to be together and these challenges have true substance. That may be a very intimate Harry and Hermione story where they work on their, arguably, stunted social skills. That may be a Harry and Tonks fic where Harry must deal with filling the void Remus left. That may be a Harry and Bellatrix fic as they meet in Azkaban and have to deal with each others impacts on their past. Anything, as long as the story makes me root for them.

- The protagonists don't fit together flawlessly. People have mistakes, bad traits - imperfections. To learn of a stain in a human's soul and still finding them beautiful within and without makes for a very relatable relationship.

- Thats a very subjective thing, but I also love pairings that truly surprise the people of Hogwarts. There are decidedly too little Harry/Luna fics out there, and the lack of good Harry/Tonks is a crime.
