I like romance stories, I usually avoid stories that are pure romance in fanfiction (Aside from Grow Young With Me, which someone else has already linked.) Why? It is a very rare fanfic author who "gets" how to write romance.

Two bland characters who are now dating and stare happily into each other's eyes saying "I love you more." "No, I love /you/ more." is boring. Soul mates are boring. Settling down right away and popping out babies is boring. Having the relationship mirror Molly and Arthur Weasley (naggy wife, "yes dear" husband) is boring.

If I am going to read a romance I want for it to have spice. I want there to be obstacles that are /not/ trite plot conveniences (an example would be the main conflict between characters should not be childish and irrational jealousy between Ginny and Luna because Luna ate lunch that once with Harry). I want the characters to be attracted to each other for reasons that are /not/ completely based on appearance. Too often you have the guy in the relationship will wax poetic about how beautiful the girl is, and barely ever mentions another positive trait in depth. Is she funny? How so? Smart? Show, don't tell. Caring? Give subtle examples.

I really, really dislike the "Smart girl, dumb guy" dynamic. Like the only way you can make a "good" female character is to have her be smarter than the male partner. And she must make him aware of this at every opportunity by micro-managing every aspect of his life. And when she feels he's done something stupid, she "smacks him upside the head." Admit it, if Ron smacked Hermione upside the head the fandom would be in an uproar, but it's hilarious when Lily does it to James? I want to see two people who are equals, and treated as such.

This is another reason I like the Harry/Draco pairing. So long as it's not one of the bad ones where the author designates one of them as the "girl" in the relationship, you have two characters with personalities that are similar yet different enough that it makes them interesting. And they're /equals/ in the relationship because neither will take shit from the other.

When I read a romance story, I want to feel the love between the characters. Don't tell me that they are in love and leave it at that. Love is more than "I like this person and we never have any significant relationship issues." Love is full of arguments, fights, insults and apologies. Love having jokes that only the two of you find funny. Love is adoring a person's faults as much as you do their positive traits. A romantic relationship should make you feel giddy, annoyed, and a little bit scared sometimes. Love is seeing that your partner has a hilarious birthmark in the shape of a donkey arm wrestling a sasquatch, and telling them you wouldn't change a thing about it. Love is both good and bad, and I want to see all of that.
