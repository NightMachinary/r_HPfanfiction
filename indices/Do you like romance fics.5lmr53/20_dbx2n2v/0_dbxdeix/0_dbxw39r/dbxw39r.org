I think it's inevitable given that most fanfiction readers and writers are very young and they understandably want to read and write about characters they can identify with. It does leave a bit of a vacuum though.

I sometimes wonder if there aren't many older readers and writers because there isn't much for them to read in the first place, so it becomes self-fulfilling.
