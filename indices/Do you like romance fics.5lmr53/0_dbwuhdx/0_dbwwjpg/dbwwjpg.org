Thank you for this. It pretty much sums up my thoughts on all fandoms... "CONVINCE ME!" I usually don't say that I am a particular 'shipper' becauase I find that I will read anything, ship anything, so long as it is written well and convincingly.

Unfortunately, this finds me in many an awkward situations where I fall in love with some pairings thanks to fanfiction only to find out that only one or two authors actually write them.
