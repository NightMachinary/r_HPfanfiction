Hello to you!

I first started reading fanfiction in order to read romance stories of characters that I would prefer together. However, as I'm sure you're aware, romance is incredibly difficult to write convincingly whilst maintaining character, so as a result there are fewer purely romantic stories to be recommended as they often devolve into fluffy OOC-ness. If you're a Harmony shipper, you want to see Harry/Hermione, not a caricature of Harry and Hermione saying things that their canon characters wouldn't dream of saying to one another.

To answer your questions, I want from romance fiction what I want from all fiction; I want to be convinced. I want to be taken a hold of by the story you're telling. In order for this to happen, there has to be an intrinsic logic to the story you craft, but at the heart of it all I want to be able to believe what your characters are doing and saying. You can have your characters do whatever you want as long as you can make me believe they would do it.

Just out of curiosity, is there anything you have that we could read?
