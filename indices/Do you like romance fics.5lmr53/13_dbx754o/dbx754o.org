  Do you like romance fics?
#+end_quote

In this fandom? Not particularly, and for a number of reasons.

Most romances tend to take place during Harry's Hogwarts years or just after them. It's hard for me to believe in a romance for the ages when the characters are still getting detentions from Snape.

The over-abundance of younger characters is probably because 1) fleshing out an AU or out-of-Hogwarts fic is more time-consuming to write, and 2) the /Harry Potter/ universe has a continual influx of younger fans ...which also means a lot of inexperienced writers. Writers who do not know how to hit the beats of the genre in all the right places.

  what does a romance fic have to include for you to read it
#+end_quote

- Non-canon or rare pairings, probably. Just a personal preference.
- Older characters (as explained above). Mid-twenties and over is ideal.
- Keeping things as in-character as possible, (unless it's an AU -- then I'm more forgiving). Whitewashing flaws makes for boring characters. Snape is ugly, cruel, emotionally damaged and volatile; Malfoy is a spoiled, +Nazi youth+ blood supremacist; Harry bottles his softer emotions and jumps to conclusions without thinking twice; Hermione can be bold to the point of irritating everyone around her since she doesn't know when to quit sometimes, and she's better at reading books than she is people; etc., etc.
- Zero infantilization of characters. This is one of my big problems with m/m fics in this fandom. A lot of it comes from yaoi-trash stereotypes, but similar stuff does crop up in f/m (and, more rarely, f/f). It's creepy and off-putting and I refuse to read it.
- No romanticized abuse. There's enough of that shit in pro romance novels.
- But no extreme fluff either. Those fics are usually no-stakes borefests.
- A writer who knows what they are doing with the genre.

If it sounds like I'm a demanding asshole when it comes to romance, I am. Rightfully so. Romance novels are my day job.

  and what do you look for in a Gen (or other genre) story?
#+end_quote

What I like to read -- /ideally/ -- are stories with:

In-character characters who are in their twenties or, at least, characters who sound and think at a level corresponding to their ages (no eleven-year-old talks like that, even if he does find out he was born "Lord" Potter); a writer who knows the convention of the genre in which they are writing; little to no rehashing (please, god, no detailed Diagon Alley shopping trips in first year); some semblance of originality; characters with understandable (but not necessarily likable) needs, wants, motivations, flaws, and virtues.

That all said, I can and do read outside those parameters, both for romance and other genres.

Mostly by accident. Sometimes to see if I still don't like certain pairings.
