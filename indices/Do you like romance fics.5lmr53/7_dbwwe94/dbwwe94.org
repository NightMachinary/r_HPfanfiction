I like romance, but I hate fluff.

That's why I'm generally not interested in reading about bumbling teenagers looking at each other for 6 months before making a move (which is not romance btw, just author wish fulfillment).

I like adult characters (or adult acting teenagers, although admitelly it's somewhat inorganic) doing adult things; that means if someone wants someone, they approach them, try to attract their interest and generally take steps to get what they want. And if it fails, they move on - at least they tried.

What I don't enjoy is useless fluff, like untold pages listing the potential couple's feelings, their inadequacies, their friends' reaction, the greater social circle reaction and so on. All that stuff can be covered in a few pages, but in romance fics it usually consumes half the story.

Lastly, I know a lot of authors have this idea that if things get sexual, the pairing isn't "pure" or whatever, which is extremely laughable in the real world. You can't have romance without sex.
