At the best of times I'm iffy on FF romances...they tend to be all the same. I will also never read a short romance without it being recommended the hell out of to me, such as comptemplating clouds. If I go for a romance I want it to be long, so to show character developement. I want it to be realistic, as fights do occasionally happen. I even prefer them to have dated other people before, explicit or implicit is fine.

Most FF romance is a short thing of two characters enter a room, they declared how they always loved each other (50-50 bash of the other big ships for the characters), and then a date/lemon/etc.

/edit/ Also gotta add, any time there is a big misunderstanding that has me shouting "Just fucking talk to each other" pisses me off something furious. Movies love this one.
