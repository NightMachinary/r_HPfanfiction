I generally like shorter romance fics. Longer ones generally tend to be boring, though exceptions certainly exist. '

I do like a bit of romance in longer action/adventure stories, but very often authors overdo this part and the fic is hurt by endless romantic drama. It is worse when a serious story is full of rom-com cliches.
