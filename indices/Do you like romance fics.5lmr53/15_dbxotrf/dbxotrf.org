I like reading romance, it is just that I'm rarely convinced by it in fanfiction. You can fall in love, but any mentions of destiny, magical love bonding etc puts me off.

My favourite romance manga is [[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=31270]].

It doesn't have to have an overarching plot for me, slice of life is my favourite, fluff is also fine. Just remember that if you choose fluff, keep it below 50k because there's only so much you can do. If you're going for a huge plot, then longer fics are okay.

I like it along with another genre, but the other one must not be a downer like angst or hurt/comfort. Humour is a must, especially if the overall tone of your story is darker than usual.

Edit: also, please no love triangles or similar drama.
