I like the /idea/ of romance. I don't specifically care about certain characters getting together or whatever, what I'm looking for is an organic, messy relationship between two interesting, three-dimensional people where there are problems and drama without anyone grabbing the Idiot Ball.

Fics that actually do this are few and far between.
