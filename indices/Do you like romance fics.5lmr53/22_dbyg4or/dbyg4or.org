My biggest reasons for dropping a fic thar revolve around romance is when it gas poor pacing.

Very often fics will rush the relationship and it'll magically just happen, which is meh for an action story and really frustrating and unsatisfying for a romance.

Worse, in my opinion, is when a relationship has the groundwork laid out and prepped for the audience but the author will hem and haw because the couple getting together is the end of the story.

There is a fine line for romance to work when it is the main plot of the story and very few manage to get that right. When the romance is a side plot to bigger action, it's not a major deal, but when it is the primary thrust of the atory, it is much more important.
