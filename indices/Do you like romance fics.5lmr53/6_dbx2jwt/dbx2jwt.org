Hey! Romance fics are totally the type of thing I like to read, as opposed to the plot-heavy betrayal-conspiracy-timetravel-ancient-magical-core stuff I often see haha. However, I do enjoy longer fics rather than one shots. Here are things I like to see in fics more centered around romance.

- Humor - this is a big one. Just plain fluff can be boring (to me) but including stuff like Ron cracking jokes, Ginny being sarcastic, whatever it may be, makes it much more entertaining.
- Some semblance of a plot - like if it's just X and Y hanging out in their house in a one shot, it's whatever and I'll probably just close the tab. And I do see a lot of these, not just in HP.
- Characters act like themselves - as others have mentioned, this makes it worth reading.

One thing that /can/ be done well but I feel like it's often just made frustrating is when the plot revolves around communication issues. Not like stories like this can never be written, but I am always a little more wary when the plot can be resolved by "just tell them", and there is nothing big (like magical oaths, mental disorders, blackmail, or whatever) getting in the way.
