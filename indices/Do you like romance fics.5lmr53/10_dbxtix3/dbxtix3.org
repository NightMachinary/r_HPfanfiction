I'm a H&G shipper which means that it is very hard to avoid romance in those fics. There are lots of issues in this type of fic, but one that bugs me more than anything is authors who feel that if H&G are in a relationship then everyone needs to be and it has to be wonderful. My wife and I have been together for 36 years and I know that a good relationship takes a lot of work and has many ups and downs, so why not reflect that in your story?
