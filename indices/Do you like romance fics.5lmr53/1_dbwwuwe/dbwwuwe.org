Romance is usually used as a subplot in action/adventure stories. Therefore when it becomes the main plot line, it's easy to understand why some people would find the story less engaging. But the problem with a lot of romance fics is that writers don't make the adjustment. They don't add subplots to the story, so you're left reading about the two characters who appear to live in a vacuum. They rarely have interactions or lives outsides of themselves. And when they do, it's always related to their relationship somehow.

Subplots don't have to be incredibly intricate. They could be simple things like a job or family or other friends. As long as they tie into the story somehow through character development or the main plot, having these subplots will make the story more realistic and engaging. Also, it helps to give you a needed break from the romance which can get a bit nauseating when it's all you read about for 20 straight chapters.
