Depends on the other series, and if its multiple crossover, then no. I hate when that happens. I've tried reading Naberius Heir (bleach x DxD) but both Ichigo and Rias are so tedius that I couldn't keep on reading.

I'd prefer, if she's a main character, a more inteligent Rias than what shows in canon, which is basically a lazy bimbo, imo. At least in the begining.

I also hate power wank for no reason at all, so when it went into Ichigo being a Quincy-Shinigami-VastoLord-Devil quadra combo, I just barfed and quit.
