Well, there is a fic, The Wizarding Lion of Kyoto linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12521313/1/The-Roar-of-Kyoto-s-Wizarding-Lion]]). It has a decent concept but screws up the execution of it.

The other is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11723597/1/Sacred-Magic-Wizards-and-Dragons]]). This has Harry with Divine Dividing. It's good but hasn't been updated in a while.

If you're fine with DxD crossovers with other series, there are more options. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10710606/1/A-Demon-Lord-s-Hero]]) is a brilliant story but hasn't been updated in a while.
