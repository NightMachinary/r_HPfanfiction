Thanks for the rec, though as I said in the description, I've already read and its one of my favourites FILFY teacher. Which is sorta the inspiration for this post. Thanks though, the one with Koneko seems really interesting.

I'm not a fan at all of humour or crack, so I'll prob skip those. Thanks.
