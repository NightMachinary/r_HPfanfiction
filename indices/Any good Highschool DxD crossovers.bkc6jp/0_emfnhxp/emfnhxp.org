Damn, I love High School DxD (Bit of a weeb), I've had a few ideas for some and are getting ready to commit them to paper.

I think the best one is FILFY teacher which has already been recommended, I've read through the whole thing 3 or 4 times, it's that good.

In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11504036/1/10th-Life]]) Harry is entered just after Kuroka went crazy and killed her master, it's crack and fun to read.

Another crack-ish one is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10596643/1/Harry-Potter-God-of-Gods]]) Harry is the reincarnation of the Biblical God, though sometimes the humour can be jarring and a bit forced. It has been adopted by another author, though I prefer the original.

One which is pretty sweet is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11976393/1/Sitting-on-a-bench]]), only read it a couple of times though.

Other than that... most of them are poorly written and are extremely irritating to read as they are a bit terrible. I would love to see more High School DxD (And Fate/Stay night) written, which is why I'm working on my own stories.

All 4 fics should keep you happy for a few days.
