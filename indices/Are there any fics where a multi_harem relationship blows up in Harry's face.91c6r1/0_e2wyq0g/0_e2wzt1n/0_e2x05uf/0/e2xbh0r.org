Alright, thanks for the recommendation. I'm reading Simurghs Son right now so this should be fun. Sorry for being vague, but I was trying to be as broad as possible as I've never really read something like this before. Harem relationships never end poorly in fan fiction, so I wanted to see just one where things crash and burn.
