Don't be so quick. It is very much an interesting read that takes a cliche fanfic-premise (harems) and runs with it for real.

Yes, it starts weird by creating and showing us the type of fucked-up world where harems are a thing (the excuse is that magic creates 4 times as much witches as it does wizards), but if you go further in than only half the first book you will realise the author is merely setting the stage for the eventual structural breakdown of that type of relationship.

It's very much worth a full read.
