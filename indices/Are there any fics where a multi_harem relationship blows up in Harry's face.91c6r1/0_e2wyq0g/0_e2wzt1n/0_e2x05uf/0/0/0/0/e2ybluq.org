The problem is that if a group is fighting against an inhumane system, then they shouldn't punish their own people for violating the very rules and customs of said system. At the very least, someone among them should go "WTF? Are you crazy?", instead of going along with it. Sure, it is brought back up at the end, but in a rather tacked-on manner. "Remember that time you punished me? I can't forgive that, bye!" feels a little too little too late.
