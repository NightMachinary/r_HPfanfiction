Firebird sucks, not because its not well written - it is really well written. Not because the story is not thought through, it is decent. No it sucks because it goes against anything a free and selfrespecting person would stand for.

I remember closing the tab after half the first book because I just could not take the idiocrasy of the people in that story anymore.

So, be warned. Prepare yourself for some disturbing concepts and psychologically damaged people.
