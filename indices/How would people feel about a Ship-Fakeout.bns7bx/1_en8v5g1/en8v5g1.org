Don't advertise it as such, or you'll piss off just about everyone that came for it. The tags are there to advertise the ship(if selecting them together).

I remember reading one story a long long time ago where the author had tagged the story one way, but like half way through it was switched to someone else with no warning. They deleted the story from how much shit they were getting.
