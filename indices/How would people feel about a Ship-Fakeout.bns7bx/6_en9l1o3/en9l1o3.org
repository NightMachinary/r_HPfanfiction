If you pull it completely within the story, it's fine. I mean I would hate your guts for it for wasting my time and likely drop it, but it's not necessarily bad writing (certainly gonna be hard to pull off tho, you really need to seed it through the whole fic).

If you actively publicize the fic as having a certain ship outside the narration (like author notes, summary etc) and you change it in any way shape or form after posting chapter 1 you deserve every little drop of the tsunami of shit that will come your way from all the shippers who read it.
