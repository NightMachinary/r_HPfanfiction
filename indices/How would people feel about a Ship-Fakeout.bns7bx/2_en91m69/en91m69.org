if you actively advertise it as one ship and end it with another, you will earn yourself a permanent enemy in the form of me. though i wouldn't cause much problem cause i'm not motivated enough to do anything about it. but you can be damn sure i'll give your username the stinky eye whenever when i see it

but if you "tease" a ship wtihout specifying that's ok

in the end it's about trying to decieve people. actually lying to people isn't ok, but nothing wrong with pulling a little sneaky on us
