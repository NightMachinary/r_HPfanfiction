Depends how well you pull it off.

Ideally, the "real ship" would develop organically, with the chemistry between the characters being so evident that the readers would be calling for those characters to get together instead of the listed pairing.

In that case, I think it could go well.

But if you just do a bait and switch out of nowhere, I can't see it ending well.

Edit: also, if one of the ships is het and the other is slash, there is no universe in which the outcome is positive.
