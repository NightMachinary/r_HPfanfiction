Its been done before, but generally, folks don't remember or realize it because the author vanishes (either intentionally or because folks no longer read/recommend their stuff) due to the overwhelming amount of hate and anger from readers who feel lied to.

Although often its less intentionally done and more that the author simply has a change of heart during the story and changes the ship. The problem is, many people read a story based upon the ship and the ship alone so that's bound to be a problem, and even if they don't read based upon ship alone if it goes from a ship they are ok with to a ship they despise... its really no better.

Regardless... bad idea. It's not ok in any sense to lie about a ship (intentionally or not) just to try and create a plot twist. If you are not sure about a ship or want to leave it up in the air, then you simply don't list or tag a ship until you are ready to declare one.
