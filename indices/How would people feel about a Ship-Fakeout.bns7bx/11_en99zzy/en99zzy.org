This is workable in FFN since you can list 3 characters without flagging pairings either way -- this is depressingly common even when there is no good reason for it. Ao3 has a different policy on ship tags, making it much harder to do properly there without spoiling things.

Personally, I find that while ship "feints" is definitely a thing, I'm not sure if I'd be happy with reading it. /Especially/ if I happen to prefer the "failed" ship, and at that point I'd probably just stop reading.

While it wasn't a "fakeout" per se -- it was an open secret -- I preferred the HGRL outcome in linkffn(Debt of Time) even if it has a HGSB endgame. The reason is simple: the only reason HGRL failed was lack of free will and soulbond/mate shenanigans -- the chemistry was clearly there and the main ship felt very forced. This fic shows exactly what I dislike about common soulbond fics, even if it isn't the worst offense (that would go to a fic with a similar relationship setup except the non-bonded ends up with an unrequited love instead of just moving on with someone else).

Now I'm assuming this is about intentionally pretending to ship one way while actually having another as endgame. Temporary misleading flings -- a "romantic false lead" -- is different; I've seen these on occasion as distraction from the main ship but where it's obvious where things are truly heading, and unless it goes on for too long, I don't mind it much.
