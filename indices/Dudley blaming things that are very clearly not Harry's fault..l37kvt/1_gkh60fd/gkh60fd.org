I'd love to get a story where Dudley is going through some massive misadventure, with danger and plot and stuff, and the entire time he's peering around corners expecting to see harry. It doesn't even have to be anything magical, it's just him, paranoid, aggressive, and irrational. The clash when Harry finally comes back for the summer could be very fun.
