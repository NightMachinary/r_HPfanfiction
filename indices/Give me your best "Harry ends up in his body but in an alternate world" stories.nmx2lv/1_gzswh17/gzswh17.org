The Lone Traveler series if you haven't read it already. It's originally by The Professional, but it was vastly extended by dunuelos (I'm linking just one by dunuelos, but they have a lot of them!). The good thing about the later is that if you don't like a particular universe in which Harry appears, you can generally just skip that chapter and move onto the next world.

(the premise makes it sound like time travel, it's not)
