Where am I I thought as I looked at my surrounding it is a forest of tall tree as far as the eye can see I hear birds twit in the air I stand up and dusted my self clean, I put my hand to my face to adjust my glasses but nothing was there I can still see clearly I put both of my hand to my face but found nothing

I look at my hair...it's red I looked at my body and saw I AM NAKED!!!!!!???
