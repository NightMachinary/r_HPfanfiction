I mean I always thought a better idea would be to imperious/confound/convince muggleborns that they need to revolt, in which they kill purebloods nearly indescriminatly or Voldemort kills “blood traitors” framing the muggleborns while muggleborns kill blood supremists. Then everyone is against the muggleborns and Voldemort and his death eaters would essentially be saviors for doing what they did. Then Voldemort could be a leader that everyone WANTED to begin with making it more difficult for anyone to stand against him.
