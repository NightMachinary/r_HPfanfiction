I can't remember the name of it for the life of me, but there was an almost total rip-off of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champions Champion) if it were written by a 12 year old. Like every plot point was copied in this fic while still being poorly written. Champions Champion isn't an amazing fic but it was amusing enough. This other fic is one I legitimately want my time spent on it back. I'll try to dig through my post history to find it.
