I ditched both roughly ten chapters in. I felt the overwhelming need to punch HJPEV, whereas "Morons" was just bad writing. Nothing outstanding, there are really way worse fics around. Like the explicit "Percy's wife has their child raped by Mundungus and gets off as well" one which for some reason can be found on Archive (which taught me the lesson of reading the tags).
