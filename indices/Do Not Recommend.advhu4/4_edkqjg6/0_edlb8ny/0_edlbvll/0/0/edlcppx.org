  I ditched both roughly ten chapters in. I felt the overwhelming need to punch HJPEV, whereas "Morons" was just bad writing.

I don't even know where to begin. The Morons protag is all about himself. He puts ultimatums towards his friends that they should fall in line or else... the way he treats Neville is abhorrent and that alone would have gotten him punched if he didn't have the author on his side.

HJPEV is a bit autistic and arrogant little prick but his heart is in the right place. He's trying to help people in his own way. Not to mention his whole "lets use science to investigate magic" idea is a great approach, no matter that it is doomed to fail spectacularly. HJPEV would never lie to his friends for *years* and then mock them and threaten them.

I don't think I've ever been as mad at a Harry as in Morons, I probably even liked those dark!Harrys better that crucio puppies.
