To be fair this is not just about "Morons", but the majority of all fanfiction. Almost no fanfiction author can write a real world reaction when his/her protagonist is a lier/deceiver/prick/arsehole/etc.

Personally because of that I'm putting linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief]]) on the same level as "Morons".
