There are a bunch of horrible stories on archive and when I was fairly new to fanfiction, I was naive enough to think that "no way someone would actually write that". I quickly learned the error of that.

Then there are some stories where you expect some form of turnaround, but there is none. I skimmed a "Umbridge makes the entire DA rape Hermione" story because I expected that they'd snap out of and then punish Umbridge some way. But there was no one doing that, no trial for Umbridge, no summary execution, mob justice or Harry whipping out a Cruciatus and turning her into a vegetable. Just the gangrape. Why would anyone write that?

Tl;dr: Archive can be a very fucked up place.
