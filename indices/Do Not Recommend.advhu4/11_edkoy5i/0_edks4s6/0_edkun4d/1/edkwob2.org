That's true for me as well. The thing is at 2 million views, and I just don't get it. Maybe it was because it was written during some sort of sweet spot, back in 2009 before the indy!Harry/Daphne phase started to die out. Perhaps it managed to get archived into a bunch of different sites which people keep stumbling upon or something. It's kinda weird because every now and then it will get a brief burst activity and some reviews will pop up from different people, and all I can say is that their taste sucks if they actually like it.
