Mine does the same thing. At points it's almost like I hit a refresh button on a posting or something. Then next to no activity for a month or two.

My theory was pretty much just, "It has Fleur in it" which makes me sort of want to write just some utter trash, hardly edited, plot-hole filled monstrosity of crap and just throw Fleur in it and see how many reviews it gets.

Then I remember I'm lazy and that sounds like effort when I could otherwise be drinking and not doing that.
