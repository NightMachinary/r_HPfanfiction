Yeah, especially since I doubt it would break Hermione like you see in fanfiction. Bellatrix Lestrange tired to torture information out of her and couldn't break her, so why would some random lowlife? We know that Hermione was at least functional after her ordeal, so definitely not the mopey "jumps at every noise" characterisation usually found in those fics. If anything, Hermione would lay back and +think of England+ plan the brutal murder of her attacker and everyone related to him.
