Probably the rape to be honest. As the old saying goes, "lay back and think of England". You cannot do the same with the Cruciatus Curse.

If we were talking about some CIA flunky waterboarding you, it might be a different story, but not with the Cruciatus curse. To quote the wiki

#+begin_quote
  The pain caused by the Cruciatus Curse is described by Harry Potter as being worse than "one thousand white-hot knives, boring into the skin" and beyond what most people will ever experience.The sensation of the curse is so intense that the person under the effects wishes for unconsciousness and even death, as a means of escaping the searing pain.

No way anyone would choose that for half an hour over being raped.
