The thing with rape is that it can give psychological blow even if the victim was mostly unconscious during the process (imagination is very powerful ability).

To be clear, I'm not saying for the rape in the story. I didn't read it myself because of it.

But I'm against downplayment of the rape itself.

What do you think Hermione would had chosen between being raped and spending half an hour in Bella's company?
