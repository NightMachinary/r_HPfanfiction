We don't have an exact time frame, but we know that some time passed before Dobby made an appearance, then he evacuated the other hostages and only then Hermione was rescued. That's at least an quarter of a hour, more like a half. Bellatrix used the cruciatus and a knife, possibly more. While the love potions, at least in the mentioned story, rob you of your consciousness and you wake up with spotty memories after they wear off. It would leave a trauma for sure, but nowhere near "Bellatrix goes all out on you" levels of pain and (psychological) damage.
