I would argue that the most sadistic character in the entire series hellbent on breaking her would cause a lot more damage, both psychological and physical, than some bloke with roofies and his cock.

Both would leave their mark for sure, but if Bellatrix couldn't break her then I'm not seeing random lowlife no4 succeeding.
