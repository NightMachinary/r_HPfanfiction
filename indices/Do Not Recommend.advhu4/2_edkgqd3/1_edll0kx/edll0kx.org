I think I know the fic you're referring to. It's by Gandalf's Beard or whatever, correct? I try to read his stories since I follow him on Quora but if his fics don't have odd writing tics like making Harry begin every other sentence with “...er” or having everyone finish their sentences with an exclamation point like an old comic book from the 60's, it's plot points like that.
