There is a story on FFN where Harry overhears Snape and Malfoy talk about Draco's mission during the Christmas party. He gets angry. Meanwhile McLaggen slips Hermione a love potion. Harry finds evidence of this, goes to the Gryffindor tower and discusses the issue with Ron. Harry points out that their friend is being raped right now, Ron decides that she had it coming and Harry then sits around and does nothing. He has the map and the cloak, but he just sits there and waits for Hermione, who is being raped at the same time.

The author justifies this with "Harry is angry" and generally making bad decisions, so it's totally in character. The boy who knowingly went into a Death Eater ambush to save his godfather, who was unlikely to be at the Ministry in the first place leaves his best friend to be raped because he is angry. And Harry is very clear about the fact that Hermione is being raped, not just some harmless fun as the magical world sees them.

At this point, it is not even the end of the first chapter but I dropped the story like a hot turd (not to insult potatoes for the comparison to that fic).
