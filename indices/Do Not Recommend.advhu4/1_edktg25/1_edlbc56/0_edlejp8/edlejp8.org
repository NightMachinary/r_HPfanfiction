No, there is a difference between stories about underage characters doing heroic things, which is a common trope in childrens' and young adult literature, and the militarism displayed in stories like DAYD. In fact, Dumbledore if anything goes towards the other extreme, trying and failing to shield Harry from Voldemort again and again and only starting to prepare Harry for facing Voldemort once he knows his remaining lifetime is counted in months rather than years.

I also can't see any glorification of children taking part in war or glorification of war at all. Just look at how Colin's death is treated, as the tragic death of a boy who had no business even being there. Or the small scene of Ginny trying to comfort the injured girl. Or Fred's death and the impact it has on the Weasleys. This is about the suffering of the individual and the grief and loss their loved ones feel.

Contrast that to DAYD, which is full of bullshit like the DA praising the noble sacrifice of one of their members for their cause. Said member was like 14 years old if I remember correctly.
