  and the militarism displayed in stories like DAYD.

Sadly, that kind of militarism would save lives. Had the DA been militarised, the Battle of Hogwarts would have been a Turkey shoot and the Death Eaters would never have reached the walls.

  I also can't see any glorification of children taking part in war or glorification of war at all.
#+end_quote

That is the result of "incompetent adults". Either the children are left behind as the war is fought or you have a story with a teenage protagonist winning a civil war. You can't have both.

  This is about the suffering of the individual and the grief and loss their loved ones feel.
#+end_quote

You are forgetting the scenes where Sprout prepares the mandrakes (which should have utterly decimated the Death Eaters) or how proud Neville's grandmother is that her 17-year-old grandchild is in the frontlines. Or Neville later on becoming a hero for standing up against Voldemort, despite being underage. And the same stuff happens after the DoM battle.

  which is full of bullshit like the DA praising the noble sacrifice of one of their members for their cause
#+end_quote

Well, what else were they supposed to say? Sucks to be them?

Canon is a very filtered world, while DAYD is a more realistic approach to a civil war. And many countries are proud of their (dead) underage fighters, just look at Poland with the Warsaw Uprising. It is not "bad fiction", it is a reality of our world.
