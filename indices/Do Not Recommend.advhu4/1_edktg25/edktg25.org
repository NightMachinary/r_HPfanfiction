Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Great premise, terrible execution. Some plot points are frankly ridiculous, but it's the characterization that makes it terrible. All the boys in the DA are militaristic heroes, while the girls have the roles of adorers, healers and victims. All characters who aren't ethnically English are portrayed in a very stereotypical way. Established canon characters like Neville or Snape act completely ooc, like Neville torturing people or Snape trying to feed students to werewolves. And then there's the hyper-militaristic overall tone of the fic that even glorifies child soldiers. Do Not Recommend.
