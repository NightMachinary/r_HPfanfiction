  That is not what I implied at all. I never said that you cannot criticise
#+end_quote

You said that this thread, where people posted nothing but constructive negative criticism, was a "witch-hunt." I don't know how else you could mean that.

#+begin_quote
  as far as an anti-recommendation for certain fics
#+end_quote

That's not very far. There's nothing wrong with saying "if you don't like certain things, don't read this or that fic."

#+begin_quote
  you are a delusional child that must whine about everything they come across
#+end_quote

Thanks for the ad hominem. You seem to hold other people to certain standards of decorum that you don't conform to yourself. Nothing like a bit of hypocrisy do devalue one's opinion.

#+begin_quote
  You are not criticising, you are downright bashing. Nothing in this thread has been criticism and more groupwanking about ‚Äòbad' fics.
#+end_quote

It is evident that this thread is, again, quite constructive in its criticism of bad fics.

#+begin_quote
  whining and moaning about something like a teenaged girl.

  You remind me of Facebook mothers.
#+end_quote

Pick one.

#+begin_quote
  not set out to bash it and go as far as not recommending it.
#+end_quote

Not recommending something is going too far? Holy shit, that's fragile.

#+begin_quote
  A truly welcoming community.
#+end_quote

Aaand we finish on an attack on the entire subreddit. Classy. And definitely welcoming üëç
