  How dare we criticise publically available stories. If this thread constitutes "witch-hunts" and "bashing", call me the fucking Spanish Inquisition.

That is not what I implied at all. I never said that you cannot criticise, although, if you do, it should be done constructively. This thread is going as far as an anti-recommendation for certain fics, which is the complete opposite of what this subreddit set out to achieve. If you dislike something, stop reading it and move on with your life. If you feel the need to post about a fic, warning other people off it because you are a delusional child that must whine about /everything/ they come across, then you are a part of the issue.

But, no, the issue is far from just, and I quote, ‘Criticising publically available stories' and crosses more into the territory of actively posting fics for people to avoid because /you/ dislike them. You are not criticising, you are downright bashing. Nothing in this thread has been criticism and more groupwanking about ‘bad' fics.

  Are we no longer allowed to call bad stories "bad" because the story was written by an actual human being with feelings?
#+end_quote

You can, but do it with a sense of matureness, not a glorified group chat whining and moaning about something like a teenaged girl. However, if a story is bad, why did it leave enough of an impression on your that you /must/ come and tell other people to not read it. You remind me of Facebook mothers.

I am ashamed because this subreddit is meant to be a place where we can discuss and advertise fanfiction, not set out to bash it and go as far as not recommending it. I mean, slash fics already had to create their own subreddit because this sub seemed to blindly downvote anything with even the teensiest bit of gay in it.

A truly welcoming community.
