How dare we criticise publically available stories. If this thread constitutes "witch-hunts" and "bashing", call me the fucking Spanish Inquisition.

  stories created by people.

As opposed to that one time a neural net made a chapter? Are we no longer allowed to call bad stories "bad" because the story was written by an actual human being with feelings? Every story out there is made by someone, and I'm pretty sure the authors know what they're doing, have heard every possible criticism before, and most certainly don't need people like you do be "ashamed" on their behalf.
