Author of The Unbroken Saviour here. Your analysis blew my mind from its accuracy. There was always a strange tightness in my chest whenever I was writing most of the chapters, but I never realized what it was until i saw your comment.

Thank you for your concern, and I will try my hardest to separate reality from my written work in the future.
