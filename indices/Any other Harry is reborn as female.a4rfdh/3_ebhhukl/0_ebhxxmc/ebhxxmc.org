I wanted so badly to like this story, but everybody is written... weird. People yell at strange times, and everybody cries in conversations where they were laughing. It's written like everybody is on the verge of a mental breakdown at any moment. Stressful to read, and no doubt stressful to write.

Honestly it makes me a bit worried for the author, that she's writing characters whose normal state of affairs seems to be in a constant state of intense anxiety.
