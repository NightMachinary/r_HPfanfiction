  Built like an assassin. That's how most would stereotype her. Unfortunately for her superiors, with the qualities of a killer come the qualities of someone who doesn't like to follow orders, and she was never one to conform with the darkness of Konoha anyways. Not even if the prodigy with the Sharingan tries to stop her. Of course, she never anticipated him taking her side. AU.
