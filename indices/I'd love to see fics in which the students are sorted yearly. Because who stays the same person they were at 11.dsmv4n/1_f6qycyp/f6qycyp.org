I feel like the house system works a lot better when it's treated as a tool for like scheduling classes and grouping kids with like personalities together so the chance of world war 3 breaking out in the dorm rooms over someone leaving their socks out is significantly lower. The problem is it's considered the be all end all of who you are as a person. Which is a heavy thing to drop on a kid fresh out of elementary school.
