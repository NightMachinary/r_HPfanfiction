The first fic in the series has a terrible Summary:

#+begin_quote
  AU. When a surprising discovery leads to an unusual occurrence, a centuries long trend is broken and plans whirl into motion. Rumors of a stone, a mirror, and a mysterious door float through the halls of Hogwarts as a prophecy comes into play. Meanwhile, two men fight a shadow war in a vain effort to control the Wizengamot... Sequel complete. Over 75k hits!

Normally I'd just skip it because of the bad summary (it's worse than nothing), but maybe you can give some kind of indication what this fic is about?
