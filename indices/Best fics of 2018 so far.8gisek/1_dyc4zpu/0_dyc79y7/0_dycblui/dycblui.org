Okay. Flye Autumne can do a better job than me explaining it, but it's a political AU where the magical world has many more inhabitants. It follows Harry and Co as they deal with Hogwarts. There's a few changes there. (The Trio is sorted into slytherin. Book 1 happens mostly normally. However, Book 2 has started to significantly depart from canon. (There's no basilisk slaying at the end of book 2, I don't think the diary is even present.) The other story line follows the various players of the game in this universe. On one side, We have Lucius Malfoy and Thomas Gaunt pushing the pureblood agenda. The other, we have Amelia Bones and Dumbledore. It gives more focus to Ron and his chessplaying, and Something has happened to Arthur. What happened isn't revealed yet, but Arthur is dead, and Molly is a shell of her former self. It also plays up the Ancient and Noble houses bit. Ron and his brothers are heirs to various Ancient House. Harry is heir to House Potter. Neville to House Longbottom, and etc. It's quite the interesting fic. Also, Snape and Sinestra might be planning bullshit. I'm not sure on that end yet.
