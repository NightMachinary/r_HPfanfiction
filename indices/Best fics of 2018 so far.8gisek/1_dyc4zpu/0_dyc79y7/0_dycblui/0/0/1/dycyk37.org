I think it's best to see by example:

Here's the description for linkffn(A Denarian Renegade):

#+begin_quote
  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power.
#+end_quote

And for linkffn(By the Divining Light):

#+begin_quote
  Book 1. Follow Harry and Dumbledore as they descend into the depths of Old Magic seeking power and redemption in equal measure. En route they encounter ancient enchantments, a heliopath and an evil that could burn the world.
#+end_quote

Both of these are pretty solid descriptions. They give you a concrete plot hook without revealing too much about the story. Your description, however, is far too vague.
