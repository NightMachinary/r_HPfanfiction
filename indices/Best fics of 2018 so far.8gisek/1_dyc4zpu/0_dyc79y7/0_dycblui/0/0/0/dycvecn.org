Yeah, I'll agree with Deathcrow here. I've seen your fic recommended a couple of times, but I never got around to reading it because the summary isn't very intriguing, I suppose. For example, you say 'when a surprising discovery leads to an unusual occurrence'. What surprising discovery? What unusual occurrence? If you identify what exactly ONE of these elements are in your story, like say, if the unusual discovery is that vampires love fish, then if you put that in the summary, I'd probably read it and go, huh. I wonder what this author can do with that?

Basically, I think your summary is too vague. You should specify some of the more intriguing plot elements you have going on so that the readers feel hooked.
