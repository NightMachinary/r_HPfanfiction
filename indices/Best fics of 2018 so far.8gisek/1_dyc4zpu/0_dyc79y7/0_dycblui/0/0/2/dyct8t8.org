Hey... oh, I didn't know you were around here or I might have been a little less ... harsh. I'd have to read your story to come up with something better. Your current summary is just nice, lyrical sounding, non-sense. "This is a story about people, doing things and some mystical events happen. Also there are plans. There's some other people who also do things." I'm sure you can come up with something substantial that tells me something that happens in your fic (like that the trio is in slytherin or how it's about pure-blood politics or something... idk)? I'd also remove the "75k hits" thing (congrats!), that's a huge red-flag for me and has no place in a summary. A better place for a celebration is an A/N or in your profile.
