  Harry Potter was a contrary creature. He'd learned young that anything Vernon Dursley said the opposite was likely to be true. So when he turned his teacher's hair blue - magic according to his classmates - and Vernon decried that "There Was No Such Thing As MAGIC" Harry knew that magic was real - more that magic was what he had. A Grey Harry story.
