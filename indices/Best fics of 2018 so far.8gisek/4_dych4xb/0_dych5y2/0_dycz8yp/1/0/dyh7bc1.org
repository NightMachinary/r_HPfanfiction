Comments like these can cause people to stop writing. I'm all for an opinion but try to talk about the written piece instead of making a stab at the author.

I for one liked the piece because of how well it (for me) captured the broken and recovered family and the interactions between characters.

While this written piece is not flawless as no such thing exists. I do however believe that it is well worth a read. As such, if the community loses a brilliant contributor, brought by crude remarks and undeserving commentary I would miss it.
