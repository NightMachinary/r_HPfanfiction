Would you mind answering some questions about Innocent? Like what years the first story spans and which characters are involved.

It does seem interesting but also raises some warning flags. The drama/family tag generally implies lots of angsty, tearful, useless scenes. Would you say that's accurate?

Also does the story mainly focus on Harry's pov, a mix of Harry and Sirius or are others involved? The author's name being "Marauderlover" does not bode well.
