Innocent, which could've been broken up into at least two different stories (nearly 500,000 words, while the two stories following it are in the 150K-175K range), covers from when Harry is 8 years old until the year before Hogwarts starts.

I would definitely say there's some angst going on in the first book but I don't think it's flooded. Definitely some good action and storytelling, and it's not just them ringing their hands.

And others are involved. Mostly Harry and Sirius but you got the POV from various other characters throughout the book.

The name provides a good measure of the focus. The story is about Harry, Sirius, and eventually Remus and their lives. A lot of focus on being on the run from the Ministry and transitioning into other stories as it moves along (I will spoiler that there's no Remus/Sirius relationship or anything too off-the-beaten path).
