  If anyone was going to gouge out their own entire magical core and throw up the middle finger at the laws of time, it was Potter. That was his usual modus operandi; find the stupidest and most impossible option available, and take it with as much collateral damage as possible.First things first: Potter had just rescued the both of them, and had done it in such a way that left him once again at death's door. That put them into known territory; Severus, once again, making sure Potter didn't die.Or: Harry Potter tries to fix the world and Severus Snape tries to fix himself.
