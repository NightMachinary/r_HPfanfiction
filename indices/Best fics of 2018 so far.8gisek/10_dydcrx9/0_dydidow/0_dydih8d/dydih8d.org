I love this story so much that I hate waiting. Back when the author updated weekly I used to check his profile every hour or so. Someone told this to me about the story and I'll try to quote them the best way I can "The thing with Black Luminary is that it hits a lot of popular cliches but in contrast to midt fics doing them, manages to hit them right." And i agree with this so much.
