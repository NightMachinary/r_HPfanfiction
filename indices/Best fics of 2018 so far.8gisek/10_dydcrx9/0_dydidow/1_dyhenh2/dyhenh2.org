Eeeeeey! Fanfic is truly the cheapest reading supplement at sea, don't even want to think how many I downloaded and read on deployment.

Protip, if you have any more underways coming up, download your favorites or new undiscovered finished ones to keep for later.

Anyhow, review count rarely means much beyond popularity and time depending on upload speed, loads of good fics I've dug up relatively lacking them.
