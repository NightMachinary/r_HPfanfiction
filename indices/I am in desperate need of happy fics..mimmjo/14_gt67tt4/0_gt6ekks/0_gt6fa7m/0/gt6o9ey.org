I'm using 5.10.1 (Calibre) and 4.0.2 (Fanficfare) and haven't noticed cloudflare issues recently. FFN updates take /forever/ compared to ao3 though.

I'm also scared to update now that I have it working, as the previous two versions of FFF threw those errors constantly.

For what it's worth, I also have my login information and the adult flag in personal.ini - if you don't, you could try that before fiddling around with file versions.
