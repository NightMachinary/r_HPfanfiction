I only know 'esper' from Simon Green's Deathstalker books, myself.

Although it's funny, espers in the Deathstalker series are humans with psychic abilities, who hide away as an underground community to avoid their extermination at the hands of a corrupt empire.

In the second half of the series once the evil empress has been overthrown, they're accepted as free citizens, but some 'elves' (Esper Liberation Force) are trying to take over the empire, seeing esper-kind as superior, and eventually end up using mass mind control to nearly take over humanity's home planet.

Perhaps Deathstalker and Harry Potter could withstand a crossover. There is a point (involving time travel) in one of the Shaman Bond novels where Molly Metcalf ends up mistaken for an esper (psychic) when she's really a witch (magic).
