This sounds more like you want a fic where she has a cognitive condition rather than one where she's blind. You seem somewhat misinformed on what it means to be visually impaired, to the point where I wonder what caused you to ask for this specific prompt, and I doubt Harry would play such a role for a twin if his parents were alive. A person with only visual impairment wouldn't need the intense level of care you mention. I genuinely believe him having provide it, even if she did need it, would lead to resentment, on her part or his, rather than the feelgood fic you want. You're literally asking for codependency.

Ngl the way you wrote this prompt felt so dismissive of the actual struggles disabled people face (including myself). Even fictional characters with disabilities deserve better than to be used only as a prop for a "typical" person's (in this case Harry's) development.

I kinda want to write a fic where she can no longer handle her brother treating her like an invalid and decides to never see him again because feelgood disability inspiration bs literally makes me sick.
