The only one I can think of that really goes deep into this is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry.]] It's from 2007, so it's a bit of a product of its time, but the writing is pretty decent. I read the first thirteen-odd chapters and then stopped because I wasn't fond of Dumbledore's characterization, but if that's not gonna bother you, the Harry-is-abused aspect is tackled in detail.
