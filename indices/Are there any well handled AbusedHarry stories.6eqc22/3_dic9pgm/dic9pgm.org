linkffn(Eight by Lily Elizabeth Snape)

linkffn(Nobody Cared by etherian)

linkffn(Second Chances by Mara Rome)

linkffn(Those Who Grieve by The Lonely God With a Box)

All of these are mentor!Snape or Guardian!Snape raising and/or guiding Harry through not only life but through his abuse at the hands of his relatives. Some are more graphic and intense than others (ie, Those Who Grieve is particularly graphic as it deals with rape so read at your own risk with that one) but the others deal with more realistic depictions of abuse at the hands of the Dursleys. I haven't read any of these in a while, but I do remember them fondly and I hope they are what you're looking for.
