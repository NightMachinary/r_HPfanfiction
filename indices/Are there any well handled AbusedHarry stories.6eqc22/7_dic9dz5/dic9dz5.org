There's one, I can't remember the name, but Harry and Ron are Aurors, and Hermione is in a different branch of the Department of Law Enforcement.

Long story short, Harry lets a witch who claims to have killed her abusive, controlling, Muggle husband in self-defense off after hearing her story. Hermione is outraged, believing that it's impossible for a Muggle to physically overpower a witch one-on-one.

Meanwhile Ron tells Harry that it's impossible for wizarding children to get seriously abused because their accidental magic acts as a shield.

Needless to say, this complicates matters within the Trio's friendship.

It's not that angsty, as far as HP fan fiction goes, but it does shed some light on Harry's childhood. And Hermione and Ron are put firmly, but not unkindly, in their place.
