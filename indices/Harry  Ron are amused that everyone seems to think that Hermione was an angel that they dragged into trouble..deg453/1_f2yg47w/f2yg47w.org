I know there's one exactly like what you're describing, I've definitely read it, but I can't recall even a bit of what it was called.

One that's close that I searched for a bit and found again was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725039/1/In-Which-the-Pink-Elephant-Hides-Under-a-Lampshade][In Which the Pink Elephant Hides Under a Lampshade]], which is somewhat the same thing, but not the one you're looking for (probably), though it's still a good read.
