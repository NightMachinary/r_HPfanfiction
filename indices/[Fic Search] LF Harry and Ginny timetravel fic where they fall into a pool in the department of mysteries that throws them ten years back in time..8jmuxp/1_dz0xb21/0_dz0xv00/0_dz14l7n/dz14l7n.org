That one is both really good and really bad. The actual smut part is outstandingly good but the "plot" is outstandingly bad. It would have been so much better as "The Hogwarts Sex Club" where everyone just shags around without a law legalising rape (and wasn't it supposed to be a voluntary thing? Why is there so much legal stuff surronding it?)
