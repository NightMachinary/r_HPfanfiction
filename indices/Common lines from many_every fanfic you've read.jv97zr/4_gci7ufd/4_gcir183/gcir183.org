Can I ask why? Like it signifies the end of an oath right? In my own fic Dumbledore swears he will never send Harry back to his relatives in front of Mcgonagall and Harry. Harry doesnt know why it's important but Mcgonagall does and is shocked that he went that far but dumbledore is distraught at what he caused Harry to go through.
