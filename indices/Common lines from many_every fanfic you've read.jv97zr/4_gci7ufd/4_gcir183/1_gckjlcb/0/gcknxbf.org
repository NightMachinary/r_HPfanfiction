My main problem with this "oath" is the possibility of a wizard "losing its Magic" and the whole implications it brings. If someone can loose his Magic, someone else can potentially find it. With this Oath in the equation, the "DoM research on Mudbloods" in DH goes from "idiotic piece of propaganda used to justify bigotry" to "something that's plausible and may be true".
