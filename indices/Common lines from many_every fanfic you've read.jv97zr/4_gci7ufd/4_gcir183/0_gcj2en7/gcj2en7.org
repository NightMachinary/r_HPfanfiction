It's not used at all in canon (but given the amount of HP fanon, that's not a very solid metric).

It originates from the Freemasons originally as an addition to, or replacement for, "amen" at the end of prayers. It didn't have any links to "magic" until it was adopted by modern pagans and in particular wiccans, when they became widespread in England in the 1950s (mainly because the "founder" of Wicca had links to the Freemasons, from what I've read).

If this were also true in the HP universe, it wouldn't really be in keeping with the fairly old fashioned setting of Wizarding Britain to use a New Age phrase that had only really been applied to magic 40 before HP is set. Though, of course, seeing as it's fiction you can also do whatever the hell you like.

Sorry for the impromptu etymology rant :)
