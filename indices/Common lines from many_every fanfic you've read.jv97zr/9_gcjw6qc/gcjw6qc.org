I specifically hate the phrase “you wound me.” It's such low-tier banter. It's just some canned phrase that people can insert into ANY conversation when they want their character to seem clever and aloof, but they can't actually think of anything clever or aloof to say.

Ex;

“Well, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess if SOMEBODY did their job around here.”

“You wound me!”

“This is the worst meal I've ever eaten...”

“You wound me!”

“You're the worst friend ever.”

“You wound me!”

SHUT UP. YOU AREN'T WITTY. STOP.

I HOPE YOU /ARE/ WOUNDED. I HOPE YOU'RE WOUNDED ACTUALLY AND GRIEVOUSLY.

Bonus points if they put one hand on their chest and gasp before saying it. Eugh.

Also, for any *j e r k* intending to reply to this comment, saying that I've wounded you --- I preemptively reject your joke and refuse to acknowledge you. It's low-hanging fruit and you're better than that.
