"so mote it be" " Bloddy hell" "The sight of his green, emerald orbs made me cream my pants..." " That's very slytherin of you" "The slimy snake has corrupted you" " You're going dark/you've gone dark" " My boy, you must learn to forgive..." " He did 30 push-ups and 100 sit-ups and ran around the block" I don't see the reason why every single fic where he's going to become independent, it goes like I need to become fit "LETS START JOGGING!!!!!!!!!" And then the author tells us some unrealistic excercise schedule, like bro you're writing a fanfic on magic, we get that he's become an underwear model in a summer but get in with it. It pisses me off a lot.

Also in fics where it's a wbwl or divergence from Halloween night or even no change, the author almost always puts the first chapter as Voldemort walking down the village sneering at the "muggle brats collecting candy" and the sound of his robes alerts the potters to his presence, he blows the door in... I mean like what, we've all read the books, we know what happened!! Why you writing it if there's no change at all!???
