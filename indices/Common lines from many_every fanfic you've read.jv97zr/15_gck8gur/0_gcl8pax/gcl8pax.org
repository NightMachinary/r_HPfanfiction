What you need to do is take your favourite text editor and change all the "For the Greater Goods." into "For Shits and Giggles."

Example

"Why did I have to be tortured by the Dursleys for 11 years professor?"

"It was all for the Shits and Giggles Harry. You wouldn't understand."

"Mindrape?"

"Shits and giggles."

"Giant snake?"

"Shits"

"Dementortown?"

"Giggles."

"O I see well it wasn't so bad then after all."
