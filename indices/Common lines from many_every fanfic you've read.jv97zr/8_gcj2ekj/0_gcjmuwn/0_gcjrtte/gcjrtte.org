Good Ginny bashing stories usually feature some sort of fallen hero Ginny or manipulated Ginny, so she becomes this redeemable anti-hero. In the best Ginny-bashing stories, Ginny realizes she was being manipulated and sacrifices herself in some manner so that Harry and the Love Interest can escape/survive/win/marry/etc.

In Hermione bashing stories, she's portrayed as incredibly smart but misguided, and unwilling to listen to others. There's no redemption arc for Hermione, ever.
