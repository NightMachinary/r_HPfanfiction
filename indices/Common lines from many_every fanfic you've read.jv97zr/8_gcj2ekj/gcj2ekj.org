Manipulative old coot, Dumbledork, on a few memorable (and cringey) occasions I have had the distinct displeasure of reading the phrase Dumb-as-a-door. Like...if you're gonna bash him, fine. But could everyone stop using the same 6 insults they pull out of the bashing-hat in lieu of coming up with an original insult?

Oh, and on the subject of bashing, Weasels in weasley bashing fics, and particularly Weaslette. I've read far too many fics with that as an insult. It pops up everywhere there is Ginny-bashing. Its not even etymologically correct-it would still be weasel, a girl weasel is called the same thing as a boy weasel, weasel is an english word, you wouldn't change the suffix, this phrase is literally aggravating to look at.

Mind you, I say all of this mostly in jest, I don't mean to personally insult authors who use these phrases in their writing, I just am especially annoyed by the words.
