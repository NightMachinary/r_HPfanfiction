  How to move past their canon issues
#+end_quote

The easiest way would be to bond them via trial by fire. The Burrow is attacked and burned to the ground, the Weasleys scatter and run. Ginny and Fleur are separated and have to fight their way through a bunch of Death Eater minions (keep in mind that Ginny would be 15 and unlike at the Ministry, there would be no "take them alive" order).

You could also throw in some ridiculous pureblood law where Harry has to marry all women who owe him life debts, but these are marriages on paper only and he does nothing sexual with them because he is quite happy with his real love. Stuck in those marriages, they realise that they get along quite well. Such a scenario would work well in a "we won the war but nothing changed" scenario, where pureblood bigots still control the Ministry.

As for how to break up Bill and Fleur, just use canon Molly. Either Bill really falls for Tonks (which, coincidentally also gets rid of the Lupin "romance"), have Fleur take offence at that and Bill's lack of defence or a mixture of both.
