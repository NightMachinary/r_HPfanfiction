If I were writing such a story, I'd start it after the war. The first step would be for Fleur to acknowledge Ginny's competence and surety. In return, Ginny could compliment Fleur for her own achievements, mentioning how she was secretly pleased to see a witch in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and that Fleur proved she was more than a pretty face.

To move them on as a couple, the easy play would be for something to befall Bill. They could reach out to grieve over it; Bill seemed to be Ginny's favorite brother after all. Perhaps in helping Fleur grieve, Ginny finds herself taking care of Fleur's daughters, who over time come to admire her for being a Quidditch Pro and beautiful without fussing about with decorum and grooming obsessions as their mother's family tends to.

A more subtle arrangement might be one where Bill simply doesn't get in the way of them having a close, even intimate, friendship as he doesn't feel threatened by his sister. An unrelated lover would seem like betrayal of the marriage vows, but not Ginny.

The more I think on it, the more tempted I am to write it.
