Instead of killing Harry, Voldemort adopts him with the goal of making his greatest liability an asset. He raises Harry as a secret son. James and Lily aren't killed in this story, but they think Harry is dead. When Voldemort sends a teenage Harry on assassination missions, the Order of the Phoenix captures the mysterious "Dark Prince" and realizes it's Harry Potter. Harry is forced to attend Hogwarts, and Dumbledore forbids him to tell people he's the Dark Prince for his own safety.
