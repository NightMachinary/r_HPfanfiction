Not to get all picky, but technically Harry Potter can't pretend to be Harry Potter. he IS Harry Potter regardless of his light/dark/grey leanings.

So if I catch your drift... what you are asking for is simply a Harry Potter hiding his true intentions and pretending to be more like the canon Harry we all know.
