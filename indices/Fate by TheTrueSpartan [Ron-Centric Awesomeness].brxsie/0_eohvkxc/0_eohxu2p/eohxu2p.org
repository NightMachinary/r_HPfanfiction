I would instead say there were always two sides to Harry Potter magic. One was the rational side that Hermione or Tom Riddle mastered but there was always that supernatural side like the power of love and the deathly hallows that only Dumbledore and maybe Grindelwald seemed to begin to grasp. Tom knew a lot about magic and how it should work but his rationalist mind could not even fathom how more powerful things could exist when they really shouldn't.

Of course this fic takes it a step above even that but we can be at least sure that the story won't be taken over by the cosmic scale things. That's what the author promises anyway and he seems to be keeping his promises so far.

Also I don't think the story means to say that there is no freedom but that Ron is tormented by the question of if he has any freedom at all. If you're caught up then the latest chapters seem to be all about Ron peeling back the chains that bound him and finally feeling somewhat free.
