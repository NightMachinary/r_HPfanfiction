I agree, it is seriously well written, but I really don't like two things: generally I dislike people with too much superpowers in HP fanfiction. Aside from magic itself, HP books are distinctively pedestrian (certainly middle-class, no Lord Potter!) and I would say even rationalistic. Magic is more like yet-undiscovered part of science than something so cosmic and overwhelming as The Entity here. Also, one of the main moral messages of HP books for me was the freedom of choice, “It is our choices which decide who we are”, and The Entity seems like taking all freedom from Ron. I hope that it will turn to be just side-effect of the brain damage, but I will probably loose on this one.
