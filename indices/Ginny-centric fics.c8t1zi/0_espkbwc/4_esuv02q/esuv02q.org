"Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince" is legit one of my all time favorites. I love Ginny's characterization and how it fleshes out Harry & Ginny's romance, making it more believable while not really changing anything. I love that it isn't entirely focused on romance, but let's Ginny be alive, and be a fun, funny and interesting character who also struggles with trauma from the chamber of secrets. And all the relations she forms with various others as well. I espescially like her interactions with Slughorn.

So yeah... Good stuff!
