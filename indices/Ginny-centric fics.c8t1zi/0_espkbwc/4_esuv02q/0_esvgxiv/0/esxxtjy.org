Yes, Snape's outburst of "I WILL KEEP YOU SAFE, LILY!" Woah, boy, That really took me out of it for a while. Luckily, it's not a large part of the story, so I was able to ignore it.

I don't like the idea of Ginny looking like Lily either. It was handled a lot better when Slughorn noticed a similarity, but also treated Ginny as her own person. That makes sense, like I sometimes see someone whose appearance reminds me of someone else, but not to the point where I forget myself and start treating them as that other person.
