The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][Changeling]] and its sequel series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017][Armistice]] are fantastic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary By Arabella]] is an old one that focuses on Ginny's diary interactions with Tom Riddle. It's long, complete, and portrays a Ginny who's very brave for an 11 year fighting a monster.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/book-learning-hp.446003/reader][Book Learning]] by Zerrer is a about a Ginny who's essentially been combined with Tom Riddle.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6997183][the train station]] by dirgewithoutmusic only has one chapter, but it's a really good analysis on Ginny.
