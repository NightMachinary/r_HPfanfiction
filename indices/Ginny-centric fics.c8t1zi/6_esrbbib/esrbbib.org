One another idea, which has never been utilized WELL by anybody, AFAIK (including Ms. Rowling for her shame) ... one of the best dialogs ever written is in my opinion when Ginny talks with Harry in OOP about being possessed. That one line ‘“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.' ... she says two words, the line has five words, and yet we suddenly see that there are novels hidden there.

We all are touched by this line, because we all forgot (and yes, it is partially JKR's fault, because she wrote that excellent princess-saved-from-dragon-by-knight story, and then completely ignored her for two more books). What drama Ginny went through? How did she deal with the constant presence of Tom Riddle in her life? Was that the struggle which made her into a fighter? How did it change her? How will she live this change in the next fights? And nothing ... JKR just threw that dialogue to the readers and never fully followed up on it again.

There is a bit of it in linkffn(3912184;4236594), but I have never really saw it processed well enough.
