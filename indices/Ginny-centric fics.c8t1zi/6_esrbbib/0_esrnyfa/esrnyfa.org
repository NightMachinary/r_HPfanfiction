Agree, and the scene in the library with Harry are pivotal in the Hinny relationship. Another area JKR promised so much was Ginny being the seventh daughter, and the first girl in seven generations. Nothing was written about that in her canon, yet promised so much. Can highly recommend The Changeling, and for any great Hinny stories, please check out FloreatCastellum, gryffindormischief and if you like AU, jenorama has a whole Potterverse of stories, with healer Ginny (was started before the books were finished) California Dreaming is epic! All great authros previously mentioned here, def a great place to start.
