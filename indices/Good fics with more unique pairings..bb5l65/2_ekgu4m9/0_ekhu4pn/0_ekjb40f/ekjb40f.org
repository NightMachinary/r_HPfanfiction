I like how WhiteSquirel made Harry-Luna pairing in the Animagus series (see above for links), or Arpad Hrunta in the Nargles and Charms series linkao3(567400;568303). Arpad Hrunta is sometimes too much sexual in some his other stories, but when he keeps himself closer to PG-13, he is usually very good.
