hey! My recs might not be good but in terms of smart harry you could try Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. He's definitely really intelligent and eccentric, as for funny... he's funny in a way that anyone with 6 PHDs would find funny, but not in an amusing way IMO. I'm going to be honest, I made it through the first book but I couldn't slog through the rest of it. It can be really hit or miss, but it is definitely a serious fic that requires a lot of mental effort to get through (i was not willing to exert that effort lol). Some people have written posts in this subreddit about why they love or hate HPMOR, so I would definitely read some of those reviews before you start reading. Here's the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]]

So now that i've got the obligatory HPMOR rec out of the way, I'm going to rec something that I really liked. It's called Oh God Not Again, and the premise is basically that harry goes back in time from when he was 23 into his 11 year old body and basically decides to have a good time and fuck with everyone. I thought it was really funny, and although he isn't technically smarter, he's 23 so of course he makes way better decisions about everything and does super well in school. If you can get over the time travel aspect of it, then I definitely recommend it :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]

Anyways I hope these are helpful!
