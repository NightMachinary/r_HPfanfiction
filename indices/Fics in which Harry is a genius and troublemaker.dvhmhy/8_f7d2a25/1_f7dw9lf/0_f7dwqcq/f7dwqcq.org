I was exaggerating as a joke. the point was that its uncommon for anyone to have more than 1 PHD (maybe 2), and therefore pretty much no one finds him funny because there is pretty much no one who fits the build of having 6 PHDs

(also for the record apparently the most amount of PHDs someone has had was 30 i think? Or maybe 14? I think you can look it up but maybe they would like HPMOR more than I did lol)
