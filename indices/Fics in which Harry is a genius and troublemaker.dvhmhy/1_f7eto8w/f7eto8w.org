"Mr. Potter! Could you please explain how you caused a hole in the wall of a classroom and a one hundred feet wide crater in the mountain north of the school? You were supposed to work on your muggle studies project, but from the rumors I've heard it sounds like you were attempting to turn lead into gold!"

"Xenon and copper."

"Excuse me?"

"I was trying to turn xenon and copper into gold, Professor McGonagall. You see, muggles can turn one element into another, but it's really limited. A few months ago I had the idea to see if I could improve upon the method with magic, and that became my muggle studies project."

"And would you explain to me how that resulted in a massive crater? Not even your father managed that!"

"Well, you see, I read this really fascinating nuclear physics book and my idea was to bombard a Copper-65 target with Xenon-132, producing Bismut-197 which takes about three days to decay into stable gold. So I started building a particle accelerator. Have you ever used /Arresto Momentum/ on a moving train? Well, I did and I figured out that it can stop things relative to different frames of reference, so what I tried to do to accelerate the particles was to arrest them in a frame of reference moving towards the target at really high speed. I finished the instant accelerating rune array yesterday, and before I start on the vacuum chamber, xenon source and bismuth seperator, I wanted to test it. So tried to see if it could accelerate a pebble. Unfortunately I messed up my calculation for the test velocity by confusing meters and kilometers per second, so I ended up accelerating the pebble to a small fraction of light speed. I think that was roughly what happened, Professor. On the positive side, if Voldemort tries to attack Hogwarts we got what's basically a railgun."
