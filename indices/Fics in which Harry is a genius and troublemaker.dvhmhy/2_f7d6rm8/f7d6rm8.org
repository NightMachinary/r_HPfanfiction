linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi) - Mad scientist Harry. Does crazy shit in the pursuit of magical science. His teachers are spared from the worst of it, but his classmates, especially poor Hermione, may be traumatized for life.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Geek of Magic by jlluh) - Borderline idiot savant Harry, and hilarious because of it. He's a serious transfiguration prodigy. He doesn't really deliberately do crazy things in pursuit of learning, it's just that he ceaselessly experiments with transfiguration and doesn't spend a moment thinking about the dangers/consequences of it.
