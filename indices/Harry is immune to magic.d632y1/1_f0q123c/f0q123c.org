It's not quite an anti-magic field, but Harry is essentially immune to hostile spellfire (and most other hostile things) in Enter the Dragon.

Despite Harry's ridiculous OP-ness, it's actually a thought-provoking read. His powers are frequently played for laughs, and they /don't/ allow him to curbstomp all the world's problems, not when those problems are things like international human trafficking powered by extensive mind magic compulsions, ancient sites of sufficient stored power to crack the Earth's crust located in the territory of nations with almost no formal diplomacy nor open borders, and the prospect of Harry someday becoming ridiculously, magically, "potent" and potentially impregnating every female within several miles the first time he has a wet dream.
