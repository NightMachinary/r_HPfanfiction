You don't mean [[http://hpff.com/]] , do you? That's some weird Chinese (?) site. Did you mean [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/]] ? One secret: [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] (be it a standalone program or the plugin for Calibre) supports it, so you can download the book as EPub and be happy.
