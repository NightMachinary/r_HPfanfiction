By path, do you mean format? I download into PDF files. I only started using the site a couple days ago. An exact example would be A Butterfly Effect by SlyGoddess. I've tried to download it a couple times and it's always missing chapters, usually chapter 10, at least. It happens with almost every single long fic I try to download. I can't use the email option as I don't use kindle.
