The linkffn(Resonance) trilogy has something sort of like this a bit further in. Harry defeats Voldemort very early on, in sixth year, and finds himself at a bit of a loss as to how to live the rest of his life. Dumbledore in this fic has been not allowing himself to age normally so he can stay alive to combat Voldemort, and resumes aging and dies in Harry's seventh year.

At several points the Wizarding public is quite frightened of how powerful Harry is and Harry finds it useful to emulate Dumbledore's mild mannerisms to put them at ease. He also dresses up as Dumbledore at a Halloween party at one point.
