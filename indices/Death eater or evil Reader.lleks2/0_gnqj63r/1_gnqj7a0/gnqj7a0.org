  This is the story of Lydia Bones, a perfectly normal and average person that chose to become a Death Eater over dying. Lydia was never a huge Harry Potter fan. She only ever watched the movies with her sister on snowy days, so she didn't realize what world she'd woken up in until her new brother went to Hogwarts when she was seven. Before long, she went off to Hogwarts, where she met Sirius Black's brother (who she knows is going to die, even if she doesn't remember how) and Barty Crouch Jr (who she knows is a â€˜bad guy', even if she doesn't remember why). Now, she's graduated and Voldemort is knocking at her door and she isn't Dumbledore. She isn't brave or talented enough to tell him no.
