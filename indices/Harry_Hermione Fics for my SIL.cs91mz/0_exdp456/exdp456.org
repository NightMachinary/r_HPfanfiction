[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]]

This is pretty close to canon, with the point of divergence being Hermione deciding to cast a charm that will let her know if Harry comes to grievous bodily harm over the summer. This causes the Goblet of Fire to replace Harry's name with hers. There are ripple effects and they do eventually start dating, but they remain awkward teenagers and the romance remains mostly in their heads for most of the story.
