Maybe she could try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by StarFox5). It's an extensive AU, where Hermione is expelled in her 2nd year for a crime she didn't commit, and she swears to get her revenge. It's a long one, very heavy on the action. It is Harry/Hermione, but it's very much a slow burn, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.
