Tom Riddle from an alternate universe where something (a different social circle due to a different sorting, a different orphanage, a loving girlfriend which filled the hole in his heart, a nice chat with the newspaper vendor at King's Cross) prevented him from going evil is summoned to the canon verse by some death eater in the 90s. However, since a sane Riddle would probably be closer to Slughorn than to Voldemort, he is horrified by his alternate/canon universe self and decided to fix things.

It would be interesting since the AU Riddle has the same potential as Voldemort but would be unwilling to use it, or afraid that he would end up as the same monster if he stares into the abyss for too long.
