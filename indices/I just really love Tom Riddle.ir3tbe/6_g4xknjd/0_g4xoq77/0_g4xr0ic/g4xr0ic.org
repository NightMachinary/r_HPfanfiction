I am familiar with humour slipping into writing to the point where I have given up even trying to write something completely serious.

However, without having read Rectifier, I might be able to point you into a different direction (since it is tagged Riddle, Voldemort and Dumbledore).

Perhaps the easiest solution to the "too similar" problem would be to have Riddle outright dismiss Dumbledore since he failed again and again to get to this point with Voldemort en large. So he seeks out Harry and basically goes from there with a Third Way fraction of him, Harry, (maybe Ron and Hermione), and some of the Order members who have not been involved in the first war and failed to win the peace (so the younger background cast like Tonks and Hestia Jones rather than Moody, Doge and Lupin).

Of course, if you don't mind whacky humour, have Riddle adopt Harry after he went to check up on the child who defeated his alter ego only to be shocked by how the Dursleys treat him. Basically a reverse of all those awful "Harry/Hermione adopts/saves Riddle only to end up in bed with him" fics.
