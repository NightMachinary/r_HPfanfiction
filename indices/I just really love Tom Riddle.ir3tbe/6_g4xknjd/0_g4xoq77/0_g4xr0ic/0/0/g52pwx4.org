It would definitely be something different and better, especially if you don't make it romantic. Although if you want just that arc, maybe before Hogwarts so that Harry is still in the cupboard and the summoning was by a death Eater who mentions Horcruxes or immortality in general without going into details. Or maybe the revival fails because Voldemort is still around as spirit and Riddle then figures out why he ended up summoned.
