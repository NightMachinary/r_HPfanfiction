Tom Riddle and the Sugar Mommas

In which Tom has the inexplicable ability to attract rich, older women everywhere he goes. He really, really hates it because they keep on getting in the way of his dark lord plans.

He tried to use this ability to get Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's locket from Hepzibah Smith but it backfired on him. Now he's become paranoid and gone into hiding to get away from all of the sugar mommas.
