Tom Riddle gets caught with a minor offense and has to serve detention with Dumbledore. But instead of writing lines, or something easy like that Dumbledore makes his detention as painful as possible for Tom. Tom Riddle has to simply eat dinner/ drink tea with Dumbledore for an hour and have a "civil" conversation with the man he hates. Dumbledore of course, being his old crazy self, talks to Tom about his "feelings" and "love" and just generally makes Tom feel uncomfortable.
