Ahhh I love Tom, too! And I have a long fic idea that I'm kinda working on and am excited about!

Anyway

Maybe this can be one of those "how to annoy Voldemort" fics except it's Tom. Maybe he's starting to gather followers and it's all serious obviously because they're trying to take over the wizarding world and one of his newest followers is a girl and she's /ridiculously cheerful/ and her antics make him want to avada (Kedavra) himself lol

Is that any good? I hope lol
