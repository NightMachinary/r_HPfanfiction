Eh, I think I've read through about 70 chapters or so before I gave up. It's well written but from what I remember it still has a lot of the pitfalls of all "raising dark!Harry" fics. Voldemort is too successful. Harry is too powerful and accepting of Voldemort's influence. Dumbledore and the light side is too incompetent. The paganism/mysticism angle was also really too much for me. It has wonderful word building but that world is too dark for me personally.
