Hit the Ground Running was quite good. Harry actually acted like an 11 year old kid for once. The only thing I would nitpick would be that the ending was quite abrupt and unsatisfying...? I definitely would have liked to see a sequel from the same author but it's still a very solid story on it's own.

Rectifier isn't so good. I usually give multi chapter stories of this length around 3 chapters or so but there were too many things that annoyed me about it for me to continue. There isn't enough build up and character development when we're introduced to Tom Riddle to really accept his behavior. It's also hard to believe Dumbledore would just accept Tom's story so easily and just let him do whatever.
