I always like character study stories like these over plot driven ones but I think shifting around the chronological order of events makes it unnecessarily obfuscating. The motif that supposedly ties the narrative together is "fire" but while the individual parts of Tom's life we are presented with are interesting on their own, they don't really provide much insight on his character, or rather they don't fit together into an actual narrative to discern what the author is trying to show of Tom's character. Or maybe I'm just too dense to figure it out.
