I really loved Silver Pard's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/Eternal-Return][Eternal Return]] so I'm a little disappointed with insurgere. It's a well enough written story but I just can't accept Tom wanting to be sorted into Hufflepuff. While Tom is still true to his self-preserving and narcissistic nature, his justifications for being sorted into Hufflepuff are rather weak and out of character. He would want to be in the "best" house to have the most advantage not be in a house that looks the weakest. Just too ooc for this premise to work I think.
