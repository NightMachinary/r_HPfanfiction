Sure I'm not arguing that, but from my personal experience a lot of the community I've encounteres still subscribe to this idea and it's reflected in their stories. Besides, not all members of the HP fandom follow every word that the author puts out about the universe. That's why widely followed interpretations are still based on the books which never made it clear the effect of the love potion and Tom Riddle's conception. If it were clear then the author would never had to clarify in the first place after all.
