  While the Harry Potter series is near and dear to my heart it does have the problem of having a flat villain. The love potion = not being able to understand love idea contributes to the flat character problem. If all Voldemort's actions are caused by the love potion theory then he's set up for failure from the very start.

Rowling made it more than clear that his actions are not caused by the love potion.

Quote from an interview with JKR:

  Ravleen: How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

  J.K. Rowling: It was a *symbolic* way of showing that he came from a loveless union - but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him.
