Ooh, copperbadge! I love some of their Wolfstar stories. I'm surprised I've never got to this one. Tom's heel face turn seems believable enough but I wonder how the political climate of the wizarding world changed since he never became Lord Voldemort. Why was Severus researching about horcruxes or turning to the dark side without Voldemort's influence on society? Like one of the commentators mentioned on AO3, I was totally expecting Remus to kill Tom for the horcux knowledge but I guess it's not that dark of a story, sadly.
