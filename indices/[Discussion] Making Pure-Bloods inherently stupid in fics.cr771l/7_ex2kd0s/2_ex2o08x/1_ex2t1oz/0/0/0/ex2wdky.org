??? I've seen it used across the entire fandom? It's not exclusive to Harry and Hermione fics. It's become something of a staple, a bit like Daphne's characterization.

I'd really enjoy if you stopped trying to misinterpret the use of names, a thing more than one person can have, as me somehow wanting to ship two real adults. I found it cute when I figured it out, it seemed like a nice fandom-exclusive bit of tribute for actors of a movie, but that's the full extent of my enjoyment of it. It's kinda gross that you seem hellbent on twisting that into something else.
