I'm not shipping two IRL people. I find real people fanfiction disturbing as a rule, it's creepy and invasive and I'm /kinda/ upset that you're implying otherwise.

I always took Dan and Emma used as names being tributes to the actors, not the actors themselves. At least, I've never seen it taken as IRL shipping, and if that's why you aren't fond of it that's fine, and a reason why to dislike using it.

But don't implicate me in being the opposite. I've never seen a piece of fanfiction that works off of the idea that they're identical to the actors or are in some way representations of the actors and I sure as shit wouldn't be reading it or enjoying it if I had.
