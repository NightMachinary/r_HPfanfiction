Here's the excerpt from the script:

#+begin_quote
  *DELPHI effortlessly rises into the air. HARRY steps back --- amazed.*

  *HARRY/VOLDEMORT (trying not to show his shock):* You learnt --- flight --- from --- me?

  DELPHI unleashes a bolt from her hand. HARRY matches her.

  *DELPHI:* Incendio!

  *HARRY:* Incendio!

  *The bolts meet in a beautiful explosion in the middle of the room. And with her other hand DELPHI sends bolts to both doors as they try to open them. HARRY looks at the doors, dismayed.*

  *DELPHI:* What? Thought your friends were going to join you, did you?

  *HARRY:* Fine. I'll deal with you alone.

  *He moves to attack her again. But she is far stronger. HARRY's wand ascends towards her. He is disarmed. He is helpless.*

  *HARRY:* How did you . . . ? What are you?

I don't know how people can defend this... I mean, I'm sure it looks exciting on stage, but it destroys Harry as a character. He dedicated his life to bringing dark wizards to justice, even died trying to defeat one, spent his adult life as an Auror. Then he gets whipped by a teenage girl. I've seen people try to justify this through Delphini being trained by the Lestranges, but come on. The Lestrange brothers were arrested by Aurors after Voldemort fell and spent 14 years in Azkaban, unlike Sirius who managed to escape. And Bellatrix Lestrange got one-shotted by a housewife.
