  Ron is about average or a bit above, usually on Harry's level but lacking Harry's flashes of brilliance.

1. Nobody fighting experienced Death Eaters at 15 is average. Sure the kids were losing until the Order showed up, but keep in mind the general public can't be relied upon to cast a shield charm correctly. The kids were not average for their age.

2. In the gestalt that Rowling modelled Hogwarts on, early 20th century British boarding schools, just passing your school certs is an achievement. This was before modern grade inflation where every student is expected to get A's. "Exceeds Expectations" is exactly that, Ron or Harry exceeded the expectations required for an OWL in the subject. That's not average.

I'm not saying Ron is the next Dumbledore, or even the next McGonagall or Snape, I'm just saying that applying modern views of exam results to canon may not be what the author intended.
