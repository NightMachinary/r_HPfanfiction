I think he's at or slightly above Harry's level academically. Both are good but not great at most subjects, but capable of exceeding the usual ability of a Hogwarts student when pressured. (Occlumency and the cabinet repair are good examples for Draco; resisting the Imperius Curse and casting the Patronus in Harry's case)

Neither of them are a match for Hermione, but I'd put both Draco and Harry firmly in the upper third of students. Ron is about average or a bit above, usually on Harry's level but lacking Harry's flashes of brilliance.
