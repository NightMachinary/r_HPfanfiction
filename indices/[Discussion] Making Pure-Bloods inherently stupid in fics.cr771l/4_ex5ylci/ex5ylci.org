Good writing means treating people like people.

Draco has been raising as a racist and pureblood supremacist, and acts like it, it does not mean he is dumb or anything. Draco is intelligent, he is also a pre-teen/teen and acts as he was taught to; we also see a little, through the books, how he evolves and changes and the weight the war has on him and, maybe, in the last two books, how he starts questioning what he was told (mudbloods are people too, and not all's perfect under lord V!). Crabbe and Goyle are probably not the sharpest tools, but they are people with feelings and Draco's friends and the produce of their education; Pansy (when we see her) is an infatuated teen. The members of the inquisition team probably ranges from the ones totally engrossed in the rhetoric, to followers that just want to be "in".

No character is simple, easy to write. FF authors are, mostly, not professional writers (and some of them see the world as black and white too). Writing a character with strenghts and weaknesses, that acts following a vision of the world that can evolve (sometimes slowly if only with age, sometimes quickly, sometimes in between), in a logical way within a compelling story, that's hard. Writing one-dimensional cliche characters is way easier.
