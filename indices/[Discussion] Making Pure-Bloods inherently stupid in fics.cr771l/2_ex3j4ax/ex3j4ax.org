  Which is odd, considering he looks to be trying (not succeeding) to knock Hermione off top of the class.

This is a misconception, in my opinion. That scene with Lucius and Draco does state that he's doing worse than Hermione, but not necessarily that he's doing better than everyone else. The scene, to me, had more to say about Malfoy's racist views than Draco's intelligence.

  I have no love for Draco Malfoy's character in canon, but I've seen fics where he's treated as this moron who only is passing due to nepotism.

This happens with a couple of polarizing characters. Ron, who we have canon proof that he is a good student and fighter, gets treated similarly. Malfoy is not a bad wizard, but i don't think having him a level below the trio is out of the ordinary. He just doesn't have the canon feats that they have.
