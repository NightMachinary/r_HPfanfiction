I'm not saying that him being a level below Harry, Ron, and Hermione makes him incompetent. Draco is a competent wizard per your examples, but the trio have some */really good/* feats.

Harry drives a hundred plus dementors away in his third year, beats Draco pretty handily in sixth year, can throw off the imperious curse, and holds off Voldemort pretty well in his fourth year.

Ron used the Leviosa spell on a troll club, that had to be extremely heavy, and raised it high enough to knock out a troll /in his first two months at hogwarts./ He disarmed Bellatrix Lestrange in the battle of Hogwarts, mostly by surprise but nonetheless impressive. He beats Greyback with only Neville and escapes five snatchers.

Hermione really needs no explanation. She isn't as good of a fighter as Harry and Ron, but her skill as a witch can go pretty much unsaid.
