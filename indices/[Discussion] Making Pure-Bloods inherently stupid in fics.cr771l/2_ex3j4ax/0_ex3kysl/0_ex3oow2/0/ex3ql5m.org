We really don't have consistent power levels for spells.

But let's agree to disagree, I doubt either of us have time for a canon analysis. It's really open to interpretation.

Seriously though, Ron getting bashed is also kinda bad, and he got pretty much the same grades barring defense as Harry. It's actually the most substantial example, but I like Ron as a character, so it fit poorly for the discussion.

When it comes to treatment, while Hermione treats Harry better than anyone else generally, she arguably treats Ron worse than Harry does. Whether Scabbers, him becoming prefect over Harry, or Lavender. He gets a raw treatment in canon. People say how he abandoned him in Goblet of fire and deathly hallows. Only the first was really his fault, and he didn't slander Harry. The second was the Horcrux. People don't blame Ginny for the chamber of secrets.
