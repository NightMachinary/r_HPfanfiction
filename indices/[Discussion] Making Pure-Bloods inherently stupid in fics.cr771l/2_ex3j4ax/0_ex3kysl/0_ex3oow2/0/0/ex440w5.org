I think that people excuse Ginny because she is 11, and her being literally possessed and thus having no free will. And she actually did fight it.

Ron wasn't possessed, though I don't doubt that it did influence him. Yet the things he brings up are kinda shallow other than the part about his family, and his family is already in the crosshairs.

Honestly, the dumbest part was all of them actually wearing the Horcrux. They could have just kept it in the mokeskin bag.
