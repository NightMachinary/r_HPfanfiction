In the more simplistic fanfic I see, any group is lumped together with similar 'these are the dumb people' traits depending on who the author is trying to make look good. Often, the muggles are the dumb group if one of the magical characters is supposed to look good, but sometimes the magical characters are dumb if a muggleborn or a muggle character is supposed to look good, or the purebloods are dumb if Harry or a muggleborn is supposed to look good.
