Ehh.

I feel it ruins the fantasy element.

Contrary to the witch hunts' goals, witches and wizards were never really threatened by them.

That being said, I do enjoy people copying ideas rather than implementations from muggles in fics.

So instead of machine guns to kill death eaters, the gang develops a rapid fire spell.

Instead of traditional bombs, you have potion disasters weaponized.

Floo monitors instead of wiretaps.

Etc.
