You can say that if you have five people who know. You can even say that if you have ten people who know. Maybe twenty, maybe thirty. But hundreds? Thousands, even? How do wizards account for the copious wiretapping that was occurring during the Cold War (and still occurring later but in a more low key way)? How do they realize that a random Chinese spy was listening in on the phone call when one of Margaret Thatcher's men told America that there was a magical government in Britain? How do they realize that said Chinese spy sent that info to the CPC, who then sent it to the Soviet Union, who then started a covert campaign to figure out if there was magic within the USSR? How do they hunt down every person who was told by British intelligence when half the people spreading the information don't even know the real names or faces of the people they spoke to? And if by some miracle they obliviate every single possible person in every single government, how do they wipe that information from computers and tape recorders when they're barely aware those things exist and could have compromising info on them?

Intelligence that important spreads like wildfire between allies and enemies alike, especially in times like the Cold War, and I just don't believe the magical world understands the muggle world enough to put proper procedures in place to deal with that.
