Yeah, I don't see how that would be much fun. If you're going to write a story about a muggle/wizard conflict, it'd be cooler to see the way their strengths and weaknesses clash. Like how can muggles avoid wizards just apparating away? And how do wizards predict muggles when they haven't kept track of muggle tech for hundreds of years? And how do they deal with their respective population sizes, with wizards popping up in muggle families randomly but also being a minuscule population in comparison to muggles? And how do muggles figure out defenses against things like curses and and transfiguration and the like? Would the muggles ever consider using bombs, knowing that they'd likely catch a lot of British civilians in the crossfire?

Now I want to write a oneshot.
