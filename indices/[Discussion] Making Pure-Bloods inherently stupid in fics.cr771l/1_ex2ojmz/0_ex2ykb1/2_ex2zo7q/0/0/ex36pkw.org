Obviously muggles aren't the dumb, oblivious fools they seem like in canon. Honestly, I don't buy for a second that the entirety of the international intelligence community doesn't know about magic. If the Ministry of Magic was tipping off world leaders about their existence during the Cold War, /especially/ Margaret Thatcher, then every major super power already has a dossier on local and foreign magical communities.

But I don't see why that would provoke a negative response from the fandom. I think it's more interesting to work on worldbuilding with the assumption that muggle society works just like real society does and isn't full of idiots.
