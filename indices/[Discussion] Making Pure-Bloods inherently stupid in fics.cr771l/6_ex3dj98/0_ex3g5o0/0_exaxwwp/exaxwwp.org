Did you read that fanfic explaining this in the most dramatic way possible? Aberforth was a magical vet, working on his fiance's farm. His fiance was in a bad accident, and he transfigured her into a goat because he only knew how to heal animals. She was still injured too badly and he failed. The Ministry came and charged him for improper charms on a goat when it was his dead fiance, and the media ran with the obvious headline instead of the truth.
