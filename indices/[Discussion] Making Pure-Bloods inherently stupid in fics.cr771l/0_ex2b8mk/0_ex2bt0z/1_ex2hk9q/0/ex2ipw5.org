Fanfiction authors often look to real life examples when fleshing out their characters. Stories focused on Slytherin characters need to show how the characters can believably think of themselves as the good guys without turning them into 2-dimensional card carrying villains. The author doesn't need to justify the character's behavior, just show why the characters /think/ they are justified.

Thus, it makes sense for the authors to model their characters' beliefs off of examples of bigotry and extremism in real life.
