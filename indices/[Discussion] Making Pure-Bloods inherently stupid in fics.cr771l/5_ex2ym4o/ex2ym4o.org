Yeah I don't do this typically I write slytherin Harry fanfics so I typically make everyone at least good at something and below average at something else so they aren't totally inept. (Ex I make Malfoy amazing at potions but below average at transfiguration things like that) I feel like making a character inept just because they are the bad guy is stupid and terrible character design, so I don't do it.
