And for pity's sake, Malfoy was not a bad seeker who "had to buy his way onto the team." I went thru the books once to check, and while I no longer have the specific results, Draco was NOT a bad seeker!

In every game that we know the results of, *except* against Griffindor, the Slytherins won either every or nearly every single game. That can't happen with a bad seeker, with the game being as unbalanced as it is towards catching the snitch, even with the better brooms his team had.

No, Malfoy just used the family money to give his team an unfair advantage. Perfectly in character.
