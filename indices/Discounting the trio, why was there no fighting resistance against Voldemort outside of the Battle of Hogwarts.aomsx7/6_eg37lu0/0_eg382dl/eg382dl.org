This is the correct answer. Maybe you need to emphasise the aspect of families being threatened more, because that's a standard tactic in autocratic, repressive regimes. And it's also something that was very evident in Deathly Hallows, but in the shape of Hogwarts essentially becoming a concentration camp for all the wizarding kids. You saw what happened to defying people when Luna got arrested for Xenophilius' writings in the Quibbler.
