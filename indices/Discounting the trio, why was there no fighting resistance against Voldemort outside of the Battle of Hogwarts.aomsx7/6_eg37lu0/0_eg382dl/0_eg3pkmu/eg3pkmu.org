I'd argue that fflai focuses a little too much on the Jews and ignores the existence of successful resistance movements in pretty much every occupied country. Just look at the assassinations of Heydrich and Seyffardt, the sabotage of the railway system in France prior to D-Day, the Warsaw Uprising, Witold Pilecki, Norwegian heavy water sabotage and the Soviet Partisans.

And there was later quite some resistance against the Soviets as well, at least in Poland.
