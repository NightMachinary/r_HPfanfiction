The reaction to the Holocaust was (some) Jews making their own country to be safe in, the impact of holocaust literature and the promise of "never again". In the Wizarding World, the reaction to the first Death Eater war was to celebrate Harry Potter's life, buy books about him and go back to business as usual.

There was no awareness shown by any Muggleborn or Halfblood characters that they should flee or fight back, except those influenced by Dumbledore. That's what gets me. Not even a scene of Muggleborn fleeing the country, they either fight at the final battle, or die in the buildup.

As someone who is a racial minority, you can bet your bottom dollar I'd be extremely attuned to issues like racial attacks in the country I am living in. I don't feel this from the Muggleborn characters in the books and it bugs me. Hermione is particularly egregious in the 6th book. She knows that Voldemort is out there, she knows that Pureblood bigots are gaining power and influence. And she runs off and plays hero with her Pureblood/Halfblood BFFs rather than possibly trying to foment some sort of Muggleborn flight or resistance movement. From the founder of SPEW, this was disappointing.
