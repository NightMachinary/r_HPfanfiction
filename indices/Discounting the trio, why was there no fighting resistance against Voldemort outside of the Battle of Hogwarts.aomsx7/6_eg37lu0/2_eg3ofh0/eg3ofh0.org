  Reichsprognomnacht

The state of things in the 7th book is already far worse than 38. Azkaban was a concentration camp and you had death squads roaming the land.

  By then, leaving the country was hard, and it was overall a shitty situation.
#+end_quote

Not an issue for Muggleborn. I doubt that Death Eaters could navigate Heathrow and given how apparation works in the books, if you can travel London - Hogsmeade, you can also reach Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt and even Bordeaux from Kent.

  Organization was difficult
#+end_quote

Again, given the utter incompetence of the Ministry when it comes to all things Muggle, you could probably run adverts on BBC 1 and no one in Voldemort's camp would notice. Phones are a thing, as is the Royal Mail, Messanger Patroni (although kinda difficult) and simply talking to firends. I mean, the Warsaw Uprising was done without foreign help or magic, and while admittadly futile, it was better than just bending over.

  Open defiance might have made things even worse, not only for you, but also for friends and family.
#+end_quote

Kinda difficult to get worse than "being round up and deported to the worst place on earth with soul sucking demons as guards" and "hunted by Death Squads"

#+begin_quote
  With that in mind, you are not the first one to ask this question: "Why didn't Jews resist more during the 2nd world war?"
#+end_quote

That is not the question I asked. I asked why there was no resitstance or otherwise defiance from the Muggleborn, citing various restance groups in Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands and France as well as overall partisan warfare on the Eastern Front as comparison (and there was even more).
