  That is not the question I asked.
#+end_quote

If you can't do a mental transfer this simple, how are you even trying to interpret a book?

#+begin_quote
  if you can travel London - Hogsmeade, you can also reach Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt and even Bordeaux from Kent.
#+end_quote

Sure, but Hagrid took months travelling to stay undetected and because magical travel was monitored, and that was in book five. Also, what gives you the idea that Wizards in general have normal passports? They aren't normal British citizens, from what we can tell. Sure, some probably had some(?), but at the Ministry (and at Gringotts!) you're asked for your wand as identification.

But sure, a few or even more could have fled, but it's not as trivial as you make it seem.

#+begin_quote
  Phones are a thing, as is the Royal Mail, Messanger Patroni (although kinda difficult) and simply talking to firends.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but the constant threat of:

- What if I'm listened to?
- What if my friends are listened to?
- What if the wizards can intercept royal mail? (Hint: They can, they managed to get Petunia's letter to Hogwarts)

I mean, if you contact anyone who isn't "arrest on sight" (all muggleborns), you could contact some friendlies like the Weasleys:

But in DH13, we get a look athis file:

#+begin_quote
  ARTHUR WEASLEY

  BLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of the Order of the Phoenix.

  FAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have confirmed.

  SECURITY STATUS: TRACKED. All movements are being monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously)
#+end_quote

So, if you contact Arthur, he either has to report you, and you're fucked, or he doesn't report you, and you're both fucked. Fun, isn't it? Oh, and the Ministry could /easily/ regularly send someone pretending to be a muggleborn, and if you don't report the plants, you're a traitor. Nice, isn't it?

And again, if you tell someone how / where to find you, and they are compromised, you are now dead.

Fear culture is pretty real, man.

#+begin_quote
  Kinda difficult to get worse than "being round up and deported to the worst place on earth with soul sucking demons as guards" and "hunted by Death Squads"
#+end_quote

Sure, it's difficult to get worse than that. But let's look at one example:

#+begin_quote
  “A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,” Umbridge was saying. “Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that description?”

  [...]

  Umbridge ignored her.

  “Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?”
#+end_quote

If Mrs. Cattermole had put up any resistance, what do you think would have happened to her children? Her children, that were trapped at Hogwarts.

They were children of a muggleborn, but they are halfbloods. Not desirable, but they didn't "steal" the magic, so no need to send them to Azkaban.

And in danger of repeating myeslf: We have an INCREDIBLY limited viewpoint. We do not /know/ what forms of resistance there are, and what they are doing.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  “You didn't hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn't have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.”
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  “These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione. “The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape hated it.”

  [...]

  “Yeah, well, I couldn't ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That's when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.”

  [...]

  “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo's and Gran's on the run. She sent me a letter,” he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that I'm my parents' son, and to keep it up.”
#+end_quote

Harry had not heard of all this resistance until the Battle of Hogwards, until it basically was over. And until the end of the book, he didn't really talk to others about what they did.

To say that nobody resisted, is pretty presumptuous, and that is beside the reasons for not resisting I gave.
