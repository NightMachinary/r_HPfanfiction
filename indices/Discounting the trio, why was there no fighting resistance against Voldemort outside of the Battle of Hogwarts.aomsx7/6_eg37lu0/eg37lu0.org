First, we need to recognize that the Death Eaters are prototype Nazis, and the Muggleborns in this instance do have the same roles as Jews in World War II.

With that in mind, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a4ogc0/why_didnt_the_jews_fight_back_more_during_wwii/][you]] are not [[https://www.ushmm.org/educators/teaching-about-the-holocaust/common-questions#answer%203][the first one]] to ask [[http://www.aish.com/ho/i/48945626.html][this question]]: "Why didn't Jews resist more during the 2nd world war?"

This answer to this is not trivial, I'm not entirely qualified to give it, but I'll have a quick go:

- They did indeed fight back, although mostly on smaller scales and from the underground
- One time they did fight early on, a jew shooting a single officer of the German embassy in France started the "Reichsprognomnacht" ("Night of broken glass"), which destroyed many jew's livelihood, burned down their houses, and is - to the best of my knowledge - regarded as one of the worst nights in (German-)Jewish history.
- The Jews didn't really know what happened until it was too late. By then, leaving the country was hard, and it was overall a shitty situation.
- You can't really fight a well-armed army that has the support of the general population. Fucking Russia had trouble with the Nazis, what could unorganized and untrained civilians do?
- There was also the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising][Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], where in a riot the captured Jews (and other prisoners) rose up. The held control of the ghetto for a while, but in the end it didn't matter.

  13,000 Jews were killed in the ghetto during the uprising (some 6,000 among them were burnt alive or died from smoke inhalation)

The three articles I linked have better answers, if you are interested in this topic, I do recommend reading them and more.

Anyway, A lot of those reasons do also apply to the same discussion with muggelborns.

- Voldemort is even scarier as Hitler, as he can't even be killed
- There was an underground resistance, and probably more than one
- Open defiance might have made things even worse, not only for you, but also for friends and family.
- Resistance doesn't matter, you'll die anyway, and if you resist, it's probably gonna be worse.
- Organization was difficult (Taboo, Caterwauling charm, ...)
- Nobody can trust nobody

Lastly,

- We don't know exactly what actions had been taken, we are limited to the small viewpoint of Harry Potter.
- In a magical world, if you get captured, your resistance is toast. Veritaserum, Legillimency, ... will make it hard to resist. It's even better than torture.

It's really not an easy topic.
