I don't see the average Muggleborn as having an emotional investment in Wizarding Britain. Not to the point where they'd risk their lives for its sake.

Sure, you have some Muggleborns like Hermione, who was basically fostered into the Weasley family from the start, and stayed with them every summer instead of going home to her parents. Or you have adult Muggleborns like Mr. Tonks who have integrated into the community and married longstanding members, like Andromeda Black. But the average Muggleborn would have maintained Muggle links and family, on top of their Muggle identity documents and licenses, so it wouldn't be hard for them to move back into the Muggle world for the duration of the War and keep to themselves until it ended.

Just as Death Eaters wouldn't have stalked the supermarket checkout lines across England, waiting for Harry and Hermione to stock up on groceries, Umbridge's crew wouldn't have gone through Muggle tax records to find one random temp worker at a Sussex call centre.
