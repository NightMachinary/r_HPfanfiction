It is straight up impossible given that supermarkets outnumber the magical population of Britain anywhere between 2.5:1 to 40:1. And that is not even accounting for the need for shift rotations and the fact that you have a genocide to run and not everyone would be working for Voldemort.

You could, however, write about a bunch of Death Eaters waiting in front of a Tesco and get frustrated that Harry never shows up because they are unaware of other stores, although that one would just be Death Eater bashing (not that there is anything wrong with that).
