But there would be many whose family would be at risk. Half-Bloods, whose mothers are suddenly being rounded up. Or Spouses. You obviously wouldn't fight if you could bail, but given how effective the Ministry was at persecuting people, you'd think that there would be more vigilantes and partisans around whose motivation is revenge for lost family. More people like Ted Tonks who had built a life to fight for.

I mean, he was pretty stupid about his escape, I'll freely give you that, but shouldn't there be more people in his position, some of whom would have fought. Hell, most of the people in the fighting age probably grew up with a grandfather or even great grandfather who had fought in at least one world war or Korea. (Great) Grandmothers, who toiled in munitions factories to do their part for the war effort.
