Probably not lol, we know what, a half-dozen half-blood students besides Harry in all of Hogwarts? (not counting Rowling's revisionism) And it's not like there weren't nearly two years of forewarning on the whole "genocidal-warlord-back-from-the-dead" issue. Getting out of the country isn't particularly difficult in Europe when the people trying to hunt you down a, aren't a legitimate government, b, probably can't even conceive of an airport like Heathrow where whole of the magical population could decide wander on in one day without causing undue hassle, and c you can teleport.

imo the only ones who stuck around were probably too stupid to do anything meaningful, competant enough to lay low with their families or too young to know any better which precludes the whole fight the power thing. And that's assuming we buy into the whole "they're totally gonna kill all the half and mudbloods guys, now don't question why none of the plebs are in our secret club or why our most knowlegable member on the the muggle problem doesn't even know what electricity is" thing.
