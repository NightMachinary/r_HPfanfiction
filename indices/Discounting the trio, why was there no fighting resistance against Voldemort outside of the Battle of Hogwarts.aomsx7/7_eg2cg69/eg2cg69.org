Well, first, you have to consider that the Death Eaters took over the magical government, and all its resources, in one night, killing the former Minister of Magic and replacing him with a new one immediately. Now it's theirs to control.

They thus controlled everything from the Aurors, to the news/propaganda, to the Department of Magical Transportation (which monitored everything from Floo Network to Apparation) and had access to records for every witch and wizard in Magical Britain.

During the confusion, and before any of the news broke out, they most likely targeted as many potential threats as they could, bringing in, or killing as many as possible. It was obvious what was happening to those associated with the order, but the Death Eaters had otherwise tried to keep their transition into power as quiet as possible. Rumors of the Ministry falling may have spread, with some people believing it, yet others not wanting to believe it. It happened before when Voldemort first came back, and it's easy to see that it would happen again. By the time people realized what was happening, the muggleborns were already being rounded up.

They also had a Taboo on the name Voldemort, which is huge, because A: it targets anyone who's not afraid of Voldemort, and B: adds another layer of fear and oppression and wariness.

There's also the problem of organizing a resistance. As far as we know, there's only one group who even offered passive resistance against Voldemort: The Order of the Phoenix, and they couldn't exactly recruit too much, as you couldn't trust anyone. They could be spies or under the Imperius or susceptible to the Imperius. They could be subjected to Legilimency and not be a sufficiently trained Occlumens to keep information hidden.

As for resistance from the current roster of the order, as far as I can remember, at that point in the series, the Order has exactly 2 active or former Aurors in their group, and one of them is pregnant and already going into hiding because of their muggleborn father, blood traitor mother, and half-breed husband. That just leaves Kingsley as the only true fighter left in the Order.

If Kingsley tried to take action, and got caught, then there is no one in the department who could gain information on what's going on there.

Same reason why many of rest of the Order in the Ministry. There was no way they could actively fight the entire might of the MoM, and Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

Most of the Order's actions were probably to smuggle out as many Muggleborns as possible with the least amount of risk, and gathering information to inform the people for the radio show.

Lastly, there's one huge reason why they couldn't offer any significant resistance: Hogwarts.

Attendance became compulsory, which meant students were essentially hostages for their parents' good behavior. We saw it in action with Xenophilius Lovegood. He was resisting by printing the true stories, but the MoM and the Death Eaters took Luna and held her hostage. It's easy to assume this wasn't the first or last time they would use the kids as hostages or the threat of taking them hostage.

And if that family were to disappear? Well, time to "interrogate" all their known friends and extended family members and everyone they've regularly met with over the past 6 months.

The fact is that Voldemort acted quickly and quietly, and had a pretty smart plan overall to control the populace. He didn't know love, but he knew fear.
