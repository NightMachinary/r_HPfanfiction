  To make JKR's scenario plausible, the Death Eaters would have needed to infiltrate most of the major department beforehand. This would probably require at least decade of preparation.

...That's actually exactly how it happened. Every head of department was either sympathetic to their cause or under the Imperious Curse by the time they went after the Minister.

They go over this in literally the first chapter of the 7th book.

As for how they even prepared all of this, the Death Eaters had become entrenched inside the Ministry over the years due to their own ambition and self-serving goals. They didn't need years to plan, because they already were making plans to gain more power and status all on their own.

Even after the Department of Mysteries incident, there were still Death Eaters and Death Eater contacts still working from the inside.

And so, with Dumbledore dead, and the Imperious Curse a thing, It was relatively simple for Voldemort to take over an incompetent Ministry, weakened and softened up by years of political corruption. All he needed to do was bribe, threaten, and curse the right people at the right time.
