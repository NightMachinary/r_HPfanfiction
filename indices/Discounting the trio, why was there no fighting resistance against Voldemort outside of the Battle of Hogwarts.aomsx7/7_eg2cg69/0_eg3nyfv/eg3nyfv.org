  Well, first, you have to consider that the Death Eaters took over the magical government, and all its resources, in one night, killing the former Minister of Magic and replacing him with a new one immediately. Now it's theirs to control.

This makes me laugh. There's a thing called "bureaucratic inertia," which basically means that it's impossible to redirect a government quickly. Probably the least useful thing you can do is take over the leader. Leaders come and go with the political breeze, but bureaucrats frequently stay in the system for decades. That's basically the point behind the old British sitcom, "Yes, Minister".

You want to see resistance? Take over a large ministry and tell them that you are completely changing policy. At least a quarter of you workforce will leave; most of these will be near retirement age and unwilling to learn new skills. Maybe another quarter will nod and smile but refuse to adjust. Another quarter will actively oppose you. And maybe a quarter will be go along, but be hemmed in by all the other workers.

To make JKR's scenario plausible, the Death Eaters would have needed to infiltrate most of the major department beforehand. This would probably require at least decade of preparation. Nothing about the way she depicts them makes it seem like they're capable of such long range planning.
