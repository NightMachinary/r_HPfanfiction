Honestly, how many of them were left to resist? If the first war was as devastating as it's been portrayed, then I'd expect a lot of resisters would have died then. The second war would have started like 15 years later? That's less than a generation - without significant immigration the population of adults wouldn't have recovered yet.

Additionally, it's also likely that we just don't see it because Harry doesn't.
