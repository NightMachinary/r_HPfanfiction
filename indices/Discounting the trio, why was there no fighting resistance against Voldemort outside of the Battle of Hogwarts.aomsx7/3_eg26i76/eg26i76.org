"Surprising lack of resistance" is a phrase that reminds me of comments Primo Levi made in one of his books about being a concentration camp inmate, to the effect that nobody in those camps was from a culture that was predisposed to resistance, that there was a cultural assumption that you submitted to Authority or were at least helpless before it.

Wizarding Britain, with its narrative that the problem gets solved by the Mighty Hero taking down the Evil Villain in Heroic Single Combat (See: Gellert Grindlewald, defeat of), could well have that problem. And while they wait for the Prophesied Hero, they put up with the boot on their necks.

There probably was some resistance, but it was small, scattered, and ineffective, lacking outside assistance in the form of the Wizarding SOE or similar. Insurgent movements generally don't do so well if they're purely homegrown: I can think of /maybe/ one that succeeded without overseas aid, .
