There didn't seem to be any in the Order either. My headcanon is that they left the country because Hogwarts was a shithole where the whole blood purity thing is tacitly encouraged. Why the fuck you bother coming to save some backwards may as well be foreign country when you can make a real nice living in the muggle world using magic on the side.
