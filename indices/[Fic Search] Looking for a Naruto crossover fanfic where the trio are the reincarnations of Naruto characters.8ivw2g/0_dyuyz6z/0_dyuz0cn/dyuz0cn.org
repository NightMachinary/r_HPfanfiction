  Harry Potter knew he was different long before he knew he was a wizard.The fear ebbed away and was replaced by something else as he took in the sight of the setting sun on the far-off horizon, warm-hued colors painting the buildings until they resembled a different city, the village of his dreams. Being up high was of no concern just then, as the wind picked up and it felt like coming home.Or: “Do you think I'd look good with pink hair?” Dudley pauses, thinks on it. “Like your friend Sakura?” “Exactly like my friend Sakura.”
