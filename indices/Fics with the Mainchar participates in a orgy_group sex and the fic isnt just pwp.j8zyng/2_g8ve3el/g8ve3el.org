The Triplicity series from idleside on AO3 is really good. It's about a threesome relationship between Harry, Pansy, and Daphne and before you stop reading this post altogether, you should give it a shot. It's an AU post-Hogwarts but has an actual overarching plot going on. It's also not fluff and brings up some serious issues between a threesome relationship actually working out. It doesn't just become a perfect romance and all the characters are well-written with actual strength, fears, and development. So it's pretty engaging.
