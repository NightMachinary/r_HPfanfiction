This is a terrible title for this type of thread. It looks like a discussion thread.

I don't know that specific one you're talking about but you might be interested in a similar concept. Linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) has a discussion about Crucio originally being used as a medical spell. It has a a touch of Harry/Daphne as well (Or at least a good leadin). This is a reasonably common trope.
