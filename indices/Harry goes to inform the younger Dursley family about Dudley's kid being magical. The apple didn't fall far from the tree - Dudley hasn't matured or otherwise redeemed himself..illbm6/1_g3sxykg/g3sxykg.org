Unfortunately, no such fics to my knowledge.

But it Dudley goes on mistreating his child, I can see Harry proposing legislation that will:

- Take away Muggleborn and Half-Blood children from abusive Muggle households and place them in Wizarding foster families
- Wipe their existence from their Muggle relatives
- Coordinate with Child Protective Service

Harry will not tolerate another Tom Riddle and a repeat of his own experience.
