Recently I was thinking something similar about time travelling back just a 100 years - in the 'redo, back in your own younger body' scenario.

Imagining a 120yr old re-living their life as an 11 year old (or younger) is kinda creepy and it seems like a very challenging approach from a writing perspective. I do still read the stories, cause I love the'time travel/redo' trope, but I do tend to ignore all references to the characters previous age.

Personally I think the ideal age bracket to stage a time travel event is the 17 to 25 range, when rational thinking is still finishing up (in a brain developmental context) so teenage recklessness still feels realistic.

Also from my own personal perspective, daydreams about redoing my teenagers years changed from guilty pleasure to horror around my late 20's lol. I can honestly say now, in my early 30's, that I couldn't think of anything worse than being a kid or teenager again.

Of course no judgement for whatever a writer chooses, different ages and time periods bring different elements to the plot.
