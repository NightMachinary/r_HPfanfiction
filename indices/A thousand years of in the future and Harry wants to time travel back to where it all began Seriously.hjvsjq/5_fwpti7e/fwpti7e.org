I'd be interested in reading more thousand-years-old-Harry-travels-back fics, actually. But only if they were done properly. Like, imagine a thousand years of experience, compared to the ten to twenty that his 'present day' friends would have. The immense personality gulf between him and them would be really hard to cross, and reading a properly-done fic (other than A Long Journey Home for the twenty-third time) where Harry has to deal with that would be really interesting.
