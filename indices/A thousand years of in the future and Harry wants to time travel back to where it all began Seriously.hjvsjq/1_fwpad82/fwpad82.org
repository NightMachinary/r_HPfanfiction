I think the problem is that in many cases Harry is going back to correct things that went wrong and that filled him with regret. Since those things in canon happened when Harry was 11-17 that's the age/timeframe he has to go back to. For example, keeping Pettigrew from escaping in third year, Cedric from dying in fourth year and stopping Voldemort's resurrection, losing Sirius in 5th year, etc. And then of course, whatever twists the writer adds to the story like Hermione dying etc.

In many cases Harry yearns to go back but is unable until "x" happens. Eg he dies, finally figures out long time travel etc. The key is how miserable Harry is because he couldn't prevent something and how much he desperately wants to change it is why he's willing to jump so far back in time.
