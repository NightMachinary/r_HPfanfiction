As the Ork Boyz say "Here we go"

​

Outline: Move story timeline up to 2011 instead of 91, send batmetal back from 2014 to 2011.

​

Dudley has no oversight on his internet activities. Watching Batmetal the day after Harry gets back from the Alley. Harry sees it in the hall and watches it around the corner. He is looking around to not get caught so he doesn't see it all, just general scenes.

He remembers Batman, it's an American Comic he had not gotten to read. Dudley talked about him a whole bunch though. Batman was like Harry kinda. His parents had been killed by a bad guy when he was a kid just like Harry.

​

Batman was rich, and Harry had a ton of gold in his vault, so maybe he was rich also? Batman learned to fight and beat up bad guys.

​

He sure was beating people up a lot in that video, and he had some people with him playing that angry music.

​

That was right! Batman had a bunch of orphan kids also! They all were badass fighters as well and could play instruments it seemed.

​

Goes to sleep thinking about hitting a bad guy in the face with a guitar while screaming about being dangerous. He saw Batmetal Batman and the boys playing metal music as he swung the guitar.

​

Que Accidental Magic Bullshit!

​

Suddenly Batmetal Transmigration!

​

Seems like it would work, be a total crack fic, but man it would be fun.

​

​

EDIT: Forgot to add how music would work.

​

Rule of Cool universe! The more you think something will work and that it is cool the better it will work. Basically Warhammer 40k Ork logic.

​

Harry's magic and desire manifest as a soundtrack that plays around him. It is Batmetal Batman, so Batman is a rich brute instead of genius. However, the rule of cool powers through his obstacles. The robins are smarter though still use the rule of cool extensively.

​

They regularly play music together to bond and just hang out. Once Harry shows up he loves the music and it begins manifesting around him. It kicks the rule of cool up even further. So the Batclan start pushing the Metal Magic further and further.
