  Tom is three years old when Mary, his twin sister, is taken from him. After eight solitary years at Wool's Orphanage, he learns that he shall see her again at Hogwarts, a school of magic. Will their reunion be a peaceful one, or will they travail through seven years of waxes and wanes, through which their world becomes increasingly torn by war and desire?
