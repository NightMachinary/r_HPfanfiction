I mean, this is self promo, but both of these have received great feedback overall and I am super excited to unveil future plots and such. The first is a Gryffindor Harry fic that will not be a canon rehash but will still cover all 7 years. He enters the magical world in a completely different manner than canon, is actually driven and will be powerful, but will actually have to progress instead of instantly being Dumbledore/Voldemort level. Currently about to enter year 2, but will update every Sunday until at least the end of 2nd year.

The second was started a couple of weeks ago and it is a bit heavier on the AU side. It is a Slytherin Harry fic that will also cover all 7 years. There may be a bit of bashing in this one, but it will be very light compared to most others of its kind. It updates every Saturday and I don't really want to say a whole lot due to spoilers and such. Fair warning, it is WBWL and contains a Female Voldemort, so if that's a turn off, fair enough.
