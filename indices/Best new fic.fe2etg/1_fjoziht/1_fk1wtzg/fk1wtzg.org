"That was the first sound that could be heard by a small, raven haired ten year old boy who sharply awoke from his uneasy slumber, groggily throwing the thin, beat up sheet he used to sleep with off to the side as he clumsily fumbled for his glasses with one hand, while the other tried in vain to remove the sleep from his eyes."
