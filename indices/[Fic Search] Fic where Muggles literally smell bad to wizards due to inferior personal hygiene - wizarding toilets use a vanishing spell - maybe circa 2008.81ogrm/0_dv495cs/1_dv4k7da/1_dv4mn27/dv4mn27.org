The internet and other communication technologies are often simply a medium to indirectly experience things without being physically present.

Social networks allow friends to keep in touch without having to meet in person.

Phones/video chat allow people to talk and see each other without having to meet in person.

People consume sports media in place of attending sports games in person.

People consume travel media in place of travelling themselves.

People look at cute pictures of animals in place of having animals themselves.

Etc.

Most of these are for two reasons: it's inconvenient to travel, in terms of time and effort, and it's financially costly.

A world with instantaneous transportation rather removes the need for indirect access to experiences in many cases, because you can directly experience things with minimal effort. I imagine most wizards would regard internet-dwellers with pity, forced to live vicariously through the experiences of others rather than living for themselves.

The one area where the internet has the edge on magic is accessibility and search-ability of information i.e. research tasks.
