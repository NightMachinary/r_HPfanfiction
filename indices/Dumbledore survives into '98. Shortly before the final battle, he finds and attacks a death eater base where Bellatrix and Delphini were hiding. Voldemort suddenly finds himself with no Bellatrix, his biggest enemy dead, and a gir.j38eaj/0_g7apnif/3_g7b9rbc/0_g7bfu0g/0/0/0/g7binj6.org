I imagine he searched all over the castle for an entrance.

But I strongly would belive while tom riddle might have had sexual urges he would have considered them a weakness. and on his path to full voldemort would have tried to remove it so he was not like everyone else.

My view point is voldemort, if he had a sex drive would consider sex beneath him and something lesser beings do, he has no need to procreate for he is eternal and who could be worthy of him.\\
but he could have also removed his sex drive on his path to perfection
