Joining a fanfiction writing group, where your peers can offer advice and constructive criticism, can be very helpful. Just remember that giving advice is the best way to get advice in return.

With your particular idea, I suggest starting out small, writing a few "one shots," to get a sense of how your characters work together and to hone your storytelling mechanics. Once you have these down, then dig into the larger story. Even seemingly little things, like building an ear for realistic dialogue or the appropriate levels of description, don't just happen--you have to work at them. Also, even though it's fanfiction, it's best to plan out your story with proper attention paid to things like overarching conflict(s), character growth, tone, pacing, narrative voice, etc. What do your characters want? What do they need? What are they willing to do to get it? Get as crisp an idea in your head of the story you wish to tell, then go tell it.

And this is really important: when you do begin writing, write every day, 500 words, before doing anything else. Worry about quality later. Go for quantity at first (which has a quality all its own). Do that and you'll not only build good writing habits, but also you'll have a novel-length story (60k words) completed in four months' time.
