linkffn(that which holds the image) was creepy! Has Harry facing creepiness but he isn't actually creepy. This spooked me.. its a doctor who crossover but you don't need to know doctor who to read this. I actually read the fic then became interested in the episode of the TV show.

linkffn(evil be thou my good) has a kinda spooky Harry. It's a hellraiser crossover but you don't need to know hellraiser.

linkffn(the strange disappearance of sallyanne perks) has kind of spooky vibes as the trio solve a mystery, but it doesn't have a spooky Harry.
