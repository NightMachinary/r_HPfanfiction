True, but generally I think people refer to katanas as the larger of the two blades worn in a traditional daisho, which I believe (according to my also admittedly imperfect memory) was often used as a last resort in armoured battle, as samurai defaulted to using spears or longbows, and the "classic" katana was primarily used in ceremonial duels (which were usually decided in a few cuts, rather than a long choreographed sequence of swings and thrusts). The horse cutter sword/zanbato is closer in function to the Scottish Claymore or German Zweihander, and be more useful in widespread battle than a one-on-one duel, which is what most katana-cultists use to masturbate over how superior the Japanese blade is to European ones.
