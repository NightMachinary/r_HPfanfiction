  And not just any sword - a katana. /Of course/.

All hail /glorious Nippon steel/! I feel like the effectiveness of katanas have been severely overestimated by Japanese folklore, samurai movies, and (primarily) anime-obsessed weeaboos, especially since IIRC the katana was considered a fairly unwieldy weapon whose major strength was the draw-and-cut method of attacking while unsheathing the blade, rather than its use in protracted duels.
