I was just being facetious. I did enjoy the story, but I found the Hermione wank to be a little too much. Spoilering this just in case:

[[/spoiler][Hermione spends a few days writing down her speculation on Horcruxes, and Harry then uses her notes to successfully hunt them for years after they separate. This puts her above Dumbledore in terms of intelligence, but lots of H/Hr fics make her into a genius so it's not that surprising.]]

[[/spoiler][However, this fic also turns her into an inhumanly sexy woman with perfect fashion sense (inherent to vampires, apparently). Not only she has superhuman strength and reflexes, she also becomes an expert at hand-to-hand combat (so not just power, but actual /skill/) and teaches Harry at some point. She fights using those as well as dual enchanted pistols and a sword. And not just any sword - a katana. /Of course/.]]

[[/spoiler][Not to mention, she has two older vampire boytoys... Er, "Shadow Kin", following her around as their "Alpha" because she's just so amazing.]]

Really, the author deserves credit for making this bearable by giving Harry some unique magical powers of his own.
