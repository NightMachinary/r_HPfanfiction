The Harry-Hermione-Viktor subplot is atrocious. Hermione leaves Harry after one month into their relationship because he's a human, then shacks up with Viktor (also a human) for six months because reasons. After only a brief mention of the insane cognitive dissonance, Harry welcomes her back with open +trousers+ arms.

Waving a wand over the really awful characterizations and saying, "Vampire problem," is a pretty thin cover. Hermione saying that she liked Krum because 'he was easy and never expected anything from her,' relegates her to either damsel-in-distress or fuck-toy. Soooooo boring.
