Well that just doesn't do the story justice, does it? :p Basically, Hermione being a vampire causes all kinds of problems in their relationship. It doesn't help that Voldemort's meddling in things and the vampires have an internal conflict as well. Interesting story, has it's flaws, but especially towards the end I thought it was really good.

One downside for me is that I don't like reading from portkey.
