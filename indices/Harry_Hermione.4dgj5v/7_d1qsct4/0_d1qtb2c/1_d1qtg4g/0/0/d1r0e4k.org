You're right, the author summary is utter crap (probably trying too hard to avoid spoilers).

It's been a while since I've read it but I'll give it a try:

The story features pretty extensive vampire lore, but more along the lines of badass vampires (think Buffy; not the glittery Twilight kind).

Hermione is turned into a vampire very early on. Her attempt to (naively) maintain her relationship to Harry and remain in the human world fails spectacularly and she disappears. After years of fighting Voldemort and searching for Hermione on his own time, Harry is in for a surprise when their paths cross again.
