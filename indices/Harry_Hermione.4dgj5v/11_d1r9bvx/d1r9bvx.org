Notebooks and Letters linkffn(3867175) is quite good. It's post-GoF and as the name suggests, the story is told mostly from Hermione's journal and letters. It's competently written and believable from the standpoint of canon, though it takes a weirs turn towards the end that I don't like very much.

Unlike a Sister is one of the best romance stories I've seen in this fandom, however, it's a whole different level. It's rare that you see someone who can write with some actual skill and emotion, instead of simply passable prose that gets recognition for avoiding basic grammar and verb mistakes. The chapter where they watch La Traviata is beautiful and touching, and the story really drives home Harry's obsession and its immoral consequences for their families and marriages. I couldn't decide whether I wanted there to be an affair. Unfortunately, it may as well be abandoned, but what's there is worth reading.

Aside from these and VC, I haven't read any other fic that I'd recommend. It's honestly cringeworthy to see thrash like Forever Knight mentioned in the same breath as decent stories. Fanon has a big boner for turning Hermione into an infallible goddess and Harry as her subservient simpleton.
