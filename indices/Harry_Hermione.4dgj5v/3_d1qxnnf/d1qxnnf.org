Depends what you're looking for in a Harmony fic, I ship H/hr but i don't particularly like Vox Corpis' style of a slow burn romance. However i'll recommend some of the ones i /really/ liked.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1][Forever Knight]] is a superb and fantastic story that features excellent characterization and story telling. this story by far is my favorite in terms of romance when it comes to H/hr. Also there's no Ron Bashing where a good major of H/hr stories suffer from and to be honest i really liked Ron in this story. Warning however is that there's a bit of smut and could get quite angsty(not necessarily a bad thing if you ask me).

*Unlike a Sister* linkffn(6574535) is a canon compliant post-epilogue story. It features Harry and Hermoine as Adults and pretty much how they live their lives. now while this is a "fidelity-fic" and i find a story a bit boring, its well written and gives us a different yet interesting perspective into Harry and Hermoine's relationship as a whole. Too bad it hasn't been updated in over a year just when the really good parts start to happen.

*Fulfilling Obligations* linkffn(4418163) is similar to the previously stated story with the exception of plot structure(The story progress in specific time periods after DH and all the way until the characters' adult life) and adds a bit of twist in the whole relationship canon. Where Unlike a Sister is more into the development, realism and contrast of the pairing, Fulfilling Obligations serves more like a "What-If"/"Could have been" type Story that is overall fairly well written and at times emotionally draining.

*What We're Fighting For* linkffn(9766604) is by far one of my favorites fanfictions out there. Yes it's cliche and the writing could use a bit of work but damn this fic has a special place in my heart. it's an AU where harry has been kept living in secrecy and training to become the ultimate +badass+ soldier.

*Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor* linkffn(2841153) /warning: if sensitive to graphic subject matter, do not read this story/ if that's not the case however and you're looking for a fun and easy going read then look no further. this fic shouldn't be taken as seriously though as there's barely any romance development in this story, but the relationship doesn't feel as unrealistic, forced and/or cringeworthy as other Harmony fics.
