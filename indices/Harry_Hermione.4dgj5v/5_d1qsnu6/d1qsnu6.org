My favorite H/Hr stories, none of them containing Weasley bashing:

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): the real war began after Voldemort's fall.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059): even though not very popular, I like this fic a lot.

*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925): technically not a H/Hr story, but I really want them to get together.

*The Power of Love*, linkffn(11251745): fem!Harry/Hermione, dark, violent, and very well written.

*Call Me Moriarty*, linkffn(11602420): another brilliant dark fem!Harry/Hermione.

Finally, *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is a superb story that's going to be finished in 10 days. After the Voldemort's fall, British wizarding world still sucked. Harry had enough, assumed the mantle of a Dark Lord to finish off remaining Death Eaters and pureblood extremists. Implied Harry/Hermione/Ron threesomes, no explicit scenes so far.
