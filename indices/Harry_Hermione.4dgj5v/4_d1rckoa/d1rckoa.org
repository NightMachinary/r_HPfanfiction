Well, personally I really love The Draco Trilogy. It has a really good Harry/Draco bromance, as well as Harry/Hermione ship. There's a lot of humor and homage to tv-shows (like Buffy, Blackadder) and other fantasy books.

It starts with Harry and Draco changing into each other via polyjuice in Potions, and then not changing back. Hilarity and drama ensues.

Honestly it's my favorite fanfiction ever. My friends and I reference it all the time! We even went so far as to have it printed in book form. Anyways, it's not online anymore, so I uploaded the PDFs to dropbox if anyone wants to check them out.
