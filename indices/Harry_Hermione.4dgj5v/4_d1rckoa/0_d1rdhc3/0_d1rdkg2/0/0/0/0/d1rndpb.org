Yes, I've read a bit about it. There was the scene about shape-shifters in Sinister, that was word-for-word the same as in a book. I found that to be a bit too much "borrowing" to be OK, and especially if you're going to deny it. At least be upfront about it.

On the other hand, I really like finding Buffy and Blackadder quotes in there, as I am a fan of both shows. The PDFs I linked has references at the end of each chapter.

And in the end, I thoroughly enjoy reading the Trilogy, despite the debacle surrounding it. It's only fanfiction after all.
