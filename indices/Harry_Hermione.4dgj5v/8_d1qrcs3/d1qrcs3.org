The sad thing is, there aren't any stories that I would give a five star. Vox Corporis is well-written (as far as I can remember), but the pacing is way too slow and has too much emphasis on the pairing. I would probably give linkffn(Definitions of Romance) a 4.5, rounded up to 5, but that's more to personal preference than objective writing (Also, it probably helps that it's just a short oneshot). Enembee's linkffn(By the Divining Light) has parts of H/Hr, but that's just a side thing and is hardly developed on.

The best I can give you is 5/5 fics with good H/Hr friendship, which otomh would be linkffn(What Lies Beneath; The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks; Stages of Hope)
