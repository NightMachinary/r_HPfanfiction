Thanks, I'll definitely give it a try. The Lie I'Ve Lived and What Would Slytherin Harry Do are great, A Black Comedy at times too cracky for me at times,(e.g. the Wizengamot scene). PS If you're the same person as Lane Anasazi as on ffnet I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]], great idea and somewhat unique take on the Harry-comes-back-from-the-dead-thing, hope you'll continue it.
