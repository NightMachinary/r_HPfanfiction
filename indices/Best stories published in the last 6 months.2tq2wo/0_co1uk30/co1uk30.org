Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

People fear Voldemort for his power -- a striking combination of innate genius and surgical precision. People fear Grindelwald for the men he led and the system he created. Voldemort or Grindelwald, Mr. Potter, which one are you? HP/FD AU - Inspired by Santi's BWL and Fettucini's Knowledge is Power. Durmstrang!Harry with a focus on politics and economics later on.

The Magnate was published 6 months and 4 days ago, but I figure that's close enough.
