Yeah, I'm wary of coming across like I've got a chip on my shoulder so I won't go on about it too much but all the weird gratuitous violence, racism, sexism and silly melodrama should be red flags for people that the author isn't quite right. And then you Google him and you're like "oh, wow, yeah he's a psycho implicated in an actual murder."
