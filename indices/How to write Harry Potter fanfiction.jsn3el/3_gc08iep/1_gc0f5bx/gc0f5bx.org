  I don't think you need to read the books at all. Maybe people have only seen the movies and that's it.

Hmm...I don't think I can decide between garlic and holy symbols...or maybe a pitchfork! Can't argue with the classics.

If you're making a movie, then sure, it just needs to be movie-compliant. But if you're writing a story, IMO, it's the movies that don't matter; you should be book-compliant.
