You are fine, do whatever you want. If you start reading the Rowling books and like them, then great. If you're not into them and reading them feels like work, you don't have any duty to keep going. To my tastes, the Rowling books were not very good and lots of fanfic is better, but it's completely a subjective thing. The HP universe as shown in fanfic is so much more detailed than Rowling's that it's fine if you don't read Rowling and just try to follow the general characterizations etc. that you see in other HP fic.

Are there any particular HP fics that you liked?

I guess reading the first 3 Rowling books could help you get settled in. They introduce the main characters and devices. They get worse after that as Rowling stopped allowing badly needed edits.
