One fic I particularly liked (a character analysis fic and one of the first I read for HP) is called “The Fine Art of Poisoning” by Silver Sailor Ganymede on FF.net. Blaise is one of my favorite characters and it really introduced me to the world and especially the Voldemort and war conflict. I'll probably read the books gradually along with fanfiction (which I've been binging).
