Ahem.

I've been reading HP fanics for a couple years (I think) and I have yet to read more than the 1st book--and that was when it first came out. My husband got me hooked by reading parts of a particularly amusing fic to me and I finally demanded he send me the link and stop interrupting me! And here we are; I'm plotting my own story (based on the books, not so much the movies).

I've watched bits and pieces of the movies. But mostly I look for text online, read the various wikis and the HP Lexicon. Pottermore used to be helpful (especially with all the articles written by Rowling herself), but since it became the Wizarding World website, I can't find anything on it! My husband is also pretty helpful that way as well.

Personally, I'd say go ahead. But do your research. Start reading the books for the fuller experience. Maybe check out other fics involving those characters but don't feel bound to those. But there are timelines and an awful lot of the books is available for free online if you look for them. (I spent the better part of a week looking for direct quotes about Death Eater masks; the white/silver mask is a movie invention, it seems.) And you know about the wikis. Look up the Harry Potter Lexicon if you haven't. And run it past a fan who knows the books if you know someone.
