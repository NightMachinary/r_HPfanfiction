I honestly think that the fanfic lore has become enough of its own beast that you don't necessarily have to have read them. I haven't gone back to read them for about a decade, tbh.

Especially when it comes to the minor characters. The fact is that Rowling didn't really have very in-depth characterisation of most of the minor characters, so a lot of what we now â€˜know' about a lot of them comes front he fandom taking what Rowling wrote and coming to their own conclusions. Which means that while anyone reading might have their own picture of that character, you're able to bring your own take and you can't exactly be wrong.

Maybe reading some character sketches by people like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3224972/HecateA][Hecate A]] who is particularly prolific (like actually breathtakingly prolific) with slice of life and character sketches will help you get a feel for the world and characters, but writing your own will also help

In the end though I think just starting to write is the best thing. If you can find a beta who is knowledgeable and can discuss characterisation with you, that might give you a bit more confidence? But most of us are just at the level that we're at, and that's ok. Fandoms thrive when there is fresh blood lmao
