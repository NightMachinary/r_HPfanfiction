For what its worth, JK Rowling gives minor characters next to no characterization at all. So besides knowing their names, and maybe a little bit of information about them, they are essentially going to be original characters anyway. Its funny, whilst I think this is kind of shit writing, its one of the main reasons why I like Harry Potter fanfics so much. Using Daphne Greengrass as an example, due to us not knowing anything about her besides her name, different authors take different approaches to writing her, and I find it fascinating to see what people come up with.
