Hmm...I think these POVs would be interesting to read (and mostly unwritten)

Philsopher's Stone: Dumbledore. How aware was he of Quirrel's actions throughout the year?

Chamber of Secrets: Other than Ginny-maybe Dumbledore again?

Prisoner of Azkaban: Sirius would be fascinating or as you say Lupin or Hermione.

Goblet of Fire: Cedric would be interesting and tragic.

Order of the Phoenix: Luna or maybe even Cho (whom I sympathise with).

Half Blood Prince: Lupin, I'm surprised there hasn't (as far as I know) been anything written on his time with the werewolves.

Deathly Hallows: Percy, Arthur or Kingsley to either get a look at the Ministery ongoings of the Order.
