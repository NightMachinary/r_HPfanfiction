There is actually a GREAT WIP time-travel fic with Lupins POV during HBP called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/1/Chemistry-Timing][Chemistry and Timing]]. One of the best time travel fics I've read and I've read a LOT.

For Sirius and Remus's POV during POA, check out [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/940338][Padfoots Tale]] and the companion [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/946711][Moony's Tale]]. They are 100% canon compliant but do take the view that Remus and Sirius were a couple before Sirius went to Azkaban.
