  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  Neville could never have guessed what his 7th year at school would be like this. With Dumbledore's Army still recruiting, there's no telling how bad the war being waged at in school might get. But it doesn't matter to them. The DA lives!

  What do adolescent girls write about in their diaries? Stop and think about that for a moment. Now, imagine you're Tom Riddle and the only obstacle between you and world domination is an awkward eleven year old girl with a fangirl crush, a Harry Potter Doll, several older brothers, and absolutely no idea about human reproduction. You might just feel sorry for Tom Riddle if he weren't such a manipulative bastard.
