It's different from what you suggest in that it wouldn't show the whole plot, but I would totally love to see each book from the DADA professor's perspective. BC Jr's in 4th year and Snape's in 6th year would be particularly interesting. Quirrell's would be like a dark horror thing getting progressively scarier as Voldemort completely controls his life; the first book was actually very creepy at parts, like when they killed the unicorn. Umbridge's would give an inner eye into the Ministry and I feel like it could be really well done, providing the opposition's perspective to Harry. The only boring ones would be Lockhart and Carrow, mostly because they barely do anything except piss the reader off. Perhaps instead, COS could be McGonagall and DH could be Slughorn, because he was so reluctant to stay. I feel like instead of full books, these would be better as a series of short stories (maybe 5-10k words each).
