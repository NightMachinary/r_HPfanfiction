1) That's really great advice, I have separated character profiles into different folders, but I never did it with the subplots. Thank you! 2) I am a huge fan of SOIAF, so I get what you mean. I guess my skill of combining it all together is a little weak, but I'll work harder on that.

Thank you for taking the time to help me, I really really appreciate it.
