1) It sounds ambitious, but that means you'll learn a lot more in this story than in a one-shot or something much more linear. As you long as you plan and take measures not to be overwhelmed (i.e. planning out all the subplots, writing character profiles to keep everybody in check, etc.) you'll do fine. These ambitious stories are definitely the ones you should outline beforehand.

2) It sounds like a lot of subplots going on, but that doesn't mean it can't be all in one story. It just means the story will be longer to accommodate all of that. Look at Game of Thrones. Those books are thick, but that's because we multiple stories going on at the same time as the main one (becoming King/Queen). Be ready to devote a lot of time to this fanfic.

3) Up to you. I'm writing my HP crossover fully before publishing it because I want to make sure everything runs smoothly from beginning to end. I'm currently at 32K, and I already have some heavy revisions to do on the beginning chapters. Others like to have two or three chapters ready to go so their updates aren't late. Others post chapters as they finish them.

Remember that your first drafts will be shit. They won't live up to the epic story you had in mind. The description might be lacking. The dialogue will seem boring. Don't worry! That's why we go back and revise! Write that first chapter, get it out of the way, and continue on to chapter two. For now no one will see it but you.
