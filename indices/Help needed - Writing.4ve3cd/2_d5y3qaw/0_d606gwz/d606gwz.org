Oh, you mean this?

  Many people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James, and Wormtail roared with laughter. Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant *as though she was going to smile*, said, “Let him down!”

Funny how you mentioned it, because it's exactly why I've decided to start the story around Easter holidays (Easter Sunday fell on April 18th in 1976). I want to have a proper introduction to her fighting the urge to smile and him using the M-word. Whether people believe it or not, boys and girls being friends at the age of fifteen/sixteen can have some pretty nasty fights which include name-calling, especially if one one them has, well, one-sided affections. I have it all planned out, and it's neither Potter or Death Eater related.

I think that he and Sirius both hexed /specific/ people, not necessarily Slytherins. However, I highly doubt she was close to either of them to understand the reason behind hexing, let's say, Bertram Aubrey (who in my story is most definitely not in Slytherin). My point is, it wasn't random at all - they wouldn't be popular if they were /that/ mean, would they?

Oh, Hermione. No, no, I have something else in mind. Rivalry - a pureblood (OC) has to work extremely hard to keep up with a Muggle-born blessed with 'pure talent' (this is Lily yep). I like to think that Lily sometimes left her homework for the night/morning before it was due because she fancied doing (insert hobby, not Quidditch or translating Ancient Runes) that weekend, a bit like... Harry.
