This sounds like a story I'd like to read.

#+begin_quote
  5) I can't start. I can't write the first chapter.
#+end_quote

Then don't start there. Can you find a moment that seems easy to write? If so, start there and see how you do. Sure, you'll have to come back and do some edits to make sure it fits with whatever you've written before, but it's not a big issue if your first completed chapter is in the middle or near the end.

I'd also highly recommend lurking on [[/r/writing]]. Many of the regulars there have excellent ideas and love helping out.
