"Who was the floo from; Harry?" Hermione asked from where she was entertaining Teddy as he returned from the floo room.

"Ron. He said that he was in trouble and needed my help with something. He wasn't very clear though. Something about being drunk and summoning something he was not supposed to and the bathroom. He just asked me to hurry up and get my ehm to get to you two's apartment immediately. Would you mind keeping an eye on Teddy while I go check on him?" he asked her. She narrowed her eyes and after a brief pause replied. "Why don't I go check on him while you entertain Teddy. He seems to be getting bored of me and missing you."

He held back a snort. He knew all too well that Hermione was looking for an excuse to leave before she had to watch Teddy eat or worse try to feed him as Teddy always makes her do when she came to visit. She hated how messy it was. He was sure that Teddy had only a few years left before Hermione starts getting on his case about proper table manners. He was surprised she did not try to get his toddler godson to behave for all the good it would do her as it is.

"Sure." he answered and watched Hermione wave goodbye to Teddy before quickly turning her head to avoid looking at Teddy's now Brown eyes looking imploringly at her. She never could resist the doe eyes if she got caught in them. As Hermione left he briefly wondered why Ron asked him for help when he knew Hermione would be here helping him take care of Teddy when Mrs Tonks was out for the weekends but quickly put it out of his mind as he leaned down to pick Teddy up. Teddy had changed his eyes to match his own green eyes and he felt his affection for his godson grow stronger. He hopes Remus and Tonks approve of how he is raising Teddy. He had been hesitant about moving in with Mrs Tonks to help her raise Teddy but he feels he made the right decision.
