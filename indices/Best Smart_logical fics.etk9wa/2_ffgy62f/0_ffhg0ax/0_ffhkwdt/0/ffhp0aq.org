Eh, there's a better way to use a time turner. Build a (liquid) infinite-fuel rocket, put one end of a pair of vanishing cabinets on it, accelerate to 0.99999999c. Use the cabinet to teleport on the spaceship, turn back 6 hours, teleport back to Earth. You're now back quite a bit more than 6 hours. Thank Einstein for time dilation.
