#+begin_quote
  Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is already looking to be more complicated than the first. He has a place in Slytherin House, but it's by no means secure; he's still feuding with his father and his twin brother; he still has a problem with trusting authority. On top of that, there are whispers of dark things coming to Hogwarts, and as much as Harry might like to stay out of it, he probably won't be able to. Especially since he's the Slytherin Potter.
