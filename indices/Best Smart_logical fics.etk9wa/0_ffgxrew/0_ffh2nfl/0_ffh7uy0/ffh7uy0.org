No link yet. I've got a beta reader going over it before I publish chapter 1. Here's an excerpt though:

Potions with Gryffindor were no better. They were working in pairs, Draco with Crabbe, Blaise with Goyle, and Harry with a fat kid named Neville. It was hard to say who had the more useless partner. While Crabbe and Goyle seemed content to let Draco and Blaise do all the work, Neville was all too willing to try his hardest and kept screwing up the instructions.

“You know,” Neville began, “it seems rather silly to just tell us not to go in a hallway. They should know students will try and check it out.”

“Well, should they just let students stumble upon it by accident?”

“No, of course not, but there are loads of more sensible ways. They could summon a temporary stone wall, or an age barrier so no students can get through. Dumbledore could even make the whole hallway invisible and unplottable with a Fildelius charm.”

Harry stopped, dumbstruck. Once Neville said it, it seemed obvious that any of those courses of action would work perfectly. Harry stared at Neville, suddenly and unexpectedly impressed by the boy. Then Neville added lacefly wings instead of wartmoss causing their potion to congeal into a solid block in the cauldron and the effect was ruined.
