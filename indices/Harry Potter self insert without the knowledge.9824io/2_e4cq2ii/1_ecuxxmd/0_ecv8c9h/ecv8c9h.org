Then you should just go ahead and write a story full of OCs and your own interpretation of Harry Potter, any age other than Harry Potter's is too unknown to be written without making loads of assumptions about too many things.

For your advice... You are right. We should focus on the fun, but can you really have fun if you know how to kill the terrorist that every person you talk to is afraid of mentioning? Can you feel comfortable knowing that the people you know, maybe even your own family, will get hurt at the hands of a group of people following an insane near immortal whose only focus in causing pain to escape from his own misery?

And what would you do/feel if the hero, Harry, fails? If Harry dies because you didn't help but caused just enough ripples to rock the boat and cause it to sink helm first?
