  The Rule all Self Insert/Time Travelers should follow: do not attempt to arrange plots based on hindsight, the ripples in time will fracture continuity rendering your past knowledge ineffectual. You are to acquire every morsel of an advantage as you can, as quickly as possible with the power at your disposal, while exposing yourself to as little risk as possible
