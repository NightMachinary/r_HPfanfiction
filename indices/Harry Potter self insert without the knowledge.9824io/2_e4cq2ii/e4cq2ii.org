Harry Potter world is a world of secrets, puzzles, and mystery. If you are going there with all the knowledge in your head then you are just ruining the story from the start. On the other hand if you are as blind as everyone else, but are genre savvy enough to think things...

I would assume someone without HP knowledge but Naruto knowledge would think the Dark Mark to be holding pieces of Voldemort's soul, that is why he wasn't killed for good. Then they would either go around killing purebloods to kill Voldemort, or try to find a way to defeat him without killing him.

They would be very suspicious of Harry Potter himself due to Kabuto being Orochimaru v2.

They may consider Ron the chosen one even, due to his poor but loving family. Also Ron does have this King Arthur vibe going for him.

Hermione is clearly the Cinderella what with being ugly, smart, and once she straightens out her looks she suddenly turns drop dead georgeus.

Neville is the side kick, no one of importance, the future friendly fat guy in family shows, he may become a deus ex machina guy that gives the last push needed to kill the big bad, but in general he is just the comedic relief character.

Draco is the unloved son of a man stuck between rock and a hard place, his parents probably actually Imperio'ed and Lucius is clearly afraid for his family so he follows what he is being told.

Sirius Black is clearly Harry Potter's answer to Bellatrix Black of Voldemort.

Albus is the supreme good in the story, he is the jesus, he is the aslan, he is the god in human-form, he may even be secretly merlin himself!

Snape is the untrustworthy spy, or maybe he is Scar if we are going with Simba.

I am seeing so many possibilities here. Where the SI screws everything up, like killing Harry, killing Snape, siding with the Malfoys, thinking Dark Magic as not Evil but merely the destructive part of magic, overestimating Dumbledore at every turn until (due to his failures) starting to think of him as the big big bad behind Voldemort and Grindelwart, and etc.
