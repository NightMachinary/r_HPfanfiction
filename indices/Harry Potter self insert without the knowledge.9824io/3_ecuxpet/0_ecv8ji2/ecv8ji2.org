You may merely write it off as the ROB that threw you into the story just scrubbed you memories of the world you are in. Maybe you know the title, maybe you know Voldy's past, but you wouldn't know of the locations, wouldn't know the traps, would know the assumptions like Dumbledore being evil for making the obstacle course on Philosopher's Stone easy enough for the three first years to clear.

If you just hand the knowledge to the SI then it gets too repetitive, too... Simple. Go grab this and that, make sure Dumbly doesn't die, go use either Fiendfyre or kill the Basilisk too for its fang, or maybe use Harry's Parseltongue to make it ally with you, make a trap either during the Goblet of Fire, or during the Ministry raid, or something.

Too simple and too overdone already, we need something new.
