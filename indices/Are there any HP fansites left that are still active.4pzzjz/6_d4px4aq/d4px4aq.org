It isn't a HP fansite at all, but spacebattles still has a lot of fanfic on it, almost all genfic, I've never seen a shipping focused fic there.

Fics Like 'Seventh Horcrux' and 'Applied Cultural Anthropology or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus' were posted there first. Decent standards for writing as well.
