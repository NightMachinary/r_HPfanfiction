So I've started reading After the End and I'm at Chapter 8 now. This story was clearly written after book 4 but before book 5. I'm just amazed at how little the authors knew back then. Like in their story, there were no mentions of Grimmauld Place and Narcissa is not related to Sirius coz that info only came out in OOTP. Luna isn't mentioned. In spite of this, or maybe because of it, I find this story really refreshing.
