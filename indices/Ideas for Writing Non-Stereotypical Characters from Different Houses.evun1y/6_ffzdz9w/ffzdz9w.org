This is exactly the reason, why I like “[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter by writerer]]” (it has a sequel). And yes, reading Wattpad stories without [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][downloading them as an EPub]] is almost impossible.
