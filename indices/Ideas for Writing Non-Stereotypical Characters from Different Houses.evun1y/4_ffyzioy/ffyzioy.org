The Sorting system isn't the end all be all of a person's personality, even in canon. We've seen cowardly Gryffindors and dumb, unambitious Slytherins and backstabbing Hufflepuffs. The Hat makes a judgment on an 11-year-old child who can grow and change with time, and even then, the Hat will put the child in a particular house if they request it, meaning family legacies in certain houses become a thing regardless of an individual child's temperament.

Focus on writing your character as a character first. The house is incidental.
