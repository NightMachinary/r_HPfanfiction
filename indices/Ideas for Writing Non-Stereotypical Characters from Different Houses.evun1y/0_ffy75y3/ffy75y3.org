The stereotype I understand the least is the Ravenclaw one, where I always see Ravenclaw portrayed as booksmart, hardworking, really good students. I don't see how this stereotype stick around when in canon there is mostly example of the contrary with Luna and Cho who aren't especially great students, and Hermione who's all the above but not in Ravenclaw.

Sometimes I want to write a really lazy Ravenclaw, that is really smart but uses it to always do the least amount of work necessary to get passing grades. Someone who's capable of studying a lot, but only on specific subject they're interested in, that has nothing to do with school. But I feel like it's just pushing way too far into another stereotype.

I remember reading [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/ew.com/books/2017/06/28/hogwarts-houses-four-ew-writers-defend-the-misconceptions/amp/][this article]] about the house stereotype which said that no matter how smart you are, it's not really an identity-defining quality.
