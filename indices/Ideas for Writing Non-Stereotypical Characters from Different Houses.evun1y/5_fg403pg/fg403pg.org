The best way to write a character that doesn't fall into the stereotypes is to remember that the reader doesn't need to know why a person goes to a specific house. When writing a character and fleshing them out you can brainstorm their motivations, their hangups, their desires, their values, and some backstory scenes that gave them those. If you create a character with fundamental basic drives that will result in them becoming the person you want to write about, house sorting becomes less important.

Sometimes after setting up the character you want, a house might be obvvious and there you go, as long as you started by trying to come up with a Character first and not a Caricature, you'll end up with someone interesting to read about.

Other times especially if you've kept the defining house traits out of your character development process, there might not be a clear house. This is good too. Think about what the character values most in themselves and in others, who they are and who they want to be. Imagine the sorting conversation that they might have with the hat, and make a decision based on that.

Most importantly "show not tell" why a character is in a house through actions that have a purpose other than showing why they are in that house, remember, the reader doesn't need to know that.
