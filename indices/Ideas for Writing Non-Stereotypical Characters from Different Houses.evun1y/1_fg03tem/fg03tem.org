  What are other Non-Stereotypical character ideas you could come up with?

Hufflepuff is where all the real dark lords go; why would an actually competent aspiring dark lord go into the house that's known for producing dark lords? It'd be completely counterproductive.

In other words, all the dark lords produced by Slytherin are poseurs, while the real dark lords who rule the world behind the scene all come out of Hufflepuff.
