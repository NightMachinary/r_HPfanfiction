Hi. When you read/obsess over this please don't hate me too much. Jewel writes in the JK Rowling style and her fanfic "The life and times" is stunningly accurate. I've never read anything so beautiful. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times]]

Disclosure -Reg Cattermole makes appearances and Nevilles parents are BALLERS

Let me know what you think!
