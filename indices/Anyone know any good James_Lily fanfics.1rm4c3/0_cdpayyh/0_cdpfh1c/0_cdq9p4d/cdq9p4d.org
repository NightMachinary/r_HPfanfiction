It's not finished! Jules has a blog (itreallyatemyhand.tumblr.com) where she talks about it (and posts extra information / deleted excerpts), and she's started chapter 37 already. She also has a page on there where she links her favorite stories, many of which are Lily/James and which tend to be very good ([[http://handlessreadingcorner.blogspot.com/]]). I haven't been able to find another novel-length L/J fic that lives up to the really high bar set by TLAT, but I have found some shorter stories that I like:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3730343/1/So-The-Story-Goes]] - sad, slightly more abstract oneshot near the end of their lives

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=87015&warning=5]] - James and Lily growing up (as a couple, not from childhood) told in 10 short vignettes

Sorry for the potentially poorly formatted links - I am on my iPad. Hope you like some of these stories!
