You've got to know when to hold 'em\\
Know when to fold 'em\\
Know when to walk away\\
And know when to run\\
You never count your money\\
When you're sittin' at the table\\
There'll be time enough for countin'\\
When the dealin's done\\
Every gambler knows\\
That the secret to survivin'\\
Is knowin' what to throw away\\
And knowin' what to keep\\
'Cause every hand's a winner\\
And every hand's a loser\\
And the best that you can hope for Is to die in your sleep"
