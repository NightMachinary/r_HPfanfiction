There are a lot of moving parts to what you've described, and it seems a bit too bombastic for my taste. For example you discussed the society, and gone some into the magic system, but you fall into the trap of not having any plot, or at least not one that you put forward in this post.

The problem I would see with this type of crossover is that the two worlds are fundamentally different, in that Harry Potter has much darker overtones to its society whereas Pokemon is a sugarcoated world. You'd either have to bring Pokemon down or the HP universe up to either one's level. It seems that you are going with the latter, in which case I would suggest making the pokemon in the world more feral particularly in the wild and require more rigorous training if captured (if you are going to have a capture system), and domestic Pokémon (e.g. the starters) being on the same training requirements as cats to dogs. Moreover, Pokémon are largely location locked e.g. the Pokémon in Asia area (red, Blue, yellow etc) are different to those found in the American and European areas (white and black, X and Y). So you have to decide whether you want all Pokémon in one area (which wouldnt make sense in the 'real world') or maybe have the students travel?

I would also be tempted to have a limit on how many Pokémon you have available, particularly to young wizards/trainers, partly for logistical reasons because having multiple characters (which Pokémon would be if they are conscious and sentient) becomes very difficult to write.

A way of getting around this might be that wizards have a Pokémon inside them and at the sorting ceremony this Pokémon is brought out of them that reflects their personality or portion of their soul or however you want to spin it. Therefore, as the wizards/trainer get stronger this is reflected in their soul pokemon (evolutions, new moves, levels etc). Hogwarts could then be a licensing school (gym), where wizards/trainers learn to hunt and capture wild Pokémon (who often attack muggles or something like that). I would also consider nerfing magic considerably so that Pokémon can take an active role in wizards society. Maybe to the extent that Pokémon become the new wands e.g the mediums in which spells are cast.

Animagus (although you have a bit of a hard on for it) seems like redundant ability in a world full of Pokémon particularly if your training one, however perhaps you could have a spell in which to trade places with your Pokémon? Patronus could simply be an attack that the Pokémon learns.

Moreover ,although it's a bit lazy, I wouldnt mention particular Pokémon unless they are vital to the plot, and it would be realistic for them to be in this position that are seen, no point in overreaching.

TLDR: Plot first, details after.
