Right at the top of the post, they mention it will be a forum based RPB, meaning more than one player, so the plot would happen as the different player's characters interact with each other and the world around them, possibly around the plot of the books, possibly not. They mention's legendaries would be played by mods, for instance.

Anyway, while it sounds interesting, it's not something I see myself taking part in. I might read it after it was done and cleaned up, if such a thing happens.
