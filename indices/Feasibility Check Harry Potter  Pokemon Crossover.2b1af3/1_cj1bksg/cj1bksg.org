For a forum-based RPG... it could work. Care of Magical Creatures would have to start at first year, and would be just as important as Charms or DADA. The problem is that you now have a huge balance issue: Pokémon are hard enough on their own, and magic on it's own (and specifically, the Hogwarts version would be a nightmare), but put both together? Ridiculously exploitable combinations of Pokémon and spells/potions will make this a management nightmare: Wingardium Leviosa is learned in the first lesson in charms and all physical melee attacks of a Pokémon are rendered useless, Augumenti creates water and Pikachu just strikes with lightning, some shield from a Pokémon and some darker offensive spells, and so on.

The temptation for going all-out 1-2 punch based combat characters with Pokémon will turn it into a very violent world... unless trainers are not wizards, or would have to give up a lot in order to make that work. I know I'd take a violent route if I'd be a player there.

It would take a lot of serious thought into how to make the two worlds combined not become a tyranny of mathematical/logical creativity.
