Okay, you asked for a feasibility check so here goes: it's NOT doable.

The two universes are just entirely too different. I can't see how Pok√©mon would mix with Harry Potter and not leave everything a giant broken mess.

They don't match in mechanics, they don't match in overlapping theme and they definitely do not match in atmosphere.

I just don't see any way this could work while still being true to both source materials
