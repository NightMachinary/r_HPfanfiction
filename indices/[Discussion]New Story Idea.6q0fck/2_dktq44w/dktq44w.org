I'm going to be honest, OP. Your story is most likely fucked from the beginning if it's a harem - and I'm not including the details you later put down. Furthermore, the ideas are completely unoriginal, burnt out, and boring. Finally, you don't seem to have a coherent plot or outline created. What exactly do you want to happen in your story? I find it helpful to have at least a basic outline when writing, in order to keep myself on track.

Seven girls is simply too much, whether your story includes smut or not. And a Draco/Fleur pairing is probably the most out of character pairing I've ever seen, and I've seen some whacky stuff.

Nevertheless, good luck with your writing. Write what /you/ want and enjoy.
