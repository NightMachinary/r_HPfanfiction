1st. No to the Harem idea, Harem fics don't work for anything other than bad and pointless smut. Real Smut needs to be done with REAL Emotion, and you can't coax it out when multiple girls are on screen with the same cookie cutter personality and all trying to get one guy like this is some Japan shit. No, Harems are dumb.

2nd. You've given a couple pairings, but then in the notes you seem to follow the sanctions of canon. If I have to read one more time about how annoyed Harry is about being with the Durselys, I'm just going to start Xing out of any fics that have that at this point. It's so overused and unneeded. Yea, we get that he wasn't loved, move on with it. (Note: Might be different with Multibook Multiyear Projects as that actually matters.)

3rd. >Draco light side >Neville pairing >Ginny pairing >Ron pairing, you're trying to do too much and trying to fuck with everything. You need to focus on one character and build that person up with supplementary commentary for character development of other characters. Relationships have to be organic, Neville isn't Magically getting pussy because the author wants it, likewise for Harry in canon, because that wasn't realistic. Sure girls can pine after a guy but they won't do shit unless he makes the first move, this is the classic move a story being created by a virgin.

4th. "Harry has to marry x amount of x." Marriage contracts are dubious and make no sense, if there is a marriage contract going back centuries then someone would have already filled out the requirements, even if accidentally. Next, we have the idea that it was James and Lily that did it, but that's stupid because there is no way either would agree with it. James disliked tradition on principle because that is what got Sirius burnt from the family tree. And Lily is very hardcore about being a Mama Bear.
