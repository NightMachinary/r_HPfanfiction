Well first of all I'll say that I'm not against harem like some people here. Seriously, the author wants to write a harem and what you say won't change that, so why bother giving a long list telling him why harem won't work then going on about write what you want.

However, I have to concede that seven is simply too many for a decent fic. If you want to play with magical number, three is a sensible choice. Still hard, but more likely to be pulled off than seven. Check out linkffn(Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble). All three girl still turned out to be rather cardboard in the end, but eh, it's better than dozens of shitty harem fics out there.

Secondly, this one I also have to concede, this idea of yours is far from new. Not this exact line up, but linkffn(The Harem War by Vance McGill) is the story to go by for reference if you're planning to write this.

Thirdly, well, you better come up with a plot, since I've yet to see anything interesting based on the few pointers above. And your story will fare better if you follow fflai's advices. In a harem, just building the internal relationship between Harry and his girls is already a lot of work. You can't also spend time to develope other ships as well without turning this into a mess. My advice? Take only three girls and render every other relationship outside of Harry's to the background.

That's it for now, I guess, since you haven't exactly given us anything to work with. No plot, no summary, just a bunch of ideas strung together.
