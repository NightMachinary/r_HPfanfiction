I see what you are saying. I have a lot of planning left as there a lot of stuff left to figure out but I hope to have a lot of these holes filled and maybe change courses with some of these ideas mainly the Dumbledore one. Its just that I have read a lot of fics where Dumbledore is very controlling so much that its his way or the highway. So yeah I know this fic doesn't sound that great at this point of time but I hope to make at least enjoyable. Thanks!
