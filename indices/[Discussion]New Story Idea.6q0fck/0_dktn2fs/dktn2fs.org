And what is the story? Like why does anything happen? What is the goal? "I'll pair of Harry to a bunch of girls" maybe does make for a good wank-fic, but nothing more.

What you have to consider is also that with 7 girls there are 8 people in relationship with each other.

8 people means 8 * 9 / 2 = 36 relationships. 36 relationships that you have to keep track of in the harem alone.

Astoria started Hogwarts at 1993 - two years after Harry - so she is around fourteen. That's very young for marriage, especially with everyone between two (Pansy, Susan) and nine (Tonks) years older. Oh yeah, Tonks is seven years older than Harry.

How will the relationship between Tonks and Astoria be? Between Tonks and Susan? I mean her aunt - that she lives with - is her boss. And Voldemort has a thing for killing Bones. He killed Susan's parents personally, and her aunt in HBP too. How will that affect her? How can Harry protect her? And what's the relationship between Lavender and Pansy?

This is a lot to keep track off, and then you still want to add story. You'll either make the girls flat and equal in some way - or the story will come to a halt. I mean I only thought about it for a second and that is chapters of character development just in the paragraph above.

And that is only the main thing. You say that Draco is on the side of the light, but that doesn't mean much in itself. Is he a spy? Will he turn on his father? How will that work out? How will Voldy react, considering Draco was marked in the summer leading up to HBP?

That alone is quite a lot to deal with.

Portraying Dumbledore that way is fine, but also extremely boring imo. But again, it means nothing. How will the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry be? How will Dumbledore act?

What exactly is the goal with your fic? All I see here are a few ideas scribbled down without a coherent plot - and the idea's aren't actually that good or new.

I mean if you want to write it, by all means do so. Writing is always fun and ultimately it's your story, not mine!

But you asked for feedback, and my feedback is that I see major problems with it.
