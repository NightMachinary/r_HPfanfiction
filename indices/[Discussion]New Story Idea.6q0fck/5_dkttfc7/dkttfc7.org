Too many characters for a coherent story. Most romances are already "full" when they focus on two characters getting together - you have more than a dozen relationships planned, not counting the ones inside the planned harem. If you focus sufficient attention on each relationship, then the story devolves into dozens of character interactions strung along in a not even loosely related manner, where the reader has forgotten what happened in a scene long before the story returns to that pairing. And if you shorten those relationship development scenes, they become mere background noise - and only clutter up the story if they still involve the main character.

(I could imagine a, very cracky, story, focused on say Ron and Hermione growing closer while in the background, Harry is trying to gather a harem - emphasis on "trying" - and his antics serve as comedy relief. So, they see him sulking after Tonks flat-out laughed into his face when he proposed - she's a grown woman and he's a little boy with all the maturity of a teenage emo - and try to cheer him up without laughing at his plans for a harem.)
