I understand where you're coming from and, especially with current context in the world, definitely have some uncomfortable feelings about it. However, I don't think it /has/ to play into that, if it's written right.

My take on it is that Magic is a semi-sentient force in the world that has begun manifesting in humanity because of [insert whatever macguffin I want for a particular story]. It /wants/ to encompass everything and it certainly does a lot to boost the survivability of the humans it manifests in, but the trade off is that wizards (and to a lesser extent, squibs) have overall way fewer children than muggles historically have, so while "magic" is a heritable trait that cannot be lost once it's in a bloodline, it spreads much, much more slowly than pure muggles can reproduce. To continue the idea that Magic wants itself to spread, I headcannon that wizard x muggle partnerships have a much higher chance of producing more than two children than wizard x wizard relationships, and that squibs are a method Magic uses to force wizarding lines to bring in new genetics (because squibs blend easier with muggles and will be more likely to be sent out into the muggle world) and that they only manifest when the families involved haven't brought in enough new blood in the last couple of generations. Muggleborns are due to Magic deciding that a nice mix of new genetics has been brought in and manifesting so that those genetics can be mixed back into the rest of the magical population - or due to enough manifested magicals dying that Magic begins manifesting in many squib lines at once because it needs to keep a balance of active to passive power (ie wizards to squibs).
