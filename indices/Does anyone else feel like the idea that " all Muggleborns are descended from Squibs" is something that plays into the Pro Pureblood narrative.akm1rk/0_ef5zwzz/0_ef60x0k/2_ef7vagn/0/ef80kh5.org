I have forgotten most of the Examples of accidental magic we get from Canon but the two that stick out to me are:

1. Harry apparating into the school roof to get away from Dudley's gang but if it has been something more life threatening that would be enough to save a child life as long as what was hunting them wasn't magical as well.

2. Neville bouncing after being dropped out the window

both thing example would be enough to save magical child life were a muggle child would die.
