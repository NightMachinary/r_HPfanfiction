It's just an exemple. I prefer the explanation to remain mysterious, and magic operating outside the laws of physics.

Magic being this force which trumps the usual laws of the universe seems more magic to me.

But what I'm trying to say is you don't need to explain it through physics and stuff, there are other ways to do it.
