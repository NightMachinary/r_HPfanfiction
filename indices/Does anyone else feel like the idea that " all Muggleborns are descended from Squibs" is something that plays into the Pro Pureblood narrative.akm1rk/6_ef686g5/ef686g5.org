I'd say it creates ground for a more separatists narrative, than pro-pureblood - after all, assuming it's true, it means purebloods were fundamentally wrong on the point of muggleborns being less worthy, or stealing magic. Also, I quite like this idea, as I've always pictured muggles and magicals as two separate species that can breed with each other, but not much else, and it's the preferred background I look for in fanfiction :3
