I don't think it really matters. Even in real life, bigots will try to find "evidence" to support their view. It's not like you will find many racists who will tell you that they hate people of color for no reason, instead they'll cite some FBI reports about black crime being high for example. Sure from their point of view they do have a point, but the problem is that they ignore all of the sociopolitical reasons behind it, just like the pureblood bigots do.
