I feel like there was a lot of removing themselves from the muggle gene pool anyway as a side effect of the "grouping." Once there's enough groups running around theres probably one close and.... I fully believe that some well meaning wizards stole their local muggleborns away from "those people that just won't understand." Maybe those wizards are waiting, hunting for lack of a better word, for a kid to pop up or... maybe... well people talk and when something odd happens people talk more.
