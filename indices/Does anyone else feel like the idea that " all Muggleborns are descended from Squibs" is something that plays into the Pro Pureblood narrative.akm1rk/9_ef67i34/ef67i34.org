I feel like it's a mix, the original "spark" had to happen at some point, and more than once. It makes sense that, eventually early magic users would find each other and start grouping up. Which, of course, led to the divide but.... why would that particular genetic quirk just... stop?

And, now that wizards have been marrying wizards for so long that both parents are practically gaunteed to pass on the gene it... sometimes happens in reverse. Sure, maybe its occasionally inbreeding - but that, I think, it is less "they didn't get the magic!" And more "something is wrong that is blocking it!" And it never gets fully investigated to figure out what. 90% a "true" squib is just... the reverse of what happened in the first place.

...but yes, sometimes it means that there's a surprise wizard or muggle or squib or muggleborn somewhere in the background.

Like Colin and Dennis... both of them feels like too much to be an accident. My gut says wizard, and maybe pretty recently.

But Hermione just sort of happened.

And Lily... maybe a "true" squib somewhere.

But... you know, headcanon
