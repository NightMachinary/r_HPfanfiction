This. I get kind of annoyed at some stories with Lily and Hermione who "secretly" have magical relatives, because it is seen to explain their being head girl or Hermione being a genius and so on. Like it kind of comes across as "magical heritage wins out."

The only exception are a couple of stories I've seen where Harry is a parselmouth because of LIly, and the whole magical bloodline in Lily was seen to be fucked up (like the Gaunts) and not the reason she nor Harry were powerful.
