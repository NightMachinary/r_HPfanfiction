Something I've thought about a lot. I write Hermione as a main character often, and I mostly try to avoid her suddenly being discovered to have wizarding relatives because I think she would feel that all of her accomplishments up to that point would now be seen like â€˜I told you she was too smart to be a muggleborn'.

There's so much to do with the squib-born angle, though, so I like reading other people's takes on it as well.
