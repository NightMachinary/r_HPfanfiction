I would say that true Muggleborns do exist but they are just a lot Rarer than a Muggleborn with a Squib ancestor. After all if True Muggleborn's don't exist were did the First Magical human come from?

I would say that Once the magical Line is starts by a Muggleborn coming into existence it would continue indefinitely baring outside forces like the Inbreeding the Purebloods seem to partake in in Canon.

Really if Magic has Anything to do with genetic it would be impossible for Purebloods to Produce Squibs because they wouldn't have the Non-magical Genes.

I am not a fan on Genetics having anything to do with magic.
