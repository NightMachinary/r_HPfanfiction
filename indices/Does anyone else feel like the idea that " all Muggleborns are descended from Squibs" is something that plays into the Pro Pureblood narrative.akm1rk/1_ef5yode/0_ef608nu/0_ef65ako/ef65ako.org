  After all if True Muggleborn's don't exist were did the First Magical human come from?

Good question, but where did magic come from, to begin with? We have no clue. Could be Muggle-Borns randomly started being born at some point, but it's equally plausible that a group of adult cavemen were selected by... whoever... (God(s)? angels? aliens? Cthulhu?)... and were granted magic all at once, subsequently passing it on to their descendants.
