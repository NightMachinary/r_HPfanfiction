Maybe they've just an invaders from the other world? Escape something like destruction of their world but as time passes or to forget sadness of losing their motherland - they either forgot or lost information about it. Or just came to Earth on space ship but to infiltrate natives they were forced to reject their technologies and later lost it and got stuck in their middle-aged time.
