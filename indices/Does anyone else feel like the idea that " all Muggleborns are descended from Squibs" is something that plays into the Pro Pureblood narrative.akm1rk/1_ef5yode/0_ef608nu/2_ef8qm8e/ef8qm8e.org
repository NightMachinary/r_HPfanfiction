  I would say that true Muggleborns do exist but they are just a lot Rarer than a Muggleborn with a Squib ancestor. After all if True Muggleborn's don't exist were did the First Magical human come from?

Here I would agree with you. I think the idea of dormant magical/squib lines being more numerous that Muggleborns/Muggleborn makes exponentially more sense than there is no such thing as a "True" muggleborn line.

Personally, I imagine "true" muggleborns lines as spontaneously occurring phenomenon What makes most logical sense to me is that these new lines act as hosts or receptacles for latent, naturally occurring magical energies. It gives some credence to Grindelwald's grandstanding that" Magic blooms only in rare souls." It seems to me, that given the historical connection between nature and spellcraft, any magical being--be they pureblood, halfblood, muggleorn, troll, or house elf-- is, in some respects, a conduit for naturally occurring magical energies.

  I would say that Once the magical Line is starts by a Muggleborn coming into existence it would continue indefinitely baring outside forces like the Inbreeding the Purebloods seem to partake in in Canon.

Once again here, I find you logic to be sound.

  Really if Magic has Anything to do with genetic it would be impossible for Purebloods to Produce Squibs because they wouldn't have the Non-magical Genes.

  I am not a fan on Genetics having anything to do with magic.

This is where I differ a bit. On some basic level I find the mixing of genetics and magic to be slimy. However, at the same time, it seems to me as if there must be some sort of connection between the two. If we accept that muggleborn lines are likely to produce magical offspring in perpetuity, barring the inbreeding and mass warfare population devastation that seem to occur in great frequency in the magical world, it seems paradoxical to then assert that genetics and magic are unlinked.

If we think of being a squib as a birth defect it makes sense for Purebloods to produce no-squibs. Because I think of magical beings as conduits rather than being inherently magical themselves, I think it makes even more sense. Some people have birth defects or genetic conditions which make it impossible for their bodies to produce or process certain hormones or nutrients. If magical lines are more about create individuals capable of harnessing magic it makes sense that in those rare souls in which, magic bloom some sort of genetic alteration has likely occurred.

Another question I've had though is why are dormant pureblood/ "fake" muggleborn lines not considered half-bloods. If magic is genetic and being a squib is a birth defect then it would make sense that the offspring were still considered magical beings, incapable of excising magic. Since the all Muggleborns are descended from Squibs argument is still based on the idea of the inheritably of magical blood it seems that dormant pureblood lines are more accurately half-blood lines (this being based on the idea that most squibs settle on the fringes of magical society with other squibs or in the non-magical community with muggles).

On a basic level, this sort of thinking would play into a blood supremacist ideology, in so far as it supports the idea that there is a fundamental and biological separation between magical and non-magical beings. Thus, this line of thinking can undeniably be used as pureblood claptrap. At the same time, I think it also creates room for a critique of pureblood ideology. One of the underling principles of supremacist ideology (outside of its focus on traditionalism and peerage), is that the "purer" ones blood is, the more magically gifted and inclined that individual is likely to be. While people scramble to claim that muggleborns are defective purebloods gone defunct, little attention seems to be given to explaining why this happens (hello inbreeding anyone...just as a place to start). Consequently, on an entire other level the idea that all Muggleborns are descend from squibs undermines another key tenets of pro-pureblood fanaticism because it recognizes some of the inherent limits in genetically inheritable magical traits.
