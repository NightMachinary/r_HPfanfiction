My idea is that all living things have a tiny amount of magic, normally to small to notice, but wizards and magical creatures have a mutation (or several) that cause them to have much more magic. This seems like the simplest explanation for having magical vertebrates, insects, worms, fungi, plants, and even viruses all over the tree of life.

I know that doesn't explain why magic didn't become dominant in the environment. Maybe an alternative explanation is that there is a fixed amount of natural magic in the environment, and it can only sustain a small number of species. Or maybe it's powered by belief, or otherwise required a sapient being to absorb it from the environment and convert it to a form that can be absorbed by other lifeforms. There's not really a good way to explain both the genetics and the evolutionary biology of magic as described in canon.
