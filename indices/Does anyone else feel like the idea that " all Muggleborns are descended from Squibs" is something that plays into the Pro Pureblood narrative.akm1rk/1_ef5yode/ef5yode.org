I don't mind that bit of JKR's post-canon trivia. The series has been pretty clear about how magic runs in families, with one of Harry's big bombshells as a kid being that his Mum and Dad were wizards just like him.

If you're going to write a universe where magic /isn't/ genetic and comes out of nowhere, instead of Muggleborn wizards coming from several skipped generations of Squib blood, then you should balance it out by making wizarding families have a good chance of producing no-Majs. If it doesn't work both ways, then your AU is inconsistent with itself.

Also, I think there are plenty of hints that Magical Beings and Muggles are different species. Magicals can see Dementors, Muggles can only feel the effects. Magicals have hardier bodies where they aren't killed playing Quidditch, and can live up to 150+ years. That doesn't sound like standard humans to me.

The easiest thing I've found is not to address it all, unless the story is about purebloods coming to terms with their prejudices. Mixing modern genetic science with Harry Potter turns a story into pure Mugglewank. And that ruins stories to me, because these wank fics always make Harry Potter into Harry Dresden.
