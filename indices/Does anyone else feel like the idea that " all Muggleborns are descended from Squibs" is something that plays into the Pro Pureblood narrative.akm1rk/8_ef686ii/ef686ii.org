I do think it does play into the pro pureblood narrative but I also think it's the most likely idea. A story I once read had it that magic in humans first came from normal humans and 'humanoid' magical creatures producing offspring together and this is why some people are better at some branches of magic, and where things like parseltongue and metamorphs come from. The fact that magical humans all do magic the same way can be explained by the offspring of these different magic creatures breeding together and the adaptation of magic to an otherwise fully human body. Of course as time went on people forgot where the magic came from and a lot of magical people would now throw a fit if you suggested that their magic came from a magical creature. This way, the only way for a 'Muggleborn' to have magic is if at some point in their family history, there was a magical creature or a magical person, which in the time the books are written in, is more likely to be an already existing magical family than its likely for a muggle to have children with a magical creature even if they somehow came across one.
