Can you explain? I've not seen this element in many stories so I'm curious why this is a pro pureblood thing. It would maybe be an anti muggle thing since it means that pure muggles can never produce magical children, meaning that the magicals and muggles are truly separate.

However for muggleborns it means they have a semblance of magical ancestry. I'd say that would improve their status (at least marginally) in the magical world.
