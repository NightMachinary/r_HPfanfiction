Pro-purebloods believe that magical blood matters. You have Grindelwald style blood purists, who think that all magicals are automatically better than Muggles, doesn't matter their purity as long as they have magic "blooming in their souls". And then you have Malfoy style purists, who think Muggles are trash, and the purer the magical blood the better.

Pro-Muggles believe that blood doesn't matter. Wizards are all equal to each other if they have magic. Muggles are equal too, and as humans, and deserve equal treatment and having their basic rights protected, ie, protected against baiting, cursing, or having Unforgivables used on them, which is a direct line to Azkaban when used on a witch or wizard. (Magical Creature rights for non-human magicals is still iffy, as people like Ron don't seem to care about house elves.) And people like Arthur Weasley, who are Pro-Muggle, still treat Muggles like carnival novelties, so eh...

If Muggleborns come from Squibs, then it means they're not really /true/ Muggles, or Muggles who have "stolen" magic, especially if their Squib blood comes from a "good" family. It proves that blood /does/ matter, which supports some pureblood agendas.
