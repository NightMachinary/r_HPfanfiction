  It proves that blood does matter, which supports some pureblood agendas.

That's kind of a narrow way of looking at it, isn't it? Whether blood matters in whether or not you get magic is besides the point. The reason Muggles and wizards should be treated equally has nothing to do with how likely they are to be magical; it's a matter of the fact that they are sentient intelligent beings with feelings, deserving of empathy. No one would argue that blood doesn't matter in making someone a human vs. a house-elf, yet the latter still deserve equal rights, too.
