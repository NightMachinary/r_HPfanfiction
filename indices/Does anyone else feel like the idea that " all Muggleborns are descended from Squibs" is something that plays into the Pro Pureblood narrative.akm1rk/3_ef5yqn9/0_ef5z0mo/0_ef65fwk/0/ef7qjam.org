Yeah but all things being equal, it's still a point in favor of the pureblood argument that they're superior by virtue of their genes. Like, if it were scientifically proven that Aryans were superior, that still wouldn't justify exterminating other races, since as you said, they're sentient beings, but Ayran superiority was nevertheless an important part of their justification for genocide, and one reasonable counter-argument to Nazi philosophy is, "Aryans are not genetically superior."

The pureblood argument is basically two-fold: 1) magical ability stems only from pureblood genes, 2) this justifies treating non-purebloods badly.

If muggleborns are descended from squibs (and thus from wizards/purebloods), that means the purebloods are right about the first half of their argument. Obviously, a difference in someone's inherent magical ability is not a justification to treat them poorly, but if all muggleborns are really descended from purebloods, that does lend credence to the pureblood view that their genes are superior (superior genes, meaning that due to their genetics, they have magic powers, they are tougher, and they live longer).

Since muggle/muggleborn discrimination is an allegory for racial discrimination, it's almost like JKR (unintentionally, I'm sure) is suggesting that some races are genetically superior, even though that wouldn't justify persecution if it were true.
