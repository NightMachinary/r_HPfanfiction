Thinking about Mendel and his peas...and how through cross breeding and selection, we are able to come up with seedless grapes for instance, I would say that, if you want to bring common sense into a possible explanation, we all evolved from the same species BUT...at some point, Magic manifested itself in some people, and those people actually married each other,and their descendeants married into otrher similar magically talented people for the betterment of their comunities, as Magic would bring more chances of survival.

​

Like in nature, through the centuries, sometimes their offspring would be born without Magic and, as it happened to them, sometimes magic would appear to non magically inclined people, so i would guess this "genetic lottery" also played into worlds becomeing more separated.

​

This would be a logical explanation and progression, but I guess JKR already said that muggleborn descended from squibs, whichis quite meh IMO. ( If that is so, then we should also assume that a percentage of muggleborn were actually half bloods, as throwing squibs- children under 11 years old- into non magical world- I assume, in Orphanages- would also offer opportunity for magicals to have sexual partners in the real world and go on to pretend that nothing happened and live without facing consequences,)
