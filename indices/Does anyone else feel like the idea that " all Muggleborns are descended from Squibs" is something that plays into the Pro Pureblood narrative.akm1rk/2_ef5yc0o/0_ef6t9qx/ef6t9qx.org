  It is an incredibly common point to add a massive rift between the worlds, Magic is something reserved to the "Magical races" and quite a different world,

That is quite common and used mostly for cheap drama or justify muggleborns (mostly Hermione) being OOC and abandoning their families because their parents don't understand them anymore.

Like, no one is stopping you from living in Norwich just because you have magic. Tell your neighbours that you work for some government department of your choice, and you'd be good to go. You'd still go to the local Tesco because you want crisps or buy a VHS/DVD. You can still have a telly and use the Internet. Hell, there is nothing stopping Hermione from making a name for herself in E-sports.
