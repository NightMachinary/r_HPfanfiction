Right, it's one of those things that can be used to give the Purebloods a "point".

It also creates a very distinct delineation between Muggles and Wizards. If Muggles can have magical children it suggests that magic - at least in some small part - is sort of everywhere. If they can't, Magic is something reserved to the "Magical races" and quite a different world, at least for my gut feeling.
