Wizards have been around since at least ancient Egypt. Statistically speaking literally everyone is descended from a squib somehow.

I kind of like the idea that muggleborns are the result of some old "magical genetics" that runs in the family coming back to the surface and it doesn't even really exclude anyone because with how long wizards and muggles have been intermingling those genetic markers would be scattered just about everywhere in the population.
