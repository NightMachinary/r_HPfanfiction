Well if it's all based on genetics and not some mysterious force that randomly selects who gets magic and who doesn't then that means practically every human on earth carries the magic gene in a dormant state, and only very rarely does it become active when they are born. Think of magic like eye colours, most people have brown or black, but some, rare people have blue and green.

So not only is Harry special in that he has magic, he's doubly special because he has those bright green eyes too!
