I like to mix and match the idea that some muggleborn are descendants of squibs, and that Magic is sentient to some degree and either thinks “oh, this is gonna be awesome!” When it makes a muggleborn or does it because it like the baby's giggle or something cute but arbitrary.

This way you can have muggleborn s being the only living descendants of the hogwarts four and other famous witches and wizards, and you can have Magic itself deciding that certain muggle babies are completely worthy of having magic, thus producing muggleborn magic users that are orders of magnitudes more powerful than their inbred opponents.

That way you can have the Creevy brothers being the great*10 grandkids of helga hufflepuff, Hermione being chosen specifically by Magic because he/she/it decided the waves she would make would be awesome, and a little green-eyed redhead who get her magic because when Magic itself was wandering by it saw the little girl and thought ‘Oh! That's one of Sali's grandkids! This'll be great!”
