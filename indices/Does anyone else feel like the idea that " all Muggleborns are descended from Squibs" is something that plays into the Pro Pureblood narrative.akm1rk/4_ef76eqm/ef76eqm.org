I personally like the muggleborns are descendant from squibs theory for a bunch of reasons that other people have already mentioned. In my head canon, you need a squib ancestor from each side of the family within the last five generations. Also, like wizards, squibs have lower birth rates meaning most muggleborns will come from smaller families (Dean Thomas is actually a halfblooded with a wizard father). I personally like to believe that the first witches and wizards were half-breeds like Fleur and Hagrid and that pure humans don't have any 'magical' genes.

I've read AU's where muggleborns are the result of true love (usually Once Upon A Time crossovers) which allows for random muggleborns without there being a lot of them.
