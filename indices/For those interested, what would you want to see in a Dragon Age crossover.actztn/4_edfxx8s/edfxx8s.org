Keeping the DA characters internally consistent is an issue I see with DA fics often. For example, someone might write a fic like yours where Harry is dropped into Thedas and he becomes friends with Cassandra. But Cassandra would likely lose her shit over a dimension-hopping wizard who uses magic that's foreign to her, and could just as easily be a demon trying to deceive her. That doesn't mean that Harry and Cassandra /can't/ be friends, but it should have some challenge to it.
