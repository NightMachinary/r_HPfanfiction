FREEDOM FIGHTER HARRY :) (he wouldn't want to go to Circlekaban after all and be locked up!)

Not to mention that I'd want a travelling Harry who learns whatever magic is available in Thedas :) and who helps the Dwarfs fight the Darkspawn (maybe make them Golems through animation charms, so the Anvil of the Void is not needed anymore!) :)

Shapeshifting Harry (I still question why Rowling never let him learn to be an animagus! Damned, it's the best escape tool ever - especially if he can't use magic in muggle surroundings!)

Also: Blood magic (he wouldn't want to be unable to fight if a Templar smites him (unless the Harry-Verse magic is immune to that?))

I'd love to see him meet Flemeth and Morrigan (that would make for a great relationship...do gooder Harry with Morrigan who's a lot less good, but not outright amoral "I will kill you all")

I'd love to see Harry try to make potions and dabble with Lyrium and the blight (like Avernus!)...not to mention maybe him being a metamorph (helps to avoid capture if he can change his looks - especially at first when he doesn't know crap about his surroundings and has to survive!)
