Not Hermione, because writers can't resist turning her into Hermy-sue and writing that she's the most beautiful in this new land etc.

Harry keeping his brain, and keeping his Magic, but more of a looser in morals Harry, giving the chantry a real reason to suspect him if it's Inquisition. Not Evil, but willing to Avada his enemies. Death Magic and such being seen as evil by the Creator, him being seen as a form of Apostate/Maleficarum as far as the Chantry are concerned, but as he uses his Magic to HELP, then the Inquisition will go with it.

Canon Harry/co would be eaten alive as they were so hesitant on killing they'd die before they got to the Inquisition, and OC-centric fics that might as well be "Not relevant to Harry Potter except the character uses Wand Magic" are terrible.
