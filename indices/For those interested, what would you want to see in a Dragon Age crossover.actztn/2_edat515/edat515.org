TBH I would love to read whatever. Dragon Age is one on my favorite games of all time, besides Mass Effect. I'd love for Harry not to lose his magic per se, but to have to learn the magic of Thedas, because the one from his world doesn't work anymore. Also, depending on the setting, if it was a MoD situation, where he is reborn in another universe, I'd enjoy if Harry was either Orlesian (partly for the comedic inner dialogue of a Brit "being in the body of a pseudo-french"), or a Free-marcher (possibly a Trevelyan, love my Inky)
