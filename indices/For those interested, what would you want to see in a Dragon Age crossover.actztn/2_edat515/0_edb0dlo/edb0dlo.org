I'm genuinely tempted to make him be reborn as / soul transfer / whatever magic bullshit you want as an Evanuris, probably Falon'Din: Friend of the Dead, the Guide. Or an old god. Just to make things more complex.

EDIT: or a champion / manifestation / shard of / servant / Master of Falon'Din. Honestly, I just like the idea of two beings of death having a connection.
