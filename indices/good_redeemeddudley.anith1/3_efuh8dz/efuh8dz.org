linkffn(the summer after the war) doesnt feature dudley but its sequel [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][the winters after the war]] does feature him as better person

as well as linkffn(The First Year, an Almost Happily Ever After story)

i last read these like 10 yrs ago when i first discovered fanfics but iirc they were both decent quality

linkffn(The Burn of the Phoenix) is pretty good but unfortunately a oneshot
