Linkffn(4172226) has Dudley rising to the occasion when Vernon goes too far. It's well-received and quite well-written.

I'd also recommend Linkffn(8369495). It's not quite as dramatic as "A Hero" but I find it to be closer in tone to the original stories, and I prefer it.

Edit: Oh bugger. I posted Ravenclaw Cutie again by mistake. That was from an earlier thread. Sorry. Fixed.
