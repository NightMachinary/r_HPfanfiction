Not near enough of stuff like this in my opinion. Only things come to mind: the one shot Cousin Harry linkffn(11923249) and Dudley's Memories linkffn(6142629) which starts of with exactly this fix, but Dudley(and co.) play a disappointingly small role in the fic overall.

I'd also recommend linkffn(11577120) which kind of scratches a somewhat similar itch?
