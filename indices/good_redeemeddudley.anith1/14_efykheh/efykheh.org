I think little0birds Questions and Answers has some of this (been a while since I read it). The fic is /not/ about Harry and Dudley reconnecting, but they interact enough that it's probably worth mentioning. Linkffn(Questions and Answers). Also, they don't reconnect at the start of the fic, IIRC. It will be partway into the story, and that fic is much too long for me to comb through to find where they first meet up (unfortunately).
