I cannot for the life of me remember enough unique details to find it, but there was a really well written one where Dudley realized what his parents actually did and eventually went into child psychology and worked with the police as sort of emergency child services in the hopes of finding "funny" cases so he could find the magical world and reconnect with Harry... ultimately to find out that his longtime co-worker and counterpart with social services is actually Hermione who's job it was to cover up magical involvement and protect/whisk away magical children stuck in extreme situations.

Dudley married and goes by his spouse's last name, but wrote a book under Dursley (in hopes harry might find it) about how the "Other" child who is not abused is still fucked up by being in an abusive household, just in different ways.

Hopefully someone else will remember enough to find it?
