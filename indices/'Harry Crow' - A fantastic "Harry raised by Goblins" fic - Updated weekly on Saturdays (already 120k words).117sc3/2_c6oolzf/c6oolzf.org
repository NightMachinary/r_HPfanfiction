Several new ideas in this story that kept me interested. I liked how Harry is considered to be a goblin.

However, the story has huge pacing issues. 20 chapters in and is only on the Christmas holidays of the first year. Several characters are, as already mentioned, one dimensional. The author is writing themselves into a corner for time.

I'll continue to follow it for a while to see if the story continue to peeks my interest.
