Honestly, totally agree. So many fics in this pairing are total crap, but this fic blows away even gen fics. I am super impressed by it and need to read it again.

This fic had me from the very first chapter, which contained probably the first proper usage of Pepper Up potion I've ever seen in a fic. I'm not super fond of the prequel (which I actually read after discovering Hauntingly), but it does explain a few things in Hauntingly. I'm definitely keeping Hauntingly, but not the prequel.

An HPLV with zero bashing or dark apologist crap... amazing by itself. But it's also a story where romance isn't the point, even if it is a big plot point. It's really so excellent I can barely believe it was actually Harry Potter fanfic.
