I don't mind now, but this one I might skip because of the pairing. Also the romance tag, as I prefer gen fics.

I was one of these people, because I used to see slash as something written primarily in the interest of romance or smut, with an eye to pairing first and everything else later. I also skip most het romance/smut oriented fics(or the few scenes in them). I then read linkffn(10099028), and that was the end of that approach. I realized that it isn't all romance.

I read the entire sacrifices arc slightly after that, and although I skimmed over some of the smut and fluff I finished it for the plot, and the great writing. This despite all the problems I had with it.(too low on humour for me, the action interspersed with angst and fluff was not my cup of tea, and I wish it hadn't been so influential)

In my experience, many people feel it isn't for them, and is written with a specific audience in mind.
