  I do find the immersion thing funny though. The ability to relate to characters living in a magical school filled with ghosts and spell casting, but not with attraction between two men.

Strange, isn't it? To be fair I also get sick of characters that are too childlike, too pompous, or too stupid for my personal tastes. Even more strange, I have no problem with women POVs...unless they're primarily romance.
