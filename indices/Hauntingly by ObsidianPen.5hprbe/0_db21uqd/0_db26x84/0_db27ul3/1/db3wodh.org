I agree with Hurt/Comfort and Angst being my least favorite genres. Not because of the themes per say, but because it's usually terribly done. It's a really hard genre to tackle without going overboard, and maintaining reader interest.

I do find the immersion thing funny though. The ability to relate to characters living in a magical school filled with ghosts and spell casting, but not with attraction between two men.
