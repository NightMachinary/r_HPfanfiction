Lots of reasons. I like to get into the head of the main character and find overly detailed descriptions of slash breaks immersion very quickly. I also find that the tropes and stereotypes in slash tend to be things I'm not interested in...hurt/comfort and angst are SUPER common in my experience. This is especially true in fics where Harry is the main character and is a sub or similar.

Quite a few slashfics tend to spend a nonzero amount of time talking about homosexuality and the issues/prejudices associated with it, which doesn't fit with my head canon of the potterverse (I tend to think there's basically no sexism, racism, and...gayism (?) presented in the books, so to agonize about how hard it is going to be to be gay is super irritating to me. I know it's a commentary about real world difficulty but HP Verse is not real life). Not to say that I avoid all things that diverge from my head canon, but that's another immersion breaker.

So in summary the content, characters, and canon tends to diverge from what I like and despite reading for years and years now, I have not reached a point where I ran out enough to NEED to start reading slash. It's just an easy filter that I can default to.

For the record, I really dislike romance in general, and almost nobody writes a non-romance slashfic...it's just not done. If you're writing slash, it's ABOUT the slash 99% of the time.
