It's just nothing that is attractive to me. I even find femslash to be quite entertaining. I happen to really like the Power of Love series by Philosophize. I'm just really not into two dudes snogging, no matter how well it's done. I have been accused of homophobia many times due to my dislike of m/m pairings. I hope this short explanation will suffice for you to not jump to the same 'conclusion' as many others.
