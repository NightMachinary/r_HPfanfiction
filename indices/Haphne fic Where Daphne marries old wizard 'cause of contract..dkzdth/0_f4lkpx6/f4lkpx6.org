Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts by Clell65619 is this except it's Harry kills the old guy rather than Daphne.

linkffn(4079609) is the original version and linkffn(5835213) is the slightly less over-the-top version. Clell prefers the latter version but to my mind if you're going to write a powerful!Harry with outrageous Weasley bashing you might as well go the whole hog.
