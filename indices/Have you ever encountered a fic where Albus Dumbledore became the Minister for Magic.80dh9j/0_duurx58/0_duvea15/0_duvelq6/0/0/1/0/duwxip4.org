Yea except the little detail that the manipulation continued after this and even after Dumbledore died. There's a reason Snape had to give Harry those memories, because otherwise Harry might not have survived. When I say he had no problem, I mean he routinely did it, even after admitting the manipulations nearly caused Harry to nearly die in book 5.
