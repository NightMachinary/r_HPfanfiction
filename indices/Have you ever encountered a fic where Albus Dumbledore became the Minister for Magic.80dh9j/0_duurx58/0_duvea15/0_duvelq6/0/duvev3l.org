Well, I guess this is where my Dumbledore bashing begins, but I don't think that's a valid distinction. In fact it is way harder to make yourself a dictator with executive power (because it is rarely built into the system) you absolutely *need* the influence to do that, and can do without the formal power.

IMHO Dumbledore is just afraid that he's going to fail (because he had more failures than successes in his life, in short, he sucks) so he doesn't want to take responsibility. If he doesn't hold any formal power no-one can blame him when everything goes to shit. He wants to be seen as this great legendary figure that can do no wrong, even though he knows he's wrong a lot. So he stays out of the limelight.
