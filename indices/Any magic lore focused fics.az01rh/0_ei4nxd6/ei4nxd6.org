Ah, if it's fics like Core Threads and HPMOR you want, I'm sorry I probably can't help you.

But, I think if you want to go into magical lore and world building there are much more amazing and fascinating fics out there. linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is one great fic I can recall.

If you're willing to go full AU, there are some really different fics with concepts I think truly deserve more recognition : linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone; Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone; Ectomancer; A Long Journey Home)
