Might as well crack it up. Quick and Dirty draft.

End of Book 4 in the Graveyard. Voldemort is making his monologue. And right when all of the Death Eaters look at Voldemort, *poof* Voldemort turns around and notices that Harry is gone, and in the distance he spots a goose with a wand-shaped item sticking out of its beak. He lifts his hand to send a curse into the distance and notices that that wand-shaped item WAS his wand.

"What are you fools doing! Kill it!"

Seconds pass by with no spells flying into the distance.

"My Lord, I think those wand-shaped items under that thing's wings was our wands..." said Goyle, breaking his high score of most words in a sentence.\\
"FOOL! Avada Kedavra!"

Right as the words fell out of his mouth, Riddle realised his mistake. Wandless magic uses your body as a foci. The killing curse kills on /contact./ Not even given a chance to lament his mistake, his body falls to the ground as his spirit is ejected.

As one, the surrounding Death Eaters look at each other and shout "1-2-3 NOT IT!" and Dissapparate away, leaving Pettigrew behind who is still bleeding on the ground.

Finally noticing why it was so quiet, he looks up and notices everybody is gone. He finally notices Voldemort's new body-cum-corpse. Not liking where this is going, he assumes his Wormtail form. It takes him a few minutes, but he manages to get the hang of walking with three feet.

He manages to make it a hundred yards away to where he thinks the portkey landed and walks into something alive. He notices this fact and looks up to meet eyes with a goose. Hey, that goose has green eyes just like Lily... And Har-

"HONK!" **PECK\** "HONK! HONK!" **PECK\**

Peter's consciousness fades as he is being dragged by the tail towards a golden trophy filled with assorted jewelry and wands with money pouches hanging off their ends.

*THE END*

BOOM! 1,000 Galleons for winning a deadly tournament... What, are they crazy? Or did Bagman skim the prize money for his debts? This way increases Harry's "winnings". And frees Sirius. And gets A LOT of Death Eaters arrested. Those wands can be tested, and a lot of unforgivables should pop up, since canon doesn't specify how far back a wand can be tested. And then Ollivander never forgets a wand or customer. So boom, traceable.

"Yeah, Voldemort came back. But then he caught whatever the purebloods have and killed himself accidentally on purpose."

BOOM! no more year 5. Fudge might take that chance to get behind a Harry who brought news of a re-killed Voldemort and evidence of a bunch of Death Eaters. In front of all of those witnesses.
