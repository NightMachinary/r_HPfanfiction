I remember from when I read HPMOR that the author talked about what was sufficient for people to form groups that were in opposition. Apparently the study suggested that group formation was, in itself, sufficient.

Now... I spent thirteen years going to schools with house structures and I can honestly say I don't think anyone cared overly much, with the exception of sports days and, at primary school, the end of term where the winning house got chocolates (Freddo Frogs, when my house frequently won anyway). But, then, these weren't boarding schools with five years of house-based classes. So... perhaps the result mentioned in the study that my memory of HPMOR says exists would hold out.

But, then, you've got to remember that Hogwarts is a small school in a really small society. People would rapidly learn peoples' personalities anyway (unless they were like Harry who I've come to see as having a particularly small circle of friends). So I'm not entirely sure we'd see anything overly different. It's really just Harry, his father and Hagrid who seem to have particularly strong dislikes of Slytherin as a whole. Possibly also Ron but I can only think of Epilogue!Ron. The Slytherins we meet who seem to intensely dislike Gryffindor... well, that's the least of their issues.
