I always thought that each house once had their own tower (the astronomy tower, the divination classroom etc.) but over the decades since Hogwarts was built some of these got destroyed in wars and what have you and students were relocated elsewhere temporarily, which became permenant later when money or ability couldn't be found to move them back. It makes sense that the Slytherin common room was originally the actual dungeons or similar and the Hufflepuff was where the house elves (or possibly originally the servants) stayed, especially since both of these common rooms aren't guarded by portraits like the other two.
