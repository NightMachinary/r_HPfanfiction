I remember reading a discussion or prompt once that suggested every student get sorted every year. Now, maybe after spending a year in one house you'd be disinclined to switch, but I think given some of the wild happenings in Harry's years, it's entirely possible that students might grow away from their original/previous house and get resorted into another one. I think that could help house unity more than anything, because you'd still have your friends even if they were outside your house.
