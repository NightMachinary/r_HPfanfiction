They weren't random - they were what the Founders supposedly idolised, no? That might be fanon, but I'm at least mildly sure the traits of the Houses were supposedly what the Founders wanted them to be.

And either way, they do kind of span the gamut of needed 'traits' for their world - you have cunning in the typically Pureblood house, so the Old Money politicians and upper management have the ability to hobnob and manipulate; you have bravery for Aurors and Law Enforcement types; Hard work for general staff; and intellectualism for the Researchers. That's basically all the jobs the Wizarding World has and the main traits you need to succeed in each realm of work.
