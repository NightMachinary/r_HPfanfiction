Sure, but it's basic indoctrination. Seven years of that reinforcement of conformity can be very, very effective. Big stuff might change a Hogwarts student after they graduate, but it's perfectly possible that they might continue that momentum throughout their lives, no?

I'm not saying it's absolute, to be clear - there is literally an exception to every rule - but it's quite likely someone who was 'raised Ravenclaw', so to speak, would remain that way. If your family is a particular religion, you're likely to be a particular religion; if your family is abusive, you're likely to be abusive; etc. Patterns do prevail - otherwise nobody would bother with Psychology or Sociology. :)
