The relevant idea, I think, is that the Hat sorts in the Founders' image. So take the Hat away: Without it, a group of kids is presented to four people, each of which pick the ones they want to teach and raise. Of course by and large, those children will then follow the values they have thus been raised with, after seven years; in fact, if they don't, they arguably were a bad pick. They are -- and are supposed to be -- disciples of the Founder they apprenticed to.

The Hat does the same thing; it picks you for the House whose Founder would have wanted you. Your house then becomes your family, and if you weren't already, you become what you were sorted into.

I dunno that there's much wrong with that, tbh. Usually, your influence on what kind of family you have is zero. Here, it's a lot more than that, even if you only get the choice once.

The /only/ thing that's a problem is when there is not enough appreciation and tolerance for the respective other three Houses, that is, their traditions, values and ideals.
