I mean, that's kind of half the point of education. You're indoctrinating children into becoming what society needs them to be - it's called Primary and Secondary Socialisation. You teach the values you want the children to have and the behaviours you need them to have. The skill-building for work purposes is a function of the behavioural training. Good members of society are good at their work, etc.
