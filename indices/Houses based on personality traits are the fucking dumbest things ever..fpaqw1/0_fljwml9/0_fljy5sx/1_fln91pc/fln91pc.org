Tru dat. Though, someone could make an alternate argument that it just takes your wishes into account when it needs to make the numbers in each house more even, or when you fit requirements for more than one - ie. It won't sort someone into Hufflepuff if they have no Loyalty, but if they have Loyalty and Intellect, then it'd let them choose - and I'm sure there'd be direct or interpreted evidence in canon to make it seem viable.

Plenty of room in the fandom for every pet theory. :)
