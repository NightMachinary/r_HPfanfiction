I think Neville and Hermione should indicate that the most, honestly - if you take the personality aspect seriously at least. Because Hermione's defining characteristics should /really/ put her into Ravenclaw and Neville into Hufflepuff, if we're taking them at face value - and doubly so at their starting point in the series.
