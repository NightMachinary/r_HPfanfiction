I always thought it was the old 'You're sorted based on the attributes you value, not the attributes you have'. The idea being that you'd grow into what you wanted to be, surrounded by people who valued similar things to you. Not that that would be any better, but it's how I always saw it. The Hat is a thousand years old (possibly-ish) and only gets brought out once a year - chances are there's a lot of misconceptions about what it does.
