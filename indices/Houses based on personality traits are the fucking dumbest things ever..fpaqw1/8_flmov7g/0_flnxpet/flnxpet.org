  People mock Hufflepuff because Helga said she will 'take the rest' but they are too invested in their own house to realize that she was the most sane, responsible and mature of the Founders. She knew from the start what a shit idea the House system was and what problems it will bring, so she did her best to make hers the most open and unifying it could be.
