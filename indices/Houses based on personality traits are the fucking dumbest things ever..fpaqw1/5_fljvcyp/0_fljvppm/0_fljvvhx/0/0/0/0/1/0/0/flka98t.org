Their prayers had the "in jesus' name we pray" thing, along with other Christian phrases.

They had a small church on campus and would sometimes take us there for whatever - I don't know about those, I always bunked.

We had school assemblies on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. They started with prayer songs sung by a choir - they were christian definitely. I remember stuff like Silent night and Sing Hallelujah.

The Chaplin of that church would give speeches once a week during these assemblies, although I don't remember those to be religious, they were more random snippets of his life experiences or other stories.

At the end of these assemblies, the national anthem would be sung and we'd disperse. The whole thing took about 15-20 minutes.

  Did they have functions for festivals of other religions like Diwali and Eid?

Nope, nothing for either of these, or anything not Christian. There were special assemblies before Christmas exams as christmas celebrations, but they usually happened in late November.

As for how the schools themselves were like...most students (at least the ones in my social circle) didn't care for most of these things, and most teachers didn't either. They just paid token respect towards these things and went about their days.

Not sure what my old school is like right now - it's been over a decade since I graduated.
