As far as I am aware they were not religious. We never called the one we prayed to anything but God. On some days we prayed to our parents. Every day we would finish with our National Anthem.

On some days there were functions after the prayer but before the anthem. They covered a wide variety of events and festivals ranging from Earth Day to local festivals and spreading knowledge about Cancer, AIDS and the like.

In some schools the organization of these events were class based. Every class was given a topic or event to conduct the assembly on and then the students along with the help of a teacher organized, conducted and performed poems, Plays, Speeches and the like.

In some of the other schools each of the house was given responsibility to organize the assemblies for a period of time and any event that happens in that time was their responsibility.
