In one my schools we were assigned roll numbers based on the alphabetical order of our name and then the first x amount the next y amount and the like were assigned houses. There were 4 houses.

Another school I attended every 4^{th} student was assigned to a house and it did not matter at all. Except for who is going to be responsible for the morning prayers and some inter house competitions it did not matter at all.
