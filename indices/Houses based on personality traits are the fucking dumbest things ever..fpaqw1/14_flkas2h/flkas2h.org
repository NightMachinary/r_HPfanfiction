The problem is that each personality traits have been pushed to their extreme. And that render it absurd because in extremal version they can only divide. But it is the entirety of the Britain social system that is creating a divide by blood status and political alignement. Even the pairing in the fandom reflects it by their statistics: Harry is always paired with someone from a light or neutral family. Never paired with someone with political aims that contradict those of the BWL. Your life is decided by this. The Light heir go to Gryffindor or in a extremal case Ravenclaw. The Neutral will go to Ravenclaw or Slytherin, with Very rare exception to the two others. And the Dark will go Ravenclaw or Slytherin. And the blood caries the personality trait so Harry will go to Gryffindor even if he wasn't raised by his Gryffindor parents. But I do think the sorting by personality traits possessed or to be developed is a good one. But it is the social divide of Magical Britain the problem.
