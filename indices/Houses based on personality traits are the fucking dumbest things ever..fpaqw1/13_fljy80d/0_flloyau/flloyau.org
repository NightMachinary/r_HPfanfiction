I like this idea :) it'll have to twist how the houses came to be in the first place:

/Said Hufflepuff, "I'll teach them first, introduce wizard traditions."/

/Said Slytherin, "I'll show them next the right path to their ambitions."/

/Said Gryffindor, "I'll teach the older to be chivalrous and daring."/

/Said Ravenclaw, "I'll teach the eldest, for their real life preparing."/
