I think sorted by years makes more sense.

Years 1 & 2 in Hufflepuff so they can be closest to classes/great hall/kitchens. So the firsties can have help from kids who were just in their same position (and not be intimated by upper classmen).

Years 3 & 4 in Slytherin.

Years 5 & 6 in Gryffindor.

Year 7 in Ravenclaw for more study areas and less people to distract them during NEWT levels.

The name of the houses could change as it truly wouldn't matter, I'm just saying where their dorms would be.
