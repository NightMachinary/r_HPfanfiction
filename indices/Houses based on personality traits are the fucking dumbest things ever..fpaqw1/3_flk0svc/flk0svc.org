Have you ever been to a summer camp, or any sports competition in school where kids are divided into teams where they have to pick a name and a color? Hell, /have you seen Pokemon GO????/

"Team Mystic is for smart people who value strategy" /no/, Team Mystic is for /people who like blue/. The end.

When you put people into different groups, even arbitrarily, they naturally ascribe personality, habits, traits, to each group, while defending /their/ traits as superior to others'.

It's our tribe mentality, people are just Like That.
