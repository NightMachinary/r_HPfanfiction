I suspect the Hat sorts based on the culture of the house already in place, and how well the kid will do there. I know Hufflepuff House is said to be kind and loyal and such, but that's not strictly speaking the reason people are sorted there. Hufflepuff said she would take anyone the others didn't want. She saw value in them; SHE was kind, but her students weren't necessarily. Someone who was cruel, unambitious, cowardly, and dumb would still go to Hufflepuff, and would hopefully emerge at least as someone KIND, unambitious, cowardly, and dumb.

On another note, there's a really good essay here on the founding of Hogwarts and the origin of the House system. Basically the Sorting once actually made sense.
