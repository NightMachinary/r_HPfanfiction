I'll take some free publicity (hopefully) also, I hope the links work, it's been really hit or miss for me lately.

The first is a completed Harry in Slytherin story that covers his first year. It has 1k followers, and seems to be pretty popular. There are some grammatical errors in this one, but it is my most popular. I am currently revising it, as book 2 is coming out in a few months; but I haven't had too much time to truly commit to editing.

The second is another Harry in Slytherin story, though a different series where he is darker than the first. It's a WIP but is updated weekly and will cover his first year.

The third is a Harry/Gabrielle set in fourth year. It's 80k words in though nowhere near compete. It's updated at least every few weeks, though school has made it hard lately.

The fourth is surprinsly my most popular if you base it off of per chapters numbers. It's going to be an eventual Harry/Narcissa and is set where Harry time travels back to the Marauders era in a last ditch effort to beat Voldemort, as his side was about to lose the war.

The fifth is a Harry/Delphini story set in HBP where they are the same age. It's kind of updated whenever I have time, and is definitely more of a side project.

The sixth is a controversial one that has gotten more hate than any other, because of one particular scene. It's a response to a challenge and is definitely the bottom of my priorities, though I do intend on seeing it through. It will be an eventual Harry/Astoria and is a WBWL story.
