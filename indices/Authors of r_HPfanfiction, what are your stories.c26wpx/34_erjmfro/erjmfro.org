I wrote a memey comedy where Harry grows up watching anime and leaves for Hogwarts as a weeb. (That was almost 2 years ago. /Damn/.)

So let me tell you about this Harry. His wand has a rare and powerful core, and he owns a cool enchanted trunk. He communicates well with animals (or at least half-Kneazles). Thanks to a goblin inheritance test, he's a confirmed descendant of Gryffindor. His animagus form is so rare it shocked everyone, and his patronus has unique traits that he employs in duels. Basically, he's a total badass.
