I shamelessly promote this on a regular basis -- the Chessmaster series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn), is mine.

Essentially this fic started with me wanting to give Ron a deeper characterization and play around with politics. It features Harry, Ron, and Hermione all in Slytherin, politics, a splash of world building, and a savvier Voldemort.
