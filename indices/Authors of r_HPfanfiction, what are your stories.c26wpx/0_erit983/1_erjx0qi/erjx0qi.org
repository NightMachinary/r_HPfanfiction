You're on my list to start reading, you've actually been on it for a bit, I'm so sorry. Hopefully I can find the team to read some.

Tangent: You know what's weird? I actually read MORE fanfiction when we had a newborn. She'd get up all hours of the night and I'd get up with her, and reading fanfiction is usually what I did. Now that she sleeps through the night, I find myself gravitating back to long-neglected books or watching more TV. I'll have to make a better effort to read more of you all, cuz it's some really good work.
