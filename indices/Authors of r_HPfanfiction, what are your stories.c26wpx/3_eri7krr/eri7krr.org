Since I shamelessly promote it on a regular basis, I imagine most people here will already be familiar with Victoria Potter linkffn(12713828).

So to "add value" I'll briefly describe my broad plans for the story and how they have evolved.

Victoria Potter started as a rewrite of my previous fem!Harry story, which I abandoned after it reached the end of first year. The principal premise of that story had been to depict the development of a top-tier witch and so it featured a lot of magical theory, but by the time I had finished writing first year I realised I wanted to tell a proper story, not just a magical theory sandbox. There was a laundry list of things I disliked about the previous version: the characters were too mature too fast, the themes were too dark, the main character too unlikeable, the world too AU, the magical theory too dry in presentation, and there was very little in the way of plot other than drama.

So I set about rewriting it to correct those errors. I inserted more plot, albeit with stakes more age-appropriate than canon. I tried to make the main character more sympathetic, though certain characteristics have carried over. I endeavoured to show magic in use rather than simply in textbooks. I made the world closer to canon, but still with lots of additional details or little differences, with the aim of recalling the feeling of first reading the HP books and falling in love with the world. And I made the tone of the fic much more lighthearted, especially in first year, with the aim of having the tone develop with the characters.

Victoria Potter very quickly took on a life of its own and has diverged from my previous fem!Harry fic to the point that they in fact bear very little resemblance to each other. In particular, I have progressively beefed up the plot elements. My original plan had been to get through years 1-3 quite quickly, almost like an extended prologue to the more detailed years 4-7, but I quickly realised that you can't have three years of just worldbuilding and character interactions.

So year 2 is now more or less a full mystery story in the style of canon books 1-3, and year 3 will follow the same approach. That said, I am still trying to keep years 1-3 pretty concise, again taking my lead from the length of canon books 1-3.
