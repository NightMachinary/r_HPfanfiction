I'm a femslash author who has only just finished my first HP story which was for the LJ Femmefest fic exchange. The story focuses on Hermione's post-war life, where she has spent her time at the Ministry busying herself fixing the problems she sees in the world around her so she can ignore her own. That is until she is forced to work Millicent Bulstrode on her latest project. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18701941/chapters/44355004]])

I also have a few unpublished wips. One about the Gryffindor chasers Angelina, Alicia and Katie and their lives leading up to the battle of Hogwarts. The other is a Ginny/Pansy story set during the 7th book in which Pansy is forced to broker a deal with the DA.
