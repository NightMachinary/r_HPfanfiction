My fic is linkffn(Hope and Healing)

Hopefully that works, I'm on mobile. Ive got decent traffic on FFN, dunno if anybody in the subreddit follows it. I promise it's not dead. I'm sitting in a hammock right now working on it. Life between last post and about a month ago just kicked me in the ass, and I haven't had the time or desire to knock out more. But I'm making headway now. Woo!
