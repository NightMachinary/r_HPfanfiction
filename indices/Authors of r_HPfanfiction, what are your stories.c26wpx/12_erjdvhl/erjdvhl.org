I've written a few crossovers for Harry Potter.

Written prior to the reveal that Ahsoka Tano had survived Order 66 is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]] where ancient tech malfunctions when hit with a Stormtrooper EMP grenade and dumps Ahsoka in the Cupboard Under The Stairs, where she meets (and decides to adopt) a four-year-old Harry Potter.

The other main crossover I've done is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][Last Mage of Krypton]] series ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Year 2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][Year 3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][Year 4]]) where Kal-El's pod landed in the Potter's garden just after Lily miscarried due to a curse cast on her by a Death Eater. Kal-El was promptly blood-adopted and raised as Harry Potter, having been /born/*/e/* to them at just the right time.

The *e* at the end of the word Born is important here, as the most common letter in the English language is a huge plot point.

Finally, I have a file for my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/1/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][random ideas]].
