I'm writting some Lily/James stories at the moment.

The Best ( linkffn(The Best by schak) ) is a pure fluff fic how James over the years fell in love with Lily. It is short and sweet.

Lily Bud ( linkffn(Lily Bud by schak) ) is a sister story to The Best. from time to time we see things that happend in The Best, but now out of Lily's perspective. It is a lot more in detail and deals with all of Lily's important relationships, be it with friends, family, lovers, allies and enemies. I started to write this story, because I realized that after reading the Prince's Tale, I lost a lot of sympthy and respect not only for Snape, but Lily as well and this was me thinking myself into a child and teenager that had to grow up in a war about her right to live and that only ever knew a magical world at peace in the stories of another child.

I tried to let her grow up and evolve along her different relationships
