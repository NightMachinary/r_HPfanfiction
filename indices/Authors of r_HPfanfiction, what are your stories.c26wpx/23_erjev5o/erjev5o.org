I wrote a post-Azkaban Sirius/OC romance and a sequel, a couple of auror Harry stories (one of which was a Cursed Child fic) and several one-shots. I finished all of them but nothing ever got much attention which was discouraging and I never worked out why people didn't like them. I don't write fanfiction anymore.
