" In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy. "

Since I am a Swedish person I thought it would be fun to write a story that Swedish wizards and witches could attend and in canon that would be Durmstrang. This story follows the current canon very closely and incorporates features from both books, movies, and Pottermore.
