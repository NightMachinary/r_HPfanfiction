My main fic is Mercy for the Prince, an AU exploring what might happen if Regulus had survived The Cave and gone into hiding, only to return to London after hearing rumours that the Dark Lord might not be entirely dead. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19191973/chapters/45623269][https://archiveofourown.org/works/19191973]])

And I'm also starting to post some ficlets and shorter stories about Regulus's earlier life, his childhood and Hogwarts years and the events leading up to his defection from the Death Eaters. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19268923]])
