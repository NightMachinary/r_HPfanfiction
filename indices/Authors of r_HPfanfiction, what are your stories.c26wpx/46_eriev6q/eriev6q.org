I'm working on a story right now, wanna get a few chapters written before I start posting it. It's the wrong boy who lived trope but it's pretty much told from James, who is cursed to remain invisible. Feeling like a shit father to Harry he seeks him out and watches him and gets a lot of feels when it comes to the younger of two twins - even if he is sorted to Slytherin.

He has limited time to wonder why he is invisible and how it he can fix, all he knows is he has to fix it. Protect his family. And be a better father in the end somehow.
