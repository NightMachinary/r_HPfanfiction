I think my most “popular” story is How to Charm a Witch. It's a short rom-com next gen story following Colin Longbottom (OC son of Neville and Hannah) as he tries to woe Lily Luna Potter. Its complete. Linkffn(11203193)

My current project is Damsel in Defiance. It's only three chapters in and I'm playing around with doing a Lord Potter trope but with a female Harry Potter. I'm also working on extending the Potter family in it. Grandparents are Fleamont and Euphemia, Charlus is great-uncle (brother to Fleamont) who has a son/grandchildren and then there's also a great-aunt and her line. Mostly me having fun with it. Slow updates (probably once a month or so). Linkffn(13248342)

Other stories include some oneshots (Roses are Red, Fallen Stars, Blood for Blood) and some unfinished multi-chapters that I lost interest in.
