Since it's still in progress, both for posting and writing, I don't want to give away too much but there's a bunch of dead people coming back well after the war ended, and unlike most resurrection fics I've seen it's not all sunshine and rainbows and good guys reuniting in this one. Canon compliant up till the dead return, including all Epilogue compliant couples and kids.
