The fic I'm most proud of is a mystery story about a private investigator Harry who goes undercover as a Hogwarts Divination Professor to investigate a case of a missing student, but this sub won't appreciate the pairing, so take a look at this comedy time-travel one-shot instead. linkao3(16999125)

It stars, among many other things, teenage Lockhart with a 70's perm, Snape brewing drugs, hopeless romantic Regulus, Narcissa who has her priorities straight and, of course, Harry who's just trying to stay sane at this point.

Edit: I've always known the bot hates me. Here's the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16999125]]
