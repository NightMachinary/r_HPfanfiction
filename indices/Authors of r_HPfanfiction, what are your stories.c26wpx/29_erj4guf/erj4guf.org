Currently I'm working on Dark Savior linkffn(13160197) it's a Batman/HP crossover. First time I've ever done anything in the DC universe been reading them for years. However, never got the exact elements I wanted with it so just decided to write what I wanted.

I've done several Once Upon a Time/HP crossovers but they're all currently on Hiatus.

Also have one experimental crossover with Sarah J Maas's A Court of Thorn and Roses called Heir of Stars and Shadows linkffn(13159585) that I'm working on as well. The reviews for that one are sort of dismal though, so it really hasn't been my primary focus
