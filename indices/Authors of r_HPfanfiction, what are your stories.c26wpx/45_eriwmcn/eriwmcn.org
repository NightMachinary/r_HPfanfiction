I'm working on my first HP story; a Snape-centric fic right now but it's not complete. I've got a title but it may change because I vaguely recall seeing a fic with a similar title.

Snape Chronicles: Reflections and Redemptions

Summary: The end was only the beginning for Severus Snape. After that, there is a clarity to be found and one can see things as they really are, not how one imagined them to be.

There also may be a sequel and possibly a companion piece. I need to get further with the outline for the second story so as to not leave plot holes in the first. If it doesn't work out this story will need a re-write. My hold up is I lost my beta, so if anyone could point me in the direction of a Britpicker that would be appreciated.
