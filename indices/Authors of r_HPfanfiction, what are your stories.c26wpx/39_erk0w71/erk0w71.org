I'm currently rewriting and expanding things I wrote years ago. I suppose I'm doing it the odd way by writing three simultaneously. Currently I've got two at 100% done; two at about 60% and one at about 5%.

Brief Precis.

- The main character is a Slytherin girl in the same year as the Twins. So about three years older than the Trio. She is a half-blood who is familiar and comfortable with the Muggle world, and indeed prefers it in many ways. Yet I've done my best to make her an absolutely dyed-in-the-wool Slytherin; the hat did not make a mistake.

- The whole thing is written as a faux-memoir. "Written" about now and looking back on events of about 30 years ago. If I'm honest, the series falls squarely into the category that TV-Tropes calls "First-Person Smartass".

- Harry is /strictly/ an unseen character. But lots of canon-characters get walk-ins as and when appropriate. The standouts are the Twins and I make a great deal of use of them - she and they have quite the grudging-respect, best of frenemies thing going on. The stories as a whole are completely canon-compliant.

- A couple of the stories are set in Hogwarts. But much of it is her post-Hogwarts career, running concurrently with the events of the canon-books.

I've not really posted anything as the writing process is sufficiently slow that I don't want to put up completed ones and have a huge delay for before subsequent ones go up. Which is actually hugely presumptive on my part, as I'm assuming people would want to read subsequent instalments.

But if anybody's up for beta-ing, or offering feedback, I'd be happy to send it their way. PM me.
