My only fic right now is linkffn(Figure in Gray by Erebus1999) which is kind of like Ebenbild's /Basilisk-born/ in that it will have a little bit of everything once I get it going good. I have plot-bunnies written down for one or two more, and I may throw some one shots in though.

All of that said, as of today /Figure in Gray/ has only a prologue and chapter one. I have the second chapter laid out, but I have to sit down and just hammer out like 7k words then edit it all. As I'm not a fast writer by any means, that takes far longer than it really should. Also, despite it being the summer (which means I'm out of college) I'm still constantly doing stuff that keeps me away from my Craptop and not writing.

Enough ranting though. Cheers all
