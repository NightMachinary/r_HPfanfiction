Pretty much all of my fic is slash and Snape-centric, so I'll spare the sub by not linking them, but so far the pairings are Snape/Harry, Snape/Albus, and Snape/Aberforth. There's one short Remix fic about Regulus, which is gen, and an ambiguous pre-slash fic that concentrates on Eileen Snape and her thoughts about her son. I've also got an upcoming Snape/Minerva fic that focuses on Snape's year as headmaster and the fallout from that, if I can just find time to polish the damn thing and get it posted.
