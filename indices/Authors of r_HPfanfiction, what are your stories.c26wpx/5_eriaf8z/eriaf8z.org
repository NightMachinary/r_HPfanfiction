Like good old Taure, I am compelled to first point out that I promote it all the sodding time, so apologies to anyone who's getting sick of hearing me prattle about it, but, look, it fits a lot of requests. I may have been hanging around this sub too long. But hey, knowing the wants of one's target audience is a good thing, innit?

The story's linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) and is an in-progress 7-year AU with a single point of departure: Hermione was born a Parselmouth, and discovered it at quite an early age. She grows up with a very different outlook on the world and a firm dedication to the cause of sentient nonhumans. A wrench is thrown in the stations of canon and hijinx ensue.
