!linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting)

A humour heavy (but still serious, I swear) fic that sorts around half of the student population into different houses. It focuses a lot of the broader cast of students, though a lot of focus is given the the Slytherin students (which now include Harry, Hermione, Parvati, and Lisa). Pretty much everyone ends up in a different friend group, and I've done my best to avoid recycling of canon material. I'm about halfway through year 1 at this point (I only started publishing in April, and I've been writing the fic live). I also just recently hit 1k follows.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

My contribution to the appalingly low number of HP/f!TR fics. fem!Riddle finds the horcrux in Harry's scar in the chamber, and decides that possessing him would be much more discreet that absorbing Ginny's soul. Unfortunately, Lily's protection is still active, so she's stuck inside his head, unable to possess him and unable to escape, but able to control his body for brief stints of time and feed him information. It's still in its early phases.
