My most recently updated story is a Peggy-Sue time-travel centering around Severus Snape, but includes a few other time travelers as well. It's called "They Didn't Know We Were Seeds" linkffn(12386916).

My other on-going fic is a next-gen one of an AU series I have where Severus Snape has a little sister. The story is about the sister's son, named in honor of Severus, and is about him grappling with who his absentee father is and with his relationship with his half-brothers. The fic is called "Always Gold" linkffn(13013418).

I've also recently wrapped up a Sirius and Severus adventure, enemies to friend AU fanfic where they end up in the middle of an unknown woods after a duel gone wrong in Hogsmeade. That one's called "Boy-Snape" linkffn(13131947).
