I've got three ongoing stories and a crossover in progress, each of which has a different feel - necessary, or else I'd go nuts by this point.

My big ongoing story is Harry Potter, et al, and the Keystone Council. I had the idea of writing a fic in the HP space, but could not nail down what sort of story to write. A Harry whose father lived? A female Harry sorted into Slytherin? A Ravenclaw harry who was raised by the Goblins, but with a witch as a foster mother? Maybe the female gryffindor twin of a deceased Harry?

In the end, I did all four, plus a canon version for fun. Each can hear thoughts from the others, and the five - together - have to navigate their lives. With five worlds, I get to pepper in subtle changes here and there, such as one world where the Headmistress is a female Albus dumbledore. Blending the worlds together has been an absolute delight, and I'm thrilled that the story has been received so well.

The fiftieth chapter just went up a few days ago. Enjoy. linkffn(12979337)

Who Dares Wins is a twin fic, sort of, where a more military/pragmatic Harry goes into the battle of the Ministry ready for a fight, and ends up winning handily. The bigger surprise, however, is that his parents show up to help protect him while his twin brother fights Voldemort in the atrium. The Potters came out of hiding expecting canon!Harry, and instead get a powerful and confident Lord Potter who has a plan and allies. Started as a one-shot, but the reception was good enough to convince me to keep going, with thirteen chapters up as of today. linkffn(13182638)

The Prisoners' Tale is much lighter, and focuses on the growing relationship between a Harry Potter who died on Halloween 1981 (but whose soul latched onto Voldemort's, and who later subverted the ritual in the graveyard to resurrect himself instead of the Dark Lord) and a restored Nagini. I'm proud of it, though it's only a few chapters in, as it seems to be the only ongoing Harry/Lady!Nagini story I can find on ffn. linkffn(13107553)
