I've written a few fics, but haven't written anything since last December.

My greatest accomplishment by far is finishing my 12 year WIP which I thought I would never get done.

Linkffn(imprisoned realm by lovehp)

My favourite will always be linkffn(food for thought by lovehp) just because I loved writing Snape and the tension created between Harry and himself over a pretty mandane thing.

I love writing about the darker and sinister side of the wizarding world and exploring the emotions and trauma that it invokes in the characters. So many of my fics portray some pretty hellish scenes and characterisations as well as development.
