I've only recently begun to start posting my fics, so I only have 2 on AO3 so far.

My very first one is The Flame's Shadow, which is really a Fantastic Beasts fic with a Percival Graves/ Credence Barebone pairing, but hey, it was the the first work I was really proud of. It's a 3-shot, and doesn't take more than 10 minutes to read. Basically a short story on Graves and Credence told from Credence's POV, and it ends on an angsty note.

My second one is Eggs, which is a oneshot, told from George Weasley's perspective at the end of the war. Basically deals with PTSD, trauma and all that-- or at least I try to, in the most respectful way I can. Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18547381]]

I have a few fics planned on the way, but I'm not sure if they'll ever come to fruition, lol. I plan to write more Gravebone fics, and maybe one about Tom Riddle, American Psycho style. I've been thinking about writing a longer story about Hedwig's namesake, but short stories are my thing so I'm not too sure about that too.
