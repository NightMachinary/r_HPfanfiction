The latter, definitely. This is a hobby for me, and not one that I'm especially skilled at.

It's a 'labor of love' as they say and I want to enjoy it, not frustrate myself by trying to stick to a schedule.

That said I'm a reader as well and can understand how annoying it is for something to sit without an update for months at a time, so I'll do my best not to do that often.
