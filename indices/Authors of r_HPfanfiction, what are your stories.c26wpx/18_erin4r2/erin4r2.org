I just published the first chapter yesterday, and its the first one I've writen in years, but here it is. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13314554/1/What-If]])

It's a James/Lily fic, but I am essentially trying to rewrite their story with Lily and Snape in different houses. I wanted to explore how this would effect Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
