The things worth mentioning that I can link:

linkffn(Retroactive by wordhammer) - a nearly canon-compliant short story about Harry and Luna hijacking the Time Turners at the end of the Ministry battle in order to change the outcome. It's funny, includes some nice world-building info and good characterizations. Bittersweet ending nearly ruins it for most readers.

linkffn(Wordhammer's Mad Ideas) - a collection of story stubs, but the real value comes from the 1st, 3rd and 6th chapters, about Harry trying to use a Dementor to destroy the locket horcrux. As Harry says to Ron, "Things didn't go as planned. Are you really surprised by that?"

linkao3(Ruminations on the Wizarding World by wordhammer) not a story so much as essays about my Potterverse headcanon and alternate ideas.
