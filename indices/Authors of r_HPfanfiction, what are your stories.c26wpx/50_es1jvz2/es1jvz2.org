I just finished a short story. I started writing it as a requested Lupin/Tonks fluff piece--a challenge for me bc I'm not very fond of that pairing nor the genre. I like thrillers, dystopian, and mystery; romance and fluff aren't really my thing. But I wanted to try it. I had more fun writing it than I thought. I think its fluffy, but I sent it to the person who requested it and they never responded lol. linkao3(Drive By by LadyBaltimore)
