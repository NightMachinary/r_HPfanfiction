Not sure what you mean by important, but I know a few fics that don't turn out the way you might expect from the summary.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317236][Unmasked]] by Cherry Bear. /At night, when he thinks she's asleep, Harry sneaks out./

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=332055][Room]] by peppersweet. Hermione finds the diadem in the Room of Requirement. /The room always provides./

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268385][Hardboiled]] by RonsGirlFriday. This one's just a funny plot twist. /Ron Weasley stars as a hardboiled private eye hired to find the missing husband of a beautiful and mysterious client./
