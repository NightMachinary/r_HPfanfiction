In a way I agree with the majority about Ron maturing and becoming the man he is at the end of Deathly Hallows, but I'm also unsure about the latter part of that statement. What we saw with Fred's death in DH was that it changed all the Weasley's at a base level. That was a sibling who'd been with them for most of their lives. It was his death that really caused a change in Percy's behaviour, let's not forget that it was in the immediate aftermath of it that he charged in to duel Rookwood without a second's though... A move that could very well have gotten him killed.

But in my mind, killing off their father would've had a much more devastating effect on all of them. A man who'd been there through thick and thin, not judging any of his children, loving them unconditionally. Also the one seen as the lenient and the voice of reason parent, his care and relaxed presence would be one that would be missed straight away. It's entirely likely that his children would become imbued with a greater fervour to join the fight against Voldemort... Whereas his wife would fall apart and find herself increasingly estranged from her children as they tried to go against her in joining the order. There's plenty of what if scenarios that would play out because of this.

1.  Percy could be redeemed to his family much earlier in this case. The flipside is that he's too ashamed to return and would feel an amount of guilt, seeing his lack of belief in his family's claim of Voldemort's return as a contributing factor to his father's death. The third option is that he attempted to return but would be spurned by the other members of the family for not being there for their father when he was most needed... or viewed as a spy following the entire ministry debacle. There's endless possibilities for the Percy's relationship with his family here.
2.  I always feel that with the death of someone so close in any form of fiction that there's the possibility for one of the family members to go dark. By that I don't mean they drink the Death Eater kool aid and switch sides, but they change from the person they used to be into a whole different kind of person. I believe some Harry Potter fanfic writers refer to this as "unleashing their inner Slytherin" and using any means to secure personal victory.
3.  Mentioned it in passing, but I'll say it again. Mrs Weasley would almost certainly become more protective of her children and try to keep them out of the order. Her fear of losing anyone else would win out. But this, in itself, could potentially be seen as a betrayal of her children (in their eyes) and inadvertently push them further away.
4.  The state of the Weasley family's financial situation would be hit extremely hard. The loss of the primary source of income could cause them to lose their home.
5.  Charlie could be forced to return to England for the funeral and then seek a job nearer to support his family.
6.  The effect of their father's death on the Weasley twins could take the wind out of the sales of their joke shop idea and they could decide to drop it entirely.
7.  Bill and Fleur's relationship and eventual marriage could be stepped up or dropped due to the additional strain on Bill as the oldest male Weasley.
8.  Ginny and Harry's friendship to relationship could also either be accelerated or forgotten in this scenario. Harry comforting her could lead to their closer friendship and potentially a romance much sooner than was seen in HBP, but there's also the scope for Harry's guilt taking hold of him and deciding to not get close to anyone else in an attempt to not cause them anymore pain.
9.  Harry's reaction would almost certainly be one of grief and guilt at not doing more. I'm also fairly certain he'd try to distance himself from the Weasley's and Hermione as a whole. Determined not to be the cause of anymore death of anyone that he cares about.
10. Ron/Hermione could start a lot sooner in this case, but only if Ron matured and changed into the man he became at the end of DH. Both factors of that personality would be required for a lasting romance between them.

Edit: Oh and the big thing I forgot to mention is that I feel that JKR would've still have killed off Sirius eventually... Just probably in either a more dramatic or cheapened way. Like him saving Harry from an Avada Kedavra thrown by Voldemort or dying along with Lupin and Tonks off-screen.
