Well said. I know Rowling canceled Arthur's death because she felt like he was losing too many father figures throughout the series, but I really feel like she should have kept this one (I agree Sirius' death seemed inevitable but she could have traded out Arthur for Lupin). For one thing, I find it entirely unbelievable that a family of 9--as in the thick of it as they were--only lost one person. But for another, it absolutely would have been the appropriate catalyst for so many things I felt were poorly handled in canon;

1. The cheap, last minute redemption of Percy's story arc.
2. It would give a more realistic build up of the Harry/Ginny storyline.
3. I'd def hope for a matured Ron. It would make the Ron/Hermione angle palatable.

And the thing about Charlie is a good point. It would have been great to see him reeled into the story instead of being this vague Weasley galavanting about Romania.
