Well Harry originally didn't even want Ron and Hermione to come, and they only came because they pretty much forced their way along. I imagine Sirius would want to go with Harry, but he has never been a part of Harry's adventures the way that Ron and Hermione have. He doesn't know all the details about the visions/link with Voldemort, the horcruxes, or have the same history with Harry that Ron and Hermione do. The only ones who can help him are them; I think this is obvious in the calculated objects that Dumbledore leaves for them. Sirius is an important part of Harry's life, but doesn't fill the same role as his friends do.

Sirius is also much older, an escaped prisoner, suffering from depression and likely anxiety and PTSD from Azkaban. He is also risky, and he encourages Harry into riskier positions by conflating Harry with James. He's just not physically, mentally, and emotionally stable enough to not be a burden and liability for the group.

There's also the fact that even though Sirius is a big kid, he's also an adult and authority figure. The trio distanced themselves from authority figures, because they need autonomy in order to properly deal with the situation. They need to be able to make the decisions themselves about what and where the next move is. Overall, Harry is in charge, and I don't think Sirius would fit into this power dynamic smoothly. This is also part of the reason that they didn't let Remus come along (as well as the Tonks and Teddy complications).
