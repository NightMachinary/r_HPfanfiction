Lots of ifs but some things seem likely/obvious...

- Harry would feel guilty because he couldn't stop it in Nagini
- Weasleys would be devastated emotionally and financially
- Ron would probably mature earlier and be more committed to ending Voldemort instead of being a prat for the last 2 books
- Voldemort might have been more successful possessing Harry if Sirius were alive

Rest is up in the air. Personally, I think Sirius would have died sooner or later.
