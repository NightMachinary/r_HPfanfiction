I think without a father figure Ron actually does the opposite of what people think here and grows more immature and bitter. His immaturity is highlighted in the last 2 or 3 books and while he remains loyal it doesn't stop him from having a short fuse and this is without the loss of a close relative until the 7th book. I couldn't imagine his mental state without having his father around.

In the sixth book when the whole finding out about Hermione kissing Krum situation happens I think Ron takes a huge hit to his pride and gives Hermione the cold shoulder(even worse than canon). Combine this with what happens in the 7th book during the whole Horcrux scene and I think Ron comes out to be a super bitter unlikeable character.
