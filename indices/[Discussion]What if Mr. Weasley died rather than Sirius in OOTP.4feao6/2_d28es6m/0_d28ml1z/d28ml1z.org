Ron is fiercely loyal, but he also seems to create and hold grudges easily and readily. If he feels he has been wronged, he gives people the cold shoulder for long periods of time before realizing he's being a git. There is a part of me that wonders if he would blame Harry for a period since he /was/ the snake. But, at the same time I could see him not blaming Harry because he does have moments of maturity and hnderstanding. Guess I am not convinced in either direction.
