Some quick thoughts in bullet points

- I agree with the majority and as indirectly stated by JKR, Ron would lose his immaturity and insensitivity.

- Mrs.Weasley she would probably more overprotective, after losing her twin brothers and now husband.

- Charlie would most likely permanently return to UK to help out his family.

- I think Percy's reaction is the more interesting one. Would he return out of grief, would he feel vindicated and angry at his father for supporting Dumbledore, would his shame prevent him to return to his family?

- Harry would feel guilty because he's Harry.

- Hermione would read a book about grief or something.

- I have no idea how Bill, the twins and Ginny would react though.
