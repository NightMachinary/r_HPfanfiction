Good point, though one could see the Death Eaters as the sworn retainers of Voldemort.

Though ending aside, I can see the Weasleys wanting revenge. They are a tight-knit, proud family (even Percy might come back sooner), the older members have already been fighting Voldemort as part of the Order, the younger members when they had to, and many of them have a temper. After the diary, this could be what pushes them into choosing a much more drastic course of action against the Death Eaters.
