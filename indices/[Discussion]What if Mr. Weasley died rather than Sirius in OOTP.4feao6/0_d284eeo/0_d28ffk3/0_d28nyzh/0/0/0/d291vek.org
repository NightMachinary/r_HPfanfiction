Thanks for taking the time to respond and for being so concise and polite.

Surely loyalty in itself is a redeeming feature? I know a lot of people argue that he's not that loyal because of his behaviour in Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows, but aren't they all overlooking that in the end he does come around? That the hardest thing for a jealous person to do is swallow their pride and seek forgiveness? Ron does both of these things and the second time he does this, he doesn't stray again. I mean, personally (and that's all this is really, my viewpoint on the Ron hate), I've always viewed him as the most human character in the story. He's neither super powerful, super intelligent nor stupid or even evil. He's got nothing that makes him stand out. He is average. But that's what makes him human. He's /that/ guy that we all know. The one who we go to school with, the average joe from work, hell, sometimes we even are that guy. In addition to this, I surmised part of the hate as stemming from this... That Ron from canon reminds people of themselves and as most of us know, the only person who's hated more than any other is one's self in their school days. It's a form of projection. But that's all my own analysis and theorising.

  In the movies, he is completely useless. His lines were given to Hermione, 90% of his actions were given to her, and he isnt "as cute" as Harry, draco, neville.

I don't like movie Ron for that first reason so I'll give you that one. But for the latter, people were already fans of Draco long before Tom Felton's face became his. I'll still argue that comparatively Ron > Draco. But yet in the bashing fics, Draco is usually (not always, but usually), held to a higher standard and seen as generally better than Ron.

  Plus, lets be honest here. Ron is extremely easy to bash because we have all had that friend that was jealous of something we had, and it ended our friendship. (if you have not, then you will have one eventually). Its a form of projection.

Again, I know what you're trying to say and I have had a friend like that. However my interpretation of Ron is that he's that best mate who thinks that staying up drinking before an exam is a great idea or the guy who has a crush on your ex/current crush and doesn't say anything about it. it's a point of contention, sure. But how a person deals with that is really up to them. Nine times out of ten you wouldn't really end a friendship based on those things alone. There's a fair bit of good to be considered along with the bad. No one is perfect.

  He served his purpose in the first half of the story. He should have been killed off/written off in the second half, allowing the main character to grow from the pain.

You see, that's something I can understand because I honestly felt that there was a vibe of that happening in Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix. When Neville was being introduced as more of a friend to Harry and developing him as a character. I actually thought that this was the moment when Ron would step back and though he'd be a friend of Harry's still he wouldn't be his best friend, necessarily. But that was when I first read it years ago. I suppose JKR just didn't want to expand or change the circle that fans had grown accustomed to.
