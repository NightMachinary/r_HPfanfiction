Ron has NONE of the qualities that Harry has to redeem himself. Harry can forgive even his relatives for over a decade of abuse. Ron can't even get over his jealousy without a life or death situation. Harry has an extremely strong sense of right and wrong. Ron just seems like a follower. Even in the books. Personally, I feel that JK wrote Ron to be a foil to Harry on the positive side, much like she wrote Malfoy to be. Ron is everything that Harry is, except amplified. If Harry is Lazy, Ron is lazier. If Harry over reacts, Ron explodes. Along with that, in honestly after fourth year, Ron is simply there for comedic relief. Ron does not give any new information after that, at least nothing that Hermione could not give, and he only serves a point of contention and "character drive" for Hermione.

The hatred from Ron stems from this, and from "Sakura Syndrome". In the movies, he is completely useless. His lines were given to Hermione, 90% of his actions were given to her, and he isnt "as cute" as Harry, draco, neville.

Plus, lets be honest here. Ron is extremely easy to bash because we have all had that friend that was jealous of something we had, and it ended our friendship. (if you have not, then you will have one eventually). Its a form of projection.

I dont hate Ron, nor do I like his character. I personally feel about him as I do about Sakura from Naruto. He served his purpose in the first half of the story. He should have been killed off/written off in the second half, allowing the main character to grow from the pain.
