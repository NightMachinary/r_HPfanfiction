You seem to be forgetting that Ron and Harry are both the same in canon on the scale of laziness when it comes to work. Both of them constantly copied homework from Hermione. Both of them hated putting in effort for the majority of their subjects (much like the average teenage boy). The only reason Ron doing it more seems to stand out is because it was constantly shoved in our faces and used as a pretext for the start of Ron/Hermione attraction. It was never the case that Ron was lazier than Harry or riding his coat tails through life. He had his own talents and skills which made themselves known over time, much later in the series when JKR actually decided to flesh him out beyond the loyal friend and follower.

It's neither here nor there to discuss who might be better or worse for Ron, but the way I've always seen it, as a male, is that Ron is the stereotypical average teenage boy who gets his moment of fame in HBP and random attraction from one of the popular, attractive girls (someone who he'd never had a chance with previously) and he jumps on it. There's very few people I know who /wouldn't/ do that. It doesn't mean that their relationship would last forever or that they're a perfect match. Personally I always felt like Lavender was using Ron, dating him because he was popular and all the negative things that come with that. But again, that's neither here nor there. Point is; Ron's a teenage boy acting his age in that book. Then he shows more maturity and becomes a man at the end of the series.

Question to all the haters of Ron: why do you have to hate him? Seriously, he's got the same flaws as Harry and the majority of the male characters in the book... What makes him stand out as the big bad?
