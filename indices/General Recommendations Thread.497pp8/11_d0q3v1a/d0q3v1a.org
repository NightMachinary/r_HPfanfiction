I'm fairly certain people have already listed it in either of the threads but I'm a big fan of "The last casualties" by muggledad. I don't have a link to it at the moment but if I have some time and remember then I will put it up. Fair warning it's not finished yet and the updates are taking a while. However, each chapter is fairly long so there's plenty of material already.
