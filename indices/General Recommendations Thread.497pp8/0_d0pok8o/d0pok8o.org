Here are my all time favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]]: A dark and gritty trip into the darkest recesses of magic, a perfect illustration of "The road to hell is paved with good intentions"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes][Behind Blue Eyes]]: A fantastic and gutwrenching romance between a young muggle girl and Harry, and how they deal with each of their troubled family's past.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me][You'll be the Death of Me]]: A brilliant inside look at the slytherin's side of the war, and the best Neville I've ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young with Me]]: A young muggle waitress (a fantastic OC. She feels as real as all the other HP characters) meets a widower Harry, and devellops a friendship with him. Harry's relationship with his children is another strength of this awesome work.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A-Butterfly-Effect][A Butterfly Effect]]: My favourite fem!Harry, and a successful attempt at rewriting all the HP books as Young Adults litterature. So be advised that this fic contains mature themes and scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8984932/1/I-Alone][I, Alone]]: A must read for anyone that thinks that Harry is way too grounded psychologically speaking for someone with his background. Adittionaly, my absolute favorite Hogwart's Express scene, at the beggining of the fic. Try it out. This scene alone got me hooked for the rest of the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9818387/1/The-Amplitude-Frequency-and-Resistance-of-the-Soul-Bond][The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond]]: The best Soul-Bond I've ever read, that is hilariously funny (Dumbledore is...I best not spoil it, but, damn, he had me rolling on the floor laughing half a dozen times). And this fic still manages to make the characters feel and react like teenagers, making this story one of my favorites.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]: A great time travel story where Hermione goes back in time, and the fic that made me discover one of my favorite ships: Hermione/Sirius. Well written, great story, and great interactions and dialogues.

Enjoy!
