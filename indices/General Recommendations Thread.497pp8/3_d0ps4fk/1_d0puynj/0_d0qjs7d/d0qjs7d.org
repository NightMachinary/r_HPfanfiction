While much depends on personal taste, I think most “best of” fanfiction would/should contain many of these stories, all of them being some of the best written stories in the fandom.

Linkffn(Forging the Sword; On the Way to Greatness; What You Leave Behind; The Skitterleap; By the Diving Light; Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle; Hogwarts Houses Divided; Unatoned; Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived; The Changeling; Applied Cultural Anthropology, or; What Lies Beneath; Resurrexit; Incorruptible: the Dementor's Stigma; Evil Be Thou Good; The Unforgiving Minute; Lost Time; The Song of the Trees)

While there are more, these are the ones I can think of on top of my head.

In addition, anything by BajaB, Ruskbyte, enembee, Perspicacity, Taure, and Voice of the Nephilim can be guaranteed of good quality writing.
