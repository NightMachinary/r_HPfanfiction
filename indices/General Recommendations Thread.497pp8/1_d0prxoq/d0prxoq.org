Ah yes.

*General recs:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]]

Thorn Circle is the first in an ongoing series - all are novel-length, and the 5th is set to come out sometime this year or next year (if Inverarity gets a move on). They're /truly/ in a class of their own, quality-wise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is absolutely hilarious - a fantastically funny and clever fic. Basically a Peggy Sue fic, and the love interest is Tonks, but it's not a shipping fic by any means.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223/1/Elsewhere-but-not-Elsewhen][Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen]], by the same author as Jamie Evans, is a dimensional-travel fic that has a rather dark side, but has many moments of clever gallows humour. Unfortunately, the fic seems to be either dormant or dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] had me on the edge of my seat the entire damn time; /this fic alone/ made Bellatrix/Hermione one of my favourite pairings. Lots of wonderful scenes and lots of angst. There's a few short sequels by the author that follow up the events of the main story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] is the single best Slytherin!Ginny fic out there, and perhaps even the best Ginny's-perspective fic ever written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118152/1/The-Scientist][The Scientist]] is an ongoing Hermione/Narcissa slow-burn fic. It's been really good so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] is a great, if very angsty, Harmony fic without any of the usual accompanying Harmonian bullshit (i.e. Weasley-bashing, Dumbledore-bashing, et cetera). Dimensional travel plays a large part, as does Luna.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is perhaps one of the most terrifying fics I've ever read, and it explores an unusual concept in astounding depth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906518/1/Ron-El-Greco][Ron El Greco]] explores the "mature" side of Ron/Hermione, and involves Ron being a diplomatic Auror in a rogue Middle Eastern city-state. Very adventurous, but ultimately down-to-earth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] is also a really detailed delving into a concept that, unlike with Catechism, has been done a few times before, but NEVER to the degree that Distaff does it. Sadly, it's either dormant or dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10402749/1/War-Paint][War Paint]] is the only HG/TR fic I'll ever read, and for good reason.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] is another amazing one with high levels of emotional torque. Hermione and Neville are the main characters, though Draco, Dean, Luna, and Percy show up at times. Unfortunately, it's also abandoned.

/(Apart from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118152/1/The-Scientist][The Scientist]])/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7850423/1/Five-flavours-Katie-Bell-likes-and-two-she-doesn-t][Five Flavours Katie Bell Likes and Two She Doesn't]] is a wonderful little Alicia/Katie vignette.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3357118/1/Come-Fly-With-Me][Come Fly With Me]] is one of the oldest wonderfully written Katie/Alicia vignettes that's around - it's from 2007.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/107440][Two's Company]] is yet another Katie/Alicia Vignette on AO3.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8315000/1/Elysium][Elysium]] is a good short Hermione/Lily story.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/970216/chapters/1905703][Snapshots in Serendipity]] is a cute little Hermione/Luna story on AO3.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/897183][The Letter]] is another story from AO3, and it's a wonderfully angsty piece of Hermione/Ginny.

*Vignettes/Oneshots:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227825/1/Telling-Him][Telling Him]] is a cute little R/S vignette; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]] is a brilliant work exploring exactly what it says in the title; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4942254/1/Penance][Penance]] is a crazy angsty little piece of Harry/Tonks that's hard to describe; and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10071063/1/The-Assassin-Wore-White][The Assassin Wore White]] is a fantastic piece featuring Madam Pomfrey.
