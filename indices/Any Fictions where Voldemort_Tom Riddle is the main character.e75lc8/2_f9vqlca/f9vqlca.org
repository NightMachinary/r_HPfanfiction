I've read many stories in which Voldemort or Tom Riddle is a secondary protagonist, but few fics have him as the only focal character. Here are some with him as solo protagonist that I have enjoyed:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6623293/][Realignment]] - (67k+ words ; COMPLETE) School-age Tom Riddle is the target of an assassination attempt by a powerful wizard (a time traveling adult Harry Potter), which leaves Tom with no choice but to accept Dumbledore's offer of guidance and protection. linkao3(6623293)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15499683/][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] - (53k+ words ; COMPLETE) Harry accidentally travels back in time to the year Tom Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets. Things go sideways in an unexpected way. Love never enters the equation. linkao3(15499683)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2501577/1/Riddle-s-War][Riddle's War]] - (28k+ words ; COMPLETE) Riddle is evacuated to the countryside along with the other orphans during a summer of the London Blitz. linkffn(2501577)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/9/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] - (76k+ words ; ONGOING) After his death, Voldemort awakens in the body of his teenage self. With his sanity restored, he resolves not to repeat the mistakes that lead to his ignominious defeat. linkffn(13088810)
