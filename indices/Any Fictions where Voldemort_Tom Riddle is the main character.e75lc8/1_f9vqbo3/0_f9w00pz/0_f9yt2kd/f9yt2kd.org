Oh wow!! Yeah- it's really surprised me how unnoticed it is! Not that I'm trying to be vain, but my last story was fairly popular so this is an interesting experience! The story is wild, really sad but we're winding down! I have exams this week but I'm planning on writing the final chapter maybe Wednesday? Anyway! It may be done this week!
