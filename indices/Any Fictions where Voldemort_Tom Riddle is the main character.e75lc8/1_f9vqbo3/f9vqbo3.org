Hi! My fic fits this category! It's almost complete- the next chapter is the last one and it'll be finished before the end of this year. Tom Riddle is the central character, with the only OC being a psychiatrist who interacts with Tom and never isolated. That being said, the story is a Time Travel one where Tom comes to the future right at the start of the fifth book. Tom however, is the main character. I should warn you, the story is pretty heavy!
