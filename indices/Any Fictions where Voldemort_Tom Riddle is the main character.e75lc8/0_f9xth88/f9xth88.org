Birds of a Feather by babylonsheep is a slow burn romance with Tom and Hermione, set in the 40s. It's pretty great, really captures Tom Riddle in my opinion. The first few paragraphs in and I instantly thought, "Yeah, I can see this little sh*t becoming Voldemort."

Hermione, who's born in this time period, not time displaced, is on point as well. Watching the two verbily spar over their vastly different moralities is a lot of fun.
