Hek, Naomi Novak has made some stellar books, "Spinning Silver" was excellent and I enjoyed "Uprooted". I was excited to read this one as she's done so well before but if what the reviewer says is true I guess it's a skip.

Edit: Though reading through more of the comments maybe it is worth reading? Hard to tell if the first comment just cherry picked a lot of examples and the problem isn't as bad as they make it out to seem.
