When Tom Riddle put a curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts position, Albus Dumbledore did not expect the outcome to be, well... whatever this was. It had been rough for the first decade after the curse was cast. No Defense professors lasted more than one full school year to teach the students how to defend themselves from the forces of darkness that constantly besieged the castle. But was the situation really so dire?

For the first time in years, more than half of 5th and 7th year classes were getting Outstandings in their OWLs and NEWTs despite the lack of continuity in Defense lessons. Alastor Moody was over the moon at the skill of the latest batch of Auror recruits. He was even planning to send some of the older Aurors back to Hogwarts for extra training.

A review and inspection of the present staff's lessons showed that all of the professors were teaching their students ways to defend themselves using their respective subjects. Albus was still a bit traumatized from watching a wee firstie subdue a boggart with the pineapple tap dance charm taught in Flitwick's class. It would have been ridiculous if someone had just told him the story had he not seen it with his own eyes.

And so in the latest staff meeting, it was decided that a separate Defense Against the Dark Arts class was no longer needed because its spirit was already incorporated into the school's every other subject.
