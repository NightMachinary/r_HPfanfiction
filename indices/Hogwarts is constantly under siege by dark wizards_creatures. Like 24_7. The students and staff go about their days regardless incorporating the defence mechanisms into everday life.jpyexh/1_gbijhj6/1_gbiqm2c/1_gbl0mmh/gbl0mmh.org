/me remembers one Russian-language fic (:[[https://www.ficbook.net/readfic/8674131]] or [[https://author.today/work/46569]] ) in which:

- Original Characters finds himself back in time (or so he originally think) in body of young boy (son of wealthy muggle aristocrat).
- He finds himself magical and understood it's HP World.
- He read some books, saw some movies and serial. Except that there are several remakes of movies and he was not very attentive.
- So he basically only knew for sure about threat from dark mage while he will be in Hogwarts. He doesn't knew who it was (some remakes changed that). He doesn't knew level of threat (later remakes were made while humaninity mastered interstellar travel so 'dark mage' is threat to earth as physical object).
- He don't want to be on Earth or even in Solar system if he is in version of HP world from later movies. He also dosn't wants his friends and family to be here.
- This mean that that Something Must Be Done. Something is Done. Kill dark mage. Or evaculate at least part of humanity.
- Something Is Done. Sucessfully.
- It wascanon world before his intervention.
- He found out canon version of events only after he was able to research parallel unverses. He didn't even understood Voldemort was super-puper 'dark mage' before that.
