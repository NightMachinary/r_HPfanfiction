There is a fanfic like this. I've just spent the last bouse searching for it to no avail. Harry has a secret room located in one of the towers filled with books and stuff where he keeps Sirius's body suspended in a pyramid of energy. Hermione eventually joins them.

The bit that makes it like this is that Harry has to get to the room before sunset because at night Hogwarts turns nasty. All the shadows attack him. All the gargoyles want to eat him. The prefects patrol the corridors trying to keep the monsters at bay. Any kids who go wondering at night are likely to die.

I just can't remember what it's called! Something like Harry Potter and the Artifact Vault or Artificiers Vault or something like that.
