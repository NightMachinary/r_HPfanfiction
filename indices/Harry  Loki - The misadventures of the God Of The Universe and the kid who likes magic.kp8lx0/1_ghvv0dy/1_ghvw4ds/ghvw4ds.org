Thank you! If you need an editor, I will do my best to help! I've seen and read so many fics with bad grammar and that are just horribly written, i.e. run on sentences, extreme usage of â€˜and', extreme OOC-ness, word butchering, misuse of the comma, terrible pacing, stretched out chapters and overall fic, unnecessary twists, trying to cram everything in, etc. I've seen a lot of problems and it would hurt my heart to see my prompt get butchered. (Not to say you will! I just don't know you or your writing style.) If you've already got an editor or don't need/want one, that's fine too. Even if you don't write it, thank you for reading the absolutely massive post I had as a shower thought.
