Really? I find that curious. I would have thought that whatever about it catches your interest, there's almost certain to be some other story that also has it in some way.

If you're looking for learning skills, then one of my favorites - incomplete, but updating very steadily, and hopefully will finish later this year - is Mother of Learning. Original fiction with a groundhog day (actually month) loop, set in a fantasy world with very rich worldbuilding.
