Or he/she is getting burnt out on HP fics. I think the burn out is starting to creep up on me. I read published books too, but HP fics are free when I'm broke. I wish more fandoms had great recommendation reddits like this one. Its such a pain to slog through the fanfiction sites without recommendations. Its like going through the sewer barefoot with the hope of sometimes finding someone's accidently flushed wedding ring.
