It really depends on how much action you want. If you want something that is canon compliant and still retains a lot of the original books' feel, I recommend this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6342013/1/Hunters-and-Prey]] . It has a story that could easily fit into the canon after the penultimate chapter in Deathly Hallows and has action and excitement but also focuses on other aspects of Harry's life.
