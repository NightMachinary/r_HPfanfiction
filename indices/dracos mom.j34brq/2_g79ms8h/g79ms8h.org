  That was the last straw. Fucking imbecile just let her son die by the stupid half-arsed plan he didn't manage to execute. As usual.

  There was actually a small ribbon of smoke coming out of his body. The last piece of news they got was that their son was killed at Hogwarts and another pureblood girl was taken to the Chamber of Secrets and she hasn't been expected to get out alive. Her rage reminded her husband, that she was a sister of Bellatrix Lestrange. That reminder came too late for him before his body was torn into pieces by the old curse used in the Black family by unhappy wives on their stupid husbands.

  One more flick of her wand and pieces of the corpse were transformed into sand, which she collected with another charm into a conjured leather bag (she was proud of that conjuration: the bag was stylishly decorated with the Black family coat of arms). That cretin also lost them Dobby, so she will have to ask that idiot of house-elf Tidy to spread around gossip, that Lucius left on the business travel to Southern Patagonia and he is not expected to return in few more months.
