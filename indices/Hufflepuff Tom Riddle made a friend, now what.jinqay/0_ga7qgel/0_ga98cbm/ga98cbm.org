To be honest, I didn't give it that much thought before I started to write. I just wanted to write a grumbling Hufflepuff Tom who's quite frustrated with all the good will floating around :p Then it evolved into Tom learning about friendship. That's probably why I'm not sure where to go from there.

I think I want to keep the suspense on whether he's actually going to become a Nice Hufflepuff, or still become a twisted Dark Lord, or maybe manage to combine his thirst for power with his new friendships in the way [[/u/bgottfried91][u/bgottfried91]] is proposing.

Maybe I could have him experiment with what this new friendship can bring him, status wise? That would bring charismatic Head Boy Tom to mind, but since in my story he's only eleven and surronded by well-meaning Hufflepuff, he might feel a bit bad about it later? Only, not bad enough to stop.

Going to keep thinking about it, thanks for pointing out that I was missing the big picture! :)
