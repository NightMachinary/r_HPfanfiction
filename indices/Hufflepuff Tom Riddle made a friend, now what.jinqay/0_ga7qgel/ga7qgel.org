Well, you've got lots of good things so far, but what is the whole idea? What's the theme?

Perhaps you could have him meet some other Hufflepuff's who are willing to become his friends, but he continually pushes them away because he believes that one is enough? But then the question would be, “What do you want this Tom Riddle to be?”

Do you want him to learn to be nicer? Maybe his new Hufflepuff friends have to pull him away from the temptations of the Dark Arts?

Also, please send me the link to your story when you finish it, it sounds like a great read!
