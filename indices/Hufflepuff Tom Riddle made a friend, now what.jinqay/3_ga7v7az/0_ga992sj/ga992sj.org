I think a Dumbledore-like path would be feasible at this point. He would probably be different because he dislikes Muggles and thinks himself superior to almost everyone, but I could see him aiming to become Headmaster of Hogwarts or Minister of Magic because he believes he knows better and wants to slowly mould the Wizarding World into his ideals.

I think there'd need to be a huge change for him to kill his friend. But that gives me the idea that if his friend dies in an accident, one that could be blamed on another student, Tom would probably go apeshit. Either he'd decide that love is indeed a foolish mistake or embark on a quest to avenge his friend, but in any case case it would result in quite a lot of deaths and misery...
