Thinking further on this, the key difference could be that these few hufflepuffs CHOSE him rather than the other way around.

Tom didn't choose them out of usefulness. They didn't choose him out of key players to gain power. They chose him, and he got their genuine loyalty and admiration and I imagine that this could still make a grand difference for him at eleven rather than having to claw his way up on the slytherin ladder.

And as such, he could be positively obsessed with this self-chosen "pure" loyalty that he is worthy of and keeping it no matter the cost. Of course, he has no concept of being a healthy friend so mental wise, this might not end very happy for those loyal hufflepuffs.

I imagine he'd just be the same old voldemort to servants who chose to serve him for their own needs. And Canon-wise, Bellatrix is also his favored out of this loyal obsession, no?

It could be an extremely selfish and draining form of friendship, where Tom takes all he can but is always far more cautious about crossing the line of risking their loss. An abusive relationship, in a sense.

... And as his greatest enemy and example years later, doesn't Dumbledore effectively control wizarding Brittain with this deitified loyalty of the greater mass?

To which the end of his obsessions tie in neatly : of course he's not going to accept ever losing them to something as death and this frightens him, and so begins his quest for immortality - just not only for himself.

He's not just out for his own throne in this life. His 'friends' very much ARE the throne itself.

Okay, I'll stop rambling.
