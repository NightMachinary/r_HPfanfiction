You could play the self-serving angle up even more for a longer time : Tom is still a messed-up kid and potentially budding sociopath / psychopath. He could develop his few close friendships with the long-term excuse for the mentioned connections and such and like they're not totally annoying and its oddly nice to feel appreciation and admiration and because obviously hufflepuffs aren't gonna admire him for his cruelty so its logical to be nice to them and so on.

And then one of them gets hurt and Tom is just FURIOUS that someone dared to touch his, HIS, friends. In a way, I suspect he would still view them as his treasures and possessions, just from a different angle. The HIS would be much more important than the friends as words here and he could be absolutely immoral to keep them to him, no matter what the truth may be. He could plot later to have them be dependent on him should he risk losing their closeness due to a job or who knows what.

Tom has an aspect of obsession and ownership after all that seeks craving. Here, he might have just filled that need with a few fellow students his own age from young and the get go, rather than his death eaters who were always just servants for his different needs and objects of founders.
