So he would start with making friends because it benefits him, but unexpectedly get truly attached to them? That'd be a cool sequel, but I don't feel like writing this story over such a long time-span. Maybe I could add a bunch of alternative epilogues 25 years into the future, though. /A la/ JKR, expect not writing the epilogue before the books itself...

I could have the "realize that having friends can be a form of power" happen has the end of the plot though. I like the idea of using the blood purity conflict, as suggested by [[/u/bgottfried91][u/bgottfried91]] Not sure of the details yet.
