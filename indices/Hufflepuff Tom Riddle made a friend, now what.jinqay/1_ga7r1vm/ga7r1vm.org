Tom is, fundamentally, someone who does things because they benefit him. He could view this friendship as something valuable to him that he's willing to protect at all costs and continue his pursuit of power, but this time to protect his self-interest by protecting this friend. You could arguably have the blood purity unrest still come to a head, but this time he's on the other side of it because he and his friend are both half-bloods. Tom ends up on the "Good" side but they don't really trust him because he's only in it to protect what's valuable to him and not for the wider cause.
