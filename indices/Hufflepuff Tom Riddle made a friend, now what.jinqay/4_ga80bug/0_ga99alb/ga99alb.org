Oooh, I like the idea of a magical college!

I like the idea of his friends pushing him toward a peaceful way of becoming powerful and influential. I'm just not sure it'd be in character with eleven-year-old kids. I mean, Slytherin kids might do it just because they have this ambition-oriented culture, but would others realise that Tom's path to power might result in bloodshed and think of this alternative? Would they be able to sell it to him? If that was happening later on, in fifth year for example, definitively, but they are still quite young in my story.
