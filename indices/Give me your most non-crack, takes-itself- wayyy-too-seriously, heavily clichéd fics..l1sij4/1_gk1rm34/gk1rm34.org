The Venom Peddler is far from the worst fic I've seen but it's probably the closest fic to what you're asking for that I actually bothered to save. It holds a frankly undeserved place in my heart for being the first Harry Potter fanfic I ever read (at least that I can recall).

“Core Threads” is something. It feels like it is/should be crack but I'm legitimately unsure whether the author intended that. LinkFFN(10136172)
