This is my go to fic when people ask for it. It has all the bad stuff. Weasley bashing. Dumbledore bashing. Goblin friends. Harry grandstanding. Harry flying off his rocker and yelling unnecessarily. Twinspeak. The twins bowing and doing jigs in praise of Harry on the tables. And my most hated thing authors do. The nicknames. Moldy shorts. Dumb as a door. Etc.
