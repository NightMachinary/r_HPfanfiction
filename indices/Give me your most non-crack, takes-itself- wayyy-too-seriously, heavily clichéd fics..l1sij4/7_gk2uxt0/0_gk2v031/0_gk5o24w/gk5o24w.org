Even some of the reviews are trash, if you ask me. I generally avoid any fic which bashes Harry, Ron, or Hermione, because those three are the heart and soul of the books.

Man, the reviews treat Hermione like a literal goddess who can do now wrong. Every character has flaws, everyone has done wrong, and everyone tries their best to be good. That's what makes HP fun to read.
