RobSt's work can be safely defined as "well-written but heavily clich√©d stories, with inevitable Harry/Hermione pairing".

People like his stories because they're well-written for what they are - but those same stories also have a fair portion of people who catch onto the fact that if you've read one RobSt story, you've read practically all of them (and a good portion of Dumbledore/Weasley-bashing stories by other authors as well).
