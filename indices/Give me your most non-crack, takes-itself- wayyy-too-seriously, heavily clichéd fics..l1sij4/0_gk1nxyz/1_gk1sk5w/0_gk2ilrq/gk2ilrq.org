Clarifying the "well-written" descriptor:

His fics each have at least a couple of good ideas/elements that I've not seen in other stories before or since, and as you might guess from my presence on this sub, I've read a /lot/ of HP fanfic.

Also, it's very rare for characters in his stories to just act in furtherance of the plot; almost always, their choices make sense in context. Even the obvious mistakes are made for in-character reasons (at least according to his interpretation of said character, bashy though it may be at times). This is /such/ a breath of fresh air compared to canon.

On a couple of occasions, he actually got me emotionally invested enough in a story to get my heart pounding from the tension. Pulling that off with nothing but text on the page/screen is no small feat.
