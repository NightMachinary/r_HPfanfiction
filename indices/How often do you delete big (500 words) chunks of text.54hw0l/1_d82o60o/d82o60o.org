Not often. I usually rewrite parts or whole chapters completely and only delete little parts. I am too much of a hoarder to permanently delete anything so my computer gets fuller and fuller with useless files. Sometimes I wish I could delete writings on my computer like I shred them IRL. OFten it are just duplicates with only a small thing altered, such as the tense or perspective.
