- /Lily's Changes/ - A time travel fic, where instead of meeting Dumbledore in the limbo after he takes a killing curse from Voldemort, he meets a very angry Lily Potter, who basically chews out Harry for following Dumbledore blindly. They both go back in time. She isn't able to save her own life, but she lays the foundations of a long plan to take down all the threats to Harry. Dumbledore/Ron bashing, so be warned. Mind you, she's more or less a non-entity outside the initial chapter.

- /Proud Parents/ - Similar to /Lily's Changes/ but without the time travel aspect. Instead, Lily shows up as a ghost during the climax of /Prisoner of Azkaban/, and sets Harry on a course getting him out from under the thumb of a manipulative Dumbledore. It's by RobSt, but ironically enough, while Dumbledore is bashed to no end, /Ron/ isn't. It's a bit refreshing, really, to see a frequent Ron-basher actually treating Ron like a human than a hate sink. Again, Lily is more or less a non-entity in the story outside her initial appearance.

- /Freaks Aren't Allowed/ - The Dursleys throw Harry out of the house one snowy night. Nearly dying of hypothermia, he's rescued by the ghost of his mother, who leads him to an old friend, Severus Snape. Again she's not present in the story very much beyond the initial appearance.

- /Magic of the Force/ - This one is a crossover, unlike the others. It takes Harry, and through an exceptionally powerful bout of accidental magic, Harry is thrown through space(and perhaps time), dragging the spirit of his mother along, and he lands on Ryloth, in the galaxy Star Wars takes place in. Lily is far more present here, being a major character for most of the fanfic. The fanfic is still being written, but so far as I'm aware, there are no plans to take the story back to the territory of Harry Potter canon. Mixed reviews from this subreddit, but it's personally one of my favorites.
