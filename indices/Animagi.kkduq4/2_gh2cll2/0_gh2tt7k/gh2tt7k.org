Animals don't have gender like people do. And what would it even mean to have the same gender as, say, a seahorse (which would suck as an animagus form, but whatever)? Male seahorses are the ones that give birth.

Edited to add: And what if your animagus form was a clownfish? You'd start out male when you were young, and then if you were the dominant male in your group, you'd change to a female if the female leader of your group died.
