Cats have sexes. Gender is cultural, so only animals with cultures (which generally means humans) can have gender.

The sexes of other animals don't necessarily correspond to human genders anyway. What if you like wearing bright colors and dancing? In my culture, these things are considered female these days. If you were a bird animagus, for most species of birds, you'd be a male bird.
