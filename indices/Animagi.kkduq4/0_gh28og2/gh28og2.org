It's a magical animal so if you want to be a female doe instead of a stag then go be a doe, what's stopping you? Animagi are supposed to be reflections of you soul, personality. So if that most closely resembles an animal of a different sex/gender to you I don't see why it wouldn't be that? What's stopping it from being that?

Though I am not remotely close to being an expert on or even having an opinion on gender so I honestly couldn't tell you. But I figure, animagus's are a magical idea so exploit it to do the thing that most fits you ðŸ˜Š.
