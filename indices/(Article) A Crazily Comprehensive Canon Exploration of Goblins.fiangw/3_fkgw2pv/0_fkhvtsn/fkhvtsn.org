Aye, I tried a thing or two with BeautifulSoup on ffnet but that old tired mess of a site isn't very bot-friendly ^^. It would be interesting to do text-analysis stuff with fanfictions. The biggest problem I ran into is the non-uniform styling and syntax among writers, trying to make an universal tokenizer thingy for such a diverse corpus is an absolute nightmare. Just thinking about the separators people use between scenes (like "_-_-_-_-_ *° HPGitGud °* _-_-_-_-_-") chills my soul, and getting rid of A/Ns automatically is also a challenge I'll let other people deal with xD (I don't consider them part of the text since authors often use a different tone to write them and I'm more interested in the actual storytelling kind of stuff).
