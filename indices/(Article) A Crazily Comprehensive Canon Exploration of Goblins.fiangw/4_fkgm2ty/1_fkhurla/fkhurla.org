I feel like that trope mainly comes from two things. One: the "Ancient and Noble House of Black," which presumeably is just Sirius's family being pompous purebloods but isn't really expanded upon in canon. Two: the Wizengamot (and Wizarding government in general) not being expanded upon. So people take the two and make up a Wizarding government based on Ancient and Noble Houses ruling within the Wizengamot, with the Minister being an elected portion (potentially to balance it out).
