Very well thought out and written. Must of taken ages to sort through everything, and then write it all out.

A while ago I went through a pdf of the books to see if anyone's ever referred to as Lord somthing or other (the only person ever referred to as such is Voldemort) and it took a good half hour of just skipping through the text from one instance to the next only looking at each for a few seconds.
