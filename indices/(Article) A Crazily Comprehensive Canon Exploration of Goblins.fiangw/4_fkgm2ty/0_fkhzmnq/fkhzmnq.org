The word “lord” appears 392 times in the books. And only once in the plural form: “My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow ...” ^{(bk.2 ch.8 para.142}) during Nick's death-day party.

There is 12 instances of the interjection “good lord”.

>144 “dark lord”, >137 “lord Voldemort” , 80 “my lord”, 1 “lord, is it?”, all of them about Voldemort. At this point I still got 29 “lord”s in the wild but they are probably occurrences of “dark lord” and “lord voldemort” that repeat multiple times in the same paragraph... my system is not really fine-tuned to detect those.

Anyway there is no “lord potter”, "lord black" or “lord malfoy” anywhere in the books, and any instances of “heir” apply to “the Heir of Slytherin”.

That little report took me about 5 minutes to make, that's the advantage of searchable databases.
