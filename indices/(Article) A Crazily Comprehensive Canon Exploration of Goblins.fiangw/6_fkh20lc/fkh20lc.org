That was a very nice read. A+ for effort. I don't think you need to worry about people not reading through major amount of text to glean something good in a fanfiction subreddit. Or maybe that's just me. I can't think of anything to ask you right now but will you be open to a request later on?

Again, thanks for all the work.
