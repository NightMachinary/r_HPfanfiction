This is really good analysis and clears up a lot of fanon tropes, but I would revise a couple of points if you extend it to EU materials like the movies and Pottermore.

On the "goblin nation": There's no /direct/ mention of a goblin nation, but several things would certainly imply it--goblin rebellions, having a liaison office, petitioning for a seat at the ICW in the first place. And most of all, Ragnuk was specifically called a king on Pottermore. It may not be official, but it may be like disputed places like Taiwan or Somaliland that are /de facto/ independent.

On Flitwick: Well, I think part of this is because Warwick Davis is shorter than the goblins were described being in the books. It could be that Flitwick is just that short rather than a larger fraction goblin. But the scene in the fifth film where Umbridge holds up a tape measure to him does imply that she thinks of him as a half-breed.
