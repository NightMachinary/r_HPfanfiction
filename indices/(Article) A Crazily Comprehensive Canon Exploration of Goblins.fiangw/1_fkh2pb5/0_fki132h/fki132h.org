Yeah, I think it makes sense, it's just a different approach. Here I had the opportunity to really search the Books for answers and I think it's interesting to look at a purely book-oriented canon. The way I see it, it reopens interesting perspectives and possibilities that have sort of been shut by films, JKR and fanon inertia through the years. It makes me think of early fanfictions that were built on much thinner foundations (like just the first few books and no movies) and were seemingly much more free to explore.

That's why I tried to be as open-ended as possible in my synthesis, I think the best stories are built on questions rather then hundreds of wiki articles and whispers of Author-mandated canonical facts and tidbits.
