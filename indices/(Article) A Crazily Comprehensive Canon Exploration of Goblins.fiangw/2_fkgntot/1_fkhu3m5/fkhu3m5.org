Thanks, I was mainly looking for collapsible text as a way to streamline the super-long post but it doesn't work like that on this sub ^^. At least the Quote thing seems to reduce the vertical spacing of the text a little bit (or maybe that's just in my mind) and the Spoiler thing allows someone to easily look for a header without getting distracted by all the text if they are only interested by one thing. Making a Big Wall of Text look pretty on Reddit is a tall order given the few options afforded by the editor xD.
