I can appreciate the spoiler warning, considering how many things have been spoiled for me by people (mainly on youtube via people posting spoilers in their titles/thumbnails or in the comments section). Granted for a topic like this people joining in should be expecting spoilers related to the topic, but I prefer being too cautious over not cautious enough.
