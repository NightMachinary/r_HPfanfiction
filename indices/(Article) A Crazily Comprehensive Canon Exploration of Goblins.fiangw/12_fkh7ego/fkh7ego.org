The title should be "Fantastic Goblins and Where to Find Them".

Very well done and researched! It must have taken hours to do this!

I really loved that you were able to separate fanon from canon with cold, hard facts.

The idea that there are Goblins who aren't in gringotts is an excellent premise for fanfic prompt.

Or a Goblin Slayer crossover 游때游때游때游때.
