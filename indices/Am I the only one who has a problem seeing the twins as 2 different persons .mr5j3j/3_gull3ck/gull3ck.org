In canon, they're fairly similar/interchangeable. People have noticed some slight differences between them - but on the whole they're not major characters, and you'd have to look /real/ close to make any difference.

In most fanfiction, that's similar - they're just not major enough characters to bother about differentiating for many authors. If you are interested in that, I think the genre to go for is the Hermione/Fred (or Hermione/George if that exists?) ship, because that one will by necessity have to distinguish between them a bit more
