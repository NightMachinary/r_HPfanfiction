Fred is the instigator in most of their antics and is effectively the driver, so to speak. He's a risk-taker and has a fierce temper. He's the one who wants to ask Harry if he remembers what Voldemort looks like. He's literally driving the Ford Anglia to rescue Harry. He's the one who gets the idea to blackmail Bagman. Contrasting George who is able to be restrained by /just/ Harry, it takes all three Chasers to keep him from breaking Malfoy's jaw when he insults his mother.

George is far kinder. He is the first to notice Harry is struggling with his trunk and calls on Fred to help them hoist it onto the Express. He's the one who offers to write Ginny (Fred offers to send a Hogwarts toilet seat). He's the one who wonders how the family is going to afford to pay for all the Lockhart books. He's more argumentative with Wood during the Rogue Bludger incident and is actively angry that Wood is risking Harry's safety. He's the one who's actively anxious about blackmailing Bagman. George is the one who helps a small first-year to her feet after they test a product on her.

When Arthur is injured at the Ministry, Fred is more venomous in his argument with Sirius. He calls him out for not "risking his neck." By contrast, when Molly finally is able to come back to Grimmauld Place, George is the only Weasley child other than Ginny who runs to hug her.

In short? George is a momma's boy.
