In canon they are not major characters, and fulfill their duty to the story well as a duo, and do not need further characterization as they are not major parts of the story (and frankly canon meanders enough already, not hating i enjoy the tangents, but it does lol). Those finer details are unnecessary.

However if you start writing a fanfic where they are more major characters, that doesn't work as well and you have to expand on their differences, dynamics, and quirks. A lot of fanfic writers do not do so unfortunately so we are given loads of the dreaded "Twin Speak" which unlike the brief and few instances in canon goes on and on and on.
