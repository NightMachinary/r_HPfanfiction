I was under the impression that Tonks's ability required effort to maintain. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but if that's the case then she's not 'turning into' anything, she's just changing her shape by concentration. If she gets distracted by anything, she reverts. I don't think it's transfiguration at all, more like pulling a funny face and trying to keep it there. I haven't read the books in a long time, so I'm not sure what's said about it.
