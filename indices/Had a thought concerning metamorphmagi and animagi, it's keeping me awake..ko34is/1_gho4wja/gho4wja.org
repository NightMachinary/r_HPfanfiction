  Would a metamorphagus even need to be an animagus to become an animal or can they transform so completely that in physicality they are an animal?
#+end_quote

I think the thing about animagi is that they become the animal wholly while keeping their human mind. While a metamorphagus might be able to have the appearance of any animal they would still be human in ability. So, yes, they would still need to become an animagus to become an animal in essence.

  Would the animagus animal have the ability to change drastically
#+end_quote

As they keep their minds, I would think so, yes. However, what I said above would apply to this scenario. They would still be that animal in essence while being the other in appearance.

Edit: metamorphagi is simply an innate ability to transfigure oneself. They are limited to what every other human can do with human transfiguration. They just do it without a wand.
