Does Tonks do the duck beak thing in the books, or is that a film-only event?

I seem to recall that when I read the books I always had the impression that metamorphmagi couldn't change anything into non-human features. So while they could change skin, eye, hair colour and shape, they were limited to human shapes.

But there are fanfics that have Tonks turning her arms into wings and all sorts, and I feel like if they can literally take on any shape of any species, that makes metamorphmagi obscenely OP.
