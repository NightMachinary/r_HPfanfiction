It was a pig snout in the books.

  Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry's bedroom, her nose swelled to a beak-like protuberance that resembled Snape's, shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione and Ginny were soon requesting their favorite noses.

  “Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks.”

  Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.
