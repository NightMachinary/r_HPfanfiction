Hmm, but a pig-like nose which makes a person resemble Dudley is still a human feature, as opposed to an actual snout.

I think the effort that JKR went to say that each of these examples resembles an existing character was to demonstrate that Tonks's ability is limited to human features.

But that may just be my preferred interpretation, because as I say, otherwise it makes metamorphmagi extremely overpowered.
