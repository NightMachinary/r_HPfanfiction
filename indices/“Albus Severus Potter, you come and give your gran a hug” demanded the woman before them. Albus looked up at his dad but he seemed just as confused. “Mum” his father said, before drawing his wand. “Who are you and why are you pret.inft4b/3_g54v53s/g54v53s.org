"Harry Potter..." a familiar voice sheepishly whispered.

"WHAT THE- DOBBY?!?!" Harry was shocked. Albus was confused.

"Harry Potter remembers Dobby's name! This is the best day of Dobby's life!" Dobby shrunk down to the form of a house-elf in extravagant, vibrant clothes. Dobby shot Ginny a dirty look.

"HARRY POTTER IS DOBBY'S AND DOBBY'S ALONE!" He drew a knife, the one Harry thought Dobby was killed with, and he flung himself at Ginny. "PETRFICUS TOTALUS!" shouted Ginny. Albus was silent, shock ringing through his ears.

Later, Harry crouched in front of the tied up Dobby. "FILTHY BLOOD TRAITOR WEASLEY GIRL! FILTH! FLITH! FILTH!!" he cried.

"Dobby! Talk to me! How are you alive?"

"Dobby made a Horcrux out of the sock Harry Potter gave him, sir," Dobby replied, "there is a reason you have not seen Charlie Weasley." Ginny lunged at Dobby. Albus and James held her back. "DOBBY WILL KILL YOU FIRST!" roared Dobby. "Dobby went back to Godric's Hollow," he continued, "and used Lily Potter's hair to craft Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Lily Potter."\\
"How did you kill Charlie?"\\
"Dobby Apparated and used the knife Bellatrix Lestrange killed him once with."

Harry grabbed Dobby and promptly threw him out of the house.
