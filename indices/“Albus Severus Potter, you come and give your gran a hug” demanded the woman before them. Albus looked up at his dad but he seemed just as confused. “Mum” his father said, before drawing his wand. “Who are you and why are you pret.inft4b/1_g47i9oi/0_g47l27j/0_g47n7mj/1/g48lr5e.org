While unlike the other comment I personally never found the idea of Snape getting some cringe-worthy (in fact, I actually like Snily in general), I always found the implication of Snape as biological father offputting. It usually means the fic is giving Lily a pass for being unfaithful due to James doing something stupid (but never irredeemable, since she usually goes back to him after that one time), which is just wrong, or that Lily truly loved Snape all along which makes her marriage to James... disturbing to say the least. I've only seen a fic truly lambast infidelity!Lily for this once (I don't remember the exact Severitus that did this) with the fic heavily criticizing Lily for basically using Snape for revenge sex (exploiting his feelings for her that Lily was fully aware of) just because James was neglecting her in favour of being with his friends instead of, oh I don't know, talking to him about it and try to resolve their relationship issues.

I do like Snape as a father figure or mentor, but never as the true biological father.
