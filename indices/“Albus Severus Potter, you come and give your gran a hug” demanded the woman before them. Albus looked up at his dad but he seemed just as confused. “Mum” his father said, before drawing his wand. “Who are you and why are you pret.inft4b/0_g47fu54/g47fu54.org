Lily Potter smiled.

“Why I'm Lily Potter. I've actually been in hiding for 40 years,” she responded.

“Uhuh. What did Sirius get me for my first birthday?” Harry asked, obviously skeptical and trying to catch her lie.

“A toy broom. I swear it was pure luck the cat didn't die every time you got on that blasted thing!” She exclaimed. Albus looked between Harry who was dumbfounded, and supposedly his grandmother.

“Ok you win that one. Who was the secret keeper?” Harry asked after he had recovered. Lily's face fell.

“That bastard Peter. Never trust a hero worshipper,” Lily replied darkly. Harry stood there staring at her blankly.

“Uh... which magical figure did Aunt Petunia send a letter to?” He asked, knowing this one would get her.

“Dumbledore,” she responded simply.

Harry fainted. Lily looked at Harry's body sprawled across the floor. She gave a wry chuckle and turned to Albus.

“Now Albus, please help your dear old grandmother drag your father's body out of the street will you?” She asked serenely, her green eyes twinkling. Albus looked at her and Harry, then shrugged.

“Alright,” he told her as he grabbed Harry's legs.
