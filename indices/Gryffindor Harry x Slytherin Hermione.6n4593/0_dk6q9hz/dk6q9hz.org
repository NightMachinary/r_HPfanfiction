That's a tall order... Decent Slytherin!Hermione is rare enough in the first place; but very few authors could even conceive of the possibility of putting Hermione but not Harry into Slytherin. (There's a general tendency in the fandom to portray Hermione as much nicer and more conformist a person than she was in canon, while ascribing to Harry far more personal ambition than he has, so the opposite configuration is far more prevalent.)

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) has Slytherin!Hermione dating a Gryffindor for a while... sort of.

I also recall a very poorly written fic that has Gryffindor!Harry/Slytherin!Hermione 'ship, and I can try to track it down if you want.
