Well, murder is murder. Are you looking for a term like patricide or regicide? As far as I know, there's no specific term like that for killing an entire family line. I've heard it referred to as something something the root and stem, maybe in Game of Thrones?

Hmm, maybe scionicide--killing the last scion of the family?
