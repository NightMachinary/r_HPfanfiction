Luke Skywalker wakes up to find himself on a strange train. He seemed to also have luggage. An owl soared though the window and dropped something into a redheaded boy's hand. "Harry, you're finally awake!" A strange girl said."What" Luke thought"My names not Harry." "Get in your robes ,we're almost at Hogwarts!" The girl said again. "Calm down Hermione" said The redhead. "No, Ron,we are almost there and Harry isn't ready" said the girl(Hermione?)Ron then got up and pulled down luggage, and gave me robes. This nightmare has got to end soon.
