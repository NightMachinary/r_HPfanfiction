That's definitely true. Still, Draco has a ton more "breadth" in terms of characterizations of him that you actually see of him. Daphne is technically a blank slate, but there's kind of 1-2 fanon consensus characterizations that are basically constant. In contrast, Draco can be anything, and it'll generally varies drastically from his actual canon characterization- you can have him be good, bad, whiny, arrogant, assertive, well-raised, a master of Occlumency, etc.

22% of fanfics on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] have him listed in the info box as one of the main characters, which is crazy when Hermione only hits 23.6% and Harry hits 28.5% (Ron is obviously only a major listed character in 6.1% of fics on that website)
