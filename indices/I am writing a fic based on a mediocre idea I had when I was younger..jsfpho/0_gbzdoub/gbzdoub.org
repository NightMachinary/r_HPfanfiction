You may wish to consider the example of Jim Butcher, who got into a "heated discussion" about whether it was better to have a good idea as the basis of a story but have the actual writing being mediocre or to have a cliche idea and put forth a good piece of writing based on it. The "discussion" ended with Butcher challenging his opponent to give him /two/ bad concepts to turn into a story.\\
The ideas were /the Lost Roman Legion/ and /Pokemon/.\\
The end result was the 6-book bestselling Furies series where element-wielding Legionaries and blood-magic using wolfmen fought parasitical insects (and each other, and their own factions...).

The ideas themselves may be important, but what is far, far more important is how you use them, the spin you put on them and the care you take. So long as you consider how the ideas you intend to use will impact on the world that your story is set in, you have a good chance of writing an interesting story.

Just remember that while most people know about Harry Potter, Warhammer is a bit more niche. You will probably need to slot some infodumps into the story to explain the whys and hows, but it should be do-able in a variety of methods. Hermione's resurfacing memories would make a good vector for showing the readers what new skills she's developing and the history/reasoning behind them.
