1) Probably as and when needed to understand what's going on or what just happened. Hermione examining resurfaced memories or other characters trying to deduce what/why from what they know would probably slot into the story best, but explanatory paragraphs from an observer's viewpoint could also work, so long as you keep track of which characters know/have no clue.

2) Fast enough to give her a chance at surviving, slow enough that she doesn't curb-stomp all the bad guys without giving them a chance to prepare.

3) Can't help you there. All I really know about Warhammer is that the Emperor is a psychic lich and the setting is grimderp. And I may be mistaken on those.
