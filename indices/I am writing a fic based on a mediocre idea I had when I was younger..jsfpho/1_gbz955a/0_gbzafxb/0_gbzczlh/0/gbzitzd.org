Well, she might eventually tell him. Her memories are intermitent at first.

The Primarchs were not morally perfect, mind you. They killed xenos by the billions.

She'll return to the Warhammer universe eventually, maybe in a sequel. She'll join up with Roboute Guilliman after his ressurrection. She'll basically be the De-facto Empress of the Imperium, as the Emperor is stuck on the Golden Throne.

Basically, she goes from a young Witch, to a woman who is literally worshipped as a demigod by an entire Galaxy.

Her two personalities will merge, combining Leyla's memories, experience, etc. with Hermione's humanity and compassion. I don't know if she won't still have Leyla as a voice in her head or not, though.

She'll obviously be quite perterbed by people referring to her as 'My lady', 'The Lady Commander' or 'Blessed Primarch.'

This here is a modified quote from Guilliman. I replaced it with Hermione's information. She said this to Voldemort, and the Death Eaters, just before unleashing her fully restored Psychic powers on them,

" I am Leyla Darkwalker, primarch, gene-engineered Daughter of the Emperor of Mankind. I am the Gardener of Gathsmere, the Unifier of the Seven Systems, the Torch of Reason, the Iron Queen. I am the Lady Commander of the Righteous Imperium of Mankind. Empires tremble before me. I was made one hundred centuries before your birth, millennia before your kind existed. I have fought daemons and defied beings that call themselves gods. Species have died at my hand. Now, tell me again, do you not fear me?
