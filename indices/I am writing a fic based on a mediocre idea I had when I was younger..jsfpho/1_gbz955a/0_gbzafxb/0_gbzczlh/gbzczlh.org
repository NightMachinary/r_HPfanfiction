Well, I think it can set up a lot of conflict, especially in HBP. I don't know much about Warhammer, but I searched up what Primarchs are, and idk, it would be really funny to read about Hermione, who's horrible at dueling and extremely socially awkward, dealing with memories of being an almost perfect being as powerful as a god. Would she tell Harry? Would she use her knowledge to aid the war? How would her old personality mesh with her new one? There's just so many possibilities for this story!
