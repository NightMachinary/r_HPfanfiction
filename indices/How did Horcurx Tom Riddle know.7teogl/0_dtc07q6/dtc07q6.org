As far as we know, Diarymort generally picked out his victims from what he'd been told by Ginny/read in Ginny's mind. And yes, he was presumably following the Basilisk around actively, not just releasing her from the Chamber and then just sending Ginny's body back to the dormitories. It's not unreasonable to assume that Ginnymort and the Basilisk encountered several non-muggleborns on the way and Ginnymort memory-charmed them. (It's also the best explanation for why no /Portraits/ saw anything.)

Oh, and ---

  The basilisk could never have figured it out himself, it's just a snake.

Don't underestimate Potterverse snakes --- even the very existence of Parseltongue is enough to show they're more intelligent than we muggles give them credit for. And even then, if Slytherin could "wire" the Basilisk so that she would only obey his true heir by blood rather than any ol'Parselmouth, it's not that much of a stretch that he could have given her some more magical way to know a student's ancestry.
