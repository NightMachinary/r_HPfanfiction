WIP but very dark...not abuse/mistreatment. More eldritch horror..

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed]] The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
