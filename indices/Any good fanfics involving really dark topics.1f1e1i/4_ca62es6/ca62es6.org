There was an extraordinarily dark but thrilling psychological piece called 'Sanitarium' out there, but the author took her stuff down. If you can find a copy, I'd say it's as mature without getting ridiculous as can be expected. The author also wrote an excellent post CoS story about Ginny recovering from Tom's possession in the Chamber, aided by Luna. That was called Glass Houses. Author was greensl33ves - if you can find them, do so, and let me know where.

... but I can't say whether they're good, as my opinion is tainted.
