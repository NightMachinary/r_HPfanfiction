This kinda ties into the class size--I always thought that the First Wizarding War was the reason why there were so many only children around Harry's age.

I'm an only child, so it's my normal, but I realized just how many only children there are. The ones confirmed by the books are: Harry, Hermione (obv not affected by the first war tho), Draco, Luna, Neville. But then we're never told that any of these kids have siblings: Seamus, Pansy, Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini, Lee Jordan, Susan Bones.
