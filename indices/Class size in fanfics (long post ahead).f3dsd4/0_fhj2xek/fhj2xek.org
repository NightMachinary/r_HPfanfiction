*What can we conclude about the number of students attending Hogwarts?*

If there are really eight hundred students then Harry's year seems to be exceptionally small - even more so if there are a thousand.

If, however, we discount JKR's initial estimate of a thousand students as just bad math, and go with her later figure of six hundred, that ties in quite well with an estimate derived from the number of carriages used to transport students from the train, and the population of Hogsmeade. That gives us a student body of around six hundred and forty during Harry's time at Hogwarts, and since Harry's year - conceived when Voldemort was at his most threatening - is clearly unusually small, in other decades the number would be closer to six hundred and sixty. Not all of these, however, have to be accommodated in the dormitories, as there should be around twenty Hogsmeade students per year and these probably live out.

For each house, then, there should be an average of around twenty-three or twenty-four students in a normal year, of whom about five are from Hogsmeade and probably live out. Taking the four houses together, in a normal year there should be about ninety-four students.

Harry's year is probably so unusually small because they are children conceived at the height of Voldemort's power. Witches and wizards presumably have better contraception than Muggles, so they would have the power to choose not to bear a child into a world at war, and probably many would so choose.

It's likely that the year below Harry's (Ginny and Luna's year) is also small. The year below that would be small to normal-sized but heavily weighted towards students born towards the end of the academic year, since there would be a low number of conceptions before Voldemort's fall and sharp rise after it as people celebrated, resulting in a rash of births in late July and August 1982. The year after that would probably be unusually large, thus balancing out the small year just below Harry.

So although the distribution between years would be uneven, by the time Harry reaches fourth year it is possible to work out the numbers as if there was one small year (Harry's) and the rest were fairly average, even though it would really go:

1st year - very large

2nd year - small to average, weighted towards July and August births

3rd year - very small

4th year - very small (Harry's year)

5th year - small to average

6th year - average

7th year - average
