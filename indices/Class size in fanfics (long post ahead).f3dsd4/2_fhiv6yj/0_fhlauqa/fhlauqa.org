My headcanon is that the Sorting Hat sorts children completely randomly, the mental talk it sometimes gives is a completely made-up bluff, and the reason people are seemingly sorted so well according to their personalities/history/desires is a combination of the confirmation bias, Barnum effect, and realistic conflict theory; no matter in which House a child will be sorted into, it will probably feel 'right', and that House will soon turn into their in-group, shaping them even more to its characteristics, and finally fueling the rivalry between the Houses even more.
