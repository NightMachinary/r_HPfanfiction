My understanding is HW classes are exactly 40 students per year, 5 boys and 5 girls in each of the 4 houses. With admission, this is easy as they just need to recruit 20 boys and 20 girls per year. HOWEVER, this makes the sorting rather troublesome as to keep the houses equally staffed, that would mean the last student sorted wouldn't really be sorted, but rather stuck into the last open spot.

My headcanon for this is that magical artifacts like the sorting hat do not experience time the same way we do. All sortings are, from the perspective of the hat, occurring at the same time. That also explains how the sword of Gryffindor keeps getting in there.
