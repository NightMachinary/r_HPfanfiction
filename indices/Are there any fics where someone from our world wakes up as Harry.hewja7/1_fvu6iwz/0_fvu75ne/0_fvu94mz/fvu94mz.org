If the SI were to be Harry it would still be considered an SI. But yeah I'm not aware of any that fit this description. SIs aren't super popular in this fandom (at least compared to say Naruto) so there aren't a ton of well known ones in general. I've seen Draco ones, but I don't think I've seen a Harry one, or even a Ron or Hermione one.
