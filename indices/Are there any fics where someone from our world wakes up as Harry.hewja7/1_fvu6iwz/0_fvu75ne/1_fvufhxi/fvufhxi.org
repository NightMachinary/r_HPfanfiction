Right, I was not exact: one subcategory of SI stories. They are usually just the same as time-travel stories in structure. They think with knowledge of future they can fix everything, but usually situation turns more complicated. I don't care much about them, so I don't remember if I have ever read this type. The only SI story (not of this type) which seemed readable is linkffn(13041698), but that's self-inserted-into-newly-created-character story.
