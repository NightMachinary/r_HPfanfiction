I've never read any, there's no other universe I feel could work properly, except maybe His Dark Materials. If one caught my eye I'd probably give it a go, but I feel like there's enough to explore in HP.

I suppose people who like crossovers are just looking to combine their favourite elements of two different world's, which I imagine can feel quite exciting. It also offers the chance to transplant favourite characters, which could be fun.
