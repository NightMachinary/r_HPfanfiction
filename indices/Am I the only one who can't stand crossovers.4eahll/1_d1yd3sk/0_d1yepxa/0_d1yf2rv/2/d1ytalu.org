I've been trying to think of one since I read this, and I can't. Even alternate dimensions don't guarantee a seamless cross - Star Trek, for example, has established alternate dimensions (the Mirror Universe is proof of at least one), but since magic and technology in HP do not mix, it would take a /lot/ of work (and technobabble, probably) to make them blend for longer than a one-shot or crack fic. So I really can't think of another fandom so easily blended with HP....

Thinking about it has made me think of Narnia's Wood Between the Worlds, though, and made me want a Narnia/HP fic using it. :/ I have no idea what would actually happen, though.
