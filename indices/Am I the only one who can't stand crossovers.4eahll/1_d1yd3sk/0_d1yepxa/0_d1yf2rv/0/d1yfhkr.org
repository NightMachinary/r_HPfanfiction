Well a lot of crossovers are just like, a character or two that gets themselves stuck in another franchise's universe or vice versa. In that sense, the universes don't really have to blend since they never actually interact, just the characters.

But I mena, it's like you said, people mostly just wanna have Hermione Granger interacting with Tony Stark, or Bella Cullen with Luke Skywalker and see what happens.
