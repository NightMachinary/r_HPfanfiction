There are some very well written crossovers out there. The Black Prince is one example that comes to mind right away.

True, the majority of crossovers that use HP as one part fail when it comes to balancing magic to magic/technology. Harry Potter magic is incredibly overpowered. Very destructive spells, mind reading, levitation,... it all comes without cost. There is very little magic that actually takes something from you. It is also instantaneous, very cause and effect and amazingly powerful stuff (relative to other universes) requires very little actual knowledge. Wingardium Leviosa alone could wreck some serious havoc in /a lot/ of other universes.

This balancing is often what separates an average to an excellent crossover. The Black Prince, for example, tackles this issue by making Harry forget about most of what he has learned in the original universe.

Shadow of Angmar, another great piece, takes his tools from him. Without a wand, Harry has to rely on the bit of theory that he knows to do magic with potions.

Or the enemy adapts. A lot of Avenger crossovers have SHIELD develop anti-magic equipment. Star Wars crossovers often use the vastly superior technology of the galaxy to challenge Harry.

Anyway... int the end it comes down to the same thing. Do you like it? Read it! Don't you like it? Close the tab!
