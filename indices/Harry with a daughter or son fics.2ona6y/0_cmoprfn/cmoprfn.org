[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5924318/1/][A Father Divided]]

Harry joins Voldemort as his Apprentice, leaving a pregnant Ginny behind. Eleven years later, James 'Weasley' is on a quest to find out who his father is, who the mystical figure of 'Harry Potter is, and dreaming of one day overthrowing Voldemort's Empire.

Harry needs some time to let his guard down in the war. So he goes to a celebration just before he, Ron and Hermione plan to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Who could have guessed what the consequences would be?

Not a perfect match for what you want, but its a shock for Harry when he finds out that he's going to be a dad when the girl is nearly due.

I can think of 2 others that fit your description, but neither are on my favourites list. One was a daughter with Gabrielle Delacour, she was already an adult when she found Harry on some island near Alaska. The other was a son with a muggle girl. Teddy befriended the boy in their first year and invites him home (to Harry's) over Christmas break. I believe it was a Harry/Daphne story, but I'm not 100% positive.
