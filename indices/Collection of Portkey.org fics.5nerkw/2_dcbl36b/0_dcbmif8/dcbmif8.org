I've not actually read a single one of them, but before I got this all sorted I was asked for a few specific stories that I therefore presume are pretty good:

- Life and Times, by Elban Fehl
- Devil's Lesson One, by The Dark Aeon
- everything by madscientist
- Fixing Harry, by Lynney
- Magic Never Dies, by Lynney
- O, by cheering charm
- Envy, by Twitch E. Littleferret
- Forever Knight, by DeliverMeFromEve, which must be amazing because in a month it became my most asked for story.
