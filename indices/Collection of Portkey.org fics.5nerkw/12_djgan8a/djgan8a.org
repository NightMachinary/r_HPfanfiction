Oh, hi...Ive been really feeling the loss of Portkey and out of desperation Ive been trying to find old stories. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THIS ðŸ˜¢ It would be super cool if you created a fanfiction.com account for this stories. I would like the new generation of readers to know the Harmony existed. Would you please think about it?
