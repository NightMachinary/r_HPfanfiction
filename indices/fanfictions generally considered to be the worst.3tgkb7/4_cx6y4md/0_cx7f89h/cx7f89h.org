No, it just means that the fic is polarizing: many people love it, and many other people hate it. In fact, somewhat paradoxically, a fic has to meet some minimal standard of quality and popularity before it ends up on enough people's radars to be hated by a significant number of people who know it by name (as opposed to "that Harmonian powerful!Harry fic #1234").

Also, HPMOR has the distinction of having attracted a huge number of readers outside of fandom --- and outside of fanfiction communities in the first place --- so how well it's liked in the broader population doesn't necessarily speak to how well it's liked in the fandom.
