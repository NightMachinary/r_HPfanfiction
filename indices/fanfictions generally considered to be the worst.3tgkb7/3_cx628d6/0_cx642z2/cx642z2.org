Agreed. I only enjoy Ron bashing in crackfics where it's clear that it's Ron-In-Name-Only and not just the author working out their anger at the way the original series ended. I didn't like the second half of canon either, but there's no reason to take it out on imaginary characters in derivative works.

Robst's treatment of Ron in that story is a bit scary.
