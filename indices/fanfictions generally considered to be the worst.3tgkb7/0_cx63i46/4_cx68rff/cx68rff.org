  Or am I not allowed to have a preference in sexual media since I'm a straight white cis male?

That depends on your audience. Not liking slash is not homophobia, but some overly-sensitive people seem to think they're one and the same. Speaking of slash, MPREG also seems to be a requirement for poorly written slashy fics, and it's an idea I can't get behind (no pun intended).

Also, I agree with everything you wrote. I've complained a lot about physical age vs mental age before in similar posts as it's one of my biggest pet peeves when reading a fic, and a major reason why I try to stick to crack without romance these days; I've yet to read more than a handful of romance stories involving teenagers that didn't make my skin crawl for some reason or another.

Snape rapes Hermione so he keeps his spy status and then they fall in love happily ever after baby time? *NOPE* me the fuck out!
