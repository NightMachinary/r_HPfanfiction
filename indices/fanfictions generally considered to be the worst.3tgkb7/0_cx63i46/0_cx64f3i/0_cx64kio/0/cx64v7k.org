Given how MeghanReviews treated the horcrux necklace as a plot device to turn Harry into a cuckold, I'd expected the story to be yanked and the author vilified. The rules are quite clear.

I just checked for a link and it's gone! I guess either the author got sick of the awful reviews or the admins finally pulled it.
