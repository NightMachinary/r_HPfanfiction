There are tons of different ways a story can be bad, but I'm starting to get to the point where my metric for a bad story is whether it's fun to read. There are tons of stories that are fun to read but would never win an award for quality writing or 100% original drop-the-HarryPotter-IntellectualProperty-and-it's-still-great Plot, and even then a lot of those are hated by people for very reasonable and obvious things.

There are several examples already in this thread of stories that are just not fun to read for some people:

- My Immortal: It's still up for debate whether it was intended to be bad, but that doesn't stop people from enjoying laughing at it. Personally, I can't stand it, it's not fun for me. Same with other troll stories.

- Partially Kissed Hero: About three-quarters of the way through it takes a turn for the racist and completely loses its plot. That's just not fun. Similarly:

- Unsung Hero: It was very fun, interesting, enjoyable (etc.) for most readers right up until the last chapter when the author started writing a completely new story that didn't fit anything of what was written before, and the sequel was even more off the rocks. The sudden change in direction is jarring and almost universally disliked.

- Harry Crow: It is very, very safe, reusing tired and worn cliches and plot points that are quite enjoyable for those who like that sort of Gentleman Harry doffing his fedora and slaying enemies without breaking a sweat. For those of us here who have been reading as early as 2003, that's simply not fun anymore. It's even less fun when you're an author with several million words written and only a couple dozen reviews while "Harry Kills Wizarding Britain version 17 (or was it 18?)" gets 20 million hits and tens of thousands of reviews.

- HPMOR: I actually thought the plot was kinda fun, but when the author uses it to preach about how awful JKR is, how much better he is, withholds chapters for donations to a charity that pays him, and is just so god awfully arrogant about the whole thing, it takes all of the enjoyment out if it. IRL cases of creators sullying their works through politicization or criminality happen all the time, but one that affected me greatly was Michael Crichton. I love his books. They're fun and interesting despite the late 80s/early 90s pseudo-science (relevant username), but when I learned he was THE face for corporate anti-environmentalism, anti-science, and global warming denial, it hurt. A lot.

Besides plot twists or entire lack of plot, there is also another issue that some stories have, which again is mentioned in other posts already: Squicks*, or things that disgust readers. The obvious big three are rape, pedophilia, and gore.

Many, many popular fics suffer from mental age vs physical age issues. They write their characters like they're late teens/early twenties but then tell you they were born in 1980/1981 and they're currently fourth years in 1994/5 making them 15/14. Sometimes even younger. It might be suitable in a non-romantic plot for the characters to be mid twenties intellectuals in the body of pre-teens, but writing about love and lust at those ages bothers people and can ruin great stories.

Some go even further and build societies (which, to be fair, have existed in real life) that have accepted pedophilia, underage sex, or sexual exploitation of underage characters. While that is a real issue, most people don't read fanfiction to think about those sorts of real world issues.

Rape, especially stories where they raped person eventually comes to love the rapist, is for some people a great plot and fantasy. Other stories have rape for the sake of being violent and personal, or very descriptive gore for, well, really there's no reason for it. Does your story need to have Malfoy and the Goons brutally violate a 12-year old in order to tell us they're bad people? No. Does Luna need to be torn apart by wooden dildo to tell us the society you created is sick and disgusting? No. Does fem-Harry need to operate a child brothel with 4-14 year old kids in order to tell us that she is fucked in the head, dark with a capital WTF, etc.? No.

But those stories exist. Some people can look past the parts they don't like and enjoy the parts they do, often recommending those stories with asterisks and disclaimers. Others simply won't stand for it and are vitriolically and actively opposed to that sort of story, going out of their way to point out and boycott those plots.

Other, lesser squicks also exist. For me personally, stories focused on the dark characters and trying to show them in a good light as if rampaging through the streets killing and destroying everything makes them a complicated character, that just bothers me. Stories that have abusive and violent leads that somehow have their love interest fall for them anyway disgust me (50 shades, along with every Draco/Hermione ever.) I just don't like the dark characters. There's a reason they're dark, and while it may have been daddy issues when they were 14, when they're 30 it's no longer something you can change by crying over a grave or falling in love with a good guy, it's a lifestyle that requires prison and major personality overwrites.

Some people don't like reading slash stories and would consider that something close to a squick. Not because being gay is necessarily disgusting to them, but the plots that hover around the idea of a character being gay aren't fun to them. There are several, all of which I have no interest in reading: PWP/smut, canon except openly gay, closeted/secret but otherwise canon, saving draco/snape/whoever from the dark side, giving up harry to the dark side, etc. Making sexuality of a character a key facet of the plot turns it into a sexual story, and if I'm going to read a sexual story, I'm going to read something that is sexy to me. (Or am I not allowed to have a preference in sexual media since I'm a straight white cis male? (yes I have been told this for not liking slash stories))

But I digress. The point of all of that mess up there is that what the general consensus of this community says is bad, is not necessarily what the consensus of another community might find bad, and especially individual readers and writers. Don't let us tell you what to find fun. By all means allow us experts to critique application of canon and writing ability, but don't skip stories just because we tell you a plot sucks without ample explanation.

Except for troll stories, clear plagiarization, or stories that are completely unedited for spelling or grammar. Those suck universally.
