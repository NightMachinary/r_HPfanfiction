I don't think the author of HPMOR withdrew chapters, he just wrote a chapter /faster/ when his charity got enough money for him to take some time off. It was coming out anyway.

And I think you're confusing Harry being arrogant with the author being arrogant. The author admits Harry acts like a piece of shit all the time, and outside the story he seems to be a really eccentric but not assholish dude. In any case, you're seriously comparing an author being arrogant with Michael Chrichton's behavior? Come on.

I agree with pretty much everything you said besides that though!
