Probably Harry Crow or HPMOR? My Immortal doesn't push people's buttons like those two fics do these days. But until someone polls the entire subreddit it is very relative. I'd say HPMOR gets more gruff because it seems the author comes across as smug, and the internet has a love/hate relationship with smugness.

Now, I don't know about hated, but for a sample of an outrageous fic I'll leave the 30th chapter of /Apprentice and the Necromancer/ linkffn(3733492). In short, Snape and a young Hermione dance some disco at this super cool party he throws for his students in the dorms. And Snape drinks a Guinness.
