I don't think there are many people who consider this to be the /worst/ fanfic. Maybe some people would say it's /most overrated/, but I can't accept, after wading through some truly awful stuff on ff.net, that *HPMOR* is the worst it has to offer, even if the plot personally offends you and you think the author is the anti-christ.
