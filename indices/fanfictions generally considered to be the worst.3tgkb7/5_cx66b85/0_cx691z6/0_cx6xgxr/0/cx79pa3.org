That makes a lot more sense, actually. I must have missed the 'hated' part in the OP, or not really considered it that important. I think that HPMOR is definitely the most 'polarizing' fic I've seen - the people who like it tend to /really/ like it, and those who don't, seem to hate it. I suppose that would make it the possibly most hated as well, although I think Harry Crow might compare because of the random swing towards Islamophobia near the end.
