  I don't think there are many people who consider this to be the worst fanfic

I completely agree! I don't think it is either. But the OP asked for the most 'hated' fanfic. WIthout saying anything about whether I like it or not, I've seen more negative comments about HPMOR than any other fic, so I'd consider it the 'most hated'. There are thousands upon thousands of fics /worse/ than HPMOR for sure. *EDIT* I looked back at what the OP said and he did say 'worst', but also 'hated', I focused on the hated. I don't think worst and hated converge in any particular fic really. Assuming for the moment that /My Immortal/ was meant to be real FFN and not parody, it could likely be called the /worst/ fic. But hated? No. People probably either disregard it or chuckle at it, but not hate it.
