"The problem isn't as bad if you assume that all families of Europe sleep with each other"

That is what I think what happens. For wizards distances play less of a role, and so in the pureblood society people married across country-lines for ages. Canon doesn't say much about that either way.

Also, this means that the probability of new genes entering the pool is raised quite a bit (Who can tell that the mother of this girl over in poland was a half-blood over here in England?)

Also, half-bloods seem to be acceptable for many families.

And finally we have magic who makes sure people don't die when hit with a canonball at high speeds ("Quaffels") - a bit of 'correct the problems of incest' ahould be possible.

I mean we have quarter-goblins, quarter-veelas, half-giants, ... - Magic can be used to breed.
