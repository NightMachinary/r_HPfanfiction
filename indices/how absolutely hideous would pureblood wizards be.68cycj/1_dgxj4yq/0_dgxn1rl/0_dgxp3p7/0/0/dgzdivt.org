I think it was less about the fact that the Gaunts married close as it was that they never married far so it was a close breeding generation after generation after generation and that is what made something go wrong.

It's the same with real-life incest: have people close to each other get a kid once and the chance of something being wrong with the kid is only minimally higher than normally; have it happen again and again and again, however, and it becomes almost guaranteed once enough generations pass.
