Anecdotally, I've once read a fic where the /magical/ community of Australia was formed not out of actual scum but rather of decent people who got fed up with something and used the laws to get exiled there. I do remember it started with some floor-level bureaucrat who was told to do something with the whole thing and disagreed with it so badly that he was the first one to get exiled (by stealing a loaf of bread, I believe, though I might be wrong as it's been a long time since I've read it).

So yeah, there could be just scum in the Australian magical community, or it could be that someone saw it as an opportunity and pulled decent people into it and it's not a complete cesspool. As canon doesn't touch on it it really could go both ways.
