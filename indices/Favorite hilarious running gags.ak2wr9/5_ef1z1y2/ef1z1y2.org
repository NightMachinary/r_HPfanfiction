There's a Drarry fic where Harry admits to watching Ginny's dot from time to time and Ron and Hermione exchange looks and say "Her... dot?" And Harry explains he means her dot on the Marauder's map. He never clues in even when he mentions Draco's dot in a second conversation and Ron and Hermione exchange amused looks.

Makes me chuckle. Can't remember which fic though.
