Their was a fic i read where Sirius' ghost is helping harry get over his death before passing on to the afterlife. And on the last day they have together basically as a final test to make sure Harry is ok Sirius says to him "now remember to snog the first hot girl you see" and harry looks at him and asks "are you serious right now?!"

Sirius smirks and replies as he starts moving on "I am dead sirius"
