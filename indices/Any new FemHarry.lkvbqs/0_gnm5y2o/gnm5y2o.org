By "new", do you mean started recently, or just recently updated? I don't know any brand-new ones, but several are actively updating.

linkffn(Victoria Potter) is fairly popular, but I personally am not all that enthusiastic about it. Taure is a talented writer, though; you may well like it better than I do.

I do really like linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense); the author has a great sense of humour, and has been very clever about weaving in canon elements in a different way, while still telling a highly original story.
