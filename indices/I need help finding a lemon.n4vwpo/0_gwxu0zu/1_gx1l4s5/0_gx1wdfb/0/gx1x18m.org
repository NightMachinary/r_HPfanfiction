I am logged in, and even double checked, because sometimes I think that I am logged in, but am not. But when I go to my history, and go back to the last time I read one of their works, there is a red lock next to the author's name. I don't really know what that means, but I do know that a blue lock means that it is accessible to logged in users only. Is it safe to assume that the red lock means something similar?
