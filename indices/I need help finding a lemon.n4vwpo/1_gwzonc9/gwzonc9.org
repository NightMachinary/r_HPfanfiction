It also could be the one where they are finding hermione's parents in AUS and the AUS government kidnaps ron cause they want his pureblood baby batter and by they I mean umbridges cousin who devises this evil plan to bring back the purebloods and its super strange seeing all these pureblood elitists fawn over ron because everyone in AUS is sterile. Even hermione has to stake claim on harry and hit the other women who are begging for harrys children. Its kinda strangely awesome, but incomplete iirc
