Depends how young they are. Younger than 5, something like “Yor an eevil wich” might be likely because all the letters in the words there sound right, they're just not spelt right. If they're a little older then they've probably had more spelling drilled into them so younger than 8 and “your/you're an evil witch/which”, and if they're older than eight just write it normally.
