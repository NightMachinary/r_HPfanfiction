I mean, technically there's the second of the Ghost in my Town series by Batsutousai. He (Harry) is reincarnated into the AU with his folks and actively lives through Voldemort winning the war, but most of the story focuses on things after that point. The first in the series has him being a Werewolf creature-rights activist.
