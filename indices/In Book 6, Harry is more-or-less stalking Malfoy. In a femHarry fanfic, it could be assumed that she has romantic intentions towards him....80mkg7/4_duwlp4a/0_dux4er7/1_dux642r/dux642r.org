If Harry was among the oldest in his class rather than among the youngest, I'd have said Cedric; eighteen dating sixteen (even with one out of school) isn't an issue, that's a high school senior dating a sophomore.

How about Krum? He's already shown he'll date young, Durmstrang's reputation qualifies for edgy, and famous dating famous gives an easy way for the relationship to have started.
