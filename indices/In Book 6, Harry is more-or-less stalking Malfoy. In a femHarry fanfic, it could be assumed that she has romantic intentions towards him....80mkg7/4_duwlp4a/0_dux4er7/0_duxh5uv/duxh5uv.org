He's a horrible person. No. Harry being female doesn't change this. I don't know why you seem to believe that every girl would date a fucking horrible person just because they might have a "bad boy" vibe.

Why? Harry/fem!Harry doesn't know anything about him, except that he's cool with Malfoy. She wouldn't go after Blaise.
