  In a fem!Harry story, would she be proactive in getting a date? Harry in 6th year is interested in Ginny, though I don't recall him asking her out and he spends more time stalking Draco.

No. She'd be spoiled for choice as the girl-who-lived. She'd be invited to plenty of Hogsmeade Dates. Her reaction to that depends of course how you write her.

  How easy would it be for a attentive bystander to mistake the rivalry(?) between fem!Harry and Draco for sexual tension?
#+end_quote

Very hard. They hate each other's guts, changing Harry's gender shouldn't change that. Draco is not just pulling pigtails, he wants to see Harry/Hermione/Ron dead.

  How interesting is Canon!Draco from female perspective? Also, what aspects of his personality kill all such interests?
#+end_quote

There's always a certain attractiveness of a bad boy. Though his arrogance and unpleasantness should make it hard to like him for anyone who isn't already in the Malfoys favor. In case of Harry or Harriet he/she would have a pretty hard time appreciating a guy who's best buddies with the terrorists who murdered her parents. Kills the libido quick I'd assume.
