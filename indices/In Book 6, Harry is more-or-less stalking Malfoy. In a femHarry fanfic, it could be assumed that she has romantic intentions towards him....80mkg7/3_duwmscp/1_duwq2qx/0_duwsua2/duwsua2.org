Uhm IMHO bring reserved and not so outgoing is a much bigger problem for boys than girls. Hogwarts seems to be relatively traditional in that boys are expected to approach girls for dates (excluding exceptions).

What do you mean about love potions? Do you think it's funny when a girl does it to a boy, but ugly when the genders are reversed?!
