If that was your only point of divergence, a lot of the plot-points of cannon would still have to come up, but it could easily be a major divergence point. You could easily envision the plot unfolding radically differently with a friendly Harry/Snape relationship:

- Harry suspecting someone else for the Sorcerers Stone
- Snape telling Harry of the Prophecy early
- Snape shuttind won Slytherin bullying
- Harry's appeals about Sirius having some effect
- Snape being more serious about the attempt to kill harry via the Tournament
- Snape not scaring away the Trio when they want to tell a teacher about the Basalisk

I'm someone who likes single-point-of-divergence stories, and I do get turned off by stories where too much changes (or it is set up as a small change and suddenly somehow that means 40 other unrelated things change). Using Snape's attitude as a point of divergence is something I could swallow pretty easily.
