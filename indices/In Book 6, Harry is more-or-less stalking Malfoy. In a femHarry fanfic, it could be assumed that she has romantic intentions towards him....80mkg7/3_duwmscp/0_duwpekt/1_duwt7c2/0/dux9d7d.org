Really? If you wanted, you could have a Snape with a different attitude easily be a major divergence point.

Besides the obvious (Any competent adult should have put a stop to a ton of what was happening in the series), A non-hostile snape would not have been a suspect in the first book, would have had a very different direction on coaching the mental stuff, requires a different teacher-antagonist to be inserted for drama.

I think there were several points where Snape was shown to be blinded by his history where if he had believed the trio things would have happened very differently...
