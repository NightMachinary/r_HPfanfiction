You do realize that they weren't actually sending Lockhart to do anything, right? They all knew he couldn't do a thing, they were just getting him out of their way so the actual competent faculty could work out what to do. Of course Harry and Ron don't understand this, they're kids and they're too worried about Ginny to focus on what's going on, but it's pretty clear. There are a lot of things you can criticize the teachers at Hogwarts for, but this is not one of them.
