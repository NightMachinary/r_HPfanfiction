I think this is an accurate reaction that Ron would have. He does have problems with dealing with emotions and he was probably struggling with preemptive grief, if he wasn't worried about getting caught he would have acted this way, even if he didn't whole-heartedly believe what he was saying. Just like he was mean to Hermione and Harry because he liked her, not because he actually distrusted them. The author is also not criticizing the teachers, but creating their own plot, and there's nothing wrong with that. The series is meant to be expanded upon now, the point of this subreddit is to post your stories, they're often not bashing, but a new, creative idea.
