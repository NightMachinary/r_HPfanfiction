There are alot of those I think. They're mostly on WBWL(Wrong Boy-Who-Lived) stories. The closest I can think of is this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7353678/1/Fraterculus][Fraterculus]] - bloodsox88 - Harry is not the BWL, his brother is. He's two years older. I can't remember if Nev's parents are alright but I remember Bellatrix is free here so they probably are. Harry also befriends the twins. And his brother, who is born in 1980, is friends with Hermione. linkffn(7353678)
