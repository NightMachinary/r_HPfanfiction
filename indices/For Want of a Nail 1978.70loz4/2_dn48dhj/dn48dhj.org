I don't want to read some WBWL - I would like it to be Harry - with caring friends who are intelligent and won't abandon him. I think it would be nice if Harry was actually a slightly normal kid, got to figure out who he was, and learn his place in the world.

I mean think about it - he was abused, then he learnt he was a wizard, his parents killed by an insane warlord, and the person who killed them is coming back - oh, and he kills a professor too, at ELEVEN. All within what, a year?
