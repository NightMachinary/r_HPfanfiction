I'd at least appreciate it if there was some originality into the supposed secrets. A portrait of Slytherin helping Harry complete rituals and directing him towards a library of Parselmagic can hardly be considered exciting anymore. Not saying those plot points are necessarily bad or anything, just that they've become commonplace.
