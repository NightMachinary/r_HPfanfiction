If only it was revisited in Half-Blood Prince. I mean, Harry was seeing that Riddle was a half-blood through the memories with Dumbledore so he might have thought the book belonged to him as well as and maybe there was something hidden there. I mean, it would have made more sense to find the Diadem in the Chamber since both held a special connection for Tom: the Chamber for his blood of Slytherin and the diadem because it belonged to a Founder. Instead, it's in the RoR which makes no sense as we never saw Riddle go there and only had a tie-in when Harry had to stash the Half-Blood Prince's book.
