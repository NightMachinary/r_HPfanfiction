Well, the Chamber's sheer existence is a salient point, I think. It's a room within Hogwarts that only one person can access (in theory), a perfect hideout for /anything/. I have the headcanon that its enchantments are separate from the Castle and controlled by the Heir, allowing them to Apparate to and from the Chamber, too.
