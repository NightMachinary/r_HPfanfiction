The chamber didn't lay waiting until Tom came along. Basically every Gaunt has been there. The place was likely raided a long time ago for anything Slytherin left behind. After all if you were going to leave a place forever why leave things you want behind? The chamber itself is now likely nothing more than a great place to do things... in secret.

Also of note that pottermore link contains hilarious information. Until the wizards copied muggles with the creation of toilets they would just shit wherever they happened to be at the time.
