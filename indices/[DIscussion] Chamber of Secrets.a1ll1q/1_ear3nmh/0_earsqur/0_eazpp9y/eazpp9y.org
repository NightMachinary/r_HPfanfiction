I think I prefer the theory I saw in a fic, that wizards have always had "modern plumbing," by having ruins on the taps/toilets that conjured water, and ruins on the drain to vanish it (and waste), and that the bathrooms were only upgraded in appearance over time. Also that the pipes were put there by Slytherin rather than having plumbing large enough to fit a giant fuck off snake in it.
