The actual purpose of the Chamber of Secrets may have been something different from its modern name. Salazar is a basque name, and one of the figures from basque mythology is Sugaar, a serpent deity that lives in a cave and comes out to father storms on the goddess of the weather. Having a cave with a dirty great big snake in it might well have been of significant mystical and/or magical importance to a basque wizard. I mean, OK, I'm pretty sure JKR didn't realise the origins of the name she picked (she says she got it from the portuguese dictator) but by a series of happy accidents it fits really, really well that he'd build a snake temple underground.
