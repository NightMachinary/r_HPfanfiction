I like this story too. In canon and many fanfics we discover the magical world through the eyes of someone entering into the world for the first time. There's surprise, there's awe, there's a sense of discovery. I find that same sense of discovery in this fic, except it is the other way around, from the magical world to the muggle.

Here Draco is entering into a different culture and a completely different life than he is used to. He is not so much discovering a world as he is discovering a new life away from the demons of his past. Most importantly, Draco is discovering /himself/; he is actually thinking for himself for the first time in his life, now that his previous world-view has been proven to be untenable, now that he is way from the influence of his family and the expectations of his former society.

When Draco goes back to the wizarding world, he is going to be a much changed man. I look forward to how he handles the situation back home.
