I greatly enjoy this story. A fic that actually has Draco being the pathetic, mediocre fool that he is in canon? Finally.

The pacing is slow, but major changes to a person takes time, and Draco needs/needed to first figure out who he was. However, in the currently 45 chapters, about 3 years I want to say have passed by, so pacing isn't HPMoR bad.

  Also, we see his first connection to Astoria, though we do not know yet how they are going to get together.

[[/spoiler][If you read the author's other fics --specifically Ravenclaw, Ravenclaw? Ravenclaw!-- you'll find out that his wife isn't Astoria, but rather a woman named Vivian. And it's implied she's a Muggle. Just because the fic starts from a canon position, doesn't mean the outcome is canon.]]
