Ah. Well, these news killed a /little/ bit of my payoff anticipation (mostly, because seeing Draco interact with a member of his former circle would be fun), but the fic is still great.

And yeah, three years in 45 chapters isn't that bad. Bennybear definitely manages to keep the book entertaining despite the slow pace. I especially like their idea of changing the refrain - despite the fact, that each summer starts in the same village, every time both village and Draco are different enough to make their interactions very fresh.
