This is actually pretty sweet. It's sad that Asha's mom was neglectful, but at least she has a template of how NOT to be a parent. Of course, looking at it from a psychological standpoint shes going to run into some trouble if that's all she's got going for her knowledge-wise, she might wanna read some parenting books and try to encourage Harry yo be independent while trying not to seem like shes pushing him away. He's been suffering abuse both physical and mental for years now so he'll take whatever affection shell give him but will react pretty harshly when shes being negative, and the way she is right now, there is either going to be a lot of misunderstandings or shes going to get very frustrated with his behavior.
