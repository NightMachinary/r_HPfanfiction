Oh no I don't have an Ao3! :( Another Reddit friend asked me about getting one too though, so I guess if two people are asking then I should already... :)

And thank you! I want to write it in a way to show how even unintentional neglect is harmful. Or on the other side of the coin, how TRYING YOUR BEST sometimes just isn't good enough. Asha isn't a bad person, and she's trying, even if she has a lot of issues, but she's still a BAD PARENT. And that's still going to affect Harry. Because her bare minimum is still awful.
