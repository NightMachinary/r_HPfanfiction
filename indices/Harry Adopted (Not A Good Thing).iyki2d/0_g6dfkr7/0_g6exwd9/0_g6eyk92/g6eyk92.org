Oh wow you read chapter 2 also? Thank you for calling it visceral and uncomfortable! I wanted to go for that kind of effect. That you can tell it's still awful throughout. That Asha is still awful even if she's trying not to be. She has really skewed thoughts and ideas and rationales about things because of her own bad childhood, and it's kind of gross and not okay still. :) That she's a nice person, but her fucked up headspace makes her a bad PARENT. I also made them kind of opposites in a way, about physical contact. Harry is desperate for it after not having it, while Asha associates it with negativity after her one attempt with her mother got her rejected - and the rest of her childhood went the same way. So she just has this huge disconnect and wants nothing to do with it ever.
