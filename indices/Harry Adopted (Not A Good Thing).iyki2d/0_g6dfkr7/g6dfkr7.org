Well this could be a super sad sort of story. Especially if Harry is just happy and doesn't even realize it's just as bad in its own way... :( Saving this PROMPT so I can turn it into a real story in my fanfics folder soon.

EDIT: Okay I started the first chapter to this fic idea! I posted it on my fanfic.net account. :) I won't post another self promotion though, because those never do well!!!
