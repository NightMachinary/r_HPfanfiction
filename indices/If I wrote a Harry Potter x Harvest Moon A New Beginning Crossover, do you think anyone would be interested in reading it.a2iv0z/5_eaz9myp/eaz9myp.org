Personally I wouldn't, simply because magic would make having a farm really really easy and if harry didn't use it for whatever plot related reason it would feel forced and that would be off putting to me.

But that's just me, plus, I've seen plenty of popular fics that would match the tone for a fic like this, I'm guessing slice-of-life/family since there's not much else to do, unless you took it in a PTSD!Harry direction but it would end up being the same in the end, taking care of a farm/godson with not much else to do.
