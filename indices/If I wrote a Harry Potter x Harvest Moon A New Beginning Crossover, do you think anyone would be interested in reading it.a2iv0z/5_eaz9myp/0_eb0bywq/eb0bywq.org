Oh, I don't know if my post was clear about this, but Harry is moving to one of the game towns, but not necessarily becoming a farmer. I plan to have a different character farming, most likely.

I am considering that type of approach with Harry, but I'll just have to see where the muse takes me, I suppose.

Thanks for your feedback!
