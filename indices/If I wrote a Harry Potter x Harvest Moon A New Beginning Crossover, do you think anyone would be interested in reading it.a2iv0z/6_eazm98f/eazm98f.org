Probably not. The worlds those characters live in are just too different for them to pull off 'always in the same world'. I say the same for most crossovers that involve saying 'oh yea there is those whole bit of reality that co-exists but we never mentioned it'.

HM is just a bit too fantastical to believe it just exists in the muggle world (and if you cut everything that makes it HM, then why not just do "HP retires to a farm", no need to make it HM). And if it was say, magical, you would think someone would say something at some point.

(This goes for a lot of 'they always coexisted' crossovers. DCU/HP crossover? No-one from HP ever mentions Superman? Really? Or Zatanna?). I really only go for those when it is clearly reasonable that the two would would have never interacted. (HP/Xanth? Sure!).

Not to discourage you though, a lot of people don't have that problem and there are a ton of those fics around :).

But personally I prefer the 'sucked into an alternate dimension' (stuck in a game, whatever) as a means for a crossover. Or the 'our storyline is different, because the Muggle game was somehow based on our magical wizarding farming community without knowing' Or something :).
