If someone sends a spelling/grammar/technical correction, or points out a basic continuity mistake thing like 'Neville was female in chapter one, and she was sorted into Hufflepuff in chapter four, but in this chapter is back to being a male Gryffindor?' I'll thank them and make the correction. I have so many different AUs in progress at once that I make these kind of which-story-who-what type of mistake frequently, and since I run without a beta typos can slip through.

In fact, I'd almost rather a 'Just so you know, you spelled Voldemort as Voldemtro' than 'pls update soon'; to me a correction shows much more engagement and care. I'm immensely grateful that they were paying that much attention, and willing to take the time to point it out to me so I could make my story better.

If it's something more basic, like 'your Harry is boring and weak, completely OOC, and lacks any meaningful drive in this story' well. . . that's not as easy to correct. I still deeply appreciate it, and I'll take it into account moving forward, but I write fanfiction loose and casually, and hardcore deep edits are something I just don't have time for.

Either way, I don't care if it's public or not. I have nothing to hide. Plot problems and typos happen, and given the choice between everyone seeing the correction or me not being informed, I'd take public every time.
