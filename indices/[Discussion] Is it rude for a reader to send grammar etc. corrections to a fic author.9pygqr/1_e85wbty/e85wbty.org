100%, like if I'm writing something and I misspell something or my dyslexia absolutely kills me in a paragraph, sure tell me and give me the chapter and were cool. But then you have those fics where you're pretty sure the author hasn't had an enligh language course since 5th grade, and all of the comments are about how they can barely read the first paragraph without a linguist to determine what word that was even supposed to be in the paragraph...I feel like theres a time and place and if you notice something that not alot of people would even take the time to comment on then sure send off the message.
