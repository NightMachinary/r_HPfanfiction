As an author, I'm open to them and keep a list of things to fix for when I do a major edit of the work. As a reader I try to give feedback before pointing out issues, but sometimes when things confuse me (like some one referring to Filch as a professor when they had actually meant Flitwick) I just ask why they did that. Depending on how the author responds (i.e. if they're rude or insulting about it) I may decide that the fic is not worth reading. You publish work to get feedback and not all that feedback is going to be positive, so either ignore negative reviews or respond to them in a polite manner.
