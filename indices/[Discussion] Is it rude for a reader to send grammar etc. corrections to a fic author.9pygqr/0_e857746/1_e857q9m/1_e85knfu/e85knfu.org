As an author, I wouldn't really mind corections, unless it is a few typos, as everyone has already suggested - I know we should spell check before posting and proofread, but sometimes a word or two might get missed and I would count that as nitpicking. But if I am making an error that is leading someone to get confused about the story or hindering their reading, I would definitely like to know and improve. One of my readers recently suggested a few cases, which were not errors but descriptions I could expand upon to make the reading more enjoyable and I was very glad they did it. What helped was also that they were very specific about their points and also polite.
