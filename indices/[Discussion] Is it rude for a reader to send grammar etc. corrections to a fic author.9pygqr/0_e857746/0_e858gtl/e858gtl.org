It also depends on the author.

If it's a couple small things tacked on to the end of a comment, that would probably be fine for most people. But if it's a bunch of stuff or anything that would need major reworking, check to see if the author asks for constructive criticism in any of the author's notes.

If they don't, maybe just say you really like the fic and offer to beta. That way they can just turn you down if they're not interested.

Some people don't want to put in more work than they already are into something they're doing just for fun, in which case pointing out faults is just discouraging.
