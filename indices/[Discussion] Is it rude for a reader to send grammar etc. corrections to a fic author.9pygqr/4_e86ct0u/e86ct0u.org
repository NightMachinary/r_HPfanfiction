I'm fine with it in general, as long as you aren't being rude about it. A "hey, you've got a few mistakes in this paragraph" or "you keep mixing up there/their" or "didn't you say X happened before? Now you're saying Y happened" don't phase me, they're actually helpful.

But if it's just "Wow, how cliche!" or "Your spelling sucks" then why bother? Not specific enough to give me anything to go on.
