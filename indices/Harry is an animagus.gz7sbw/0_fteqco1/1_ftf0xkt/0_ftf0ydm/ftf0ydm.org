#+begin_quote
  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus.  Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Severe Ron bashing ahead.  Rated M for crude language, even cruder humour, and sexual situations
