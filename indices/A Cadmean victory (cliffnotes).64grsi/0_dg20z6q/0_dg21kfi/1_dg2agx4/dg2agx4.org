It never shows Dumbledore doing great magical feats, but i don't think he ever gets to that level. Most students sure, but not Dumbledore/Voldemort level.

He is quite smart, but not at the level of 'i know everything about everything'. His relationship with most people starts out antagonistic and slowly changes to indifferent. There are some exceptions, but it isn't really a fic about large friend circles and group hugs.

It is a good fic, and everyone has their own opinion about it. I feel that everyone should read it at least once.
