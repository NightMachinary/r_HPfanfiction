Well, who knows how long this'll last. But kathryn518 writes massive chapters and it seems to take her quite a long time to do so. Just take a look at the publish date and updated date on her longer works and then divide that by the number of chapters she has for those stories. It gives plenty of evidence on its own that she only does a chapter or two a year, and that's when she doesn't suddenly decide to start a new project like Powerful Magical Artifact or a lengthy one-shot like Not Dumbledore.
