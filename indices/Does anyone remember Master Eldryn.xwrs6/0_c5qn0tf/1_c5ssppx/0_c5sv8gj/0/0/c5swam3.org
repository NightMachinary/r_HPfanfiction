/"I was simply wondering why he would wish to remain unpublished if he had already published them himself."/

Uhh... that's clearly NOT what you meant in your previous post. But no worries... you don't need to save face on the internet.

/"I mean if they have been on the internet in the past how does it qualify as remaining unpublished to give out the stories again now?"/

About nine years ago, there were multiple issues with plagiarism, and then banning issues with his ff.net account, so Eldryn removed his stories altogether, told his readers he didn't want to see them in print, and vanished.

Basically, people sharing his fics without his permission is what led him to rage quit the fandom. I respect his decision.

/"Also, why share that you had the authors works if you weren't willing to share?"/

Just to make you angry. :)
