A few ðŸ˜Š mostly recommended from the ATYD discord.

linkao3(Dress Up in you by MsKingBean89) - Muggle Wolfstar. Same author and it's just bloody adorable ðŸ˜….

linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge) - A raising Harry story with decently similar ATYD vibes ðŸ˜Š. Adorable but with enough mystery and tension to be interesting.

linkao3(Calibration by TheDivineComedian) - Everything by TheDivineComedian is brilliant. They really capture Remus well and expand on the world of HP. You can slot their work around ATYD and it fits perfectly.

linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) - A Sirius doesnt die fic. Great Wolfstar. Really heartwarming, again with enough drama to be interesting!
