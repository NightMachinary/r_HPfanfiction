Oh yes James was sooo good in this fic like just so well done and I just loved all the scenes with him it hurt me so much that that James never got to be in Harry's life.

Yeah I would have liked to see the time him and Sirius spent together in the house and interacting with Harry but I guess we have the canon interactions with Harry and can assume how their year there went. And I'm glad that Out of the Blue showed him being at least happy in that wedding picture with Tonks even if he looked tired and skinny and grant knew he had taken Sirius death really really hard. I'm so curious as to how the author would have portrayed Tonks and Remus together and the birth of Teddy not gonna lie.
