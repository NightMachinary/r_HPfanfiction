Little off topic, I know...

The Wormwoods were terrible people, but I can't help but think that their abuse of Matilda was rather mild, relative to the abuse Harry got subjected to.

Near as I can tell, a lot of what Matilda went through with her family was mostly down to her and them not really connecting, as opposed to the deliberate ostracism Harry suffered. It always seemed to me that the Dursleys wanted Harry miserable and downtrodden, but with Matilda, the Wormwoods just didn't understand why she wasn't happy(not that they tried very hard to understand).
