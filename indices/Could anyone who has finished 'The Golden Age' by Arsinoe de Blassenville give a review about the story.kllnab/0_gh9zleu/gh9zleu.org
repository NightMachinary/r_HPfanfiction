I'd say that description is pretty accurate - the author extrapolates the worst features of the canon characters and the wizarding world. It's quite readable though.

If you want something uplifting then linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge]]) by the same author is the opposite; everyone, including Snape, is their best self and Voldemort is defeated by competent and responsible adults.
