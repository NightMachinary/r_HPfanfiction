I don't think of it as deconstruction or hate. It's a story where the worst qualities of everyone are exacerbated and amplified, but in my opinion it's played for laughs. More of a crack fic than a hate fic, imo.

That being said, if you can't handle reading an AU where the main characters are flawed and their flaws directly ruin their lives then don't read it, but I thought it was a good read. Hilarious at times.
