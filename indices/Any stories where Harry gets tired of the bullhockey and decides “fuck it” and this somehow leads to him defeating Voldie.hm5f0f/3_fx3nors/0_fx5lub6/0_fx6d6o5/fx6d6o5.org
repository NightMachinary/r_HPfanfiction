I recall a fair amount of them being Harry/Daphne or Harry/Hermione; if it's not the latter, then expect her to be bashed a lot in most indie!Harry stories. A few more are typical harem stories.

Though there are /a lot/ of Harmony fics, so you may be better served just looking for Harry/Daphne ones; and while i recall a few genuinely good romances, those area bit harder to find; most Harry/Daphne fics i recall are your typical Grey!Harry, Dumbledore (and sometimes Weasley) bashing fics.
