Not particularly.

My theory -

A camera actually reflects the light multiple times, and what Colin saw was a reflection. Harry, on the other hand wears glasses which are transparent and most likely wouldn't stop the magical powers of the gaze. We know that the light gets reflected but the magical power doesn't (probably) and that while the light reflects on the mirror, the magical energy passes through or is absorbed like any other inanimate object.
