Meh, I mostly just want it to work because fanfiction and we already have Cyclops-Harry shooting Killing Curses out his eyes by accident :-P.

Honestly I have no idea what'd actually happen. Myrtle had been crying when she died, and I know from experience that kids who wear glasses will push them out of the way to rub at their eyes when they cry so I'm assuming that's what happened there - but if she didn't, that invalidates this entire argument.

Unless of course Harry's glasses are in turn magic (I mean, he shoots Killing Curses out his eyes - makes sense for his glasses to be charmed to stop that effect), in which case I'd rule that neither Harry nor the Basilisk would die as the effects are so similar the glasses would deal with both.
