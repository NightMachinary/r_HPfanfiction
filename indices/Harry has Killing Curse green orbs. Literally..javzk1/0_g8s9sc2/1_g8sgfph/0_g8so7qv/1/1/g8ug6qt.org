Not every petrification was by reflection - Justin Finch-Fletchley was petrified after seeing it through the translucent Sir Nicholas. It could then be argued the the magic part was partially absorbed by the ghost, but it's simpler to say that direct eye contact kills and anything else is less lethal. After all, basilisks were first bred in times long before glasses were invented, let alone easily produced, so they were still incredibly lethal when they were invented.
