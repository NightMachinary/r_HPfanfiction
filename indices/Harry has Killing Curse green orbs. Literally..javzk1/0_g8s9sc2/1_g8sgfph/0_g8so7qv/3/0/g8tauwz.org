Yeah, it should fall squarely under "children's literature, don't think too hard or it won't make sense anymore". But then those are usually the most fun discussions to have.

Also I doubt most parents would give anything but a relatively cheap and simple, "the viewfinder is basically just a magnifying glass somewhere at the top with no mirrors anywhere" type camera to an excitable 11 year old - so it's probably about the same protection wise.
