Plot twist: Both survive because the magic in Harry's eyes is so similar to a Basilisk's gaze that they cancel each other out lethality-wise. Basilisks judge their mate by the strength of their magical gaze, and Harry has the strongest gaze the Basilisk has ever seen (which, to be fair, isn't hard given it had never seen another basilisk before).

Harry gains a fanon-Ginny level stalker who also happens to be a sixty-plus foot, thousand year old snake.

This is how Hogwarts/Giant Squid type crack-pairings are born.
