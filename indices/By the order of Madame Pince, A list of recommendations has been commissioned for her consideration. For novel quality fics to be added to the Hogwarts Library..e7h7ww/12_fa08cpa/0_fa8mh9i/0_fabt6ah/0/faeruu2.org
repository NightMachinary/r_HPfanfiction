I've just started the 4th now, what is LIFE. Gah it's all so good. I love long chapters, and I don't mind long waits. One of my favorite long af stories seems to update about once a year and it's worth it. Even if they've stopped updating, a good story is always worth the read and wait, even if unfinished :]
