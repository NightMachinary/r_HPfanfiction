Wow! I had never heard of Pureblood Pretense, but the description sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try....and HOLY CRAP! Just finished the first book and it was so so good! Completely original and unique and I love her interpretations of magic and the characters. I'm excited there are 2 more long stories I get to read and an unfinished 4th that's still continuing. I've been in a slump, not being able to find any good fics in awhile so THANKYOU! I've spent my whole sunday binge reading this, bout to spend the rest of the week now too... BUT ITS WORTH IT :D <3 <3 <3
