"What is going on Ron?" Harry asked looking around The Great Hall which was bustling with activity. Some one was levitating huge piles of presents to the middle; he was not sure but it might be Proffesor Flitwick. A few strange...beings were sitting there looking at a book that looked huge. He was not sure how the table was able to hold it's weight. He doubted that even Hermione would be able to read it. And how were they even reading it? The pages were just a blur to him; they were turning so fast. But the strangest thing was the hundreds of people looking exactly like Dumbledore who seemed to disappearing and reappearing in the blink of an eye. All of them held a large rucksack and had one of the strange being by their side who were holding their hands.

"Oh that, it is just one of the things Dumbledore likes doing." He blinked. He opened his mouth to ask what he meant before Ron continued. "I think it is going to every single family and giving them presents to spread light or something. I can't wait to show you my new exclusive chess set." He said while rubbing his hands.

"How does he know what you want?" He asked confused. None of this was making any sense. But Ron was not paying attention to him. He was going out of the Hall he had dragged him to to grab some gingerbread cookies. He did not even let him open the presents he got and had all but dragged him down here. "Come on Harry, don't you want to open your presents." He was pretty sure that Ron had dragged him down here just to show him this as he ran after his friend.
