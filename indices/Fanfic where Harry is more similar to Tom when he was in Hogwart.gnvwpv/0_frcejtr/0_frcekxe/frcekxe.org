Severus raised an eyebrow at that, but chose to ignore it. “You can do things, can't you Mr Potter?” Severus asked tightly, seeing that the boy was looking star-struck at his letter. “Things other children can't.”

The boy lifted his head and smiled so beautifully at Severus, much like Lily used to, making his heart clench. “I can move things without touching them,” He confessed in a near-whisper. “I can make animals to things for me without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.” He said gleefully. “I can make them /hurt/ if I want to. Can you do the same?”

“Can you do the same, Sir.” Severus corrected. Leave it to Potter's brat to not have any semblance of manners. “And yes, I can."

“Prove it.” The boy said stubbornly. Skeptically.

Severus took out his wand and uttered a simple reducto to a vase, breaking it, before using a simple repairo to fix it. The boy looked at him in awe, making Severus a little smug.

“Hogwarts will let you learn all this, and how to control your magic.” He stood up. “Come. We shall go and shop for your school supplies.”

“We?” The boy asked. “Can't I do it myself? I'm used to it.”

All the more better for him, then. Severus would prefer to not spend any more time with the boy than necessary. “Alright. Go to the Leaky Culdron Pub in London and tell a barman named Tom that you are a student shopping for Hogwarts, and he will give you directions. Visit the bank first, here is your key.” Severus said, producing a key and handing it over to the boy. “Everything that you need will be written down in your list. School starts on September first. Here is your train ticket and to get to the platform, you must run through the platform between nine and ten, got it boy?”

The boy nodded, taking the Hogwarts Express train ticket and keeping it next to the bank key he had placed on the window pane.

Severus Snape curtly nodded and turned toward the door before a voice stopped him-

“I can speak to snakes too.”

Severus stopped in his steps. Unsavoury memories flashed through his mind- a handsome pale man hissing, pain, screams of mad laughter, the dark mark, more pain, red and green lights- Severus forced them back down.

Severus turned to face the boy, “What?”

“They speak to me,” Potter smirked, his green eyes flashing like the killing curse -the same curse that killed Lily, Lily had the same eyes, Lily-

“Oh?” Severus said nonchalantly.

“I can speak to snakes,” the boy repeated, tilting his head to the side much like Lily used to. “They find me. They whisper things to me. Is that /normal/ for someone like me?”

Severus swallowed. “No,” He stated simply and walked away from the boy as fast as he could.

Minutes later, Severus Snape would show the memory of Harry Potter to Albus Dumbledore.

Some more minutes later, Severus Snape would see Albus Dumbledore's face become pale, and then green; his eyes flashing with regret, concern, nostalgia and pain.

A month later, Severus would see a mop of black hair with aristocratic features and the most beautiful emerald eyes smirk at him when Minerva would call out his name. He wold see the boy gracefully sit on the stool as excited mutters floated around the Great Hall. He would see the Sorting Hat shout “Slytherin” immediately and without hesitation, without even touching the boy's perfect hair. He would see Albus Dumbledore clutching his goblet so hard with a pained and forced smile that his knuckles would turn white before lightly clapping. He would see Draco Malfoy smirking and welcoming Potter to the house of snakes.

Two months later, he would see a sort of crowd surrounding Potter- Draco Malfoy to his right, Marcus Flint to his left, Crabbe and Goyle walking behind him protectively and so many others following them in a formation that he could recognise all too well.

After all, the Death Eaters moved the same way.

And that same day would be the first -but not the last- time that Severus Snape would find Albus Dumbledore chucking down a bottle of fire whiskey.
