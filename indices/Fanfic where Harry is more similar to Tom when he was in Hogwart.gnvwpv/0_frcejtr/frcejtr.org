*I don't know, I'm not quite sure I've read such a ff yet. But I liked the idea, so I wrote a little one-shot for you on the spot based on the first interaction with Harry Potter and Severus Snape if our favourite Potions Master comes to give Harry Potter his letter and finds him in an orphanage.*

*P.S: Please note that this is un-edited.*

​

“I must admit to be confused upon receiving your letter, Mr Snape,” An old lady smiled at him, making Severus look at her. “In all the years Harry has been here, never once has he received a visitor.”

He understood her silent question, ‘Why are you here?'

“Mr Potter had been admitted to being a student of the school I work at before he was born by his parents,” Severus explained, trying his best not to sneer at the last word,"I am here to deliver him his acceptance letter and take him shopping for his books and uniforms.”

“Oh!” The woman said, a flash of concern in her eyes. “So you are going to take him away then?” Her voice sounded eager. Hopeful.

Severus raised an eyebrow at that. “Yes,” He drawled. “Hogwarts is a boarding school, so all necessities will be provided there. Mr Potter will only be returning during Christmas holidays and the Summer vacations."

“But other than that, he is going to go with you lot, right?” The matron asked.

“Yes,” Severus replied.

The matron breathed a visible sign of relief.

“Is there a problem, madam?” Severus asked softly.

“No, not at all.” She replied quickly. Too quickly.

“Please,” Severus said, “I insist.”

The matron hesitated, looking around nervously. “The boy won't be refused admittance to this school, right?"

“Yes,” Severus confirmed.

The matron hesitated again. “Harry is a lovely boy,” She started slowly. “Very polite. Extremely smart. But there have been... incidents.” She revealed.

“Oh?” Severus said. She must be talking about accidental magic. “What kind of incidents?”

“Weird ones.” The matron replied. “Nasty ones. Once, this other boy Richie, took away Harry's blanket and threw it in the fireplace, and the next day, his whole room caught on fire. Then there was this other time when one of his teachers told him that his answer was wrong, and the man's hair turned blue! There was no proof that Harry did this, but... he's always there whenever these strange things happen. A girl Daisy tried to cut his hair, but it grew back the next day and Daisy became bald! He even once somehow got on the roof, you know! Then there was Mark, he bullied some of the younger kids -Harry included- and once when we took the children to the zoo, a poisonous snake bit him and he died! Poor boy. Now, I know Harry could have not done those things, but... he was smiling, you know. He was smiling when Mark was crying out in pain- didn't even lift a finger to help him.”

Severus listened patiently. The incidents didn't bother him too much, what really did strike him was the tone in which the matron used to talk about Potter- scared awe. Severus would never be able to forget that tone. How could he, when every Death Eater had used the same tone to speak about the Dark Lord.

“This is Harry's door.” The matron pointed. She knocked on it. “Harry, you have a visitor.” and without another word, she left immediately.

Severus cleared his mind and once again, cursed Albus for sending him of all people to fetch the boy. He opened the door.

An angelic looking boy sat near the window. The light casting a halo-like illusion behind him. James Potter's face with Lily Evans' eyes met his.

The boy looked at him from head to toe and only said one word, “Go.”

Severus raised an eyebrow.

“You are a doctor aren't you?” The boy asked, his voice soft, clear and regal.

“No,” Severus replied coldly as he looked at the boy who was the product of his bully and the love of his life. “I'm a professor.”

The boy smiled emotionlessly. “I don't believe you,” He said, “She thinks I'm different. She wants to put me in a mental hospital. Are you here to profile me?” The boy asked, his tone mocking. “Do you think I'm different too, /Professor/?"

“Yes,” Severus said, “But you are not mad. Hogwarts isn't a mental institute, it's a school.” He said, giving Potter the letter. “A school for learning magic.”

The boy raised his eyebrows, eyes filled with distrust as he took the envelope, opened it and read it's contents.

Severus prepared himself for the boy's reaction. Some would question that it was a joke, others would think it made perfect sense and still others would think it was devil-worship and yet others would argue about the existence of magic. But he couldn't have known that he would have never been prepared for the boy's statements.

“I knew it,” He whispered. “I knew it. I am special.”
