[[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Crack][[Crack] can describe fanworks with a fundamentally ludicrous premise, or otherwise including a plethora of unbelievable, incredible, or just plain silly elements - that is, implying the author/artist must have been on drugs to produce something so insane. It may be used in a compound noun ("crackfic"), or as an adjective ("crack pairing").]]
