I think one of the reasons that Alexandra's behavior stands out as being so horrendous is that Inverity has included a social structure that will consistently reprimand Alexandra for behaving the way that she does. Harry only ever had this in the form of Hermione, one of his two friends, easily ignored. Alexandra has parents who are far more involved than the Dursley's, as well as a Headmistress who won't condone or encourage outrageously dangerous actions like Dumbledore does. While you're right that she's the only third person perspective (with only one exception that I can think of) that we get in this series, we are also constantly viewing her actions through external judgments, and that colors our perception of her character just much as Alexandra's perspective does.
