True, though I do think that some of her actions, even in isolation, have to be considered incredibly rash. Case in point, her decision towards the end where she follows the crow into the woods.

I hope that as the series grows, the character matures as well. I think Alexandra is very well written. It is because she is written so well that I find her argumentative and stubborn behavior so irritating as I don't have any other characters to latch onto.
