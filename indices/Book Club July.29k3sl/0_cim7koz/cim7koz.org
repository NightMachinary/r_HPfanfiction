I preface this by saying that I haven't read the whole series. I'm currently making my way through the second book but I will leave most of my thoughts for the first book only.

I think the one time release and the prose are superb. There were only three or four typos from what I remember, but everything else is very professional. (Aside from enclosing thoughts and asides in parentheses. I think there's a much better way of doing it, but I appreciate the consistency). The world building and detail are excellent and, more importantly, restrained. When information was needed, the author would provide. It wasn't a simple expository dump of "This is how Wizarding America works." I feel that is the strongest aspect of the author's writing. Constructing a believable and constrained world is difficult when you're melding the different cultures of such a large country as well as doing your best to mix wizarding and Muggle affairs.

The author is very much like JKR, believable and necessary world building in combination with characters that are easy to remember. This might be revisionist, but the author is also like JKR in that the story is wider than it is deeper. Perhaps it is a side effect of being the first book in a series. Perhaps the age restrains the author from exploring more mature themes. Regardless, the characters and the setting paint a broad landscape that is very rarely delved into. Anna is Asian and smart. Darla and Angelique are ditzy and dumb. David hates anything that doesn't support ASPEW and other equality issues, real or imagined. I get that they are young children that have to be established but they are memorable because of the repetition of their characteristics, not because of their actions. Very much like JKR, Hermione is bookish, and while she bends and breaks the rules, she is still much the same person at the end. Ron, stubborn and jealous but loyal to a fault, repeats the same character arc in the 4th book that he does in the 7th. I fear that Anna, Darla, the twins, and David will be the same.

I have yet get to Alexandra. I will not rant paragraphs about her. She has her characteristics and I admire the author for sticking to her guns about what Alexandra is. I also acknowledge that sticking true to the character is the mark of a good author who knows what the character is. Yet, yet, yet, is /painfully/ hard to read about a character as obnoxious and unlikable as Alexandra. Headstrong (idiotically so), prideful (at the extent of all others for almost 85% of the first book), and just plain stupid, Alexandra is a difficult character to root for. I don't mind that. Not all characters have to be super!Harry. But it is made doubly hard when Alexandra is the only third person POV we have. With so many of the other characters so one dimensional for the time being, I found myself wishing more harm than good upon Alexandra.

I respect the author's restraint in regards to the plot. It is too easy to get overblown and start by the villain trying world domination. I just didn't find a lot of agency in the plot. For much of it, I was wondering where it was leading to. When I realized what it was circling towards, I found myself unsurprised by the plot twists (both of Alexandra's character discovery as well as the main antagonist). It speaks volume that the writer left enough clues to piece together what would happen, but it didn't GRAB my interest. It's not even until midway through the second book that I found anything to really hold my interest.

Perhaps it is my age. Perhaps it is the eerie resemblance to JKR's style (which I've come to dislike). It is hard to not recommend such a well written work. I come to this, then. Respect the world building. Admire the prose and the consistent plot. It is rare for a plot to be so well planned out. For me, there were things that I couldn't overlook that prevented it from being a favorite work of mine.

It is a troublesome fic to review.
