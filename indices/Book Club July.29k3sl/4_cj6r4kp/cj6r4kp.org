The entire series is amazing and a great take on the american wizarding world. The first book however...

I like the story, don't get me wrong, but it's obviously not the writer's best work. She's progressed over time and so has her writing. While that doesn't ruin the book for me, it still makes me cringe at the way the reader is told practically everything and shown only a few things.

The main thing I did like, however, was how Headmistress Grimm was handled. She isn't a perfect character, her motives are secret, and by the end of this story I am still unsure about whether or not I like her.

All in all, it's a great story. A few flaws here and there, but the author herself has progressed to a much better writing.
