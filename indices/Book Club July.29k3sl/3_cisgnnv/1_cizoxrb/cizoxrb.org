Agreed. Sure, Alexandra is a total brat and does a lot, /a lot/ of stupid things, but I can totally understand where she is coming from and why she's doing what she's doing. So, I wasn't really that much annoyed by her behaviour and after a while I just came to expect her to fuck shit up and get in a lot of trouble. I have bigger problems understanding why her friends are her friends in the first place, though. There was barely any time for them to become close and then they already feel the repercussions of being associated with there - wouldn't people normally seek as much distance as possible to her?

I did like the books a lot though and was greatly entertained reading them. Can't wait for the next one to be finished!
