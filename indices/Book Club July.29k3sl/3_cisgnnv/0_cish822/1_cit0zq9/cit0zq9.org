I think the difference is that the protagonists with character flaws in other fanfics are likeable. A character flaw is great and is a sign of a (usually) competent author, knowing where they want to take the plot and how to develop both the story and the character.

Take [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That Was Promised]]. Harry is quite naive (character flaw) and because of it, someone has died. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza's]] Denarian series is another example. Harry here is rude, selfish, and not a nice person to be around, yet I still rooted for him. These are only a couple of examples but I think you get my point.

The difference between Alexandra and all of these other characters is that we like them despite their flaws. Alexandra... well... I honestly don't like her. She frustrates me to no end. I think Kwan summed up her character very well. She's headstrong, stupidly prideful, and it's a rinse and repeat. I read fan fiction to enjoy myself but I honestly can't because Alexandra is so difficult to root for, I find myself just hoping someone will just slap it out of her.
