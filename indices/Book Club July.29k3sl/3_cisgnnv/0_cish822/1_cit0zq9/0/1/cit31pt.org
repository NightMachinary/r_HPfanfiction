Of course, opinions will vary on whether or not you like Alexandra. She will obviously appeal to some personalities more than others. A couple of points though.

*SPOILERS ABOUND*

- Generally, when a character acts stupidly or arrogantly, there is a cost. It would be poor literature otherwise. The cost can come in several different forms. For a majority of the story, Alexandra acts recklessly to the detriment of all others. Yes, she has some good reason to. But don't all actions? It is a testament to the writing that one can even /root/ for Alexandra after all the things she does. Off the top of my head, she endangers Brian's sister by not informing Brian of the dangers within the pond (which she knew). She continually exploits Bran and Poe's servitude for her own gain. She foolishly gets drawn into another stupid dare by Larry in staying in the forest (dragging Anna into it, though to be fair, it is of Anna's own volition). She strays away in Chicago, ignoring everyone's requests despite the numerous precautions and detentions already sent her way. Finally, she breaks into the Registrar's office, putting herself in a position to be incredibly exposed (as well as Anna). Then, without informing anyone else, she follows the crow into the woods.

These are a series of selfish and prideful decisions. How many detentions will it take? What kind of punishment will deter her? How many times will her friends have to put themselves on the line for her own needs? Of course, she doesn't pay the cost at the end of this first story nor should she have to. Now that I've completed the whole story, I can say that Alexandra has paid some of the cost, but I don't think she has balanced what she has done (going after Maludo takes the cake in incredibly moronic decisions) in accordance to her punishment.
