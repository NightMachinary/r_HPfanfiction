I agree. It's a similar problem I've seen people have with characters in tv shows. If the character has flaws, people hate them, think they're terribly written, etc etc etc. So many people aren't willing to invest time in something and see a flawed character gradually grow.

That or they go the opposite way and give an overly flawed character WAAAAAAAAY too much leniency and forgive almost anything, usually because they find said character attractive.
