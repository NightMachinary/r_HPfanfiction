Having read all of the stories, I can see why people find Alexandra annoying. I do, however, think that it's an understandable character trait and not really a deal breaker for me.

As for this book in particular, I would have liked to get a little more focus on her becoming/being 'best friends' with Anna. That particular relationship suffers a little bit from telling rather than showing, particularly early on.
