*My comments will probably be spoilery for the entire series.*

I've just reread the first few chapters, and one thing that immediately jumps out is how quickly and clearly Inverarity defines Alexandra's character. Only five chapters in, and we already have a pretty good idea of the kind of person that she is. I know some people are highly annoyed by Alexandra, but it occurred to me while reading the conversation between Brian and Alex after the Kappa attack, that part of the reason I've never found Alexandra as annoying as I otherwise might is that things never actually go her way. Brian confronts her, rightly, about her being thoughtless and only ever considering what she wants. This behavior would be incredibly obnoxious except for the fact that from the moment she enters the wizarding world the odds are stacked against her, and nothing ever really goes her way. Many of the calamities that befall Alexandra are exasperated by the behaviors Brian complains about. She can't help but to be impulsive. It's who she is. By book four, the world has smacked her around enough that she at least begins consulting with people occasionally, and her abilities grow so that she can deal with far more dangerous situations, but she still doesn't have a mind for long term or unexpected consequences, and it makes for an unpredictable, fascinating story.

*Definite Major Spoilers Ahead!*

The other main point I took from re-reading these few chapters is how complicated this whole situation really is. The meeting between Alexandra, Claudia, and Dean Grimm is one that is eleven years in the making. I've read this book several times before, but this is the first time I've questioned whether or not Claudia was confounded. Now I have to wonder. Was Claudia in a state of shock over the end of her separation from the wizarding world? Did Dean Grimm confound both Claudia and Archie in order to spend time with her niece without interference? Most of all, I feel sorry for Alexandra. From the very second she enters the wizarding world, she is being lied to and manipulated, and even worse the people doing the lying and manipulating have their own valid reasons for doing so. What a complex web Inverarity has woven. Or perhaps I've just spent far too much time thinking about this series.
