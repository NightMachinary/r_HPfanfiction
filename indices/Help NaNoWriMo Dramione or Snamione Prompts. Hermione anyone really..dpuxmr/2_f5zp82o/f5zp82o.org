I really like SSHG but only when Hermione is way older (like middle aged) or they are both the same age. Teacher-student makes me feel really icky, so here are some prompts:

Crookshanks' playing with the time Turner in 3rd year causes Hermione to hurtle back to the Marauder's era. Having never learned the truth about Sirius black she immediately sides against him with Lily and Snape. Snape, having another friend, doesn't pin all his happiness on Lily and finds he can be happy with others.

Snape and Hermione are colleagues. Hermione cannot believe the insanity that James Potter gets up to, and Snape asks her what she would think if the boy (*set fire to a teacher/brewed a volatile potion in the girls lavatories, went after a giant snake armed with nothing and then armed with a sword etc)

Hermione is legit born in the late 50s-early 60s and goes to school with Snape. She remains a Griffindor and loathes the Marauder's along with Lily.

Draco has been sneaking sweets from the house elves and has several cavities. On hearing that the standard treatment is to make the teeth fall out and the grow in the new ones, Draco throws a tantrum. Snape suggests Muggle dentists as a joke, but Narcissa takes it seriously, she hates seeing her boy cry. Enter the Granger's Dentists with specialised training for children.
