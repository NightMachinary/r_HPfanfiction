I like reading both pairings, with SSHG one of my favorite ships, so I'm happy to share some random ideas! Will update this post if I think of more

SSHG

- Hermione ends up with the Half Blood Prince's potions text. She is very curious about the owner of the book and the actual spells. Either she can turn into a dark-ish Hermione and/or slowly figure out Snape's true loyalties over the course of the school year. She may finally put it all together right when Snape kills Dumbledore.

- Post-DH Voldemort is dead but the Death Eaters have won. Snape is de-facto assumed to be in charge. Hermione wants to infiltrate and topple the existing Death Eaters but realizes something's strange about Snape's loyalties and everything is not what it seems.

- While trying to create a new spell, Hermione accidentally sends herself back in time to the 1970s. She is free to change the past however she likes. Somehow she ends up sorted in Slytherin and befriends Severus and Regulus.

DMHG

- Draco gets some sense knocked into him after Hermione punches him in the face. He slowly looks at her in a new light and helps the right side of the war behind the scenes

- Post DH, the Malfoys must compensate all those tortured in Malfoy Manor during the war in order to repair it. Hermione asks to be inducted into the Order of the Golden Fleece, an ancient society with soft political power and vast magical resources. Draco helps Hermione get in

- Draco and Hermione are running against each other in an election for Minister of Magic. Who will win?

- after OotP, with Lucius in jail, the Ministry finds Narcissa guilty of something and imprisons her too. Draco is sent to live with his Aunt Andromeda for the summer and learns a lot about the Muggle World. The Tonkses live in the same town as the Grangers

- Draco and Hermione are Head Boy and Head Girl. They have their own special dorm and common room. For various reasons unspecified, the whole school is against them individually. Both use the special dorm/common room as a place of respite
