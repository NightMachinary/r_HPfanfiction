Wow, you managed to pick the two most controversial Hermione pairings on this subreddit...

The general opinion on this subreddit is that Snamione is creepy on many levels, and that Dramione requires you to change one of the characters because they are LITERALLY ideologically opposed on every issue (Draco "as for me I hope it's Granger" Malfoy wants Hermione dead, she would quite like to remain alive if that is fine. Hermione wants to free the house elves, Draco is complicit in abusing them. Draco believes in blood purity, Hermione is proof that it is bogus).
