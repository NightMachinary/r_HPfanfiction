No, by the time Malfoy would be forced to challenge his prejudice, there is way too much water under the bridge for a romance. Hermione is vindictive and has a long memory. If you want to sell their relationship, you have to make changes in order to prevent all canon interactions after the first book.

The Buckbeak incident and its aftermath was pure sadism towards Hagrid on Malfoy's side, and just ask Snape what calling someone a mudblood does for a relationship.

And HBP was a long list of outright war crimes.
