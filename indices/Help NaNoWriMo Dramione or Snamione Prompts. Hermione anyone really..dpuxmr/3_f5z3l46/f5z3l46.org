  What type of Dramione (...) fanfics have you been dying to see? Any plots, themes in mind?

There is exactly one way I can see it actually happen without making anyone OOC, one that, as far as I know, has not been written yet.

The basic premise is that Draco, upon being matched or beaten by Hermione at every exam at the end of their first year, decides to investigate why a Mudblood could beat him. He can't find any evidence of cheating and therefore asks his mother once he is home. Narcissa, not really interested in the whole topic, merely says something along the lines of Lucius not always being right with his believes.

So Malfoy decides to observe Hermione, trying to smoke out her secret. So instead of calling her racial slurs and trying to get Buckbeak executed, he observes. He should be antagonistic towards Ron as their beef seems to be class-based rather than racially motivated. Year two passes with not much changed.

Year 3 is where things get interesting. Malfoy is still observing/stalking Hermione, but he notices that there is a rift between her and Ron (due to the Cat/rat fights). So he tries to, well something between gloating and cheering her up by pointing out that she is better off without Ron. Hermione half-heartedly defends Ron, but it gets them talking. This should not become an easy friendship since Malfoy is still a prat, but it is a starting point.

Year 4 is where you can kick off the romance, although waiting for Umbridge in the fifth could do the trick. With, for example, Malfoy giving Hermione inside knowledge so that she can avoid the Inquisitorial Squad. Malfoy in the DA would be a no since no one other than Hermione should trust him at that point.

Through all of this, Harry should stay neutral to Malfoy. He doesn't like Draco much, but because Ron and Hermione are at odds, he doesn't want to pick Ron's side either. If you want to keep Harry's role marginal, have him hang out with Katie Bell rather than bash him. Bashing is the trademark of bad fanfiction, and bashing Harry even more so.

Snape and Lucius should be antagonistic as they were colossal dicks in canon (eg Lucius setting a Basilisk loose in a school or Snape abusing his students). A Draco "redemption" story should redeem him, not whitewash all Death Eaters and Voldemort. Lucius would not like his son to associate with, much less date a Mudblood. And Snape is a dick to everyone. That is also a good avenue for conflict if you feel like it.

There should not be much of a divergence from the stations of canon until year 5/6 since Malfoy's friendship with Hermione wouldn't influence the TWT, Sirius breaking out or Voldemort's return. So spending 100k words on rehashing canon is a bad idea. Write to show changes, show how their "relationship" develops and how Malfoy's thoughts change. Keep this fic centred around the changes Malfoy goes through and not Harry's canon shenanigans.

Tl;dr: Malfoy observes Hermione during years 2-4 rather than antagonise her, slow friendship, Snape and Lucius are still human garbage. Prevent Malfoy from becoming a Death Eater through a long process rather than try to write that away or ignore his countless war crimes from book 6. â€‹
