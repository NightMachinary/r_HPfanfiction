Adding on to this I've seen fanfic's where Lily & Molly knew each other & were close in the Order during the first war. Like was Molly & Arthur ever apart of the Order during the first war? IIRC Fabian & Gideon were.

All that to ensure Harry has a love interest & a best friend while still in diapers like you stated above.
