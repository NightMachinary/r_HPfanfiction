Yeah, I feel the same when I'm reading Marauders-Era fics, and suddenly, everyone from the First Order of the Phoenix is in Lily and James' year, and of course, they all are in Gryffindor. Like, does make sense for Dumbledore to create the Order and including only kids who just graduated?

Not to mention all those Lily and James live or Sirius raises Harry fics where the Weasleys are brought in almost immediately, just to make sure Harry has a love interest from the age of 2 and a best friend.
