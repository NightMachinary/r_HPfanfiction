Hogwarts is a famous school in Britain, so while annoying, it would make sense a lot of people know each other and become friends at Hogwarts or before Hogwarts.

With the Half-Bloods, it'd depend on how often the parents visit the Wizarding World.

With Muggleborns, it wouldn't make sense for them to know magical people before going to school.
