Isn't it canon that Hogwarts is the only magical school in Britain? It makes sense that everyone from the older generation would know each other from their school years. Not to mention Malfoy and his gang, or Crabbe and Goyle at least, seem to have known each other before Hogwarts. I do agree it's ridiculous for EVERYONE to meet before Hogwarts, but the wizarding community seems to be very small and close knit, so it's not outside the realm of possibility.
