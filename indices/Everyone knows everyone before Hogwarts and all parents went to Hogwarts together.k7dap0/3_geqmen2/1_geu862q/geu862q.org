Yes but Lucius Malfoy was born in 1954 James Potter in 1960 so that's probably like an entire generation gap for wizards. And James was like a first is when Lucy was in his seventh year. In many fanfics of Marauder's Era they show that James Potter had a rivalry of sorts with Lucius Malfoy too. And in Lily and James raise Harry fics, whenever Harry tells them about his meeting with Draco Malfoy, they say just like his father. How could they know they were just together for one year. (AND THOSE WHO SAY THAT HE WAS AN ORDER MEMBER SO HE KNEW HIN TO BE A DEATH EATER, not all death eaters went about showing their face in daylight. They wore masks. That's why it was easy to claim Imperius curse)
