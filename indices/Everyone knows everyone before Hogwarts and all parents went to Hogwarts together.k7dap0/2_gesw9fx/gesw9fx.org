To play devil's advocate a bit here, you have two generational wars that would play into baby-booms / consolatory familial partnerships that would play out as if everyone in the population were part of a small town of a few tens of thousands of people, though spread out across a whole country, which isn't a huge issue where magic is involved.

Three big wars if you count Grindelwald / WW2.

So, tons of people start dying. You and your family start getting very close with other families with worldviews similar to your own, because you need a support network in dangerous times. War ends, baby boom as people sense social relief and all these new connections (literally) foster in the next generation, another dark wizard rises, rinse and repeat.

Inclusion of muggle-borns would be weird, yeah, but for close-knit wizarding families, the acquaintances and friendships across generations of families makes some sense given the context and populations involved.
