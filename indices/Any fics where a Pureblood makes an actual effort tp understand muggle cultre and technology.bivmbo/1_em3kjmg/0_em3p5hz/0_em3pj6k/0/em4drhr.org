And I'm pretty sure he calls the telephone a fellytone at some point. You'd think that the head of the ministry department that handles wizard-muggle interactions would be familiar with the most common communication device muggles have.

I love Arthur, but he doesn't /like/ muggles- he fetishizes them. If he actually cared about them as a people instead of an idea he'd be more familiar with their way of life. Arthur is condescending in a friendly sort of way- a "the poor muggles need to be protected because they can't handle themselves, but look at the interesting toys they made," way, kind of how you'd treat a child.
