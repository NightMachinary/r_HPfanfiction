I /really/ hated that part of The Prestige and the assumption a lot of fiction makes. Your copy would be closer to you than any other human being could ever be. They would be a person whom you would understand completely and with whom you would agree on everything. You would get along with them if you can get along with /anyone/. Killing them would be worse than fratricide.
