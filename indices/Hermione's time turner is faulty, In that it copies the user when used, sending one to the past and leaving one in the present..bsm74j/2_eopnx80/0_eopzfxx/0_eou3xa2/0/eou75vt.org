So, first of all, apparently, back when I saw The Prestige a long time ago, I had missed the point that Tesla's machine didn't actually work and it was a trick-within-a-trick, this one aimed at the movie watcher.

With that out of the way, it takes a lot for an otherwise sane person to murder family, and we know that we are generally favourably disposed towards people who look, think, and act like ourselves. In fact, I daresay that if you were to ask any of these writers what would it take for them to murder their own copy, they would put the bar about as high as they would for murdering their own brother or sister.

In this particular case, there is absolutely no reason even 50 Hermiones with 50 wands (which would also be copied) couldn't all attend Hogwarts, though some of them might need to be resorted due to dormitory space constraints.
