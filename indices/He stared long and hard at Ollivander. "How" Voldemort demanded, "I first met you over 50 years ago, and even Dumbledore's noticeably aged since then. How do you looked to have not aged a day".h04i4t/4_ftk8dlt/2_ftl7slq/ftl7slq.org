Reminds me of a one-shot I wrote, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12724348/1/I-m-a-a-WHAT][I'm a a WHAT!]] (for some reason the ellipses I'd put in between the a's didn't save) where Harry discovers that he's a Time Lord (and in this fic, the show is actually in-universe, and all wizards/witches are some kind of descendants of Time Lords with at least a bastardized memory of the word science of Carrionites). Part of me wants to continue it, but I'm also a smidge intimidated regarding the sheer range of possibilities as I haven't thought of a definite plan (plus I'd be moving it to AO3 in protest of FFN being brainless enough to delete Nightmares of Futures Past under false pretenses).
