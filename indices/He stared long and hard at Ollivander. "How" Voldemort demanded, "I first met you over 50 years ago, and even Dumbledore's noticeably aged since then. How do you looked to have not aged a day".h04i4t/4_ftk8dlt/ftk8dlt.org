Ollivander returned the Dark Lord's gaze.

"There are more things in Heaven and in Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy," he quoted quietly.

Voldemort's eyes narrowed. "You would quote the stories of history to me, a man who will create it? A pity, Ollivander... perhaps you /have/ aged. Only old fools fight the future."

"I am doing no such thing. I know quite well how foolish it is to fight time." The two men began circling each other slowly around the room. "But I am, perhaps, amused, Tom."

"Do not say that name!" Voldemort snarled.

"Ah, but I think I will, Tom. I know the power of names. All too well, perhaps..."

With a flick of his wrist, Voldemort made a jet of yellow light fly out of his wand, causing the wall behind the old man to explode violently. Ollivander fell to his knees.

"You are testing my patience, old man," hissed the Dark Lord. "You have a secret. If you are not willing to tell it to me, I shall have to resort to... more extreme methods."

"I have many secrets," Ollivander said, getting to his feet.

"I do not doubt it. Wand-makers are rare..." Voldemort stroked his own wand lovingly. "It would be such a shame if one were to die... much knowledge would be lost."

"It will take more than what you are capable of to kill me."

"Oh?" Voldemort raised his eyebrows. "Let us see. /Avada Kedavra!/"

A jet of green light shot from his wand and struck the old man in the chest with a whooshing noise. Ollivander fell on all fours, and, with a labored grunting noise, pulled a strange metal wand out of his pocket.

"What..." Voldemort inhaled sharply. "What are you?"

The old man pressed something on the metal wand. There was a rhythmic noise like wind, fading in and out, becoming louder each time. Ollivander struggled to his feet once more.

With a loud clunk, the noise stopped, and a large blue box stood where there had been nothing before. His skin glowing yellow, Ollivander straightened his back, standing proud, the metal wand pointed at the Dark Lord.

"I'm the Doctor," he said.
