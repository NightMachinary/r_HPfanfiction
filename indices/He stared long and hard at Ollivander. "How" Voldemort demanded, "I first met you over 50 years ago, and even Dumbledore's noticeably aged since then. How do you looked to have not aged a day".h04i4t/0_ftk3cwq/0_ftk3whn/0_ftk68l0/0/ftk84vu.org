Nevyn is one of the major characters from /The Deverry Cycle/ series, by Katherine Kerr. It's Celtic fantasy, and part of Nevyn's backstory is that he was studying magic against the wishes of his father. Eventually he's stripped of his titles and even his name(Nevyn=no-one), and his betrothed ends up dying in a rather tragic fashion.

He swore that he would not rest until he made it right. The Great Ones accepted his vow, and made it so he couldn't die until his betrothed reincarnated, he reunited with her, and taught her magic. This lead him to be functionally immortal for a long time.
