They talked. Voldemort threatened. Ollivander gave him an excuse about cosmetics and premature aging. Voldemort left without incident.

After the dark lord was gone, Ollivander stood there still for several minutes.\\
Then, his image wavered, wobbled, and vanished, revealing...a trio of house-elves standing on each other's shoulders.\\
The two on top lowering themselves down to the ground, the trio stepped into the back room of the wand shop without a word.\\
Then they turned left as a group and went through an illusory wall. Stepped onto an elevator indistinguishable from the carpet around it, and descended.\\
Down, one floor, two floors...the elevator stopped in a dusty old basement, filled with crates and boxes and musty old paperwork from generations ago.\\
One of the elves went to one of the old bookkeeping folders, and opened it up. He took a particular folded sheet of paper, and unfolded it. Then unfolded it, and unfolded it again, and again, until it was the size and shape of a doorway.\\
The three elves stepped through the paper doorway and disappeared, the paper neatly folding itself and slotting itself back into the folder after it had disappeared.

A labyrinth of corridors, fake walls and disguised doors later, the trio finally enlarged a lion statuette and stepped through its jaws to a workshop bustling with activity.\\
There were house-elves /everywhere/, tending to an indoor greenhouse filled with magical trees and to a menagerie filled with dozens of rare creatures, carefully carving sigils and runes into suitable sticks, chanting and waving their hands and wands to enchant artifacts...this hidden all-encompassing factory, churning out wands and devices, only a small percentage finding their way into human hands in exchange for their gold...\\
"No human must know." One of the elves whispered. The other two beside him nodded solemnly.
