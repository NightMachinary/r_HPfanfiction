Ollivander (/pulls mask off to reveal a middle-aged man. Voice changes/): Ooooh, you've discovered my little secret, Mr Riddle. There's no such thing as wands! They're just sticks! The Ollivander family has been running this scam for 2000 years! We haven't even bothered to put the unicorn tails and dragon heartstrings inside for the last thousand years. The creepy old man act just helps you credulous fools believe it, hahahahahaha... But I suppose the jig is up now. And to think we would have gotten away with it if not for you meddling Death Eaters! ... Except... did you think you were the first to find out?
