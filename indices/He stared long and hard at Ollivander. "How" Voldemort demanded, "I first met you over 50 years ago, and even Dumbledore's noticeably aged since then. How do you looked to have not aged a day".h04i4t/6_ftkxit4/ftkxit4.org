The door swung closed and locked with a quiet click, the shade fell down over the window, and Voldemort felt a ripple of magic unlike any he had felt before, he somehow /knew/ that they wouldn't, couldn't be disturbed. "Who are you? /What/ ... are you?"

" When I was young I was a mighty warrior, eager to prove himself. I fought for Hedju-Hor with sword and the few wandless magics that were all that existed at the time. Seeking new adventures I slew the guardian of the sacred grove with this knife and cut off a branch. From that branch I fashioned the first wand and became a mighty ruler of men, first at the king's side.

" After many generations of men I sought new challenges. I gave up my first name Heka and became Narmer and made myself king. I became Imhotep and spent centuries researching magics old and new. I became Medea. I became Herpo. I discovered great things ... and in my foolish youth - I was only 2000! - I attracted the attention of the gods.

" They cursed me to both have what I wanted and to be what I hated. They made me keep my immortality, but to be ordinary, a mere craftsman. I hear them jeering at me in my dreams even now after millennia.

" But even the gods make mistakes. I may have no other strength but I have my great skill and have been honing it for eons waiting for the right wizard to come. You, Tom Riddle. You. I saw greatness in you even when you were a child. Many of the wands you tried that first day would have served you well but I wanted to make you a special tool. I poured all my skill into your wand that afternoon while you shopped for your books and robes. The wand chooses the wizard, ah yes, but the wandmaker always has its first loyalty and through your wand I have /your/ loyalty.

" Don't I, Mr. Riddle.

" Now, you have some gods to kill. Then, perhaps, I can get some rest. "

With another gentle click the door unlocked and light flooded back into the shop.
