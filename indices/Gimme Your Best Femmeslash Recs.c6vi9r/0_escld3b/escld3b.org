[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620][The Fire that Swallowed the World]] by RowlettLesbian is a wip that's just finished the first year, so while romance has been hinted at, there aren't any romantic relationships yet bc they're all 11. That said, it's well written, very unique, and endgame is f/f.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13988820/][blindfolded minds collide, and we fall]] by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel is a shorter fic on Ginny and Luna's relationship book 2-4.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7307941#main][Dyad]] by holyfant is a oneshot of Ginny and Luna after the war.
