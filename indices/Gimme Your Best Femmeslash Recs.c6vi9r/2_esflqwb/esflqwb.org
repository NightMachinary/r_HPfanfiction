[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/40007?view_adult=true][The Scandalous Tale of the Diagon Nursery Calender]] - Similar to the plot line of the movie Calender Girls, if you've seen that. Funny and I think no smut at all, although it's been awhile since I've reread it. Hermione/Pansy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12217386/1/][Camelopard Dreams]] - Murder mystery, Ginny/Luna. I loved reading Ginny as a detective - if anyone has any recs that are similar, I'd gladly welcome them!
