Here you go!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1698382][out of the lake series]] - this is one is a tear-jerker, so be careful.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1800187][birds of a feather series]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17834201/chapters/42081641][Professor Black]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11914698/chapters/26923794][renascentia: from the ashes]] - so, so, worthy of the time it takes to get through this fic. The world-building and character work are amazing. There's a second part too, and if you like it, check out the authors' profile for a bunch of one-shots about the Black family!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23874001/chapters/57388117][a shrike (to your sharp and glorious thorn)]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15863055/chapters/36953667][neither lost nor found]] - wasn't updated in a long time, but I don't think it's abandoned

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23655241/chapters/56780728][Ozymandias]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25404448/chapters/61607203][Professor Black (WIP)]] - I stopped reading it somewhere around chapter 80 because it follows the canon a little too closely to my taste, but it's frequently updated

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29542353/chapters/72596433][set those ghosts alike]] - interesting take on Regulus' who was sorted into Gryffindor.

One-shots:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24579736][Voldemort's Second Cousin (Three Times Removed)]] - a funny one-shot.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/808422][Blood brothers]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1016931][some day you will grow up and learn to lie]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9561752][a little unsteady]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17063405][Of Heroes]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12401754][Stasis]] - a little darker version of Regulus

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24095437][Is this hell?]] and basically everything by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/unspeakable3/pseuds/unspeakable3][unspeakable3]]
