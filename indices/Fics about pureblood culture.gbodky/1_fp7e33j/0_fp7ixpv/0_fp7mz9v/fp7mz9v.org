It's sane Voldemort using some old law to get custody of Harry, think head of the family situation. Voldy takes his seat in wizengamot, they know he is (or was) voldy but he makes them belive he was not in control of his actions. After that it's quite a lot of politics and social change with some Harry & Voldemort on the side. Voldy and the gang are the "good guys" here, at least as good as a "former" dark lord can be.

It's a long read but if you like politics and the maintaing of wizarding traditions I would recomend it.
