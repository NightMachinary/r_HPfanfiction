I would highly reccomend the Black Sheep Dog series by Izzythehutt, which is an ongoing series in which Regulus survives the cave and Sirius has to deal with/reconcile with his family. The pureblood culture in this AU is very heavily based on aspects of British aristocracy and judging by your description I think you'd really enjoy it. It also features Sirius paired with an OC French witch from the same background. Genuinely a brilliant read. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611]]

On a similar note, I am currently writing a story that very closely follows this setting, The Dog Days of Summer, which centres around a summer holiday at the Black family country estate when Sirius is ten. I hope you might enjoy that too :) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21737692/chapters/51857092]]
