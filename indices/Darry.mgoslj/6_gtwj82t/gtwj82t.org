I personally think people who ship things like Drarry, Snarry, Tomarry, Dramione, Snapemione(idk), etc etc should be chemically and physically sterilized, their hands chopped off and their tounge cut out. Honestly that's the only solution I can think of that will improve the general state of not only the hp fandom but the world in general that has zero perceivable downsides.
