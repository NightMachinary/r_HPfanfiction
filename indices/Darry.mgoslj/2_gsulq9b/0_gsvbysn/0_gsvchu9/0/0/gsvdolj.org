If Draco is written in a great way like in Little Bat (the only one I could think of) I like him. I honestly believe J.K mess up on a lot of characters even including The Golden Trio. Everyone has a right to be a fanboy/girl/them (sorry if I miss anyone) I'm a huge Fanboy of Tonks, Luna, and McGonagall
