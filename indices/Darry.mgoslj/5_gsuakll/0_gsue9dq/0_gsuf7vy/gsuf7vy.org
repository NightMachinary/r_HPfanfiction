Yes, there is prejudice.

I am not talking here about Voldemort here, l am talking about children, Gryffindors and Slytherins hating each other. Hermione, Harry or Ron have never tried to be friendly to Malfoy and vice versa. You can't say Draco was evil at 11 and wanting to be a terrorist, criminal and support genocide. Just like Marauders thought Snape was evil at 11 too. Those 2 cases can't be compared, but there certainly is prejudice on both sides. Slytherin and Gryffindor.

Prejudice starts in the family, true, but it is certainly nurtured during Hogwarts years while the staff and Dumbledore do nothing to stop it.
