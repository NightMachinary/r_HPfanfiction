Is it Draco, or his father? If you say it's Draco, then you're essentially saying that Harry would immediately jump at the opportunity to bully a Slytherin since that's what his father did to Snape and clearly whatever the father does must be done by the son as well. If you say it's his father, then you've correctly identified that he /didn't/ have the choice like Harry. He couldn't say anything positive about Muggleborns without running the risk of his dad potentially beating him.
