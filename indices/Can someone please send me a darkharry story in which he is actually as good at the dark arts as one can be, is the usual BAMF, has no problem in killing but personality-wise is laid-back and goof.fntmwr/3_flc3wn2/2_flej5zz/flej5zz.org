Frankly, I was thinking something more along the lines of: “Harry was walking the corridors in a enthusiastic conversation with Lavander about an exposition at Teen Witch of one of his favorite singer.

‘So Lav, there is no way possible that the weird sister are better, there sound is good, I admit, but they just don't have the same depth in their lyrics, you know' said Harry animated while making gestures with his hands.

‘Yeah, Harry, I know from where you are coming from, but you've got to admit that in the matter of knowing how to play an instrume-‘

‘POTTER!' Yelled an furious Dolores Umbridge, ‘This is the last straw, how dare you ignore your detention, I will see you expelled for-‘

‘Crucio, what were we saying, oh yes, you are kind of right in this, but you see, there is more to a good music than only what you can get from an instrument, art in any form has a certain depth, something that you see and can't help but relate, you know?' Continued Harry ignoring Umbridges screams, and hooping without a care in the world at the side of a suddenly pale and wide-eyed Lavander.

‘Y-y-yes, Harry, guess you are right' said Lavander.

Harry looked at Lavander and scrunched his eyes in confusion over Dolores agonizing screams with a confused expression in his face

‘Lav, you feeling alright, you seem kind of pale all of a sudden'

‘J-j-j-ust fine Harry, really, y-y-you don't need to be worried'

‘Oh, well, if you are certain' shrugged Harry.

Lavander looked at the twitching form of Umbridge and against her better judgment decided to ask.

‘S-s-say Harry' she started ‘w-won't y-you get in trouble because of...' she asked looking at the the woman/toad hybrid.

Harry as if only now remembering of his use of an unforgivable looked at Umbridge's form with surprise.

‘Oh, I knew I was forgetting something, thanks Lav, obliviate' said him carelessly throwing the spell over his shoulder ‘can you believe she still hasn't clued on me erasing her memory all the time? Man and I'm not even particularly good at this, just now I've sort of managed to not erase her capacity of moving her arms, so, fancy getting something to eat at the kitchen, I could do with a sandwich.'”
