As a slash reader, I can say many authors and readers think mpreg is weird. Many times even gross. But it can also be pretty hot and steamy. Lots of mpreg is awful, true. However, we have our 11-year-old writers and you have yours.

Mpreg is a trope used to get characters in interesting situations. To add on to TheBlueMenance's list:

- It's a reason for sex and relationships to happen (arranged marriages, reproductive goals)
- It can get angsty or happy depending on the world
- Authors can explore what an mpreg world is like (cultural systems, politics)
- How it would affect the character (physically, emotionally)
- Delving into imagined biologies (trans, hermaphrodite, A/B/O dynamics, agender)
