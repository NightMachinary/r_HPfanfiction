Harem is probably not taken seriously because it's usually porn. It's not a "serious" fic so people don't treat it as such.

SI is not necessarily terrible, but it's a potential warning sign of a badfic. I don't know if there are good SI fics out there because of my own reading preferences: I rarely read anything that is not Harry-centric.

Do any good MPreg fics exist? I've never read a MPreg fic, and I never will (because slash). I always hear they are unequivocally terrible, however.
