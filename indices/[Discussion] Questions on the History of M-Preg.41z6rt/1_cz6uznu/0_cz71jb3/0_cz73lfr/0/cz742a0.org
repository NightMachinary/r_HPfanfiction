Just like SI, there are good mpreg out there, even if there is also a lot of crap (the ratio may in fact be better, depending on your definition of a good fic). But almost all of it is very heavy romance, rather then the focus being mpreg. In a way, these stories /are/ porn, ie emotional porn for women. The audience is not intended to be men at all, just like the audience of harem is not meant to be women. The demographic of this sub is very much male dominated (or at least, males tend to post more), and so the sub hates on mpreg, while being accepting of harem.
