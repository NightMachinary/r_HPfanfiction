I agree, you don't see people jumping up and down on SI anywhere near as much as mpreg, and the level of crap is about the same. Even harem share about the same level of horrible (I don't identify as a feminist, but I really hate the characterization of females in these fics, and very very few have a plot which makes any sense at all). But as people actually like harem here, harem isn't subjected to snark and doesn't appear in the discussions of worst/hated/rants.

I like your list too. There is a lot of really good articles out there about why mpreg occurs, but fewer about why we see it so much in HP as opposed to any other fandom. I mean, is there more, or it a perspective/volume fallacy? I'm not sure.
