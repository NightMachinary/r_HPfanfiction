I haven't actually read any mpreg where the explanation is a trans man. I've seen:

- aliens with alien biology
- gods (aliens by any other names) with godly biology
- Future science ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws][Clarke's third law]])
- Mutants (whether spontaneous or by evil organizations).
- Omega verse (or other gender changes, where men are no longer really male)
- Meyerism (Vampires, werewolves, other fantasy creatures are special or else known as /fails at biology forever/)
- Bio-Augmentation/deliberate self alterations
- Transhumanism and energy babies
- Half-Human Hybrid Whatevers (with Meyerism above).

So that I haven't seen trans men is actually surprising to me.
