This [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2r69eu/but_why_mpreg/][sub]] has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ymftp/whats_the_strangest_most_disturbing_use_of_magic/][bias]] against [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3tge6z/is_it_just_me_who_wants_a_ffn_slash_or_not_slash/][Mpreg]]. Male pregnancy [[http://imgur.com/nGMErwH][is older then dirt]]. So asking what fanfiction it was found in first is.... well, I have no doubt there is Kirk/Spock fanfiction back in the 1970s with one of them getting pregnant. TVtropes has a reasonable [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse][article on it]].

For the most part, mpreg is widespread in HPFF vs other FFs due to a few things:

- magic provides an easy explanation as to how
- many of the most interesting characters are male
- JKR has somewhat endorsed gay relationships by making Dumbledore gay
- there is just a lot of HPFF out there, meaning for niche subjects like mpreg are still a lot of fics, all still under [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw][Sturgeon's law]].
- many writers want to see their in love characters have biological children (for various reasons)
