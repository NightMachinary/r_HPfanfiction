I agree with you about it being rare... but then I had a thought which makes me wonder. How much overlap is there in the two procedures? /Could/ +they+ two such people possibly meet in the clinic or one of the various activities that go along with it and then bonded over shared experiences?

Now I almost wonder if its surprising it doesn't happen more often. Granted, the actual populations are tiny so it's unlikely the overlap would happen much but still.
