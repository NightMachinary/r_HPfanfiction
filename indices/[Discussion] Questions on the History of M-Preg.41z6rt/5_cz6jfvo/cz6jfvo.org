  Did M-preg exist before Harry Potter
#+end_quote

I'm guessing you're asking if Mpreg was an theme/trope/motif in other fanfictions before HP. My answer is yes, because 'male pregnancy' is an established theme in literature/folklore. As a theme that has been around for thousands of years, it's possible/probably that it would pop up in fanfiction.

For a scholarly look at the subject, see this paper: [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0ahUKEwjZ9MGIlbvKAhXkr4MKHeicC70QFggvMAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dlib.si%2Fstream%2FURN%3ANBN%3ASI%3Adoc-WLFEOMOQ%2F4a0eae9b-7dfa-4281-9db1-4a15ddb3475d%2FPDF&usg=AFQjCNFPiHV7KiltbxYx-svMgat1bUbZug&cad=rja][The Motif of a Pregnant Man in our Knowledge]].

There is a great reference material called the /Motif-index of Folk-literature/ by S. Thompson. If you can access a copy, an analysis of "Male pregnancy" in folk literature is given (index item T578).
