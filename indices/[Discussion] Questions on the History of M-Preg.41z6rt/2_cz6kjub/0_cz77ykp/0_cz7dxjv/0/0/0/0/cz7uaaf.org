... So... as is often the case with Potterverse magic, it occurs to me that Wizards have easy access to the answers to questions we muggles struggle with so vigorously.

Example: Do we have souls? YES. (And also Dementors eat them.)

Which makes me wonder... If side-along apparating requires conscious intent to bring the other person with you... and a baby is a separate person... could magical childbirth simply be a matter of the mother apparating out of the hospital bed? If so, then they can also answer the "When does a baby count as a person" question pretty readily too.
