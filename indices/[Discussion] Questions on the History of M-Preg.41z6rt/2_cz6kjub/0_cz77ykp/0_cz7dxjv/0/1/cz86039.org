During the vanishing bones Harry doesn't appear to be in any pain at all, and I don't remember in the books him mentioning pain either. Sure, the muscles would no longer be anchored to anything, but the rubbery floppiness of Harry's arm makes me think that it isn't just the bones which are changed. This makes this idea not as a bad idea as it first appears. Sure, you may need to hold open the vagina to allow the baby to slide out, but there is no danger of torn muscles, and because the pelvis is not there, there is no rigid constriction to past through.

Of course, I'm not a OB GYN, nor have I ever given birth so I may be completely wrong....
