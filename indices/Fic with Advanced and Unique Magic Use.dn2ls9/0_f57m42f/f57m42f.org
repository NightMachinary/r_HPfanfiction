Reminds me of this one fic where harry used transfiguration to severely manipulate his own body in an animalistic way, and where there were three components to it: the Wand, the Word, and the Wild. Also, it spoke of repercussions of transfiguration of oneself: like a person transifiguring themselves to have werewolf like features and then being stuck in a feral, wolf-human state permanently. Harry was a transfiguration prodigy and wanted to transfigured his parents' brains to make them better, as he and Neville were sort of role swapped as well. I forgot what it was called, though...
