In linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon), Harry has mastered wandless magic enough that he effectively has some invisible arms made of magic as well as his regular arms. He uses those arms very effectively in battles.

The story also explores the magic of wards and various ways to break into places despite them. This magic is not used in duels, though.
