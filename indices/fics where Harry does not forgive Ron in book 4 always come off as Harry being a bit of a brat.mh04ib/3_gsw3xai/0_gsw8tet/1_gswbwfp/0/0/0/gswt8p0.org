In all honesty, I completely forgot about him following the spiders into the forest while writing my last comment. That said, Ron is a gryffindor he is brave. Hermione was just attacked and an adult just told them following the spiders would answer their questions. They didn't have reason to believe they would be following the spiders to their death. Hagrid specifically told Harry in his first year nothing would hurt him in the forest if he had Fang with him.

As for Sirius, Ron was already in the situation. Crying in a corner or trying to sell him Harry would not be a very gryffindor approach. It was brave, but it doesn't necessarily reflect loyalty.
