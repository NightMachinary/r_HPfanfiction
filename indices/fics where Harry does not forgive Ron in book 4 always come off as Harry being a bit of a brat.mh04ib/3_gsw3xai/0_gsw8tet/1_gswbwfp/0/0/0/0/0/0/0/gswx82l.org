At the same time I don't think he could stand there and watch a death eater kill Draco in front of him without doing anything.

Ron is brave and stubborn and pretty smart when he needs to be, but his anger and inferiority issues can hurt those around him and it's perfectly understandable if after Ron dissolves the friendship Harry doesn't take him back as soon as he has the best showing on the first task and Ron shows up to point out the very thing Harry told him in the first place.

Personally, I would forgive Ron, but he wouldn't be my best friend again 2 minutes later and I can't fault someone for not forgiving him. Especially someone with Harry's history trust is important.

That said, canon Harry has a lot of love and trust, and as I said I prefer good friend Ron, so I don't read too many Harry doesn't forgive Ron fics, but given the average quality of fan fiction I can belive that attributes are inflated a little making Harry come off Bratty. I just don't think the lack of forgiveness itself is the problem.
