By 4th year does he? He does in first year, Harry is going either way and Ron goes with him. Second year though, it was his sister. Ron was always going to try to do something whether Harry was there or not. And in third year, a dog literally dragged him into the fight. And in 4th year the Death Eaters attacked the cup he was at anyway.

Sure he was in dangerous situations with Harry, but the only time he took a conscious choice to stand with Harry during those times was when he was a glory hungry 11 year old. His reflection shows he wanted glory more than anything at that age. And 11 year olds are terrible at risk assessment.

Personally I prefer good friend Ron over Ron bashing, but Ron bashers don't exactly have to struggle to justify Harry and Ron not talking again after that fight in 4th year.
