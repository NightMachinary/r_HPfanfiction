Ron puts Harry in danger as much as he saves him from it.

- He's the one who agreed to a duel on Harry's behalf when Harry hadn't even learned any spells yet. (This may be a lesser "crime" since Draco also didn't know any spells; but he COULD have.)
- Deciding that taking the flying car was the only solution for getting to school. Really?
- Mouthing off to the acromantula, causing them to attack. They were going to attack anyway, but Harry was working on a diplomatic solution when Ron ruined it.
- He's the one who dragged Harry off to face a basilisk instead of, I don't know, ASKING AN ADULT for help.
- Getting dragged off by Sirius-the-grimm. Not his fault, but still, Harry was put in danger because of Ron.
- You make it sound like it's all one-sided, but it's not.

And honestly, a Ron has been an absolute pillock for an entire MONTH, both in private and in public. I think it's NATURAL for Harry to want him to grovel before forgiving him.

What a lot of people seem to ignore is that childhood friendships are usually volatile. They have spats and breakups and "he's not my friend" before they find common ground again. To say Harry is a brat for not wanting to suddenly be Ron's friend is putting it all on Harry --- just like Dumbledore saying Harry has to make allowances for Snape instead of telling Snape to pull his head out of his ass.
