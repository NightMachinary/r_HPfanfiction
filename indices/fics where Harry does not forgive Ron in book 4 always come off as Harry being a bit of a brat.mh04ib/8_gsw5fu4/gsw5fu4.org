Yeah, just took a look at linkffn(11922615) and there Ron kept from Harry Charlie's message that he is coming with dragons (aka attempted murder by neglect). Which is clearly ludicrous, although it shows another hole in JKR's story: it is quite likely that Charlie would mention to his family (especially his Mum, who would be very eager after this information) that he is coming to Britain, and then the mere fact of him coming suddenly back to Hogwarts would be a leak (because I don't think anything including couple of dragons would stop Mrs Weasley from mentioning to her Harry that he is going to stand up against a dragon).
