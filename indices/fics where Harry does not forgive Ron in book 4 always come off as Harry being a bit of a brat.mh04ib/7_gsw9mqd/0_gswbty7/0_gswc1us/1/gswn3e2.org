  Ron not believing a word his friend who helped save his sister from Voldemort is bratty harry not forgiving someone who turned on him at the drop of the hat when told multiple times that he didnt do what ron accused him of isn't bratty its fucking logical.

Off topic, but it is strange how everyone has amnesia about Harry's adventures right when summer hits. Coming face to face with Voldemort and fighting a monster of legend in the Chamber of Secrets are things you think people would never forget, but no, it's like it all never happened.
