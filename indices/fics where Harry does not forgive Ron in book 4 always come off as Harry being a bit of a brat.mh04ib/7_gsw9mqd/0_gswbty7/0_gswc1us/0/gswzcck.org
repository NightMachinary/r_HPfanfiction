I think the issue here is you are only allowing for instant forgiveness or forgiveness never happening, you don't seem to be considering the possibility of forgiveness taking time. Harry never forgiving is kinda bratty, harry forgiving right away is kinda letting Ron off easy. Harry letting Ron get the apology out before saying it's all good or saying "that was really bad and you're going to need to earn my trust back and while I accept your apology our relationship won't go back to how it was for a while is entirely reasonable
