Harry is 15 and just nearly died. In that situation I think anyone would be scared and angry. Harry feeling like he's been betrayed is perfectly reasonable, and if anything, Canon downplays his feelings.

Add on that Harry has been abused for his entire childhood and that Ron was his first ever close friend and you've got everything needed for a total breakdown, something that could very easily break a friendship.
