I think we also have to remember that the characters in that book are children, and that we don't really see much of their lives - the books speed through weeks/months, so something like Harry and Ron's spat in book 4 /feels/ a lot longer than it is.

Like you say, we can view Ron's actions a few different ways - but I'd mention that the meta-fandom's perception of it is also important in fashioning those views. For instance, the 'Ron is the loyal one' idea is one that I think developed in the fandom, trying to find a distinctive positive role for him in the Trio - and then trying to fit that back into the text, where it doesn't exactly work (like, Ron is loyal for sure, but defining him as /the/ loyal one of the Trio doesn't make sense to me).

Similarly, the 'Evil Ron' interpretation is not one that people naturally would get from the books or movies - it would more be like a dislike of Ron. But through more interaction with the fandom and negative views of him in fanfiction, obviously that could go further and further until we get to the death-eater adjacent versions of him.
