Honestly, like most disputes in the series, the in-world conclusion is pretty simple - they're all idiots who fucked up in one way or another, each with some vaguely relevant logic behind their actions. :D

The out-of-world conclusion is even more simple - Rowling has all the consistency of liquid Helium. Sometimes characters are loyal or smart, other times they're neither thing simply because that was what she needed to push her plot forward.

It's one of the many reasons why fandom perception varies so frickin' much.

People each see those things happening, draw different conclusions and observations based on their experiences and worldviews, then try to make it all make sense and fit together in their concept of the characters and story. And while that attempt might make sense to them, it won't necessarily make sense to anyone else because interpretations and headcanons and concepts of the characters vary wildly from person to person. The thing you gotta remember is that, to the people who write these fics, those interpretations are either interesting or make sense to them.

eg. The Ron-not-believing-Harry thing. If someone sees Ron as a lazy, lackluster person that's basically a single rejection from being a Death Eater, then that scene makes sense because he's 'finally showing his true colours'. So, they make it so the previous stuff was him playing a part or faking it for whatever reason (usually Evil Dumbledore or Potions Molly).

If they see Ron as overly loyal like you, that sudden change doesn't make sense. So, they maybe explain it as teens being teens and thus they make Harry behave like that too, to avoid being seen as Bashing Ron and keeping that consistent 'teenage drama' thing going. Or they take a Horcrux type route and explain it as some influence or other.

I imagine that's why it's so rare to find crossover between bashing and redemption here. I've never seen a fic where Borderline-Death-Eater Ron is actually redeemed into a loyal and decent person akin to the more positive view of Ron.
