Came here to say this. The same Ron who offers Harry his sandwich five minutes after meeting him, is not jealous of Harry getting on the Quidditch team and is rather excited and happy for him, not to mention seeing (and helping) Harry deal with Voldemort, a basilisk, dementors, and every other shitty thing that happened to him in the first three books, suddenly decides that Harry is an attention-seeking prat lying to his face about entering the tournament.
