I've read exactly 1 story that did the slow forgiving of Ron well - and they reconciled eventually. Otherwise, it is just as you said, Harry feels like a prat. A Harry that does not forgive Ron just feels wrong to be honest. It really goes against one of the biggest foundations of his characterization and makes these iterations of Harry so enraging and difficult to read.
