Well, that kind of happened in DH, when Dumbledore told Harry that he could still come back, therefore facilitating Harry's rise from the dead. Does that count?

(Sorry, couldn't resist.)

Actually, now that I think about it, that /could/ be a plot point: Harry dies, but becomes a shade due to Voldemort serving as his horcrux, and it's up to his friends to raise him from the dead to fulfill the Prophecy (or just because they'd rather he be alive).
