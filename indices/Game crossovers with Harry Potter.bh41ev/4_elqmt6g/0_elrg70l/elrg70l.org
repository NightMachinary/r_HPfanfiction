I'm currently writing a fic with this cross over. I'm not going to post it untill I've completed it, but I'm about half way through it. I'll save your name and PM you when it's up.

I've played through the game a few times to find all the small plot points laying around, and have done tons of research into the lore surrounding the game. Hopefully people enjoy it. It does have magic(obviously) and Harry dealing with Insight.
