  Does anyone know if C'est La Vie will be updated?

Updated? Perhaps someday.

Finished? Not a chance. Cywscross is notorious for starting promising stories, updating frequently for first few chapters, then slower updates, then slower yet... and then he or she starts a new story and begins the process anew.

It's dated, but another Hufflepuff Harry story is [[http://ficwad.com/story/167231][Shake Me]] by RoxySnape.

Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/7/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] is a (quite good) female-Harry story where she's sorted into Hufflepuff.
