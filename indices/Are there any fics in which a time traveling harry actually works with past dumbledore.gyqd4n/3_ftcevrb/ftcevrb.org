Tapestry of Fate by Minxie linkao3(10140137)

Escaping the Paradox by Meri linkao3(2060)

Return of the Prodigal by Lachesis linkao3(7876201)

All of these have a Dumbledore who knows that Harry is a time-traveller. Note that these are not Peggysue time travel where Harry goes back to his child's body: he goes back in his current/older body, to before he is born (Marauder era).
