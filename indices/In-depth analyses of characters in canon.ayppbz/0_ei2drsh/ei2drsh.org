I find more the HP Lexicon most helpful for in canon information (dates, major events, things like that). It cites to the books so you can then read in context if you need more.

And searching this sub and reading through the comments will be helpful for most characters in terms of common misrepresentations or analysis through discussion. Off the top of my head, I can think of dedicated threads for Luna, Snape and Sirius all in recent memory, and the archives go very far back.
