Yeah. And transferring into a warzone isn't the best for the kid. He is an adult by law. If he can't take care of his sister, who will be an adult in a year as well, well enough to beat out going to a country in the middle of a civil war, then I wonder just what he can bring to the table for Harry and Co. Comic relief? A "good Crabbe/Goyle"? Or is that a case of "plot induced variable competency?" He's a competent wizard and valuable friend at Hogwarts, but a useless idiot at Durmstrang?
