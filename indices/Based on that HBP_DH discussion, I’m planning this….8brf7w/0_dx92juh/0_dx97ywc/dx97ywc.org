But really, how is your fic any different from thousands other post OOTP indy!Harry ones?

Since Daphne is already an OC, what does adding more OCs from Denmark do to the story? You are not even from Denmark and seem to be not familiar with this country at all.

Actually, the fandom is so full of 'Harry alienating from Ron/Hermione' that indy!Harry fics with an intact Trio are very hard to find. Remember that his friendship with Ron and Hermione was forged through life and death struggles, and he could count on their loyalty during terrible times. Even Ginny had shown her loyalty through the foundation of DA and the Battle of DoM. Why should suddenly a newcomer with hardly any proven track record gain Harry's trust? Lots of girls in the school had rather nefarious design on the BWL (Romilda Vane), and canon Harry was perfectly justified in being paranoid. Your Daphne better show that she could help Harry significantly with deeds, not only words.
