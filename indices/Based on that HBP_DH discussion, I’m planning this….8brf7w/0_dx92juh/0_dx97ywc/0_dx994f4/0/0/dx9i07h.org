The other person posted that /after/ I responded to the original post. I can take criticism. I can also take suggestions. I will not, however, ever appreciate people who try to tell me how to write my own story, and I think every writer can agree to that.

Also the same person often makes assumptions. It was a build-up of frustration, and for that I apologize.
