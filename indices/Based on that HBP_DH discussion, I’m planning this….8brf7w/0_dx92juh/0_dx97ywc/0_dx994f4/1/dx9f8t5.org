You said Harry wouldn't be as close to them, and that would "force both of them to realise their flaws". That's pretty much the standard "Harry gets new and better pureblood friends, and the mudblood and the ginger traitor realise how badly they have been treating Harry" plot. Coupled with Greengrass as the girlfriend, and her family playing important roles, that pretty much seems to be yet another "Harry/Daphne" fic, where Ron and Hermione are at best minor side characters.
