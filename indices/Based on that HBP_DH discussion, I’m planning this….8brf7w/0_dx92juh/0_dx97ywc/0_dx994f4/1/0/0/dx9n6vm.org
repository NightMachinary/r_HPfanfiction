1) Yeah. Special pureblood OCs playing important roles sounds like the standard pureblood trope to me.

2) Yes. But while Harry ending up a little less close to his best friends - who went through hell together with him - because he wants to spend more time with his girlfriend might be plausible enough, him making a whole new group of friends, instead of pulling Greengrass into his old group of friends (doubly so if her cousin is a Gryffindor too) is pushing it too much, in my opinion. Especially with Voldemort around. You'd have to be a special kind of idiot to focus on a bunch of untested strangers (from Slytherin and Durmstrang, even!) instead of those who joined you in battle already - for years, in Ron's and Hermione's case.

3) You said he "wouldn't be as close to them", even though there's no reason for that just because he's dating a girl. If they are his best friends, then what's this shit about "force them to confront their flaws"? Why turn to OCs if you have a perfectly good group of loyal and brave friends already?

Quite simple, why do you need to chase the typical "Harry dates Daphne, and drops his friends" plot, instead of Harry dragging Daphne into the DA and his circle of friends? That would be original - a Daphne who is the outsider, who has to prove herself, and who has to adjust her biased pureblood views.
