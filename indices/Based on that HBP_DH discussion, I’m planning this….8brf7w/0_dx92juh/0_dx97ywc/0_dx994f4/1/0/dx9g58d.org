Okay, let me provide spoilers, since you people like to assume wrongly:

1) The brother is a Gryffindor and the sister is a Ravenclaw. Still sound like the standard "pureblood" trope to you?

2) You can have two different groups of friends.

3) Of course Harry's not as close to them if he's dating Daphne. They're not the big, happy Weasley-Gryffindor family anymore. That /doesn't/ mean they're not his best friends.
