  She could further offer to remove the Trace for Harry and his friends through her family's 'connections'. Her parents could advise him to go after Death Eater finances, such as seizing Lestrange and Malfoy vaults, if Harry stepped up to support Minister Scrimgeour and their factions. Also, Greengrass faction might provide additional material support if the Order agreed to a common goal.
