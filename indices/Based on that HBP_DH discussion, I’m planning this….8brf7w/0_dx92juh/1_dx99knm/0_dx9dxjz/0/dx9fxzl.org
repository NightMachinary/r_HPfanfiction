  This isn't going to be about politics and pureblood culture - well, there'll be tidbits, but Harry's not interested in that sort of stuff.

Did I mention 'pureblood culture' at all? One big shortcoming of HBP/DH is that Harry didn't understand to utilize available resources. Hermione, despite her intelligence, had no clue about anti-terrorism and counterinsurgency operations. If there was something Daphne and her faction could bring to help Harry, politics and strategies would be their key contributions.

It's a cliche, but I think it actually makes sense. Of course, I would cut out all the pureblood culture stuffs, although the Greengrass faction certainly wanted preferential treatments after the war.

Was the Greengrass faction truly benign, and why would it suddenly help out Harry? Well, it obviously saw Voldemort as a systemic threat and bad for its business/influence. It was mostly made up of people like Slughorn, who possessed significant power and wealth, but were not courageous enough to fight on their own. Dumbledore originally didn't trust it, but with time running out for him, was willing to accept it as the lesser evil.

Regardless whether Harry was interested in politics or not, he had to accept it. For example, seizing the Lestrange vault to compensate the Longbottoms would be a perfect reason, Hurting Death Eater finances would be an added plus, and getting the Cup in the process was just the icing on the cake. Daphne would be able to explain very easily to Harry that for every X amount of Galleons seized from Death Eater vaults, there would be one fewer assassin/murderer for hire. JKR might not want to bring up true anti terrorism strategies in her children's book, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't either.
