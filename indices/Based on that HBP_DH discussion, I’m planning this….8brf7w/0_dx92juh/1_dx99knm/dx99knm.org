Furthermore, I have these plot considerations:

- Dumbledore's redemption is achieved by taking competent actions in teaching Harry effectively and preparing the Order for his eventual demise. I expect to see Dumbledore showing Harry all the memories within a few hours, telling Harry about the danger of a Taboo, and offering different options in defeating an individual with Horcruxes.
- Daphne could confirm Harry's suspicion that Draco was a Death Eater and planning terrorist activities in the school. She could further offer to remove the Trace for Harry and his friends through her family's 'connections'. Her parents could advise him to go after Death Eater finances, such as seizing Lestrange and Malfoy vaults, if Harry stepped up to support Minister Scrimgeour and their factions. Also, Greengrass faction might provide additional material support if the Order agreed to a common goal.
- Daphne prompted Harry to restart DA.
- Draco was caught red handed, thanks to Daphne's support. He was forced to cooperate. The Order might 'kidnap' Narcissa to maintain the appearance.
- Voldemort showed up to defend his Cup when the Ministry was trying to seize the Lestrange Vault. He didn't succeed, many got killed in the battle, and Goblins were pissed at Voldemort.
- Pansy and Parkinsons defected following that Voldemort's defeat.
