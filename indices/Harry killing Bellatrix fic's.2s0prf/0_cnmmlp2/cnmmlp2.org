[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][The Dark Lord's Equal]] by Lens of Sanity is one that comes to mind. How "worth reading" is a matter of personal taste (the author riffs off ideas from several other authors, to which several readers seem to take objection), but might be enjoyable.
