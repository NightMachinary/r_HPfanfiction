The Genghis Khan idea is neat, but the "Neanderthal mixing" makes no sense. Apart from the fact that it would mean that no pure African (100% Homo sapiens sapiens) could have magic, it also doesn't account for magical animals and plants. I suppose mixing with Denisovans or other archaic humans could have provided magic for Asians.

Traits aren't always (or, maybe even often) controlled by single genes, and just having a gene or a gene sequence doesn't always mean the trait expresses itself. The more vital something is to earth-style life, the earlier it appears in DNA. That's how scientists estimate how long ago different plants/animals started evolving separately. We have gene sequences in common with peas, for example. Obviously not the ones for curly vs. straight hair, or eye color; they're ones regulating some cellular processes.

This does imply that magic is controlled/accessed by one or more gene sequences that have been around since the early days of multi-celled organisms, and perhaps earlier. The existence of muggleborns and squibs implies that muggles and magical are the same race; they haven't yet split into separate evolutionary lines.

That further implies that magic is expressed by a very particular set of gene sequences, and perhaps requires epigenetic expression - muggleborn are those whose parents either don't have a complete set of gene sequences for magic, or who did not get the epigenetic "trigger" to cause them to become active, while squibs are those who have the gene sequence, but never got the trigger. Or, perhaps, they got the trigger, but don't have a complete set of gene sequences for magic.
