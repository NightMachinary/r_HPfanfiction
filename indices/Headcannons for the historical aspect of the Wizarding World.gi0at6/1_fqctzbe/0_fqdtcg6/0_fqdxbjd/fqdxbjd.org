Tbf, I only chose Neanderthals not because it makes sense from a genetic or evolutionary perspective, but because of the theory that modern humans are a mix of Homo Sapiens and Homo Neanderthal(i)ensis. There are a couple of very neat theories that posit that the modern human is in all aspects a mix of the two, that the more warlike and agressive homo sapiens was tempered by the more passive neanderthal, while the more sedentary and unadventurous neanderthal became active and began wandering through the homo sapiens. I thought it would be neat if magic was also a part of that.

In any case, it's my least favourite of the two theories anyway. I like the common ancestor more, because it means that wizards have been around since the dawn of humanity, perhaps even before. As for your second point, magic and genetics are only tangentially related - almost every species has a magical counterpart, like Kneazles and cats, which can interbreed without any notable effect on sterility. Of course, magic can combine creatures that are a bit more out there, so perhaps magic itself has an effect on the viable foetus being formed from two rather dissimilar species. (firecrabs and manticores spring to mind. Even if manticores are a crustacean, they are too dissimilar to ever form a viable offspring without the help of magic)

I've always preferred the idea that Muggleborns are created through the ambient flow of magic essentially flipping a switch in ordinary human to non-ordinary human. Perhaps every muggleborn parent encountered a fluctuating magical wave, or stood under a particularily magical solar storm, or the child was concieved when the full moon was at its zenith directly above.

This, then, makes it the same process that creates other wizards - with magical parents, the child is simply exposed to the magic of their mother during the entire pregnancy, essentially guaranteeing a magical child is born. Squibs, then, are created mainly through inbreeding, just like a lot of other birth defects. Magic can be used to correct other such defects, like the Habsburg chin and other deformities, but one of these possible defects is the flipping of the switch back to ordinary human. The child was still exposed to their mother's magic, but the flip was switched and they were born without the ability to manipulate it. It still mutated their body, which is why they live slightly longer and can see magical things. And, of course, human magic bases itself on intention a whole lot, so a spell created to affect muggles doesn't affect squibs - not because they're genetically any different, but because the caster considered them different.

Magic is a mystical force adjacent to nature, not overriding it or being subservient, and I find it much cooler if magic itself acts according to its own rules rather than the established ones of other things, like genetics and the like. Imo, JKR intended it to be like this, too. I think it's pretty sad that the community insists on making magic less and less magical and just another branch of mundane science.
