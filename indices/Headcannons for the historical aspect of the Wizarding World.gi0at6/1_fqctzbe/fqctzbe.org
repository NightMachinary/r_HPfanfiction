I had a funny idea the other day, which was that Gengis Khan had magical blood in him, but which didn't manifest itself into wizardry for whatever reason, same as Heracles, Alexander the Great, etc. Their magic twisted into a different shape, reinforcing their body and mind instead of their soul, which resulted in people with greatly enhanced physical aspects and mental acuity. Gengis, then, is responsible for a large part of magical blood in europe, as well as the disproportionate number of muggleborns found there.

I also had an interesting thought - where did magic use in humans originate? I have two theories, both of which I like equally:

- It was created when the Neanderthal genes mixed with Homo Sapiens genes. Some combination of them opened the latent potential in the resulting humans, making them wizards. Today, there is little neanderthal genetic material remaining in humans, though magic itself has already suffused the entire species in a way that can never be taken away. The two genetic profiles mixing was the catalyst moment.

- Humanity evolved from a common ancestor who was somewhat of an ape, out in the jungles of central africa. However, this theory says that ape was magical. They could manipulate heat, and start fires when threatened. Over the millennia, they slowly evolved out of the trees and walked into the savannah, where they honed their magical abilities. There, they wandered as nomads for eons before finally making that last leap, and twisting their magic into the shape that would eventually lead to what it is today: They learned to manipulate heat and fire through symbolism and metaphor, as that is what separates human wizards from all other magical species, just like immortality seperates phoenixes from all other magical species. A vestige of this original heritage is still present in modern humanity - their magic feels warm; the strongest spell they are capable of is Fiendfyre; they are the only sapient magical species a Phoenix will tolerate living with. It's also mirrored in many creation myths, like the greek one, where Prometheus gave fire to humans, and the human soul is described as a flame, or the nordic one, where two great realms crashed together in the primeval darkness - primordial cold and primordial heat.

Magic itself originates from The Big Bang, and eventually Stars. A star can in theory fulfill most of the criteria of life, and I posit that they are an immensely magical form of life. Their matter and energy radiates outwards, lashing planets and the entire universe in chaotic waves of wild magic, which saturated Earth in the ancient past and led to Abiogenesis, the start of life. Life is inherently a magical thing because of this happenstance. And because star matter is what makes up the entire universe, even our planet and our bodies, some of this immensely powerful force lingered within the matter making up everything, eventually giving all magical species a fragment of the infinite energies present at the moment of creation, and carried over the billions of years through stars and planets and eventually into their bodies.
