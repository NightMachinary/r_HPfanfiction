I personally like to move away from canon on the issue of the historical background - particularly for fics. So it'd be a case by case situation!

That being said, I typically see it with interweaving magical and non-magical history being the most interesting. So, big historical events IRL should have an impact on the Wizarding World in some fashion.

That can either be inferred from some canon or fanon details about the current magical world - working backwards is a rather good way of doing it, IMO. For instance, the French could have a more open/less biased representation towards non-human magical beings (drawing from there seemingly being less of discrimination towards Fleur/Mme. Maxime, both of who are important and part non-human). Why would that be? Well, maybe we point back to the French Revolution, and say that wizards were involved in the revolutionary side, applying its ideology to magical creatures. Or, as another example, why is Luxembourg populous enough to have a Quidditch world cup team? Well, maybe we point to the witch hunts, and say that Wizards and Witches decided to congregate in some tiny 'nations', where singular cities might be mostly magical - and using said magic to keep them independent, tying into other european micro-states/small states.

That can extend to other fanon choices. An example there might be how an author might decide to deal with the native american wizarding society - both north and south american. Canon is not particularly verbose on their subject - but some authors might choose to still have them in their own societies, and have to wrestle with how to make that be the case in the past.

I tend to think it's better to think of it on a fic-by-fic setting, since part of the fun of the HP universe is just how open ended it is. However, generally speaking, I quite like having multiple powerful - and different - magical societies/ways of doing magic. So Europe might be focused on the wand, but China, India, and any other magical society that's decided on being used would all have had different traditions and centers of power, to spread things out around the world.
