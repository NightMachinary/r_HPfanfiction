Here's a couple of mine:

1) The Statute of Secrecy isn't the start point for wizards hiding themselves from Muggles, and in fact had been doing so to greater or lesser degrees for centuries beforehand; it merely represented the severing of the last connections between their two worlds, and officially made it illegal to reveal the existence of magic to the mundane world at large.

2) The foundation of Hogwarts Castle, and the town of Hogsmeade, was initially an attempt to gather together all wizards and witches in the British Isles into one place with an eye towards creating a semi-independant magical city-state in the Scottish Highlands; which would later be refined to creating a safe haven for all wizards and witches (regardless of their familial origin) fleeing suspicion and/or persecution from/by their Muggle neighbours.

3) Salazar Slytherin didn't /actually/ hate Muggleborns, he was just against letting them return to their Muggle families after they began their studies in magic; and was in fact one of the first people calling for what would eventually be codified as the Statute of Secrecy. The reason for his vilification in the history books is because Godric Gryffindor was infamous for his pettyness.
