Actually, Newt voiced almost every single spell he used, other than a summoning charm in the beginning of the movie. The reason why there is so much wandless magic in the film is simply because we are seeing trained wizards in action, although it isn't used for much more than Telekinesis. The massive dome was likely a shield charm done in unison. Wand Movements haven't mattered since the First book, it isn't even mentioned passed Harry's second year I believe.
