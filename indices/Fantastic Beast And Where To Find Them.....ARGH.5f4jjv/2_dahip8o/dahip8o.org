- Wandless magic was already canon.

#+begin_quote
  The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.

  The wand is a European invention, and while African witches and wizards have adopted it as a useful tool in the last century, many spells are cast simply by pointing the finger or through hand gestures.

- Non-verbal magic was already canon.

#+begin_quote
  ‘... you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of non-verbal spells. What is the advantage of a non-verbal spell?' Hermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, ‘Very well -- Miss Granger?' ‘Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform,' said Hermione, ‘which gives you a split-second advantage.'

- Reducing wand motions was already canon. Can't find right quote at the moment though.

- The insta-dome may be some sort of special MACUSA power. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5ev6ez/dark_lords_and_darker_magic/dafl5ci/][Taure provided interesting theory about those here]]

So for person getting disturbed about canon you don't seem to know canon that well.
