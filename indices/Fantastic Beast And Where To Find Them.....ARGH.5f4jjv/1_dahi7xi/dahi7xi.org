Not sure what your problem is, really.

Non-verbal magic: introduced in HBP, something we see adult wizards use all the time.

Vague wand movements: again, something we see all the time in the books, with wizards casting many spells with simple gestures - flicks, waves, even just pointing. It's always been the case that wand movements seem to be something you can dispense with.

Wandless magic: this has always been possible. See Quirrell in PS, Snape's legilimency, not to mention the entire discipline of potions.

Shield charm: while we learn in HBP that many wizards are completely incapable of casting the shield charm, it shouldn't be a surprise that aurors and other high level wizards are able to cast it well. In DH Harry cast a shield charm over half the Great Hall, separating Voldemort out from the rest of the fighters, and Harry at that point has an incomplete education. Flitwick, in the same book, casts a shield charm over all of Hogwarts.
