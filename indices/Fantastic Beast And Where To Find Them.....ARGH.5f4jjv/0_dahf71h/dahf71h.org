Hmmm, I wasn't really looking for instances of wandless magic in the movie, but the ones I do recall are by Graves and Queenie (maybe).

[[/spoiler][Since Graves was actually Grindelwald, I'd say that his instances of wandless magic can be forgiven. Queenie, on the other hand, I thought I saw her holding a wand, but I can't be sure. But she is clearly a powerful witch, if her talent for Legilimency is any indication. I suppose Credence uses wandless magic, too, but his is really more in the realm of accidental magic. Very violent and very uncontrollable accidental magic.]]

Voiceless magic is taught sixth year and up, going by canon, so really, it's a skill most competent witches and wizards should have.

Wand movements are a bit of a tricky one. My headcanon is that the more proficient a witch/wizard is at a spell, the less wand movement matters. At some point, wand movement ceases to matter at all once you have become good enough at the spell. But I don't know if this is actually mentioned in canon or Pottermore, so I can't be sure. If I recall correctly, most instances where there is little wand movement are for spells which are used quite often, e.g., Accio. But for spells a little more complex (Queenie baking strudel), or used less often [[/spoiler][(the Revelio spell Newt uses to reveal Grindelwald's identity near the end)]], there tends to be distinct wand movements involved.

So, overall, I'd say the movie is fairly accurate and I'm definitely considering it canon.

P.S. Apologies if the spoiler tag doesn't work, this is my first time using it and I'm a little lost, tbh.

EDIT: I just saw the bit where you said they raise a protective dome with nothing more than a point of their wand. Sorry, totally missed that when I first read through it. In DH Part 2 several teachers are also shown to be raising similar-looking wards with only a point of their wand. Hermione raises wards, too, in DH, but there is little mention of wand movement in the books and the wards she is shown to raise in the movies do require wand movement, but also look very different from the wards raised in Fantastic Beasts.
