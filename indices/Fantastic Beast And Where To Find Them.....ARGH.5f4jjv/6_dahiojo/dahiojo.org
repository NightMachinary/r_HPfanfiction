You've missed the fact that in JK Rowlings world the Wand is a European invention. Wandless magic originated from North American magic.

"The most glaring difference between magic practised by Native Americans and the wizards of Europe was the absence of a wand.

The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one"

The article then goes on to state that Wand permits are required for all wizards and witches if only for the purpose of tracking illegal activity.

But it doesn't outright state the only wands are able to be used. It's conceivable that by the 1920s people were being trained in both wanded and wandless magic.
