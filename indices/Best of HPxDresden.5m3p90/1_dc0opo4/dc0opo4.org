I actually mentioned this series in another topic earlier today:

'The Denarian Renegade' Trilogy by Shezza

It's a nice, long series, and I found it to be very entertaining, though it doesn't hold up as well with a second read-through. All the characters are (fairly) well-developed (including Dumbledore) and go through some sort of character-development (excluding Harry)

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade)

linkffn(The Denarian Knight)

linkffn(The Denarian Lord)

There is an additional oneshot linkffn(The Denarian Variation) and technically a fourth book linkffn(The Denarian Apocalypse), but it only received two chapters before it was abandoned.
