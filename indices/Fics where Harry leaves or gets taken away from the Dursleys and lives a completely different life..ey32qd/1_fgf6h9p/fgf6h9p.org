/Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts/ linkffn(13230151) has Harry being mentored by a Tabletop RPG group that includes conspiracy theorists, an aspiring actress, a computer programmer, and a hobby shop store owner who may or may not be a former spy, before eventually striking out on his own when he comes into money. There's a bit of bashing, but for the most part, it's just Harry being cynical and kind of a prick.
