I imagine it as Harry's pov. Dunno why.

"Did you guys hear---" Fred? started.

"---what happened yesterday night at the Slytherin common room?" Probably-George finished.

Harry Potter stared at the third years in front of him. Yesterday night? He had spent the last two entire nights at the hospital wing. Had Snape gone after the philosopher's stone while he was asleep? Did someone from the Slytherin house try to stop him? It seemed unlikely, the entire house consisted of evil slimy snakes.

"If mom is sending another howler, we are running" Ron warned, not really wanting to hear whatever his brothers wanted to say.

"We didn't do anything!" Fred defended hastily. Yes, that one had to be Fred. Probably.

"Although we definitely would love to take credit of anything that traumatizes the Slytherin" George added.

And that did get their attention.

"Malfoy decided that pestering the Longbottom kid would be a good idea" Harry turned towards the Slytherin table. He recognized the name. Everyone gasped when Longbottom was sorted into the green house, from what he had gathered, everyone expected him to be Gryffindor, like his parents before him. "and no one really knows the entire story, but Neville did some weird wandless magic and suddenly Malfoy was in the floor, sobbing." Fred was enjoy this way too much. He agreed though, Malfoy sucked.

"Brilliant!" Ron laughed. "Maybe Longbottom isn't as bad as I imagined. Bloody scary though."

"Wandless magic at eleven?" Hermione sounded unsure. "That's impossible."

Harry ignored her. If Neville didn't like Malfoy, maybe not all Slytherins were that bad.
