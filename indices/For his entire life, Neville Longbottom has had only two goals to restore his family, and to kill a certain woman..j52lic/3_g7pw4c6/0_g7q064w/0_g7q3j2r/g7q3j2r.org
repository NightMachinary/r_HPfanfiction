After that morning, Harry started hearing Longbottom's name everywhere he went.

"Did you see him in Defense? He is so fast!"

"Neville is always at the library, he is so smart!"

"He never talks to anyone in class," Lavender lamented. "He probably feels lonely, maybe I should try to become his friend!" Padma laughed out load.

"You already tried, he ignored you" Lavender blushed and Harry decided he didn't want to listed to that conversation anymore.

But it was at the end of the year when everything went south. While they were waiting for the potion class to start a sudden explosion was heard and the entire building roared.

"It was insane!" Susan bones said, five hours later "At first we thought he was barmy, but he kept on yelling at Quirrel and ranting about how he was going to have his revenge. He said that if he couldn't kill Bellatrix yet, he might as well kill the man she worked under. And when he did manage to take the professor's turban off, he was right! It was he-who-must-not-be-named!" Susan continued.

"It was really him?!" Lavender gasped. It couldn't be, Voldemort was truly alive then? Snape wasn't after the stone?

" Yes" the huffepuff continued soberly. It was obvious she had spent some time crying. "And he tried to kill Neville too. Theodore tried to get in the way, but he couldn't do much. Neville then did some weird magic and suddenly he threw him a lightning, of all things. It was terrifying."

A lighting? How did that make any sense.

"The Daily Prophet is going to have a field day tomorrow." Padma added. "But his spirit really did go out of his body?"

Susan nodded, it looked like she was about to start crying again. Harry could relate.

"It did. Dumbledore is probably going to address the topic once the aurors leave his office. But whatever the case, it's obvious that Voldemort isn't as dead as we thought"
