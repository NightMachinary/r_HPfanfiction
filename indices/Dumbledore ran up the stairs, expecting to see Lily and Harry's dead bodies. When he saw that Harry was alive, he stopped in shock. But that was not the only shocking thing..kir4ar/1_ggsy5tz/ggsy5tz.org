I first saw this, and thought it was a WBWL story, because to be honest, who didn't? Anyways, then I noticed the absence of Jamie Potter, the red haired, spoiled nuisance, and to be honest I felt a bit disappointed. (I'll see myself out now...)

Continued reading, and my jaw dropped. What a twist! Mind making this into a oneshot?

It baffles me that Nicholas knew all about horcruxes. You mean, Harry could have been a nice normal boy this entire time?
