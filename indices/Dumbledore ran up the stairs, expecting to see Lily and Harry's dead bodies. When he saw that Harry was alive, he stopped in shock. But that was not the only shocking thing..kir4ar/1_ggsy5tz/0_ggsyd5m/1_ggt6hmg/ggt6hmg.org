Everyone is trash at writing when they start. It isn't a talent or a gift. It's a skill, same as boxing or carpentry or dancing. The only way anyone ever gets better is to practice.

So ignore what you think is the quality of your work, and just get to work. If you don't, you'll never know how good you could be.

Plus, that way we get good stories to read. :P
