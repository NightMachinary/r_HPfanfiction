Awww, don't bring yourself down! I'm sure you'd be awesome, you come up with great ideas, and have a very dramatic way of saying things (Albus Dumbledore.....was dead)

I think you'd be a great crime/adventure fanfic author, with the plotlines you have. It seems like a regular WBWL, that the reader doesn't even note that there's no so-called boy who lived. It seems so normal, until the mention of horcrux, then you start to reconsider your thinking. Avada Kedavra, and then, right before you have even read the last line, you know what's happening.

This sub has a writing center with proofreaders who can help you improve! It also has many anonymous resources, in case you don't like other people reading your stuff. Posting a fanfiction always is scary, but once you see people reading it, your self-esteem increases with the bookmarkings and reviews and positive comments.

But, if you don't want to, and feel like writing a fanfic will make you feel bad, then don't! I hope some awesome fanfic author is lurking around here....
