I read this everytime I slog through a story that initially looks interesting but then devolves into contrived melodramatic angst. It's like having one drink after a night of binging, just sets you straight, clears your head.

It provides a nice dose of deconstructive realism, in that, only JK's twisted mind would have a clueless 15-16 yr old boy refusing a girl like Romilda.
