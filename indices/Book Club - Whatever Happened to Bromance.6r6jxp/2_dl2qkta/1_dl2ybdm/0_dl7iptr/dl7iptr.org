Yeah, same. Looking back it would have been fine and she was nice but at the time it just freaked me out a little bit and I didn't know how to react. Maybe because I just wasn't used to girls propositioning me rather than the other way around? I don't know, it was just really weird at the time and I was too uncomfortable with the situation to do anything.
