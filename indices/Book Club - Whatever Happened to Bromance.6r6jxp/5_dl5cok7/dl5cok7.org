This fic doesn't need a detailed analysis because that's not what it's for. It's balls-out comedy and loses steam on a reread, but the first time it's full of lolz. Many people here recommend frankly bad fanfic all the time. Skip Prince of Slytherin for once and read this instead, it's great for a laugh. Better with alcohol.
