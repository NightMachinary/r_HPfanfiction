I got about 2/3 of the way through the Saving Connor series and I've had to give up. I hate every single character in it. Every. single. one. I thought maybe it was just a set-up at first and that they would all realize they're being abusive towards Harry and all that, but they DON'T. Or if they do, it's been dragged out waaay too long. None of the characters act their ages. The children don't act like children, the adults don't act like adults. Every problem is solved by a convenient magical object that seems like it was perfectly tailored for the specific situation. I really wanted to like this series, but I hated everything about it.
