[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger]] by whydoyouneedtoknow. Rating: T Summary: AU, first in the main Dangerverse series, now complete. Lone wolf. Dream-seer. Bright child. Scarred child. Singer. Prisoner. Dancer child. Dragon child. Eight semi-ordinary people. One extraordinary family, and how they became one. Pre-Hogwarts story. Notes: Brilliantly written story and quite lighthearted but has some very emotional moments. The author is currently working on the fifth and final book of the series, with regular updates.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]] by Lightning on the Wave. Rating: M Summary: AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE Notes: The best Harry Potter fanfiction series I have ever read - it rivals the real series. It gets very dark in the later books so it's not a lighthearted read. There are seven long books, and the series has been completed.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=321302]] by MarauderLover7. Rating: Mature Summary: Over 20000 reads! Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway. Notes: Well written and reasonably light-hearted, though there are dark moments. It's still the first book, though the author's mentioned a sequel already and updates regularly.
