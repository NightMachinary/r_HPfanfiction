Looks fine on my end(24in 1920x1200, 14in 1920x1080, 5.5in 1080x1920), Fireshot-taken pictures tend to be a bit blurry when combined with Windows's DPI scaling, but I've used it for a long time to take screencap of long pages, and you're the first one that's said anything about it having readability issues.

Actually, come to think of it, viewing it on low resolution screen may be the problem, since full zoom will get you like 4 words per line and it'll look like crap zoomed out because of interpolation.
