This is by far the best indy!Harry I've ever read. The storyline is fast paced, and I as a reader was able to feel the intensity and urgency behind Harry's actions, as though he's on a timer. There are cliched moments, but they are very limited in number.

The action is riveting, Harry's power is believable given the premise of the story, he doesn't run around making fools out of Albus or Tom on a regular basis - he catches them by surprise exactly once - and after that, they wise up. Voldemort is also terrifyingly strong.

Yes it is abandoned, but the last written scene can be interpreted as an ending of its own, if you so choose.
