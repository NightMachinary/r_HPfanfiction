I guess that makes you different from normal people. The instinctive reaction to something bad is to avoid it, and people remember what's bad for a long time. There's also a big difference between a ship that's normally at least decent and you reading a bad fic versus a ship that's inherently flawed where almost any random fic you choose will be problematic. A lot of people tend to stop reading fics once they find them distasteful, and repeat experiences that appear to be the norm tend to leave them jaded. You've somehow decided to ignore that aspect of decision-making personally.

You mention that you have a good quality threshold, but you also mention that you've found "many HP/TMR to be absolutely hilarious". I'd personally be hard-pressed to find more than 15 actually good HP/TMR fics in the fandom, and certainly no more than 5 that are hilarious. The reality of the situation is yes, every ship will have something horrific written about it, but there are also ships that are inherently awful and if you contemplate most of those fics, low-key horrific, and it isn't worth peoples' time nor sanity to try any random fic in those ships.
