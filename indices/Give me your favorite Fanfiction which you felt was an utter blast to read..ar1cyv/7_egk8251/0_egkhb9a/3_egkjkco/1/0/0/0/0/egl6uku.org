You can change canon, but a lot of people don't take the time to actually do so. It's pretty hard to justify why Harry should end up with the person who murdered his parents, tried to murder him, and ruined countless lives, including those of his family and friends. I've read Full Circle, and the relationship does indeed make sense, buts that only because of the reincarnation. And honestly, it could go the other way. Reincarnation could just as easily result in a Harry who is willing to do whatever it takes no matter the cost to completely eradicate Voldemort from existence. The story could still even be crack. The description does help alleviate some concern, but fanfiction authors are not famously known for their good writing, nor is fandom known for its good taste. The high amount of kudos helps, but without knowing beforehand how it compares in number to other fics does not actually give it any real value (FYI, it's only 12th among the top HP fics with kudos too). As mentioned before, fandom doesn't always have good taste. People are far too willing the glaring flaws in how a relationship started in order to start shipping their distasteful whitewashed characters. Other stories that are often given many kudos are stories with Mary Sues as the main character. A lot of popular fanfiction is just mindless creepy fluff or wish-fulfillment roleplay.
