I guess it's dropped since the last time I checked. My bad.

Everyone always talks about their bad experiences with fanfiction, but honestly I've never had any problems. I think a lot of it is my quality threshold --- if it is not up to par within the first few chapters, I exit the tab --- and me remembering the good fics better than the bad ones. I honestly try to not let any previous bad experiences with a bad ship (for example) affect what I will read next. There is a ship who's every story I've read I literally cannot stomach, but that doesn't stop me from clicking the next story, because /maybe this will be different, maybe the story will be so good I can ignore the ship/

I think that's a big part of fanfiction, to me at least --- the picking and choosing. We choose which fics we want to read based on tags, and we don't mind skipping over bigger sections of the text because there are plenty more fics in the sea.
