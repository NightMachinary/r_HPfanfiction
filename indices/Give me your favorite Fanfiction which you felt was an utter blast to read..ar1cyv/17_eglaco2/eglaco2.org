Oh boy, get ready!

linkffn(7899682) Schooled: HP/TR, when I'm in the mood for a good curve stomp.

linkffn(4924413) Dark and Light: plays a lot with boring cliche tropes. He's perfect but can't feel anything. He's not quite human. His magic sides with the dark side but that doesn't mean he's evil. If you're gonna use cliche tropes, this fic shows how to use them well.

linkffn(6099036) Caf√©: nice slice of life. Not much really happens, but then again a lot really happens

linkffn(2900438) Unsung Hero: my favorite of the wrong BWL-Potter-twin fics

linkffn(11244373) Sine Qua Non: HP/SS, blink and you'll miss it. Two Harry's existing at the same time, one a student, the other a muggle studies professor. This is written in my absolute favorite way of writing couples: subtle. Are they really good friends or something more? That's non of your business. You can infer what their relationship is.

linkao3(3390668) C'est La Vie: I just really like this author's way of writing characters

linkao3(2677538) Fifth House: HP/SS, Some really interesting ideas about Hogwarts, magic, and soul bonding. Author only move 25 of 68 chapters to ao3. I have all 68 chapters if anyone's interested

Dullastacks' A Little Light Reading: taken off the internet. My favorite of the "characters reading the books" but it's just Snape and the fic never finished the 1st book before being deleted. I also have this saved.
