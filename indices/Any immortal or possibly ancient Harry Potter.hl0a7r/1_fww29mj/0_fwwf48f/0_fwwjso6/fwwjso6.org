Not really - it would certainly help to some degree, especially to get references or have a general sense of location (well kinda), but to be honest, the author explains anything particularly important that you need to know, and the series is currently set way, way before The Hobbit and subsequent books anyway. As someone who only had a passing knowledge before I read this fic, I'd definitely recommend it.
