Linkffn(Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum)

Harry goes to Drumstang in this one. It definitely has some cringey parts (Below) but first time I've read it, I found parts that were decent.

But I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like the cliché “Harry is rich, handsome and a Quidditch star”

All in all, definitely could have been improved upon but this definitely isn't the worst one I have seen.
