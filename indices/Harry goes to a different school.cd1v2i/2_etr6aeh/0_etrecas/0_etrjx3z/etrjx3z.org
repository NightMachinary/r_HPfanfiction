So I looked at the first chapter of Snow Point, just to see if the writing was like the summary, and it's definitely not. It looks like there's a beta who might have helped with editing.

I can't speak to the quality of the plot/premise, but if you're interested in the story and just put off by poor grammar, don't be.
