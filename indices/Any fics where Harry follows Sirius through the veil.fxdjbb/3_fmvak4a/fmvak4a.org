*On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads* - linkao3(17926664)\\
The Veil isn't really the Veil, it's a dimensional crack. Manipulative Dumbledore, but in a reasonable capacity. No other bashing. Except maybe Odin. Well, he doesn't really follow him. It's more of an expedition?

*Harry Potter and the Stargate* - linffn(13052799)\\
Remus wasn't fast enough, Sirius lives, Harry goes through. H/LL. Dumbledore/Ron/Ginny bashing. The Dumbledore bashing at the end was hilarious. It borders on the level of absurdness you see in Champions Champion. Op Harry.
