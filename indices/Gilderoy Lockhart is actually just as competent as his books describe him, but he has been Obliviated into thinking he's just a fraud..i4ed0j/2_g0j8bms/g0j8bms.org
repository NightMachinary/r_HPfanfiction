Here's the truth - I don't know how I got here.

They say my name is Gilderoy Lockhart; Order of Merlin, Third Class; Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League; five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award and all that.

You know, even if I didn't.

But I've read my books, because who wouldn't if they had woken up in their own blood with no memories. Was I attacked? Did I do it myself? Am I even me? At this point, does it even matter?

All things I had hoped my biographies might have answered. But no, they're a pile of garbage. Crossing over dates, erratic inconsistencies. I don't think they can be anything but fakes. The world believes them, though, and you don't know how scared I am that one day someone will need to me do something, help them or protect them. And I won't be able to, amnesiac fraud that I am.

That's why I took this job. I could fake my skills to children, teach them some basics and then take a sabbatical. And Dumbledore would be here the whole time. Safest place in Britian, they call this castle. More fool me, I suppose.

And yet for all of my lack of skills, sometimes I wonder. You saw me during the duel with Snape. I let him hit me. You frown, but when I saw him begin to cast I knew I could dodge it. Somehow, I knew. It's happened before - when I don't think, just act I can move faster, cast better.

Just like somehow I knew enough to track the beast down. The spiders, the water on the floor, the ghost. Although I can't have been that good if two second years also came to the same conclusions.

I won't lie to you two boys that I'm not scared. I am. But you need to stay here, and get help. I'm going after your sister, and I will not let more students be hurt on my watch.

It's time to have faith in myself.
