Yes but it's because despite the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of fics, I periodically run out of stuff to read. I'm pretty focused on Hermione fics or timetravel, and I /need/ it to be relatively well written which cuts 90% of fics, plus I generally ignore Dramione.. Sometimes I feel like traveling through filter after filter or on searching through threads here, but other times I rediscover something. Like now, I'm rereading Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire. It's been years so I've forgotten most details.
