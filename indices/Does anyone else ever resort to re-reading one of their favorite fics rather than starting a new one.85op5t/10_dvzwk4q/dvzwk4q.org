I have a few standbys that are palate cleansers. I re-read them after reading a particular long story, or when I need a pick me up.\\
I've got a massive spreadsheet of every story I've read, usually finding them isn't too hard. Oddly enough, the ones I re-read are often not the most eloquently written, but they have a particular something about them that has me returning again and again.
