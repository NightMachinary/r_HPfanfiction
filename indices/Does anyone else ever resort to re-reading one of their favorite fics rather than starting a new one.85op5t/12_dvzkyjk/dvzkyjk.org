I love to re-read things, i've re-read most of my books at least twice (and some I'll read the entire series before i read the latest edition - problematic when it's the 'in death' series and 40 books long) they're like a comfort and i don't have to concentrate as hard as if i'm reading something new as i already vaguely know the story. though i've read so many different things now that i usually need to get a chapter or 2 into something before i remember that i've actually read it before!
