I basically search for new fics to read so I have more good stories to reread on a rainy day. That's what it feels like anyway. I love finishing a story and favouriting it so I know it's there when I inevitably need to find it again. There's a limited number of times you can reread the same story over a period of time after all. I often stop before getting to the end because there's no pressure to actually finish what I'm reading.

Before getting into fan fiction, I don't know how many times I read the Harry Potter books themselves.

Oh and there are certain stories that I actually enjoy more on the reread than the first time for whatever reason. Maybe once I know where it's going I can enjoy the journey more, maybe things that are revealed later make the earlier sections more impactful or maybe just my expectations were harming my experience on the first read.
