I have never been able to re-read a fic, from start to finish. The most I got was "The Legacy" and I got bored after around 60% through. Which is funny for 2 reasons. I must've re-read HP, Percy Jackson (and the following series, HoO) The Inheritance Cycle and Red Rising about 10~20 times each, and also because The Legacy is hands down, in my top 3 favourite fics all-time. IDK why I can't enjoy re-reading fanfiction, but I'm happy that at least there's always a new fic to read, even if it takes a little bit of time to find what I enjoy.
