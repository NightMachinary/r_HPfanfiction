Only ALL the time, lol. I constantly find myself rereading fic I've read multiple times rather than starting one of the 30+ tabs of new fic I've got open. In all my fandoms of fic.

It really is nice to come back to something you know you enjoy and there's some comfort/safety in knowing how it all works out in the end no matter what's going on. Sometimes I just don't want to not know how things will end.
