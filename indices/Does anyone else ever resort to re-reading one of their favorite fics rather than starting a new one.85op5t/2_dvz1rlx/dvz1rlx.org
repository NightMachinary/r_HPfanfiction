Oh yeah. Sometimes you need something interesting, but without tension - no wondering if someone's gonna die, if a couple will get together, you already know because you've read it before.

I can't start new long fics (or books) in the evening, because that's how I end up staying up until 2 or 3 because I have to know what happens. Only re-reads before bed, because I can put those down.
