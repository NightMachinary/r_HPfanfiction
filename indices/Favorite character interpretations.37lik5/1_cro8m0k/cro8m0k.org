Snape and Lockhart in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][Applied Cultural Anthropology]]. (Other characters ain't bad either, but I am assuming that Harry, Hermione, and Neville are PCs. Junior Slytherins are well done.) Portrayal of Snape is coherent and dignified, while still being a jerk and being consistent with canon, while Lockhart is altered to be a competent con artist of the level who could have fooled Dumbledore.

Actually, the same author has a Lockhart-centric fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9269590/1/Note-to-Self][Note to Self]], which is a more canon-consistent characterization of Lockhart.
