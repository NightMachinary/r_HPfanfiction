  Tom Riddle from HPMoR

  Smart , calculative , a little bit manipulative and playing on multiple levels.

I feel like Tom's initial personality design was giving the author problems with finishing the story in such a way that would let Harry win. So latest chapters had Quirellmort almost continuously tranquilized with both [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall][Villain-]] /and/ [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][Idiot Balls]].

Starting from Hermione's assassination attempt, Tom's decisions weren't making much sense from in-universe perspective. From a meta-perspective I'd say that the author was simply trying to hype the story up.

The initial characteristics were good though.
