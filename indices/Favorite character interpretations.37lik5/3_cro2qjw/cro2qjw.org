One of my favourites characterizations is Tom Riddle from HPMoR without the being evil part.

Smart , calculative , a little bit manipulative and playing on multiple levels. HPMoR might take it to strange extremes , but i like genre-savy characters that understand the rules and do their best to exploit them. I mean it's what our brain evolved for , exploit the envoirment for our benefit.

The 3 easy steps to make a nuke with HP magic come to mind :)
