Here are some good, well thought-out and complicated characters that come to my mind. Note though that some of the stories are rather long, so I am not sure how useful they'll be to you;

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] --- *N. Flamel* (you can jump to the relevant chapters through Ctrl+F);

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] --- *Tom Riddle*, *Barty Crouch Jr* (though non-canon), *Lily*, *James*, *Peter*;

  /(spoilers)/

  - there are two good and memorable scene in chapter 27. One where James enters the house to hear Harry hiss something in parseltongue. The other when Lily discovers that Peter is a spy.

- brucktoo's mentioned [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][Sacrifices Arc]] has /many/ good characterizations (e.g. also non-canon *Peter Pettigrew* and *Rufus Scrimgeour*, many of Harry's year-mate Slytherins, etc), but the series is rather long, so I don't know how suitable it will be for you;

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird Trilogy]] --- *Dumbledore*;

- [[http://ink-splotch.tumblr.com/post/112332424299/have-you-ever-thought-about-writing-a-fic-in-which][this short prompt]] --- insights on *Neville*.
