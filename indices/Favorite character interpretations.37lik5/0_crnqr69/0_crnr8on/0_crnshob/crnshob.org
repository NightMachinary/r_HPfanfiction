Sure, I can't get all the bits but like for Evan Rosier his introduction in 'Come out of Darkness Morn', his albatross letter in 'Freedom and Not Peace', and the goblin fight in the same should give you a solid basis. As mentioned the pdf versions should make searching much easier. For Rufus Scrimgeour the link should take you to his introduction which does a nice job, as does the elder (name Romulus in that fic) Rosier link (not sure it covers all his character angles but should give you an idea).

Of course the two Rosiers in canon are dead or at least believed to be but could always pull a Barty Crouch since you always need bad guys (or questionable), I would think, in an RPG.
