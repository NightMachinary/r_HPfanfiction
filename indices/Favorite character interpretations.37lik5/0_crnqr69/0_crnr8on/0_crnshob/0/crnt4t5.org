True, and I'm not above having a younger cousin of Evan Rosier be a 4th year or something and patterning 'Mark' Rosier after his family mold. The Harry Potter series was weirdly devoid of any interactions between the various students outside of their own year... my players presumably wont suffer from this given their love of the twins, Tonks, and etc.
