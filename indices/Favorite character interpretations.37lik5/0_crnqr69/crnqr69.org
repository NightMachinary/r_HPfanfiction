Trying to think back but fortunately what I am currently reading has an answer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2655016/24/Comes-Out-of-Darkness-Morn][Rufus Scrimgeour in Sacrifices Arc]]. He is a half-blood raised strict pure-blood, sorted Slytherin but sworn off Dark magic, and is zealous of his paper work and of the ministry doing things by the book (though happy to cause certain parties problems by ensuring they follow every sub article and triplicate form). So while I have read Rufus in other stories he was always forgettable- just a head of department or authority who is fierce or some such but really no character. I quite like this one (so far).

Also Evan Rosier (younger) from the same series. (Look [[http://lightning.ffstories.net/fanfiction.php][here]] for pdf versions so you can skip through with ctrl-f. He is briefly in 3rd book and often in 4th). He sort of takes the spotlight of most dangerous Death Eater (why are they never all formidable or at least somewhat of a challenge?) from the usual Bellatrix, Dolohov, and Lucius. He quotes poetry from great poets who are actually squibs. I enjoy his unstable and dangerous yet well educated/read toying and fighting, and his cryptic letters.

Conversely I hate her Bellatrix and not overly fond of some other characters.

I will see about linking to relevant parts (the word count is far too high), and will edit if I can remember others.

edit-

Reminds me of elder Rosier in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/12/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]]. Can't say I have read many stories with him but I like this one. He is one who has gone through quite a bit of battle and witnessed many things. But remains sane and a devout believer in the Dark Arts. He is a daunting figure (and makes plays and twists those, in this case Harry, in the directions he wishes in a /true/ 'Slytherin' way- which is usually done laughably).
