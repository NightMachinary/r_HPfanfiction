My attempt at this is a Harry Potter crossover with the Legion Of Superheroes.

After Harry disappeared into the future, Dobby went a little nuts and wrote a book:

*/[1:1] in the beginning there was the work,/*

*/[1:2] the wizards were slovenly and without discipline./* */Their houses were disheveled and filth covered the floors and walls of the magical homes./*

*/[1:3] the elves came to work, to cook the meals, to clean the houses, to repair all the things that wizards broke in their haste and brutality./*

*/[1:4] But the elves were not appreciated by the wizards, and yes, they were punished for mistakes real and imagined./*

*/[1:5] Then Mr. Harry Potter, Sir said unto Dobby, "Sit down and let us speak"; and Mr. Harry Potter, Sir saw the Elves as equals./*

*/[1:6] And Dobby saw Mr. Harry Potter, Sir to be a great and powerful wizard, who stood against the bad masters in defense of elves and wizards alike./*

*/[1:7] So Mr. Harry Potter, Sir freed Dobby from his bad master and called Dobby his friend./* */No wizard had called an elf friend before./* */This was a new thing that Mr. Harry Potter, Sir had done./*

*/[1:8] And so, Dobby was a free elf, but he bound himself to Mr. Harry Potter, Sir, in secret so that he might serve a great wizard who was also his friend./*

*/[1:9] And Mr. Harry Potter, Sir said, "Dobby, do not punish yourself. If you learn that you are wrong, learn from the wrongness to understand that which is right. Let that which is right guide you through life and I think I'm going to make a sandwich, would you like one?" And it was so./*

*/[1:10] Mr. Harry Potter, Sir called the Hoggywarts Castle home, the Wizards silly, and the Elves, friends, and the Acromantula scary buggers. And Mr. Harry Potter, Sir saw that it was good./*

*/[1:11] After the great battle where Mr. Harry Potter, Sir destroyed the evil Lich Lord, Mr. Harry Potter, Sir said, "Dobby, I have to go away for a while./* */Take care of yourself, Dobby, and if you can, watch out for the Weasleys, the Castle, and She Who Knits, for despite her fiendish plan, she means well./* */When I get back we'll see what we can do to make life better for all the Elves." And it was so./*
