I don't really have a story, but I'm going to act a little bit like Hermione on this one: it's unknown how dragons or nundus react to basilisk, but the basilisk definitely is afraid of the rooster's crow in the series, and in European folklore weasels are immune to its gaze and venom, even going as far as killing the baby basilisks.
