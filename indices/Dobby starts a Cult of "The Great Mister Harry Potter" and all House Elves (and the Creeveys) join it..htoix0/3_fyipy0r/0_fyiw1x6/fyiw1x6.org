I read a one-shot that had Harry entering the Room of Requirement and finding dozens of witches worshipping a pair of his boxers. When they notice him and start to chase him, he runs out of the Room in panic. The story ends with Sirius saying, "Now, /that's/ how to prank somebody with this room" or words to that effect.
