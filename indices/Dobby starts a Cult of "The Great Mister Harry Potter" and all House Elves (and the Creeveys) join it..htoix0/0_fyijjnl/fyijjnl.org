If this is all humor I'd love to see Severus Snape initiated. Like he sarcastically tells one of the Creevey's that “oh yes, the sun shines from Mr. Potter's bum, doesn't it?” And they actually take him seriously. They don't accept any of his refusals to join the cult and enlist a few house elves to ensure Snape is on time to meetings. The biggest compliment they get is “I'd rather be suffering a Crucio from the Dark Lord right now” which they accept happily because if /they're/ worse than Voldemort than surely Harry Potter is going to defeat him with absolutely no trouble!
