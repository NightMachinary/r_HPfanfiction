I rec my own fic shamelessly. Harry Potter and the Bonds of Time Saga. One complete fic, 91 chapters, and a sequel with 60+ so far. And a third story will come.

It is a Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione fic, and Harry and Ginny have a Soul-Bond, and Time Travel to the past. Mostly Harry/Ginny centric.

Also link to my profile. All of my stories are H/G and R/Hr. Except for the Next-Gen fics Ickle Firsties, (but I didn't get very far in it.) and very old fan-fic of mine, Family Affair is Next-Gen, but not canon, since it was written before DH.
