The rest were recommending the famous long fics, so I figure I'd stick to the relatively shorter ones for now.

- Love Without Questions by teatales - linkao3(22734682)

  - It's a pretty amazing fic. It explores Hermione coming to terms with being aromantic while also delving deep into her insecurities and feelings of loneliness.

- Grateful. - linkao3(3294857)

  - This one is really /really/ short, but it's also very good. It explores the expectations on Hermione's shoulders.

- Set in Stone by bluehasnoclues - linkao3(17396063)

  - This one focuses on Hermione recovering from being Petrified in second year. It's a very good canon divergence, and it really digs deep into the consequences for Hermione.

- Madam Longbottom's Appointment Book by seekeronthepath - link(17868182)

  - Here Hermione is Augusta Longbottom's secretary. It's incomplete, but it updates pretty regularly.

- In Bocca Al Lupo: When Innocence Changed Into Experience by morpholomeg - linkao3(24594295)

  - This is much longer than the previous ones, but it's an amazing take on Werewolf!Hermione. Lupin is prominent here too, but the main focus is Hermione. It's got amazing takes on disability, politics and world-building.

I think this is what I've got or now. I hope you enjoy your reading!
