  Hermione Jean Granger knew a lot of things. She knew about dental hygiene, and about books, and the best spots to hide in the library when teased. She knew that in all the stories she read and watched on the television and all the people she knew grew up and found someone to spend the rest of their life with.But her prince never came, and Hermione was alone while everyone around her seemed to be moving ahead or moving away. She didn't understand.

  It's not Hermione isn't grateful to be so smart, she is, she really is.She just really wishes sometimes that people would realize how much they put on her shoulders.ORYou can call Harry Potter the Chosen One all you like, but the truth is he wasn't the only one bearing too much Responsibility.

  Hermione was the first and only one Petrified. Unfortunately, no one thought about what that entailed. (Petrification feels like death because it is.)

  When Remus came back to himself, he was in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, naked, shivering with pain and with cold, and he could taste blood.“I don't have the full story,” said Madam Pomfrey. “You'll have to speak to Minerva or Albus for that. But Black has escaped, and - Remus, I am so sorry. You bit Hermione Granger.”or: a story of innocence, experience, and prejudice, spanning the summer holidays after Prisoner of Azkaban.
