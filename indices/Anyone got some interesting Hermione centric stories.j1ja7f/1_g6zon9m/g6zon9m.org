I mean, the Arithmancer is kind of the obvious rec, so I'll start with that. Hermione likes to do maths (and the fic even properly calls it 'maths' instead of 'math'!) and a lot of problems happen where arithmancy is the solution. Also, Hogwarts is a bit weirder than usual.

A personal favourite is the Confectionary Chronicles. It's a supernatural crossover, but you don't have to know anything or enjoy Supernatural in any way to like the fic. I literally haven't seen a single episode and know literally nothing more than 'there's a gay angel and they go to hell a couple times' and I've enjoyed the fic considerably.

Trigger warning, the story starts out with a suicide warning for a reason. It's not Hermione, and it's not graphic at all, but it is... vivid. If you don't want to read that, skip forward in the first chapter to a paragraph starting with 'After the funeral, Helen and Richard decide to move away from the area.' You can control+F to search the page, if you're on PC. Phone page searches vary, so I can't help there.
