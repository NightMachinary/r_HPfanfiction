Just finished this and thanks for the rec btw! Becoming Neville, although AU, really feels like Harry Potter and I loved it! I'll look through my bookmarks list and see what I can find that's similar. I feel like some of my favorite wolfstar fics are like that - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]] comes to mind right away. It's really long and definitely worth the read if you haven't read it before. Linkffn(3378356)
