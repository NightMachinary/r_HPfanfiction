I really suck at describing, but I'll try my best.

So there's Neville, but he has some issues within himself--insecurities and fears. During the story he gradually overcomes them, like talking to Snape and talking back to authorities. Like at first he sees himself as "the other kid in the dorm" or as someone unforgettable. But as times goes on he gains confidence albeit he falters sometimes.

Maybe it's because I'm not finished with it yet, but the romance is, to me, put on the backburner compared to the mystery and Neville's character development. I guess I just want to see character development--going through trials, facing fears, and overcoming them and such.
