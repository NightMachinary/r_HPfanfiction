It is a fun read, but I dropped it after the egg hatched. The whole process is pretty new and interesting, but the summer it took place in lasted 36 chapters, and not enough happend in the timespan for me to understand where all the words went honestly.

I like that Harry is aware of wizarding customs, but doesn't entirely conform. I like how Sirius is portrayed. I like how Narcissa is still somewhat of a snob. I like how the author did away with the Horcrux. I just really dislike the pacing.
