You made it further than me then. Assuming the author does not radically change his style in the later parts of the story, I would say that it could easily be cut down to 200.000 words instead of 500.000. Without losing anything. I mean, I have read many very long stories, some way over 1.000.000 words, and have absolutely no problem if it is done right. But the pacing in this is abysmal. I swear, more than half of the chapters I made it through could have been skipped, since they contained nothing of import happening, nor any relevant world building.
