  Ron will not be a big part of this story. He will fall out of touch with Harry and Hermione. I will not bash him overly obscene but I just don't enjoy this character.

Author states that he just isn't a big part. not sure if that changes anything for you, I have not read it though, so IDK how accurate that is.
