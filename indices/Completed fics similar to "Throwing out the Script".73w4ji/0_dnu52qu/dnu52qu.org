Not completed nor has it been updated in some time, but you might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/Whiskey-Time-Travel][Whiskey Time Travel]]. It has a powerful Unspeakable Harry thrown back in time and he does try to keep to the shadows a bit, but it's mostly trying to avoid the Potters of the current time if I remember correctly.\\
