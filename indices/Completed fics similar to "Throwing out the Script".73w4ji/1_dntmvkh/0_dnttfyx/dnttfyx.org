Funny you should mention that one. It's literally the next one I am reading after just finishing Throwing out the Script. They had been recommended by someone to me together so I figured they may have similarities. I am hoping for more suggested here though. It feels like it would be a genre of time travel that would be well explored but I have mostly seen trio era time travel, not marauder in terms of Harry being the lead (I know there are quite a few Hermione ones).
