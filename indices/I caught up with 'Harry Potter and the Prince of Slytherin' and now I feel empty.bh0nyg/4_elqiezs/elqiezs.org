Prince of Slytherin is a solid fic, but it's really just... a lot. I stopped following it because every time it updated after months I'd be like, "Wait, who the fuck are all these people again?" I always got plot points confused with other fics. Maybe if it ever ends up finishing, or even just being abandoned, I'll sit down and read through the whole thing.
