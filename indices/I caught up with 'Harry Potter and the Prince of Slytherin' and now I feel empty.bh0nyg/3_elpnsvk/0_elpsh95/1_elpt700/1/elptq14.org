I mean like I said it's thrice weekly updates so it's not like we're waiting long for more content, and there's already a heck of a backlog but I get the logic there

It's just that some rather awesome stuff is happening right now in story and it's always fun to have more people to geek out about it with. Especially if they are coming from the fresh perspective of a new reader. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about it, but I understand wanting to wait.
