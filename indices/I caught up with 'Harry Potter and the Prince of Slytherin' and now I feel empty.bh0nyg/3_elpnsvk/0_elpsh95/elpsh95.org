Admittedly this isn't Harry Potter fanfiction, but given you mentioned reading Worm it seemed too fitting not to mention given this is the series going toe to toe with it in terms of popular web serials.

Might I recommend [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com][A Practical Guide to Evil]]? I could wax poetic about it for pages (honestly to the point I fear it may become tedious), but I don't wish to do so on an unrelated subreddit unless actually asked to.

If comparing directly to Worm, without getting too spoilery I would say Taylor and Catherine (the "main" character of PGtE) certainly have similarities though each are shaped by the world that they are in. While the world of PGtE is crapsack for the average person, it is not as dark as Worm. There are definitely consequences for actions, but it's not so dark that you can't enjoy the humor that's actually in the work because you know something terrible is going to happen in a few paragraphs.

In terms of length, it's over 1.5 million words right now (more than Harry Potter, closing in on A Song of Fire and Ice) and has an extremely consistent thrice weekly release schedule with an extra chapter at the beginning of every month
