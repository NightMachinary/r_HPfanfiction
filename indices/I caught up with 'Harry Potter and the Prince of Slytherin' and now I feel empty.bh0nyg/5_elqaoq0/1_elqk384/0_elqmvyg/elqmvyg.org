I can't tell you without major spoilers. I know that's unhelpful. Uh, let me think how to clear it up while occluding the plot.

The thing is, the characterization of the characters works really well together, and most of the time I enjoy the pairing- right up until I start to overthink it. Then it gets weird (on both sides). But that is also handled as one of the relationship issues within the fic, which does diminish my own conflicted opinions about it, too. It helps that it isn't just ignored for the plot, but part of the plot. I can tell you that it isn't an inappropriate power-relationship that makes the other feel coaxed tk obey nor is it incest, though. And it is wholly consensual from the start.

Gosh, that probably made it more confusing, didn't it? ðŸ¤”

Wait, I know! Mild spoiler warning:

There would be an issue of an age gap but time travel took care of that, but with a bit of a twist.

Edit: I suddenly realized that I should probably also mention that it has slash pairings, het pairings, etc, as well as mention of polyamorious(?) relationships (what's the adjective of polyamory?) and other genders.
