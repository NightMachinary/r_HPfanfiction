It's a ten part series that total over a 1.1 million words as of now. I initially avoided it since the summary didn't particularly capture my interest, but after (the then) 9 parts that I had high on my hit lists when all filters and word count requests were met, I ended up giving in. And I'm so glad that I did. It's currently my favourite HP fic. +(despite that I sometimes still feeling a bit weird about one of the ships, but /at least/ one of the characters shares my sentiment from time to time)+

It's incredibly rich in historic world building (and a bit of international magic world building through that, as well) and I just love how thoughtfully that has been woven in. I'm just going to forcibly stop myself here before I start rambling on about all the things I liked and end up spoiling too much.

Funnily enough, it's what I picked after I binge read through Prince of Slytherin as well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
