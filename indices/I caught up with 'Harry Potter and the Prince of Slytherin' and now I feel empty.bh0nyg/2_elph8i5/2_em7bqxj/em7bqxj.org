It's not really clear cut in the fic either. James makes some poor decisions and does some assholeish things, but he has reasons that while not justifying his actions, at least somewhat explain them. So he's not just an asshole because he's a bigoted asshole, so it's not quite the same as typical bashing. This isn't revealed till later in the fic though, so in the beginning it looks like straight up normal bashing.
