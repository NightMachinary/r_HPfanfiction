Also, it doesn't help that you get pretty far into the fic (and the bad James Potter behavior) before the reason is revealed.

And I think it may be needful to clarity the usage of the word reason here. For me personally at least, it's a reason in so much as "There is logic to why he's doing what he's doing. He's not a complete irrational bastard." However, I still very much think his actions are morally wrong even in the added context. His actions are at least arguably logical but I would not call them reasonable.
