I agree.

Find a legal way to disown him.

If you can't disown him, befriend him.

If you can't befriend him, kill him.

Being antagonizing doesn't help with any of those goals.

But his character isn't supposed to be very Slytherin. He sees Harry, rightfully, as a threat. A threat he can't just put in jail, like he's been able to do for most of his adult life, I'd reckon. His actions, while not particularly reasonable, /do have/ reason and fit his character (brash Gryffindor).

That's not an argument against what you're saying; I'm just clarifying why I wouldn't consider it /bashing/ in the normal sense. An attribute has been added to the story and I think the way the author is writing how James reacts to that in a rather in-character way.
