It has a very anti-Slytherin James Potter and he takes it out on his Slytherin-sorted son, Harry.

It's reminiscent of James-bashing stories where he hates his son simply because of his bigotry but, in the case of this story, there's a /good reason/ for it, even if you're not aware of it immediately. So the "bashing" that /does/ happen happens for a reason, but it feels like bashing because you're so used to reading bashing stories.
