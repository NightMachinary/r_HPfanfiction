I honestly think POS is really quite good even if it has an unfortunate acronym. Most fanfics are just threads, but POS is a tapestry. The author has made significant changes to the backstory of the world, but he's also made sure that those changes make sense in context and can be seen throughout the story; for example, he uses the Lord of the Wizengamot trope, but leaving the Potters alive prevents SuperHarry, and he uses Lord Rings, but those fit in with the theme of his magical Britain being tied together with ages of mutual pacts and agreements. (I think his explanation of fanon Blaise Zabini is superfluous, but maybe he's been in fanfic long enough for it to be relevant.)

That said, sometimes the story feels a bit too densely threaded. Chopping it up into "books" might fix some of the slight pacing issues. Characters from Books 4-6 are appearing in Year 3, which allows for more denseness, but it feels like the story's at a Year 5 place in Year 3 and if it keeps going at that rate it'll probably spend year 5 entirely bogged down in politics like the Star Wars prequels. The benefit of having the whole series be out lets you tackle Horcruxes much, much earlier than Year 6, but at the same time if you're tackling Horcruxes in Year 3...

Nevertheless, I'll have faith in POS until the author proves me wrong.
