Not like a ROR, I didn't explain it well my apologies. The fic is centered around Grimmauld and essentially it has “feelings” so since Harry doesn't appreciate it the way it should be appreciated as the house of the ancient and noble Blacks the carpets move to make him trip, the temperature cools significantly, the kitchen grows smaller etc. etc. That's what I meant but couldn't really articulate until now
