Not really. Certainly, it's an interpretation that fits very well with what we see in canon, but the specifics are never discussed. A whole, structured concept-based system is still a fanon creation, much like any worldbuilding of what Beauxb√¢tons is like will still be a "fanon creation" even though /something/ like what they come up with exists in canon.
