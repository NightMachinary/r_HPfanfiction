It is, but that's sort of a key element for my judging of fanfic worldbuilding.

There are four options:

1. It doesn't delve in how things work.
2. It uses concept-based system (either canon based or different like Wit of the Raven [even if that had also strong energy aspect])
3. It scraps everything and creates new system on a different base.
4. It keeps canon spells but tries to base them in energy or math or anything else and inevitably ends up being inconsistent with itself.

I'm okay with "1" if it fits the focus of the story, "3" can be interesting, of course, I definitely favour "2", but unfortunately it's "4" that overruns fanfiction.
