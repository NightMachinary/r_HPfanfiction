Magical cores have given the idea a bad reputation, but I rather think of magic as a /force/, an energy that can do any number of things depending on the way it's "bent".

Now, a wizard's soul has an instinctual connection to it, so they can manipulate it to do things like wandless telekinesis, and if they want something hard enough the magic is going to respond more or less haphazardly; spellcrafting is figuring out exactly what shape the flows of magic must take to produce, for instance, shrinking of the target, and how to reproduce that pattern just by channeling raw magic through the wand and giving it the right shape with the wand motion.

Of course, that's the theory --- in practice, only the very simplest of spells, like /Lumos/, can rely solely on such mechanical thinking, and for any really advanced spell like the Patronus Charm, the wand movement and incantation rythm "nudge" magic the right way but you have to want it desperately enough that your instinctual magic will do the rest.

E.G., wizard magic is related to human concepts and thinking because that's how magic was "crafted", be it with the scientific precision of Alchemy or through wild, instinctual manipulation of it by living beings. That magic isn't any more "concept-based" at its core than sound can be said to be 'concept-based' just because we use it to carry meaning through oral speech.
