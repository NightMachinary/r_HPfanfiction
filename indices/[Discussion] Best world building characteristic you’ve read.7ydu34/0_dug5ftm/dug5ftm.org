The werewolf society in PotDK. Kind of separate and independent, but still firmly under Voldemort's thumb, to the point that being sent there is used as a punishment. And i's not just a throwaway curiosity, it's actually integral to the plot. Not that throwaway curiosities have no place, but for something that had so much of the wordcount dedicated to it, it's good that it was used beyond "Sirius and Remus are buff half-naked beast-men".
