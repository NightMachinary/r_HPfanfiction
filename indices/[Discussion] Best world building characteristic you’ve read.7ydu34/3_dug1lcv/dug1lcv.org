The detail on magical vows in Forging the Sword. Not because I consider it good world building in and of itself (personally I feel like the idea of "locking up a part of your magic" is a bit too close to magical core territory) but rather because of the way it was used in the fic to develop the character arcs of Harry and Ron.
