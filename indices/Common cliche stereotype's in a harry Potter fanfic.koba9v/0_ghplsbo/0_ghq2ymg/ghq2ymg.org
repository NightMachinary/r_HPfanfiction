The ones I've read usually have him inherit the lordship through Sirius but the only reason he CAN inherit it is because of Dorea Potter being a Black by birth.

Which usually becomes a vehicle for the author to make funny ha ha's about the Black family motto and talk about how backwards blood purity is and insert jokes about Harry being a Half-Blooded Lord Black. Just before he disowns bellatrix and brings andromeda back in... but oh wait... DUN DUN DUN Narcissa isn't evil and Draco is misguided and Lucius is abusive and AHHHHH

I've read this story so many times it isn't even funny anymore lmao

I got off track....
