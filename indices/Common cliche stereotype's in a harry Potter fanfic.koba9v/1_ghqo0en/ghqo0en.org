I really don't like the idea of "The most ancient and noble house of Potter" it just doesn't feel right to me.

I don't have any problem with the Potters being an old family I just think that it would be cool for the Potters to be neither Noble and activity refuse to be called ancient because they have political power in other ways like owning the ground Hogwarts is built on or something like that perhaps the Potter were thieves in ancient times and got their Prominence due to that or some other shenanigans.

If you don't want the Potters to be an old family but still have relevance, the Grindelwald War could be used as a springboard. Maybe they were instrumental in their downfall or the Potters had an exceptional generation of Wizards at that time.

There are so many options but no "The Most Fabulously Ancient and Super Noble House of Potter" gets used in 70% of scenarios where Harry needs Political influence.

+I don't like goblins in general so I always have to suffer through Gringotts scenes I have dropped more than 5 fics because of Gringotts and ill bet there are going to be more.
