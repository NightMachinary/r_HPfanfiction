I think the main issue is that seeker is a boring position in canon and therefore the matches which focus on Harry are not that interesting. If you focused more on the overall happenings and add more commentary on the other positions, it would be more interesting. Have the seekers interact more with the chasers, either as a fourth one for the own team or as a disruptive element for the opposing one.

And keep things simple. No one knows what a Fabianski Dive is supposed to be, but a cross, through-ball or pass are simple enough.
