1) A lot of people probably don't like Quidditch and think the rules make no sense, so they have Harry not like Quidditch either.

2)A lot of people probably think that it's boring to read about Quidditch matches, so they don't write Quidditch scenes at all.

3)A lot of people probably just hate sports in general and want to write Harry as more of a nerdy character than the athletic person he really is.
