  Would these plot points solely be there to relieve the author of writing Quidditch scenes? Or did this fenomenon come about another way?

I don't think so. Most fics where Harry plays Quidditch don't have any Quidditch related scenes in them in the first place. Rather I think that him giving up the game frees up his schedule. With indy!Harry he has to exercise rigorously every day after all, as well as studying far harder than canon, practising all his spells, going to Wizengamot things and tending to all his House affairs. There's no room for Quidditch in that schedule.
