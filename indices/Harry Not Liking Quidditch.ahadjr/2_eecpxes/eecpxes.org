Typo, but yeah, it could easily come to pass through another way. You can write the no-first years rule for a reason - Quidditch isn't a game for weaklings, and first years are tiny when compared to the older years and are far more likely to get seriously hurt.

Have Harry suffer some bludgers in either training or a real game, where the opposing team beaters aren't going to make it easy for him, and you'd have Harry with a genuine reason to stop playing.
