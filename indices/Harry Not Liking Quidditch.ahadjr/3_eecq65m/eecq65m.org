I think its often used in stories that also have Harry "turn his life around" - which apparently means for a lot of authors that every minute spent on something fun is wasted. In a lot of these fics where he gives up Quidditch, he is also never shown to go for a recreational flight.

The reasons for it are probably as diverse as the set of authors that write them. One reason could be, of course, that the author just doesn't want sports scenes in his fic. Another rather juvenile trope I often saw is this notion that if Harry becomes a scholar / trains himself to defeat Voldemort, he obviously can't enjoy sports. There is also the situation where Harry truly sacrifices his enjoyment to get more time to train himself with a goal in mind, but rarely do I see the actual consequences of this sacrifice in a fic.
