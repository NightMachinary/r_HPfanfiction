I always think it would be interesting as to how Dumbledore would react - Sirius knowingly putting a student in very real danger for no other reason than Sirius didn't like him?

Would he cover it up? What would the reactions of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs be if Snape suddenly ends up dead but there's no punishment for those involved?
