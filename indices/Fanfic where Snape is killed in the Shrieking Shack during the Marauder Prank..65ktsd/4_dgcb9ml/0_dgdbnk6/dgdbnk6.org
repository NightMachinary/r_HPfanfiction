I think it's a sign that Dumbledore sometimes believes his own hype. So long as Lupin wasn't seen by anyone else and the Marauders stuck to the forest I think Dumbledore assumed that the security he put in place was adhered to. Or maybe he thought it was good for Lupin for his friends to provide that support and was overlooking the security concerns because students shouldn't be on the grounds - because teenagers are going to do what they're told
