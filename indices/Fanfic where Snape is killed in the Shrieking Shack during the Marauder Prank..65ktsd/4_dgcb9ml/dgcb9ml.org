Frankly I think, if James didn't save Snape, Dumbledore would have. That a werewolf on loose once in a month and Dumbledore not checking security would be quite unbelievable. His school literary having one dangerous aspect in a certain criteria and nobody monitoring it doesn't make any senses to me. And why I consider - nobody knowing marauders becoming animagi and accompanying Remus on a fullmoon - as a plothole.
