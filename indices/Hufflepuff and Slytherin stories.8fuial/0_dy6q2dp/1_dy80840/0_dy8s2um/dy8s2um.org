Now that's a fun ship. Helga drags Salazar back to Hogwarts by the ear "now apologize!" She taps her foot looking at Godric and Salazar " shake hands, you're best friends for Merlins sake! "

Godric, and Salazar both look down and mumble "sorry"

"What was that I couldn't hear you?" Helga says sharply " SORRY! " they practically shout at each other

Rowena starts giggling behind them, Helga runs to her "shut it you!, You're next."
