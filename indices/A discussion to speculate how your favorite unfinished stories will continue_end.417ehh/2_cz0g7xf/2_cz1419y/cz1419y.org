For A Long Journey Home, [[/spoiler][I'd like to see if Jasmine was somehow involved in the founding of Hogwarts. The place where she lives in the time of Merlin, a good half century before Hogwarts is founded, is suspiciously similar to the Hogwarts grounds. It's in Scotland, there's a big lake, there's a forest where centaurs live, her house is built on a cliffside if I remember correctly. All those things kinda point towards it being the future site of Hogwarts, and I want to see if she has something to do with that.]]
