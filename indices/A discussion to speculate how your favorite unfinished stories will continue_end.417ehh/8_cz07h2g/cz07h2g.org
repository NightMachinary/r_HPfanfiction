The Black Prince linkffn(11098283) :

[[/spoiler][I cannot wait to read how Margeary Tyrell was characterized in the story. If possible I would love to read about what Margeary thinks about Aeryn at this point in the story. She knows about Harry's "Black Prince" moniker which means she's familiar with his story. It'll be extremely interesting how she addresses her presence and existence as Harry's betrothed.]]

[[/spoiler][My guess is that for now we won't learn much about Aeryn since the author pourposefully had her left behind at Castlery Rock so her presence wouldn't impede or complicate the development of the Harry/Margeary romance.]]

[[/spoiler][I guess that within the next couple of chapters Harry will attempt to begin a prepping for a journey to Dragonstone to search for the Dragon Eggs.]]
