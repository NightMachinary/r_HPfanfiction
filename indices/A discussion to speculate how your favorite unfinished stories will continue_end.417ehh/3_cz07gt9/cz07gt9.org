The Havoc Side of the Force linkffn(8501689) :

[[/spoiler][With the Corellia arc now complete I cannot wait to see how the Black Sun plot arc turns out to be. I assume that there will be a significant more amount of fight scenes similar to the casino part of the Corellia arc since the Black Sun is a criminal enterprise. My guess is that HK will get a body during this arc.]]
