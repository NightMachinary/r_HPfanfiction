At what point did you think that Hermione was a Mary Sue? At the [[/spoiler][Umbrige orphanage?]]

If so, I do say it gets better later on. Though Hermione is significantly powered up in the orphanage, once she gets to Hogwarts her "smarts" are more leveled out and they don't distract too much from the story.
