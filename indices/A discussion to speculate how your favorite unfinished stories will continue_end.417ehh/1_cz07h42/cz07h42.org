Reign of the Serpent linkffn(9783012) :

[[/spoiler][This story blew me out of the water when I read it during Thanksgiving. Sadly there hasn't been an update in almost three months but I have to say, the AU world building is phenomenally worked out and the characterization for each of the main characters is extremely well worked out. I cannot wait to read about the implications of change in Harry's mindset after overhearing Lily Potter's and Hermione's conversation. I assume that Harry will continue to act ignorant of what happened at that discussion and will use it to create a new goal that will form the bones of the ambition to overthrow Salazar.]]
