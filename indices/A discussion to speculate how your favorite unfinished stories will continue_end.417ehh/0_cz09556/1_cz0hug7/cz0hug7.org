I personally have not gotten around to reading the five chapters available in the DLP forums and so I'm basing my comments off of what is available on ffn.net.

I think that Harry will not end up going "dark" but that the divergence will occur when Harry turns out to be much harsher and "darker" when it comes to the actual final battle. He'll end up creating a divide on how exactly to bring down the Death Eaters and his brother will end up falling in the middle of it. By this time his brother has grown up and though he respects Dumbledore and his methods, he probably thinks for himself and he feels divided on how to fight this war.

My thoughts come from the idea that HP and the BWL is a story that focuses more on morality character interaction than "fighting the bad guys." The bad guys will be fought and defeated but the true meat of the story is how the characters change and adapt to the existence of to a twin who goes to Durmstrang.
