I'm interested in where linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi) is going. Until now its basically a rehash, except we only see it fleetingly from an outside perspective while exploring magic, the dark arts, and getting to know some OC/OC standins.

This is all great fun, my question is where the story will diverge, or if it ever will. I had a thought that Harry might not be a participant until the Battle of Hogwarts. After all Durmstrang lets out earlier than Hogwarts, Harry graduates comes home, fights the final battle, and its over, cue epilogue.
