Most of my favorite WIPs are sadly abandoned. I still hope Perspicacity reverses his opinion on posting Misericorde and Lily, the Dagger and Rose sequel/conclusion, but I'm not holding my breath.

That said, HP and the Distaff Side and A Cadmean Victory are the two WIPs I'm keeping an eye on. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side; A Cadmean Victory)

Distaff Side

[[/spoiler][There's so much left to do in this story that I can't really image where it will go in detail. The broad strokes are obviously that Harry, Luna, his dimensional twin, etc. will take on and kill Voldemort, and I'd imagine it will happen soon with how well their training with the Riddle clones have gone. Still, I'm very curious how it will happen and how the relationships will continue to unfold. I expect none of the "good guys" will die. I imagine Harry will go back to his original dimension...and hoping he takes his new friends with him. I also hope for a reconciliation of some sort between Harry, Black, and Lupin. Black as a poodle makes me snort in laughter every time.]]

Cadmean Victory

[[/spoiler][I love this story, huge H/F fan so that probably goes without saying. Author updates frequently, so frequently that I hope it'll be finished soon. I read the first 60 or so chapters (all he had done at the time) and loved it, but very very surprised with how ok Fleur is with Harry killing people; must be an obsessive kind of love, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but not nearly your normal kind of relationship. It will be interesting to see whether the relationship survives and what kind of conflict, if any, will stem from it. I personally think it's going to come to a head, and the two will end up physically/magically fighting, leading to a separation. I imagine they'd eventually reconcile, too, but...yeah. That said, there's about 30 new chapters to read, but I'd have to start over to get everything in mind. I'd burn through it in a few days and then be left wanting again that it's not complete, so I'm trying to hold off until the next major division or the story is completely told. (It's "three books in one" iirc.) So I'm not sure how much more has developed in the plot and relationship since I've last read.]]
