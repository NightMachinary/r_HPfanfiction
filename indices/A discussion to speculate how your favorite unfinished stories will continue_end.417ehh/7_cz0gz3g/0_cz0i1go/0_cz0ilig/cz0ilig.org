[[/spoiler][Yeah, there are definitely some tropes and cliches at use here...training in the Chamber of Secrets to turn him into a super!Harry, besting wizards with years more experience (and ostensibly more skilled, too). It's well written enough that the cliches and tropes don't bother me that much. It's hard to find something original in fanfic, so I just look for stories that use the old tropes well.]]

[[/spoiler][It helps that I'm a H/F shipper, so anything well written with the pairing I will read. Good, lengthy fics are hard to find.]]

[[/spoiler][I just can't read chapter by chapter of any story really, not anymore. I just lose bits of the story. It's why I really only read completed fics now (unless I'm tempted by something in the summary, like with this one).]]

[[/spoiler][In contrast, Reign of Power was quite the original piece way back when it was written, but there is some silly stuff and stuff that has become a sign of terrible fanfic (heirs of everyone, vampire friends, etc.) but I feel it uses them well; actually having those things affects the story instead of just making him rich and an instant "god" when he hits his "magical maturity". I can overlook the somewhat poor grammar and spelling at times. I would be with this story, too, if it were an issue.]]
