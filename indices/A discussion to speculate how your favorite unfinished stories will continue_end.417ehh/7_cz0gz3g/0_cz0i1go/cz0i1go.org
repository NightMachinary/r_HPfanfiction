[[/spoiler][I loved the story when I first found it a couple months back. I read through all the available sixty or so chapters. Once I started reading it on an update chapter basis it kind of fell apart for me. I loved the lack of significant grammatical errors and the update time, but looking back and seeing the nonsensical cliches and tropes used to create a super!Harry made me drop the story.]]

[[/spoiler][But like you said, this story is one that you need to read an arc at a time. I think reading it chapter by chapter kills the flow of the story. I'll try to pick it up again once another arc of the story is finished.]]
