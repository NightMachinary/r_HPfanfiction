[[/spoiler][With Tonks' (metamorph surgery ritual?) revealing Harry, to be Harry Potter with the famous lightning bolt scar the soon to happen confrontation with the Order of the Phoenix will be a discussion to watch. I assume a new deal will be negotiated with Harry taking over as Iris's guardian because as Potter with the same blood the blood wards will work better with him as Iris's guardian than the Dursleys. B/c of that Dumbledore will try to attain more secrets from Harry in exchange for guardianship.]]
