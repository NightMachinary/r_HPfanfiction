You've almost certainly read Seventh Horcrux, so I'll skip that:

linkffn(Oh God Not Again!): Harry isn't actually insane, but literally everyone except Sirius and Luna seem to believe he is out of his mind.

linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): the best insane Harry story I have ever found, plus great action scenes.

Linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): not funny at all, but another great Harry is going insane story.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal): not exactly a sociopath, but definitely a sarcastic arsehole. That line after the Harry vs. Dumbledore fight was great:
