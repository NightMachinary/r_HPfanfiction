Well, if you cannot find one, turn it into a prompt an author could get interested in. Something like this:

'Voldemort is resurrected in May 1984. The Ministry falls in February 1985. In June of that year, Dumbledore enacts his final plan. One, he is sure, will see his next great adventure turn into a special Hell. On July 1st, 1989, Alma Potter is sealed away.'

'James and Harry die that night while Lily slips into a coma, dragging Voldemort's horcrux along for the ride. Thirteen years have passed. St Mungo's lies abandoned, sealed off from the outside world after all its occupants withered away and died in the winter of '82.The talk of Black magic being behind it was everywhere. Stories of curses, attacks and inferi stalking the halls in those last days. Of how Molly and Ginevra Weasley came in and were never seen again. Of how Alice and Frank Longbottom died screaming at the top of their lungs as medical staff were dragged into the walls by... things. Now Pettigrew, at the behest of the Dark Lord, has been tasked with infiltrating the building and looking for clues as to what happened there. Wormtail was not sure about this assignment, but it was either this or infiltrating Azkaban. And surely, this could not be as bad as Azkaban, right? Right?'

Of course, the easiest way to get what you want is to write it yourself, but that's a completely different kettle of fish.
