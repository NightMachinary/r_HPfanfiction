Yeah, actually I found a few of my shows through crossovers too now that I think about it. Well, I might try my hand at it, even if only for a oneshot. The hard part is that as far as I'm concerned, FEAR is pretty reality oriented if you disregard that psycho aspect of it which is mostly just hallucinations anyway. And then there is the HPverse which is ,most of the time, really far removed from reality. It is hard to balance horror and magic, so it will be either your typical, "lets take this single character and drop it into the other universe" kind of story, or something totally unreadable :D Oh and I don't mind rambling, there isn't enough people around me who I can talk fanfics about with :)
