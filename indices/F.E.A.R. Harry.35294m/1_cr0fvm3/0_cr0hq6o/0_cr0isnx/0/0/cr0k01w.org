So you disregard the prompts and make it an urban fantasy spinoff. One of the most underexplored aspects of HP fanon is the fact that there isn't just the magical world in it. England's there, in the background, generally not acknowledged at all. And mid-nineties urban England marks the tail-end of an era where designs such as brutalism dominated. HP takes place in that weird transitional period between where everything was either old or buried in concrete and the period where warm, welcoming and Jamie Oliver-type lifestyles rushed to fill the yawning chasm left by the eighties.

In other words, it's the perfect place to actually have a horror fic set around. The damp asphalt streets marred by potholes, the tenements where off-colour stains marking where violence and brutality took place amidst the crumbling dreams of the '70s working class, the almost casual way in which deprecation and soullesness seemed integrated into the design...

Play it off as straight horror 'oh-shit-it's-ALMA' for the unlucky muggle/squib babysitter for the plucky pureblood Auror and a gradually encroaching madness that tears at the soul of the young lad who was sent to investigate reported sightings of a witch engaged in muggle-baiting and ended up being stranded in a battle between muggle members of the police and what seems to be an incredibly powerful, not to mention quite insane, wraith without his wand.

Between the battles, the struggles and the need for secrecy, the sheer inhumanity and misery of the tenements, towers and other mass/social housing systems Alma uses as cover, the crime, the broken dreams and reality of muggle life in a bad situation even before the 'hauntings' happen (and the madness that follows-looting being the least of it), the Auror becomes convinced that it's all part of Alma's illusions.

Basically, even if the Auror survives, he or she will be quite unhinged, given that even Knockturn Alley has nothing on the sheer gravitas hundreds of people crammed together in a bad situation can impose upon sensitive souls. Couple that with the fear and panic of the unknown attacking them, and it becomes quite a spectacle.
