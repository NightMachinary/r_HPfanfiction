That's because nobody's actually made anything too interesting out of the setting really. It's basically 'psychic psycho tsundere and her offspring go crazy' with guns added. You want to attract people to the setting? You need atmosphere. You need to play with it yet keep it recognizable. You need to make it into something other than 'oh look, canon rehash with bits added to it. Yawn.'

That's hard. But, fear not! Because if you do it right, well, you will transcend the barriers of fandom and get people interested in the canon of the crossover you're crossing with. It's how I make some of my game/TV show choices nowadays-I read fanfiction crosses with them and stuff I like, then go after the settings behind the crosses that interest me. Yeah, it makes for odd outcomes (I just don't get MLP, for instance. I just don't), but I'm rarely disappointed and goddamnit I'm rambling.
