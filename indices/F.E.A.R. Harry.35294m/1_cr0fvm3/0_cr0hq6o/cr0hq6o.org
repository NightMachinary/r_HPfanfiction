I really like your teasers or whatever they are, especially the second one. Of course I could try to write it myself, but it's a completely different experience from reading a story. I'm not saying that it isn't enjoyable, but , at least I, have to consider all the story elements in advance. So it's more about describing the idea instead of experiencing it. I dont know if it is understandable what I wrote :D Anyway, I might try writing one if there really isn't a single one. The bad thing is, that as far as I know, FEAR-s fanfic base isn't that big. The last time I checked there were little over 200 fics in total, and most of them are below 10k :/
