Well, I think the first game is pretty old now, don't know exactly. And as I mentioned before (or not) I never played the first two. As far as I know the first two is more a horror game with shooter elements while the third one was an okay shooter with some story. I can count on one hand how many times Alma appeared in the third game :/ Anyway, it's an enjoyable game, but wouldn't play it again.
