linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) and its sequel linkffn(The Best Revenge: Time of the Basilisk by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is an optimistic take on Snape.

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) centers on Hermione but has an excellent Snape (and is /not/ a Snape/Hermione 'ship).
