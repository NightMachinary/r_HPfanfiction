  After the 2nd Wizarding War, Hermione works as an apprentice at Hogwarts where Severus is still the Potions Master. She performs a time-turner experiment using Severus in the demonstration, and things go horribly wrong. Follow the pair as they arrive in various times, in unfamiliar roles, and try in vain to come back home while learning about each other and their true feelings.
