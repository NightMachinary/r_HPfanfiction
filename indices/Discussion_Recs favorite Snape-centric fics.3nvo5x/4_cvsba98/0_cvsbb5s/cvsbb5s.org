      Written for the Snapecase fest on LiveJournal\.  My thanks to my expert beta readers, Moira of the Mountain \(aka Mountain Moira\) and The Real Snape\.The first line of the story comes from Goblet of Fire; the rest is mine, though of course the characters are JKR's; I make no claims to her empire\.
