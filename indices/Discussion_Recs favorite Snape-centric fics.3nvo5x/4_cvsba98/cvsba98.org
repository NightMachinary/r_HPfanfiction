Now to mix up the recs a bit.

linkao3(In Memory of Sigmund Freud by delphi) Snape/McGonagall, Snape/Moody. Vaguely suicidal Professor Snape after his first year of teaching is invited to spend the hols at McGonagall's summer house. A recently injured Moody is there, too, recuperating. The fic is an extraordinary character study, full of hints and subtext and astonishing insight into what makes Snape Snape. I love this fic like burning.

linkao3(A Gramarye of Folk Magic by delphi) Snape/Aberforth Dumbledore. Huge cross-gen, but it works. After he defects from the Death Eaters, Snape is billeted with Albus' brother. This is an account of the year that follows. Aberforth is a triumph, pragmatic, earthy, laconic but funny, still damaged by that long-ago family tragedy. Seeing a very young Snape through his eyes is fascinating and poignant.

Two related short fics create a somewhat different mythology in which the Prince family shares a bleak destiny, tinged with old magic and Ministry politics. [[http://severus-shorts.livejournal.com/13205.html][A Rowan in Winter by duniazade]] and [[http://snapecase.livejournal.com/28671.html][Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree by duniazade]] Beautiful, enigmatic, dark, unsettling. Gen fic.

linkao3(Mutability by kelly_chambliss) Snape/McGonagall. Another character study of Snape during the years leading up to Voldemort's defeat. It's the portrait of a man trapped in claustrophobic duty and pessimism, ordered by the Dark Lord to seduce Albus' deputy. Severus's thought processes are illuminating and self-sabotaging, leading him ever deeper into detachment.

linkao3(The Shadow of Misery's Wings by femmequixotic) Snape/Viktor Krum. Two has-beens, damaged by their pasts, drawn together by need and an intense carnal bond. The fic revolves around a central scene, an amazing and unflinching piece of smut.

Back to gen again. Two fics that are somewhat similar, since they both deal with Snape's final year: linkao3(Penultimate Acts by pasi) and [[http://hoggywartyxmas.livejournal.com/24152.html][Into the Silence by lyras]].

And one last rec for a Snape gen fic before I go to bed:

linkao3(To Dwell on Dreams by musamihi) Snape is addicted to a potion that lets him hallucinate Lily as a still living woman. The potion is close to destroying him, and Dumbledore locks him in a room to force him into withdrawal. Beautifully written and harrowing.
