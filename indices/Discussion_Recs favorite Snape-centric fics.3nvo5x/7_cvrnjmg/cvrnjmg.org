Not one for Snape fics (or Snape, himself, really), so this is probably not going to be one of the fics from that genre with real literary appeal.

Still, I read and liked linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6586583/1/The-Prince-s-Harem]]), because it seemed to reflect the whole "fix everything for Harry and make his life awesome" (an occasional guilty pleasure after darker reading) genre onto Snape while being humorous and light-hearted enough to actually keep me reading a genre that, again, I have little to no interest in.

Warnings: Use of potions ingredients as illicit drugs. Marauders era. Snape having sex. People thinking Snape has even more sex than he actually does. Some Marauders&Lily bashing. Not actually as bad as these warnings would make you believe.
