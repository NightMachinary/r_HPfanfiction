Well, it is Snarry, a (very long) one-shot and absolutely fantastic. The author sticks to the seven canon books...but with major twists thanks to the use of quite possibly, the best use of time-travel I've ever come across.

The Snarry part is slow to develop, and the story starts out very funny and sarcastic...but gets darker, more and more bitter and serious as the Hogwarts years roll on by.

Seriously, it's excellent and one of my favorite stories. If OP doesn't like it, I highly suggest Snarry fans to read this.
