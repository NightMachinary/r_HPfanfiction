linkffn(Bound to Him) is a really good SS/HG, despite the embarrassing title. Voldemort decides to have Hermione spy on Harry for him, so he captures her during the summer and binds her to Snape. In that sense it's like a marriage law fic. But the writing is really good and heartbreaking at times, hilarious at other times.
