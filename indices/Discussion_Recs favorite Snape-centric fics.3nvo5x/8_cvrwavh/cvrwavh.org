Digging for Bones by Paganidd

I loved this Severitus fic, long, but unlikely to be updated.

The Birthday Present by excessivelyperky One of my favorite Snape characterization, with a very rare pairing.

Looking for Magic by Hypnobarb Snape/Hermione-I suppose its more Hermione-centric than you might like.

My absolute favorite: Spellcaster by SGCBearcub

At this point its pretty AU, but it helps fill in conceptual holes in the canonical structure of the wizarding world. Its a Marriage Law fic, but give it a chance!
