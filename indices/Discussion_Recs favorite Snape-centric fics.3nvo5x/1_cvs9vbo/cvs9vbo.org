Snarry is my central passion in HP fandom, but I don't usually try to convert people because I think it's one of those ships where it either hits your id and makes sense to you (in a bizarre way) or it doesn't.

Here are a few Snarry fics I love a lot, and in a second comment I'll link a few non-Snarry fics, including gen.

linkao3(Blood and Fire by cluegirl): Harry put an accidental mark on Snape which saves him repeatedly from the retribution of his enemies and the general public; Snape hates him for it. They work through the moral implications of owning/protecting someone against his will. It starts a little bumpily (and the author has an unfortunate fondness for "gritted" as a dialogue tag), but it's fascinating and intense and well-written, with a fierce, intelligent Snape POV, mob cruelty, a strong, stubborn, and not clueless Harry, and complex emotional ideas. The ending, IMO, cheats a bit, but I'm willing to forgive it for the rest of the fic, which is harsh and sometimes beautiful.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/2690][The Finder's Fee series]] by gatewaygirl, an AU which has Snape and Harry in a D/s relationship, but one in which Harry is an equal, not a helpless quivering innocent. It begins with the two of them sneaking down into the Chamber of Secrets to cut up the basilisk to sell in parts, splitting the profits between them. The magic and the relationship are both inventive, and the last installment has the added attraction of Ron's POV, when he's sent to arrest Harry on suspicion of having killed an endangered and legally protected firebird.

linkao3(Rapture by mia_ugly): Dumbledore gives Harry a pocketwatch that takes him back in time to meet a young, raw, self-loathing Snape. Snape falls in love with this compassionate young man who keeps showing up and disappearing from his life. Beautiful prose, great characterization, and a pervasive sense of tragic romance that overcomes somewhat weak plot machinations at the end. One of my favorite fics of all time.

At the other end of the scale, linkao3(In Between Days by atrata) is a tour de force of Stockholm syndrome dynamics, sexual manipulation, and morally ambiguous (or simply morally appalling) Snape. My bookmark comment for this says: "Brilliant, disturbing, intense, incredibly hot, fucked up, acerbic, intelligent. A dark, powerful, morally elusive Snape with a fierce will of his own. Dysfunctional, unsentimental dynamics. If you crave obsessive Snarry, you've come to the right place." Warning: underage.

There are plenty more where those came from, but that might be pushing it, since Snape/Harry isn't really your cuppa.
