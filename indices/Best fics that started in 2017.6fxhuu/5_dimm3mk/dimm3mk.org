linkffn(Marry You by Dorothea Greengrass)

linkffn(From Southampton to New York and Beyond by Dorothea Greengrass)

linkffn(Saviour of Magic by Colt01) - rewrite of author's first story Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord, it's started to be different from chapter 13. It's slightly darker and more mature than the first.

linkffn(Wind Shear by Chilord) - time-travel

linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence) - time-travel

linkffn(Fear the Coming Darkness by I LIKE FEAR 1-2) - horror story, multi pairing but still intriguing.

linkffn(In Darkness, Bound to the Light by ElMarquis) - it's Lotr/HP crossover and oneshot but still worth to read.

linkffn(The Swallow and the Dragon by Flameraiser) - The Witcher/HP crossover
