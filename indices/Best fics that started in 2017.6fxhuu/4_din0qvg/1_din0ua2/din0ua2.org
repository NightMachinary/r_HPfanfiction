  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  It had been a full year since he saw the child. Remus assumed that Harry didn't know who he was. And he didn't know what to think about that. Then the boy smiled. His emerald eyes glimmered and he reached his arms forward as he spoke the word that simultaneously broke Remus heart and fixed it. "Moony."
