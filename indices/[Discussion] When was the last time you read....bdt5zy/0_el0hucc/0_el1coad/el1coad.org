I've started forcing myself to read at least one real book in between every complete fanfic I read. Reading fanfics is easy because you're already invested in that world. It's much harder to immerse yourself into a new world.

It's been quite liberating, though. It's also prompted me to read 6 books this year that I probably wouldn't have otherwise. I'm reading American Gods right now and it's managed to hook me into it.
