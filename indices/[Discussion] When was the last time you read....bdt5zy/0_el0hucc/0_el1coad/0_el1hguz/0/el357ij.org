It's just one book, and I'm roughly halfway through so far.

It's a little disjointed, but given the premise, I think it's intentional on the part of the author to make you feel the way the main character does - in over his head and lost in a world that doesn't make sense to him anymore.

I'll reserve final judgement until I actually finish the book, but if it keeps the pace and the thrills building into a satisfying conclusion, I think it will be a very high rating indeed.
