I always wait a year until I reread the books. This time I am reading them in English for the first time. I love them but I am struggling to finish the first one because it kind of bores me - I also had that struggle the first time I read it. (Not that it's bad but the darker themes of the later books are more interesting for me)

But I can't get over the year without fanfictions. They are my save heaven and they give me some variety, canon can't compete with.
