I'm actually almost done with DH right now, but it's been slow progress because I've been reading the series to my kids. So to answer the question, I guess I've been very slowly rereading them for the past year or so. Lol But before that, it had been an embarrassingly long time. I think that I'm going to give them another read myself once I finish up with the read aloud.
