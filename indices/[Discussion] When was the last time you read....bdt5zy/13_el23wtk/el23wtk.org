I read the 1st-4th a while back (7mo ago?) when reading a proper set up ‚Äúcharacters read the books fic.‚Äù Typically those stories tread the plagiarism line, but I found one that if you had the actual HP books open in your lap one could read in them, then jump back to the fanfic story and then back to the HP books, etc. I think the author had to lock the story though, I'm on the email list and get sent a link when she writes a new chapterü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Beyond that, it's been years.

I've probably read chunks of the 7th book the most. For instance, anytime I end up watching Part 1+2 of the 7th movie I often have to re-read (or listen to audio book) book 7. Specifically re-reading ch 36 The Flaw in the Plan (when HP wakes up in the forest from his weird Dumbledore kings cross dream) to the end. Honestly, because the dramatic fight scene in movie 7 part 2 pisses me off---all the loose ends that were tied up in the book were tossed to the wind for a dramatic light show battle in the movie. I know they were competing w/ Twilight's movies at the time---but even the final Twilight movie Break Dawn part 2 was able to squeeze in their dramatic movie-only fight scene and then flashback to what actually happened, which was true to the book.

Anyway, yah you're right, I turn to fanfics when I get an HP craving long before I go to pull out my cannon HP books.
