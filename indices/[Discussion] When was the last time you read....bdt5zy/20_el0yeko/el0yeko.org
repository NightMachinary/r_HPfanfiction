More than a decade ago. Haven't read DH since release, the others before then.

This means that I am more influenced by movie portrayal of characters than what is shown in the books, which is likely to affect my view of some people.

The main one that comes to mind is Severus Snape. I am told that movie-Severus acts in a far more redeemable way (his worst portrayed action after his turning away from the Death Eaters in the movies boils down to being Neville's Boggart, and he apparently did far less inexcusable things than in the books, the only truly bad point being his awful teacher persona). He still has the same biggest personality flaw -- inability to let go of his past (his view of Marauders and Lily are stuck in the past just like in the books) -- but his actions are generally portrayed in a better light.
