Haven't actually read the books. My mom read them aloud to me when I was a kid, and she continued doing that even as I grew up and learned to read for myself. It was a fun little tradition...

Nowadays I reference PDF versions of the text when I need details for a fanfic, but I haven't touched a physical copy since middle school --- and I'm a grown man living on his own now.
