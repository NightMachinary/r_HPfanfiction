Admittedly Draco does try to get a highly intelligent hippogriff executed after it attacks him after he insults it. And tries to bait Harry into going after Sirius Black when they still think he's a Death Eater. And Snape threatens to poison Neville's toad, tries to have Lupin given the Dementor's Kiss as well as Sirius, and when that fails exposes Lupin as a werewolf.
