I think you're mixing fanon with canon. Canon Harry wasn't as pathetic as the fandom makes him out to be. Yes, he was mistreated but it wasn't like he ever bowed down to the Dursleys. He talked back and he wasn't exactly a pushover as a wizard either. He fought adults and outmaneuvered a dragon at 14! How is he below average!? Just because he's not god level? Also prophecies making someone powerful is lazy writing as well. Just saying he can be powerful because "HE'S THE CHOSEN ONE" is boring and uninspired. Instead we see Harry make mistakes, get lucky, and with a lot of help he wins.
