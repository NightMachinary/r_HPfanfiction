I like this concept because I don't think any prophesied person can be below average like how Harry is in canon. It would have been alright if 16 year old Harry was as powerful as 16 year old Tom, and then he had “love” or something else as the “power he knows not”. But canon Harry is too pitiable, gullible and weak throughout the series except for rare cases....
