In my own canon, Gobleki Tepe was absolutely made by wizards. It was “just” a pre-agricultural settlement, because magic makes it possible for sedentary societies to emerge without first developing agriculture.

In prehistoric times, there were at least as many witches and wizards who formed magic-only societies with each other, as there were witches and wizards who remained with muggles (there's a trade-off between being King of Shit Mountain and being a regular dude in relative Utopia---some wanted power, or to stick with the people they knew, and others preferred the higher standard of living that can only come when you have a few hundred or even a thousand witches and wizards living and working together).

(Ancient societies often described the gods as beings who lived in the world and could be interacted with, but were nevertheless remote from humans, because many witches and wizards removed themselves from society. Yes, Zeus was Top God in Greece, but he spent most of his time on Olympus, not slumming it with humans and giving orders all the time.)
