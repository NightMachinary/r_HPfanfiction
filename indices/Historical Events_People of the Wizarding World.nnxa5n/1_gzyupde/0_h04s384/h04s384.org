In my canon, I tried to change things up a bit by making the European wixes into relative latecomers to the Secrecy thing---the other main “superpowers” of the day, China and Uagadou (an actual magic city-state whose “catchment area” covered much of Africa) were already isolationists, and once the European wixes got on board, the pro-Secrecy faction acquired critical mass and forced the rest of the world to go along with it.

Starfox5's explanation is that there were prophecies to the effect that “if we don't seclude ourselves, Bad Shit will happen.” I didn't really like this because it's so vague, but I've been dabbling with an AU where the Statute is broken during WWII, and it's becoming increasingly clear that magic + muggles = Bad Times, because (most) enchanted objects be used by anybody, magical and non-magical alike. The Statute of Secrecy was put into effect in the the multi-generational slaughter of the Thirty Years' War and the growing use of flintlock rifles and other firearms. Even without Seers to provide helpful prophecies, it wouldn't have been hard to imagine what could happen if a muggle army were outfitted with enchanted objects.
