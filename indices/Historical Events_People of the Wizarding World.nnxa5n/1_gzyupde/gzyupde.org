I would avoid making too many very important people magical. That tends to end up defaulting to magical supremacy as the message becomes 'everything muggles though that they had achieved was actually done by us'. Maybe also include some losers, so that you have counter examples of muggles succeeding in spite of magic.

I feel a good place to look is for existing stories of 'magical' people. The most obvious cases are folklore. You might feel that King Arthur is already done to death, but maybe look at some of the older Celtic stuff. Many of the early Christian saint were basically adopted local pagan legends as well, and can get pretty wild.

You can also take more general events and just create mini stories of OC magicals in them, even if they didn't go down in History. A common example of this in fanfiction is how the obviously Saxon in origin Witengamot, adapted to the take over of William the Conqueror and presumably his own magical courtiers. Although please avoid the xenophobic pureblood wank over the Malfoys 'only being in the country for 900 years'.

One area I really want to see fleshed out is the lead up to the Statute of Secrecy. While JKR heard the phrase 'witch burnings' once and decided that was a good enough justification, if you actually look at Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, that was the least of their worries. Between the (counter-)reformation, famines, plagues, social change and the constant wars, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were all out in force and it is frankly no wonder that the magicals decided to hide themselves away. But presumably this decision wasn't easy, especially given how many would have muggle friends/family/vested financial interest, so getting the near universal agreement required to make the Statute actually enforceable must have been a saga unto itself.
