Well we know that Ptolemy, Agrippa and von Rheticus (and maybe Newton although I don't remember whether that's canon of fanon) were wizards in the HP universe although they are based on historical people. Also the Black Plague I think is mentioned as one of Malfoy's curses that got out of control while trying to chase away from his land some people that would refuse to leave. Also another Malfoy is said to have cursed Queen Elisabeth I to never get married after she turned down his proposal.

Speaking of which, during the first year of the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians tried to shut down in their city while awaiting the Spartans to tire while sieging. However there was a plague outbreak within the city that forced them to get out. That could be a magical intervention. The great fire of London could be the result of a quarrel between the baker from whom the fire is said to have started and his magical neighbors.
