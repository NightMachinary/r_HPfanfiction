I think it's just a matter of perspective. For some "purebloods," half-bloods are people with slightly more muggle blood than they themselves have. A muggleborn great-great-great-great-great-grandmother might disqualify you in the eyes of Mrs. Black, but most people would probably consider you to be close enough to pureblood.

For example, Harry's children have three grandparents from old pureblood families (James, Molly, Arthur) and one muggleborn grandparent (Lily). Some people would say that's enough to consider them pureblood. Others would consider them to be half-bloods, but might consider a hypothetical child of Lily and Scorpius Malfoy to a pureblood. Others would say the entire family line was ruined by Lily Evans.

Names matter as much if not more than actual lineage, since it's not like people show up at Hogwarts with their grandparent's blood status written on their foreheads. If you know the Abbotts are a well-known wizarding family and you meet someone named Hannah Abbott, you're going to assume she's pureblood. But for all you know, she could have a muggleborn/muggle mother. On the other hand, someone like Tom Riddle might be initially assumed to be a muggleborn simply because no one recognized his muggle father's surname, even if his mother was a Gaunt.
