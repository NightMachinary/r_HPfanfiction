I agree. I'm pretty sure I've read somewhere that Rowling based it on the Nuremberg's laws. The term for a half-blood in Nazi Germany is a 'Mischling', but there are two categories. Mischling of the first degree had two Jewish grandparents, Mischling of the second degree had only one. If you had three or four Jewish grandparents, you were a Jew. Having none, you were a "pureblood German"

Basically, I think that as long as you have one Muggle grandparent, you would still be a Half-blood. James, Albus and Rose are purebloods, Huge and Rose aren't
