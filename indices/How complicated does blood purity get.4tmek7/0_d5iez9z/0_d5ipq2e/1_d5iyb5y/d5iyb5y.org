There are definite and I'm pretty sure deliberate parallels with the Nuremberg Laws, but I didn't realize the originals were that complex. There would need to be some differences. First, there is no equivalent of "muggle-born" under the Nuremberg Laws. Second, if we carry the chart over exactly, then a witch or wizard with one magical parent and one magical grandparent would still be considered a muggle-born.

I've seen arguments that only witches and wizards with no muggle /or muggle-born/ grandparents are purebloods, since elite purebloods consider muggles and "mudbloods" to be basically the same, but I don't think I buy it. That's closer to the One Drop Rule, and while the Malfoys might hold with it, I suspect most wizards don't.
