I always saw it as more of a political thing than most of the commenters here do. Especially since as far as we know, there is not an actual difference between magical and non-magical blood. It's more of a metaphor for your family's status. I imagine if your family was around when blood purity became a recognized concept (as it's a pretty baseless theory that has been proven in the series to have no impact on magical ability), your family would be considered a pureblood family. Everyone after that would be considered a newcomer and wouldn't have the same social status as the existing families.
