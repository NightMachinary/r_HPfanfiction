The children of muggleborn also count as halfbloods. When the change from halfblooded line to pureblooded line occurs, I do not know. Its probably at the same time as your estate becomes interesting for the elite to do business with.

For all we know, it could just be that you need to be properly distanced from the muggle world to be considered pureblooded, hence why only the children of the halfblood may be considered pureblood.

It could also be the case that once a muggleborn or muggle joins the line, the entire line will stay halfblooded forever (or until the generation with the "dirty blood" is no longer remembered).

There is a lot blank space here, ready to be filled. It can be easy by making it dependent on the grandparents and nothing else, or it can be difficult and be entirely dependent on social and cultural mannerisms, rituals and habits.
