I made [[http://imgur.com/7xsifxt][this]] a while ago when I asked myself this question (after seeing [[/u/rimasshai]] picture I feel a little dirty.)

We know Harry and Voldemort were 'halfbloods' (figures 18 for Harry, 9 for LV). Hermione is a muggleborn (figure 1), and Draco a pureblood (figure 21). I think most would agree that having 5 or 6 magical parents/grandparents would make you a pureblood, 3 or 4 a half blood and 0 a muggleborn. But what about those with 1 or 2? While figure 16 is more likely to be a halfblood, what would you call figure 2? With only one magical grandparent I wouldn't call them a halfblood. But are they a muggleborn? What about figure 6 (the magical child of two squibs)? Is that a halfblood or a pureblood? Also, what is the difference between a squib and a muggle? If figure 7's child was not magical, would that be a muggle or a squib? What about a non magical child in figure 16?

Eventually I just gave up and decided that it was a cultural thing rather then an actual definition.
