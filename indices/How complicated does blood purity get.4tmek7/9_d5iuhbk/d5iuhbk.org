One way to measure it: in your idealized family tree, how many generations do you have to go back on average to get to a muggleborn? (Idealized family tree because it assumes no overlap among mages -- your mother and father aren't sixth cousins or anything.) So N-- Tonks is a child of Andromeda Black, with an average of (we'll say) 12 generations, and Ted Tonks, with an average of 0 generations; so N-- Tonks gets a score of 7.

This is not the system in use because N-- Tonks is considered to have garbage status, whereas someone who was seven generations removed from muggleborns would be acceptable to high society.

Another metric is the minimum number of generations instead of the average. N-- Tonks would have the same status as, oh, a child of Hermione Granger and Seamus Finnegan. That also doesn't seem quite right.

Still another way to look at it is: assume that magical ability is a dominant single-gene trait. Assume that muggleborns are all heterozygous. What is the probability that you are homozygous? That is what your purity is based on. Every time you produce a squib, that knocks you back to mudblood rank, though -- bearing a squib is shameful, but not quite /that/ shameful.

I think the actual system is far less formal, far harder to specify. (Though it could be amusing for Nott or Zabini to keep a running tally of everyone in Slytherin, both their lineage points and the points they get from actions.) It's got aspects of all three formal measures that I suggested, plus the notion of blood traitors who lose status because of their actions.
