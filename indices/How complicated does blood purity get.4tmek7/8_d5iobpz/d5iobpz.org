As others have said, its based upon generations. So a pure blood marriage would be 2 magicals without the corruption of a muggle born or muggle in their blood going back a certain number of generations. This is part of why purebloods are a much smaller number and suffer from inbreeding. The reality of finding a mostly or completely non related pureblood to marry as a pureblood yourself is tough.

Half blood is likely a little more relaxed as muggle blood or muggle born blood can be introduced at any time and it does not affect the bloodline as long as one of them is magical back a certain number of generations on one side or the other.

However its important to realize that these are political definitions when it comes to "qualifying" as a particular type of blood.

For example... Harry is not actually a half blood (both his parents are magicals so hes pure blooded), but based upon the potter history, and the fact that Lily was muggleborn, hes still going to be considered a half blood in the magical world.

However he married Ginny (a pureblood), and his dad was not muggle born, so given a few generations if their children did not marry outside of established purebloods, the potter line would become purebloods as well.
