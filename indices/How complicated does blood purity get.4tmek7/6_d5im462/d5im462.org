I reckon it would depend on the character answering your question.

For extreme blood purists, like Blacks or Malfoys, tapistry-keeping families with certified pedigree would be true purebloods generally worthy of being fraternised and married with. Poor purebloods, halfbloods, and the like would be acceptable contacts if it was made obvious that they knew their place and were “sufficiently assimilated” (generally demonstrated through their knowledge of traditions and “wizarding culture“). Mudbloods would be ostracised or ignored. Political and magical power a person or family currently wielded would also affect to a certain degree their hight on the totem pole. Aside from that, politicking would also decide how “pure” someone's blood got when they married into a pureblood family or out of it.

For half-bloods who in some manner depend on blood purists, all the above would be nominally true as well, though they wouldn't have the same fanaticism about it (e.g. hidden relations and business with halfbloods and muggleborns).

For half-bloods who try to live on their own --- and “purebloods” who just don't give a shit (e.g. Weasleys) --- blood purists' stance would matter if for some reason they needed to be aware about it (e.g. they held governmental positions that necessitated frequent contacts with blood purists). Otherwise they would be just peripherally aware about it and act on their own discretion.

For muggleborns --- and representatives of other categories that have burned their bridges with pureblood agenda (S. Black, the Tonks, etc) --- the whole blood purity business would generally stink of social stratification ripe with “human right” abuse potential.

For low-tier dark lord minions, anything their lord said would generally be accepted as truth without thinking much about it.

For higher-tiers and the inner circle, some double-thinking might've been necessary.
