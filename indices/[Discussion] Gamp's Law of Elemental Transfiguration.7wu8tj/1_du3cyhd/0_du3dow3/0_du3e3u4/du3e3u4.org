True, but why does it say that? Is there a different Law for Advanced Transfiguration?

No matter what kind of system of elements is used, if it encompasses everything (as most elemental systems usually do), specifying Elemental Transfiguration is redundant - it could just as well be Gamp's Law of Transfiguration. As such I suspect the Law concerns only a subset of Transfiguration, albeit a large subset.
