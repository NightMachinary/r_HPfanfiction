Yeah, since the exceptions state what you can't transfigure, the rule presumably states what you can transfigure - everything except the exceptions.

That said, it probably also defines the scope of transfiguration - there are probably things that you can't transfigure which aren't in an exception simply because they're not within the scope of transfiguration, like souls, magic itself, etc. - non-physical things.

So Gamp's law probably states something like "It's possible to transfigure any element into any other element". Probably the understanding of "element" is not the same as Muggle chemistry though.

Probably.
