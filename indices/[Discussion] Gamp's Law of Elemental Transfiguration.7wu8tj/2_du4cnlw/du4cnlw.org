Some people have suggested that money might be another exception. After all, Leprechaun gold disappears and the Philosopher's Stone's ability to create gold is supposed be really special. And if it were as easy as transfiguring stuff into money, or inxreasing the amount of money, there wouldn't be poverty.

And I think another exception may be life. That if you transfigure something inanimate into an animal, it isn't truly alive.

And of course the law itself has already been explained here in other comments.
