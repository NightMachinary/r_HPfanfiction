It's a trope. Hermione and Ron leaving Harry solo, suspecting him, ect. Leaving him alone with possibly someone swooping in to be his new bff.

It shouldn't make sence - It's the Wizarding world - but it would be fun if at the end you (the reader) find out he did do it because who would think poor Harry would do such a thing? Plot twist I'd read.
