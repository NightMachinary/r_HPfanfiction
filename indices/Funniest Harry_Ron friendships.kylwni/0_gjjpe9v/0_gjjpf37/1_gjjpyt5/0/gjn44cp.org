That is a bot that displaces the hyphen in statements like <blank>-ass <blank> to read <blank> ass-<blank> - in speech, put the emphasis on the "ass" instead of on the surrounding words for the effect.

In this case, it turned it into "ass-bounty hunters" - which sounds like they're coming for that booty.
