  It's not until she's brought a basil and strawberry sponge cake to Neville Longbottom and his new girlfriend, Hannah Abbott, a dozen rhubarb hand-pies to Luna and Xenophilius Lovegood, and another basket of ganache-covered muffins to Dean and Seamus, that Hermione admits to herself what she's actually doing: she's making a thing of this. It's a veritable PTSD tour. With pastries. And hand-skimmed clotted cream. And she has no idea why she's doing it, but it's becoming very apparent that she is.    Sometimes you're sad. Sometimes you need dessert. And sometimes, it's a little of both.
