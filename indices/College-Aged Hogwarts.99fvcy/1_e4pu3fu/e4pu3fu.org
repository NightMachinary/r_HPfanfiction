These kind of stories are always shit, because it makes zero sense if you think about it for more than 3 seconds: Just one example... How do purebloods function? Do they just get home-schooled until they are adults and do nothing else that has anything to do with their wizarding heritage (JKRs version that they do fuck-all until they are 11 is already bad enough)? How many muggleborn would actually ditch their old life as adults? If Harry attends Hogwarts at 19 instead of 11, does that mean Voldemort tried to steal the Philosopher's Stone 8 years ago? Was there a Triwizard 4 years ago? Etc. etc...

It's just a bad idea, unless you throw everything from canon out the window and should just read The Name of the Wind instead.
