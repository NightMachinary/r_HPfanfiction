I think the tone shift happens in PoA. It is that book that we see a man imprisoned wrongly, and no one doing anything about it. It is there also that the story starts getting darker with the concept of Dementors, Sirius and Remus completely willing to murder Peter, and we see the a side of Harry that /makes/ him the chosen one; his righteous anger streak. That along with his saving people's thing, is what makes Harry Potter the subject of the Prophecy.

Like Starfox said, in the Third Year, the bad guys won. Sirius was still a criminal, Harry still went back to that hell he grew up in, and Remus was outed as a werewolf to everyone. All that and the only positive out of it was that Wormtail (a 30ish year old man) stopped sleeping with Ron.
