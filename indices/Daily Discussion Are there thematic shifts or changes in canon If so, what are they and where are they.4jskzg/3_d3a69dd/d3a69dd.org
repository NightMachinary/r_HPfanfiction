I would argue that there are several thematic shifts in canon. The most obvious is the one between GoF and OotP, which a lot of people have already commented on, but I'd argue that there was also one between OotP and HBP, and also between HBP and DH. I'll try to qualify this as I go on.

There's a thematic shift in magic that happens gradually from PoA onward, where magic slowly becomes more and more tied to powerful magic items and 'unique' plot tokens such as animagi. In earlier books problems are often solved by remembering the right incantations, giving the sense that almost anything is possible if you know how to use a wand or brew a potion. The later books focus more around 'ye olde weapons of yore', most notably the hallows themselves, and personal ability/knowledge takes a back seat. You either have a magical plot coupon, or you are too short to ride the plot train. Things become more ritualistic and less functional with regard to plot devices (like Horcruxes, Animagi and Hallows) and less complicated with regard to spellcasting, which is often relegated to 'point at object and say funny word' in place of earlier complex wand movements and such.

I would say that the quality of writing shifts after OotP, marked by a sharp decline with the inclusion of the prophecy, which was a step away from the 'famous kid who people think is a chosen one' into 'actual chosen one' territory. It marks the beginning of Harry's transition into a weird kind of Jesus analogue... but I'm getting ahead of myself. It's a transition point where Harry is no longer implicitly expected to fight Voldemort because of genre conventions, but is actually expected to do so in-universe. Basically, by the time HBP comes along, the HP series makes an audible clunking sound as it desperately tries to bootstrap itself into young adult fiction. In my opinion, it does not succeed.

Book seven is where the Christian subtext really takes off, though it had always been present (House sorting = Calvinism, in a nutshell), and it coincides neatly with JKR's association with the Church of Scotland. Dumbledore plays an odd sort of God role, and Harry's faith in Dumbledore is tested by Rita Skeeter's biography of him. Ultimately, this leads to him dying and being 'reborn' after a conversation with DumbleGod in the afterlife, in a way that is so crassly symbolic I feel a little dirty just writing about it. There was no subtlety, only Jesus!Harry. It's also where, once again, there is an audible clunk as the books attempt to continue the adventure in the format of the school year, despite only tangentially involving the school at this point. It's a dramatic change of pace, because there is relatively little 'wacky school stuff' to distract from the bareness of the mystery plot, so there are long stretches of basically nothing going on in DH. This mirrors PS in some ways, as that year didn't have much going on either, but in DH I feel this is more obvious, especially since it was meant to be marketed to teens.
