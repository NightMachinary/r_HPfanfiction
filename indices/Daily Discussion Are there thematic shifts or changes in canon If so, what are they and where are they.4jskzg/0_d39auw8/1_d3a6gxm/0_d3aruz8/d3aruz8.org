Indee, I mean I didn't want him to die, but he's less important (over all) than say for example Sirius (now that one hit me like a hammer...he was one of my favourite characters, damned Rowling, couldn't you have killed another "nobody" or someone I hate, like say Snape? -.-) and we know less about Cedric, too (Sirius is still a minor character, but we do know a lot more about him)
