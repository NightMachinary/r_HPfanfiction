Thing is, Rowling liked to try to have her cake and eat it, when it came to character death, and it kinda showed how immature her idea of death was in many cases. Often she would randomly kill a background character and I'd get his sense that she was giving me this puppy-eyed look through the pages and saying 'see how /tragic/ war is? I'm a ruthless, heartless /monster/!'

Except she really wasn't. Often, it was someone who had contributed barely anything to the plot. She massacred her supporting caste in DH for very little effect, in my opinion, because it only served to highlight the plot armour of the main characters. Basically, there's a difference between 'senseless' death, which can be legitimately surprising with the right timing (Cedric actually worked, for example), and actually senseless death. Most of the deaths in DH were the latter, and they had very little effect on the main characters for the most part. There just wasn't time to show it all, and she used the device way too often on background characters.

She was under enormous time constraints for the last couple of books, but still, I think she overused death tropes for little benefit in Deathly Hallows.
