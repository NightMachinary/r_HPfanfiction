Learning more about Lord Voldemort's (Tom Riddle's) past, and the Horcruxes, in /Half-Blood Prince/, and ending with Dumbledore's death at Snape's hand. Not only does it help to characterize the main antagonist and villain of the series, providing a reason and motivation for why Voldemort "cannot die" and why he fears death, but it provides a major thematic shift and tone change, setting up the Horcrux hunt to come for much of /Deathly Hallows/. Likewise, the death of Dumbledore also signifies the "death" of Harry's innocence and childhood, and ushers Harry and the audience into a "bloody hell, things just got real" stark moment of realization.
