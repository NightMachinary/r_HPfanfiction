[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354), is really good. Harry and Hermione both work as curse breakers after the war, and they discovered an ancient spaceship. They first meet people on Battlestar Triton, and eventually uncover the secrets of Star Gate: Atlantis. I especially like the fact that Harry and Hermione make a huge difference in both these new worlds.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], linkffn(11027086), has Harry living in Middle Earth for 10 years before the last War of Ring broke out. He alters the course of war rather drastically and gets together with Eowyn.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), Ginny also falls through the Veil and meets Sirius in Essos. I like this fic a lot because it shows HP Magic in its full glory as Ginny and Sirius carved out their empire in Essos within a few years. The story slows down for a while as the author is shipping Ginny with Rhaegar Targaryen, but it has picked up steam again. The author has indicated a major, unspecified, new threat in which Rhaegar can make some meaningful contributions too.
