"Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus" Is mostly about AU Fem!'Harry' and the sheer absurdity that is her life, but she regularly has tea with "Uncle Death" (who may or may not be Canon!Harry). Warning: This fic is the inception of a fabulous series of AUs and AUs of AUs. If you fall into this black hole, you may never climb out.

"And On" is just a drabble, but it's kind of fun.

I haven't actually read "The Most Powerful Weapon", but it looks promising. AU Harry takes up the DADA post at Hogwarts.
