I've been contemplating for a long time writing a fic where Harry loses so many of his friends that he comes up with this idea to go back in time and pretend to be James on that Halloween night after the real James is killed. He wants to change how time happened and change the war and raises young him like his son and completely takes on the James persona. He would raise little Harry to be independent, smart, cunning, and prepared for what he had to deal with growing up. He would raise Harry not to be so stubborn and set in his ways and would raise him to be a more neutral person. Remus Lupin would help him in the beginning of the story learn as much as he can about his father (because in this AU Lupin is still alive but not many others are). This would happen before the time jump. Harry would wear contacts to hide his eye color (or maybe some type of magic, not sure yet)

I've got cool ideas for it. Writing it on the other hand... that I am struggling with.
