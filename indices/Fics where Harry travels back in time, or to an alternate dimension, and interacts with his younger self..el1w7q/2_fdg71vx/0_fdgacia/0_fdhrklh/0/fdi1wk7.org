You'd need some canon refactoring, then - James was 20 by the time he died, and the second war ended when Harry was 17. Not a very big difference, but close friends would be able to tell if their friend is younger than they remember him being. I'd say 19 is the bare minimum, but 21 or 22 would give you a little bit more room to play around with canon.

In this version of events, the horcrux hunt obviously has to either fail or not begin at all, I think the best point for this would be if the gringotts heist went wrong and ended with either Ron or Hermione's death/maiming at the hands of the goblins.

This, then causes issues, and with all three missing from the battle of Hogwarts it is soundly lost to the Death Eaters, or doesn't happen at all - Voldemort was only there because of Harry, after all.

In any case, Voldemort fully entrenches the Ministry and begins hunting down the Order of the Phoenix, and the dark ministry is in charge of exterminating muggleborns, half-bloods and muggles.

A good setup would be something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Remus and Harry stand in an abandoned safehouse. Every compatriot of theirs disappeared, gone into hiding or dead. Lord Voldemort has all but won, and even now swarms of dark wizards are scouring the countryside for remants of resistance.

  Both swear a solemn vow to avenge their friends, to make things right.

  The Headmaster's pensieve, pilfered during a raid that cost many their lives, allows Remus to extract and alter the memories of his school days, making them appear from Jame's point of view instead of his own. Harry views and internalizes them.

  Remus uses a transfiguration trick invented by James, which makes a transfiguration resistant to reversal unless one knows the counter, to make Harry's face into that of his dead friend. Harry's eyes have darkened as of late, an eerie red leaking through the horcrux mingling with his native green and turning them into James' brown. (This is mostly poetic justice, Red and Green are complementary colors that mix into brown; Tom Riddle's red with Harry's green)

  They recovered a spell from the Headmaster's private library, in a secret compartment and containing a letter from Dumbledore, addressing himself, attempting to talk his future self out of what he knows he will want to do. The spell draws upon a blood connection of the caster, and tears them through time and space toward the instant their life ended. (you can guess why dumbledore had the spell and didn't destroy it - Ariana) Essentially, it's a trapped situation like the resurrection stone, an attempt at true revival, but it failed spectacularily. Death cannot be reversed, and the spell places you at the instant the light left their eyes, forever stranded there. Another problem of the spell is its power requirement - it would weaken you so much that you would likely die on arrival, or be reduced into a coma.

  (At this point, you could exposition a bit about Voldemort's cunning plan to wipe out the muggles via turning their atom bombs upon one another, and installing enchantments upon major wizarding areas to ward off radiation, heat and fallout, and then repopulate a cleansed earth, and have one of the two heroes have the epiphany of using one of these detonations as a power source. would make for a cool scene)
