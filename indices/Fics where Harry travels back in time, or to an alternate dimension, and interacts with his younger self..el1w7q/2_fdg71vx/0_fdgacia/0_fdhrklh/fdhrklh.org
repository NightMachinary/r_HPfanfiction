My thought was to have Remus and Harry pour over Remus's memories of James and all the knowledge they can find for Harry to do this. Driving force for Remus is that Tonks and Teddy were killed by Voldemort and Harry is convinced that he can change everything. Remus is driven by the desperation of wanting family back. The one piece I'm unsure about is does Harry let Remus know once he's gone back in time. Remus might smell the difference and I could write it that way, but I'm still mulling over that. Having past Remus in the know could help Harry immensely.

Animagus form is a tricky one. I don't know a whole lot on them and would probably need to do some digging in that category.

Yeah, I've thought about Sirius a lot. Tricking Sirius would be difficult because James and Sirius are so close. I'm thinking maybe the lie of guilt could trick Sirius for a while and then Harry one day snaps and just tells Sirius that that Halloween night changed him and he's not going to be the same as he was before.

I was thinking that having Harry show up, see the actual James get killed by the killing curse would traumatize him a bit. But knowing Harry, he wouldn't be able to sit still so he would charge in there blindly, even though it wasn't the plan. He would barge in as Voldemort was on way to kill his mother. Then once he's there Voldemort would duel him, “kill” him (aka kill the horcrux) and then turn to kill Lily and the attempt to baby Harry. And then by the time Harry wakes up Lily is dead and he momentarily forgets why he was there and is sobbing over Lily because he's never seen her in person and he stupidly thought maybe he could save her in a blind fit of rage. I think that would be enough to really make people think he is James and he could state grief and magical exhaustion on anything else.

These are great questions! Helps me think through it more!
