Writing is fun. The hard part is starting, and even then, that's not as difficult as you'd think.

How would you mask Harry's unfamiliarity with his Father's life? Perhaps Remus as a co-conspirator, who gives Harry the memories of his school days so he can see what James did and can react according to that?

What about the Animagus Form? His patronus is a stag, so no issue there, but Remus in particular probably still runs with his friends even after their school days, and if Harry's animagus form isn't a stag, that's gonna cause issues.

If you plan on having Harry-James "survive" I hope you won't keep to canon like a tick but shake things up a little - don't have Sirius in Jail for instance.

Additionally, how would Harry fake an emotional reaction? James would obviously be extremely distraught and need time to come to terms with it, but Harry's known about and made peace with his parents' deaths for a while. Maybe have him attempt to battle Voldemort, get injured and make Voldemort use a spell other than the Killing Curse and have Lily die in his arms?
