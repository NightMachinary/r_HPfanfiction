I'm not 100% sure this is the same fic but I remember a scene where Hermione gives Harry a fake spell to transfigure something into crystal (I think it is) and he is able to. McGonagall is there and is surprised because that shouldn't be possible and Hermione explains that she thinks as long as Harry does not know what he is doing is impossible his magic seems to make it happen.
