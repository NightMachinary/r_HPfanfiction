Isn't that kinda... canon...? ðŸ˜…

Like, Hufflepuff takes those dedicated to hard work and fairness, /not/ everyone. Gryffindor however, while /supposedly/ for the brave and honor driven, also took Peter Pettigrew (whose literal only motivation in life was being afraid and therefore bending over backwards to get protection from the biggest school yard bully currently around). Gryffindor took Hermione, Dumbledore /and/ Minerva who all three would arguably have made a better fit for Ravenclaw. And last but not least, Harry himself went to Gryffindor, although by rights he should have been a Slytherin, simply because he asked to be put into Gryffindor.

If any house in canon just "scoops up" everyone no matter what their traits, then surely that's gotta be Gryffindor, right?
