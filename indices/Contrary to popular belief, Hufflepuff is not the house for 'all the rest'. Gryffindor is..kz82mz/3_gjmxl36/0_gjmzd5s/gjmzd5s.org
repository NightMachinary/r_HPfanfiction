According to the Sorting Hat, Helga Hufflepuff said ‘I'll take all the rest and teach them all just the same' or something to that effect. The meta narrative is that those who would have fit elsewhere, went to Gryffindor ‘because anyone can choose to be brave'.

What I was attempting to prompt, though failing, was that those that did or did not fit elsewhere might feel insecure about being placed in Gryffindor so overcompensate by doing reckless things in order to prove their bravery.
