Much more simple: It looks at potential and then picks in the Founders' name.

Look at it like draft picks. You have a pool of students, and four masters that have different philosophies for teaching their apprentices. And now they do their best to pick those who they think will be worthy to be taught by them, i.e. who they think are the best students. And then the Founders died, and the Sorting Hat took over.

So the point isn't that you have to be exceptionally cunning to go into Slytherin. And "sorting too soon" is also not an issue. The House is /supposed/ to shape you, and you are picked because it looks like you might appreciate the values it teaches you, and the hope is you then do your House proud. In that sense, every House simply wants "the best" students, they just disagree about the definition of "best", and so there's (almost) never an issue.

At 11, there will be noticeable differences between children. And those, plus, I assume, magic (the Hat can look into your head, after all), should be enough to make a call.

Or, at least that is how I always looked at this issue.
