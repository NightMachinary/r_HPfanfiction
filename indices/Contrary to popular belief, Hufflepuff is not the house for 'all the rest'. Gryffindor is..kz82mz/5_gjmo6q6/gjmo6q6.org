I agree that Gryffindor students are probably insecure and want to be brave (ie. secure). However, I think Hufflepuff would be the "all the rest" house if there even is one!

I don't get why Gryffindor would be the "all the rest." Sure, most kids want to "be brave," but the popular belief is that Puffs are leftovers. Popular belief is very influential, especially to children.

Not wanting to be a bandwagon is not original, so your assertion has merit. But, Hufflepuff is vanilla. They like loyalty. Bland. I doubt that many kids want to go to Hufflepuff. If they believe they should go to Hufflepuff, and it's not because of familial loyalty, they do so because they heard the stereotype. Surely, even muggleborns would have heard others talk about houses.

For those who don't agree with the idea that the hat just places students into whatever house they tell themselves they should be in, here ya go:

I don't believe that a quarter of 11 year olds are "wise" and "smart" or "ambitious" and "cunning".

For Slytherins, just think of the whole "Heir Potter-Black-Greengrass, do you want to join our families in an alliance (and pretend our family heads actually value our words)"? Remember all the cringey shit you did as a kid? Yeah, we weren't smooth.

Regarding Ravenclaw, there are geniuses, but they are anomalies. Unless Hogwarts takes only the brightest, either the average wizard and witch is just smarter than the average muggle or how fanon treats the "smart" thing is blown out of the waters.

Yes, kids adapt to whatever is expected of them. Think of Snape. Sure, he being abused by his muggle father had a lot to do with it, but the environment was just /toxic/. I do understand that by the time they are 17, they will be molded into their house's stereotypes and model their friends, most of whom are probably housemates. Interesting study, btw, is how we can identify people's names with a decent amount of accuracy. My point still stands bc I am talking about 11 year olds, not 17 year olds whose senses of identity are tied to a particular group for 7 years of their adolescence.

The hat could be sorting students into the house they will grow best in, but why the hell would it sort kids into Slytherin? I am a Snape-fan, and I have to admit that the annoying Gryffindors are still "the good guys" compared to Slytherins! Before anyone says the hat doesn't know current events, iirc, it does...
