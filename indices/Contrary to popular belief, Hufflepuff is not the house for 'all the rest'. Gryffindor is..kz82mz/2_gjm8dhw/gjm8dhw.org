I like this ðŸ˜Š.

I personally run with the cannon that you have to ask the Sorting Hat to be put into Gryffindor. Only people who are brave enough to ask for what they want, to properly chose their place rather than being forced into it by someone else get sorted to Gryffindor.

Hufflepuff and Gryffindor for me are quite similar? Loyal, honest, hardworking? The only difference is that Gryffindors are so wrecklessly dumb.

Dumb enough to make demands of a thousand year old hat.
