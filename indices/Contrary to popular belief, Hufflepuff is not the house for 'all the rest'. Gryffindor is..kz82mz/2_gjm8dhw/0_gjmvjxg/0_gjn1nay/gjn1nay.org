They are 11 years old. If you 11 and you are arguing against a sentient, anciently, enchanted hat that is doing literally the only job it was designed to then you are not right, you are a moron. A brave bloody moron.

That's mansplaining (hatsplaining? Kidsplaining?)

Just because you are brave, doesn't mean you are right.
