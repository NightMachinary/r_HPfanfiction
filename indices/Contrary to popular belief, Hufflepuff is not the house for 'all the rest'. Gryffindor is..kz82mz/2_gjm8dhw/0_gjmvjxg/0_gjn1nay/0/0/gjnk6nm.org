Ah, but that doesn't mean it's the /right/ thing to do. That's my point.

It's brave as shit. To ask for what you want. Especially to ask for something when the whole point of 'The Sorting' is to 'Be Sorted' not to 'Chose your House'.

The hat is designed to choose what is best for you based on your traits. That's it's whole thing. It's been doing it for a thousand years. Why do you, an 11 year old child, think you're better than it? You're 11, 11 year olds have no idea who they are, or who they're going to be. 100% I'm handing a decision as meaningless as my class group to a magical object who's sole purpose is to pick the classes.

Was it right, that Sirius was a Gryffindor when it probably got him disowned from his family and estranged from his brother? Was it right that Peter was a Gryffindor? When he was the slyest, cunningest double agent in the whole book that he was able to fool the entire order and his 3 best friends? Hermione is teased for being bookish, why isn't she in Ravenclaw she would have suited it better?

This is why I think Gryffindors need to actively chose their house rather than being sorted. Because Gryffindors are wreckless. The act without thinking of the consiquences. They do what they think is right, even when it's wrong.

They are the type of people who would be dumb enough to think they know better than a sentient hat age 11. Who would be brave enough to try. They don't think of the consiquences that choice might be, and it will either benefit them or it won't.

The sorting hat respect their choices. It sorts them because they chose it and having that wreckless idealism is what Gryffindor aims to promote.
