For any given definition of "right" ...?

"What is right" is as much (or even more so) one part of what gets you sorted as anything else. Unsurprisingly, at the latest by the time they leave Hogwarts, there will be a /huge/ disagreement over "what is right".

But that aside, I don't think Hufflepuff and Gryffindor are very much alike. Stereotyping to the extreme, loyal and hardworking (in that sense, selflessness -- already visible in Hufflepuff herself, when she decided to teach "all the rest") are traits that are valued in Hufflepuff House, while Gryffindors are stereotypical heroes -- vain, in search of glory, unafraid in the face of danger, not /particularly/ loyal (especially if it collides with any of their other values), brash, dedicated to their cause.

For instance, I could see Barty Crouch Sr. as a Gryffindor. He was a zealot, and as soon as his /own son/ turned out to be "on the other side", he literally threw him into prison with his own hands. This kind of conditional loyalty we also see glimpses of with Sirius and Remus, who don't hesitate to kill Peter once it turns out he betrayed them. Loyalty doesn't mean standing with someone when it's convenient. The awful end or dark side of loyalty is following someone wherever they may go, at the expense of one's own self. I don't think Gryffindor has too much of that.

But yeah, it's a nice idea that asking the Hat to put you in Gryffindor increases your chances to go there. Just, in the end, such an action is only the expression of a disposition you already have -- and that the Hat would see, regardless of what you did, no?
