I think that both the Marauders and the Weasleys were prone to getting in trouble for being where they're not supposed be. Hagrid mentions having to chase them away from the Forbidden Forest and there are a few mentions of them knowing the castle better than anyone else. I took that as they snuck out after curfew to go exploring.

You're right though that for some reason fanfiction writers take this to another level of them pulling elaborate pranks all the time. Although the Weasleys did develop a lot of products that could constitute as pulling pranks (ie trick wants, canary creams, etc), I think you're right that there wasn't much mention of any pranks in the first few books.

It is mentioned that Sirius tricked Snape into seeing Lupin transformed in the Shrieking Shack, "for a laugh" so I think some people have interpreted that as he did other things at others' expense because he thought it would be funny.
