there was a thread about this in the past that listed some of their actions: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7p83zy/why_do_people_assume_the_weasley_twins_are/]]

they were also born on april fool's. in a series with werewolf remus lupin, snake lady nagini, herbology professor sprout, etc., i think that's suggestive

i think people extend that to james and sirius mostly because they're compared to the twins
