Fanfic writers write super elaborate pranks because they're absolutely ridiculous. They've convinced themselves that Fred and George are some kind of pranking duo even though the number of pranks done by the Weasley twins can be counted on one hand with fingers to spare. It's the same thing with the Marauders.

They charm snowballs to hit Quirrel in the back of his head during Christmas, they spell Percy's Head Boy badge to say Bighead Boy (which is actually funny), they give ton-tongue toffee to Dudley.

The swamp thing against Umbridge is more of a big fuck you to her insane educational decrees rather than anything else. It doesn't read like any of the ridiculous pranks that ff authors come up with anyway.

Fred and George (and the Marauders) have a penchant to cause trouble. But ff authors, for some random reason, have collectively decided to associate causing trouble solely with pranking. Getting into physical, verbal, or magical fights with other students, talking back to teachers, breaking curfew, being in areas that are out-of-bounds, skiving off classes, sneaking off to Hogsmeade, getting drunk or providing alcohol (or drugs and potions if you want to go that way) to other underage students - all this comes under causing trouble. None of it can ever be called pranking, not by anyone sane anyway.
