Part of this is the genre. In British boarding school fiction, like Enid Blyton, pranks are an integral part of school life, with certain characters being the most active. For example, Bobby in the St Clare's books would play at least one prank per book, normally small juvenile things such as replacing chalk with identical plastic versions that don't write or stink bombs.

When I read the HP books I related the Weasley twins to these characters and extrapolated from their personalities and the pranks that ARE mentioned that they were doing more that Harry didn't see as he wasn't in class with them. Generally, pranks are played only in class because there is a captive audience, it disrupts boring learning, and the target can be the teacher who is seen as fair game. This is where many fanfiction authors fall down - if a prank is played on fellow student not in a position of power (Percy was a prefect, Montague was trying to take house points) then its bullying.

This is why a lot of people see them as pranksters - because you're supposed to think that.
