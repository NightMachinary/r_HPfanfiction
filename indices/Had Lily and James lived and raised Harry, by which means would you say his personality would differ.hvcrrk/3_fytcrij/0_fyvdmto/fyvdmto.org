Why do you look at the Marauders as pranksters, because i always felt that James was more like Harry than the Weasley twins, eg that he ignored curfew, was generally kind shown when he accepted Lupin for who he was and became an animagus with his friends to help him have an easier time. The map was created to be able to join lupin during the monthly encounters where they explored the entire castle to map it down.
