I think he would have maintained his sense of adventure, but not tried to solve things on his own so much (or at least not until his later teens, perhaps upon feeling left out from the order). We're told James matured in his later years at Hogwarts. While Sirius may have encouraged some mischievous ways I think both Lily and James would have kerb pranks of the likes pulled by the marauders. Canon Harry was funny, so I imagine that this one might have enjoyed being funny.

Whether or not Harry was better socialised and trusting would probably have a lot to do with when the war ended. When Voldemort attacked the Potters, nobody knew who to trust. So, he may simply have trusted people he already knew rather than people he met.

I like to think it finished early enough for him to make friends with Ron, Neville and the children of other order members. This would make him more friendly and knowledgeable about who was around him, though I think his close friends would likely have still been small in number.

That said, I imagine that it would take Sirus (who needs to mature) and Remus (who feels unworthy) a few more years to find someone, perhaps having a few relationships lasting a couple of years or so before finding The One. Then, enough time to want to have a baby.

I think that his kinder traits would have stayed with him, encouraged by Lily and that his temper would have been more even due to indirectly learning positive coping skills.

Nevertheless, I think he would still struggle and felt weighed down by the prophecy and potentially having lost people he knew during the war, depending on how late/if it paused. So, more rounded but not a wholly different person.

I like to think he would have relied on his family more, but potentially could still have felt somewhat guilted into Albus' spiel about being the only person to solve it ('he won't stop hunting you down'). Lily and James would put up more of a fight than the canon order did.
