Okay so James... That guy is as N as the Weasley twins. His prankster mind keeps him thinking on new ways to improve what he has already done before. Not looking at the current thrills but already a step ahead, "how can I make this more epic?" "Evans is rejecting me now, yes, but she'll come around." James is all about the future.

New the J... compare to Sirius who is ENTP, as the twins... James is the leader.... he is the one with the plan. He is the "Lets all turn into animagus and help moony".

Going deeper about functions lets compare James to HBP Ginny (a real ESTP)

ENTJS main function is ET (voicing his thoughts and plans of epic pranks out loud, voicing how cool he is, always letting the people know).... ESTP is ES (which leads to the athletic type inherent to Ginny's personality)

Second function would be IN for James, which again planning for pranks. ESTP's is IT, so that's where Ginny's toughness and direct manners come.

Third is ES for ENTJs which is the physical Quidditch part of James. EF for ESTPS (RRemember Ginny voicing her feelings out loud, especially to Ron? James is open with his thought but Ginny is open with her feelings)

fourth is IF for ENTJs, IN for ESTPs... less developed functions.
