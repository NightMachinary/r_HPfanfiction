Let's talk about MBTI... it has its flaws but is what I have as of personality types.

So Lily is a ESFJ... and James is probably a ENTJ... canon Harry is a ISFP

Here is when we have a big chat about what traits are learned and which ones are inherent to one's self. That could go almost anywhere... however, having Lily for a mother I would imagine that Harry would still keep his F... don't see James turning that one. And S is probably there, as that could be a bit less about environment and a bit more about who Harry is as a person (he would still be good at Quidditch I suppose, and process his world similarly...)

​

So xSFx

​

The thing is that, as must of the fandom thinks, I agree that the I is the more likely to switch to E. With the confidence of a family and having Lily, James and (maybe) Sirius around would mean there is a big chance this Harry is an extrovert.

ESFx

Now both of his parents are J, but Sirius would be P and big influence. Besides, maybe Harry does has some tendency to P by himself.... IMO it could be either one of those...

​

Now MBTI has problems, but helps as a sort of a guide, after all 2 characters with the same type can be very differently. ESFJ, would mean that Harry is more similar to Percy Jackson than Lavender Brown (Both ESFJs)... Now Ron is an ESFP, but I don't think ESFP harry would be as funny or careless with words as Ron... I imagine Harry as more of a Disney-Hercules ESFP than a Ron ESFP.

But hey those are just some patterns, people can be very different, even within a MBTI type.
