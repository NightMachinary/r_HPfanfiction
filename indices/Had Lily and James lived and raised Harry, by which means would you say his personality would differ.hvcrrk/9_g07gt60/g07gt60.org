I think Harry would be pampered and quite rich. He would be a bit spoiled but good hearted. Like a nicer version of Dude or Draco. I say that because Lily is someone who tends to close her eyes to the flaws of the people she loves and I she is basically as a nicer and prettier version of Petunia. She would be quite permissive to her children and they can do "no wrong". She would also be overprotective towards strangers, and a bit of an overbearing mother in law.

I also imagine Harry would at least have one more sibling. Harry would be the cool overprotective older brother. And for that to happen Harry would grow up in the middle of the war, or Voldemort would be defeated in the day he invaded their home.

Harry and Dude would still hate each other in family gatherings "ugh that annoying cousin" and I'm not sure if they would ever make amends or get close because Dude wouldn't be raised with Harry and probably wouldn't question their different treatments. Even if Dude gets better he probably wouldn't reach Harry. Petunia would ressent that Lily got more than one children.

Harry would also be close to Sirius since childhood. James would be proud that Harry got into sports and he and Sirius would stirr Harry's mischievous side. This would cause some bickering with Lily that wants a well behaved, composed child. Harry and James would agree with her, but would keep with their mischievous stuff behind her back, until she discovers it again and the same thing repeats.
