There's a big gap between JKR's rhetoric and what she actually writes, when it comes to moral characterisation.

JKR's rhetoric is all about free will and choice. See, for example, Dumbledore in CoS where he says it's choice which matters. Or indeed that quote where she says that if Merope had chosen to love Tom, he would have turned out better.

What she actually writes, however, is completely different. Harry is just a fundamentally good person in a way that is divorced from his upbringing (Dursley environment would be extremely unlikely to give rise to a person of Harry's character) and his own actions (he tortures people but is still considered good). Tom, on the other hand, is depicted as essentially born evil and irredeemable. The characters' capacity to choose is an illusion, because the choices they make will always reflect their fundamental, pre-determined natures.

There's an old article, only accessible via the WayBack Machine, which explains this better than I can:

Harry Potter and the Doctrine of the Calvinists
