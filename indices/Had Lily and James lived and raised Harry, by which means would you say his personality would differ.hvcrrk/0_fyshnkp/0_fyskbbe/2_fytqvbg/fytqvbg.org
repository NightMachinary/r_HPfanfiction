Maybe he has three brothers, the first Lily decides the name and goes with Tom since it's a pretty normal name. Then James gets to choose, and while trying to get a normal muggle name he ends up finding the seemingly perfect one on a DC comic, so perfect in fact that he just rushes up to register it without talking with anyone else, therefore the baby ends up named Riddle Potter. Then when the last is born Lily is still mad that James named one of their children Riddle and James is still mad that Lily won't admit that he is much better than her at this naming business, the result is that they can't agree with a name before the birth and then end up agreeing that each of their best friends get to choose a name and they will take a pice of each to combine in the name of the last child. Snape chooses Tricavolos, Sirius chooses Marcus, a coin toss later to decide the order and they take the newly named Marvolo Potter home.

And thus Harry becomes the Elder brother of Tom, Marvolo and Riddle. Dumbledore is slightly disturbed and Voldemort oddly touched.
