Yeah! I always thought he'd have a bigger family, maybe three other siblings? I like to think about names a lot. Harry seems pretty normal and for someone who isn't British, it really strikes me as a very traditional English name because we always stereotype them as Harry's. Names like Phoebe (or Poppy) and Alfred strike me as names Lily and James would use.
