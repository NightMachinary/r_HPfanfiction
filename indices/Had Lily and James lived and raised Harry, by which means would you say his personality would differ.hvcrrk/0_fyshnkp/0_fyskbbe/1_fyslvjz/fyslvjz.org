On my head I always pictured just one sibling. Lily would want Harry to have company, but she comes from a family of two, and even having one sibling was hard enough for her. I see no indications of she pursuing a particularly large family.

James is an only child, but he recognizes the value in relationships. Though I don't think he would like his family to be a closely held group. I see him more of the idea of having 2 kids, but very close to other kids their age... like hypothetical Sirius kids. Probably James would have pushed for a Harry-Neville friendship early on.
