My mental picture says they had two, but another part of me thinks that if the war ended maybe five years after canon, there could have been a second child before that time (making a family, not safe to go out and do things) and then a sort of baby boomer inspired 3rd. OR a 'our child has just gone away to Hogwarts, the house seems quiet and our friends are just starting to have babies' 3rd.
