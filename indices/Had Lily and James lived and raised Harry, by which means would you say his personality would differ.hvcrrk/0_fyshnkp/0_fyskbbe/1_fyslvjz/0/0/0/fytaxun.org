Yes, that's quite true. I always imagine 3-4 years between the two children in any case. I suppose them still being quite close in age, while still not being 'immediately into fidelius' age gap.

I think that after a few years under protection and being safe, it would have seemed more normal. So while they might have initially been really careful, they're not so much any more particularly as parents often feel broody once their older child isn't such a baby.

In my mind, I'm quite torn about Harry's conception. I think in canon it was suggested that people were setting up families quickly because of the war? I can understand marriage - James wants Lily to have his money and they're active members of a counter-terrorist group. But the baby?

On the other hand, I think that once people have had their first, they like to stick to their ideal age gaps as much as biology allows. Plus, the war was going on for most/all of the 1070s, so to an extent it could have seemed like life too them.
