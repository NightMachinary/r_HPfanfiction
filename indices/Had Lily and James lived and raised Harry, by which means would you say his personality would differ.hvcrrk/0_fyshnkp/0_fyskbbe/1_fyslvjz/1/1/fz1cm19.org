Alternatively maybe James coming from a pureblood family has superstitions about the number of children they have and pushes for either 1 (first number with positive value), 3 (most magically powerful number, the triangle -most stable form found in nature, the three forms of the triple goddess in Celtic religion, the three faces of Hecate -maiden, mother, crone), 7 (luckiest of numbers), 9 (3x3)... would even explain why we see some pureblood families with only a child while other has up to seven. Maybe it could be traditions upholder by each family, as in, Arthur Weasley is the seventh child and he then goes to have seven children while Malfoys didn't have more than a single child for a set number of generations.
