They were twenty, true, but that's still considered extremely young, most people don't have kids at twenty. They were nineteen when he was conceived. This just makes me all the more sad when you realise they died at twenty-one...

Edit: some looking around turned up the average age of parents when they had their first kid in 1979/1980. Apparently, it's 24, that's four years older than Lily and James were.
