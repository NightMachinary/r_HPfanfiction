Hm, I think Alfred is a bit old for a younger sibling of Harry's. I've double checked on using ONS data and Alfred drops in popularity from 11th in 1904, to 28th in the 1944. Then it doesn't appear at all in the top 100 for the rest of the centuary.

Pheobe is absolutely the sort of name that strikes me as being the right sort of age, probably because a relative was called it in the mid 90s (65th in 1996), but didn't really take off until post-2000 and particularly post-2010.

I find it all fascinating.
