Andrew is extremely off putting to me, never liked it. I like Edward --> Eddie/Teddy. I'm sorry I'm not on the trend side of things but the file isn't loading on mobile. Although, I can see Felix, maybe? I don't know about the popularity then. I agree about Poppy, it also has that cutesie vibe.

I love Lucas --> Luke. Adam is a lovely name, I can think of Jason along the same lines. It definitely has that same vibe as Harry. I agree about Sadie being too American, how about Emily/Emilia/Emma? Or maybe Audrey? An alternative to Flora could be Fiona. Maggie, Maisie, Josie (Josephine). Lucy is a nice name, but here's the thing with me: I cannot tolerate two family members who have names that have matching first letters, it makes me twitch for some reason, which is why Jason is also off-putting.

[[/r/namenerds][r/namenerds]] is like home, I never knew there were people who were as obsessed with names as myself.
