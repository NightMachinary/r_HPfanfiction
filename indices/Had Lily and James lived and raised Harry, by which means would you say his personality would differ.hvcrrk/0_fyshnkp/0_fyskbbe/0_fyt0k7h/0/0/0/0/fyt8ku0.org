/Andrew is extremely off putting to me, never liked it./

Aha, you should hear what I've called my dog. You'd hate it.

My MIL named all her children with all the same first and ending letter. Then, all their childhood nicknames also had a different but the same as each other end letter. I cannot even. The new round of nicknames is barely any better! I cannot even. My wife (who has the name initial as me) wanted to carry on if we had a girl, but we've put off children for now - hence the dog.

So, I agree but Lucy is alright for me because the end sound is different. Actually. No. The more I sound it out, the closer they seem.

Josie struggles from the name problem as Sadie, I think. Maggie I think is also too old. All the other names are great.

Emma is not a personal favourite of mine, but I don't think my favourites and Lily and James' would overlap. Unless, I suppose they don't actually favour shorter names and just chose a more modern version of Henry.

Yes, I think Jason a viable contender except for James. Only reason I didn't put it down is a particular Jason from childhood.
