My apologies to your dog. Andrew is a much better name than what /I/ called my pets. I hope Soso and Momo rest in peace.

Yikes, that lacks individuality and us extremely tacky. It's like naming your children, Olivia, Oliver, Olive, Olivier and Olivine.

When I suggested Josie and Maggie I was thinking along the lines of Little Women (Jo and Meg). So...Elizabeth nickname Beth actually seems a strong guarantee. Amelia nn Amy Potter.

Yeah, Lily and James seem to have that old fashioned, traditional style. As Petunia says, Harry is a nasty, common name if you ask her. Think along these lines, whatever Petunia wouldn't use, Lily and James would. Lily was actually not that popular a name in 1960, it didn't even reach the top 1000, although I don't know about variants of it. James has always been popular.

I hate when pretty names are rendered awful by people you know.
