I really like the name Andrew which turns out to be popular around the right time, but I can't see Lily and James going for it. I'm not a huge fan of Chris, but it feels like it could fit.

I think I would probably go for Adam or Luke - Luke has that sort of 'could have been Lucas, but we shortened it - like Harry'.

For girls, I agree - Poppy I think goes nicely because it's a flower name and it also has that sort of 'brightness after war related loses' feel. Also, it's just a nice name. If Lily wanted to buck the trend, I think I'd choose Lucy.

Sadie is probably a bit American for me - but Eloise is a lovely name. (The 1994 lists reads like my class register, tbh.) Nothing wrong with Flora, except that it reminds me of spreadables. Ruined, lol.

Haha, I've never seen [[/r/namenerds][r/namenerds]].
