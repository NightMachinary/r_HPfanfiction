A kinder, slightly less arrogant version of his father with an entirely different set of friends.

I've always had it in mind that Lily was a little spoiled as well, so he'd definitely be that. I actually don't see him growing up with a sibling. James and Lily were young. Of the parents we know, they're nearly a decade younger. So I can't see him with more than 2 siblings and none less than 8/9 years younger.
