There was an interesting post once about how while child Petunia may have called Lily a freak....Lily siding with Snape, the kid who nearly killed Petunia and who openly disdained her very existence was truly shitty (the flashback scene in DH where he goes "but she's a mug---"). Petunia was a little brat at that point, but she didn't seem to treat Lily as subhuman at that point when Snape clearly thought of Petunia as subhuman. Not to mention taking said kid who nearly killed her sister into her sister's bedroom and violating her privacy by reading Petunia's shit.

Basically..."siblings often talk shit to one another, it's not a shock that someone would react badly to first hearing about magic...especially when their first experience outside of their family is nearly being killed by it..." And instead of trying to help her, she goes "you're just a jealous loser" and keeps hanging out with the kid who thinks Petunia is dog shit.

Also, I have a sister, and we may talk shit about one another but god forbid I catch someone shit talking her...kind of like "hey, only I can call her a bitch." I'm pretty sure that's a common dynamic among siblings, and it doesn't seem to have carried over to Lily and Petunia.
