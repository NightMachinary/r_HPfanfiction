This isn't really analagous to having a parent who is a different ethnicity though.

With different ethnicities, the kids are part that ethnicity. Like a Filipino parent would have Filipino or biracial kids. With wizard/muggle genetics, there's no such thing as being "part wizard" or "part muggle". Muggleborn wizards are still fully wizards, just born from muggles. And they're still considered more than a muggle or even a squib born of wizarding parents. It's an all or nothing inheritance. Like people who are born male and identify as male don't go around saying they're half-woman just because their mom is a female.

In Snape's case, his father abused him horribly because he was born a wizard instead of a muggle/squib. He was a little kid. Petunia and Lily were also kids, though Petunia was older. Snape experienced Petunia throwing abusive language at him and Lily (like his father), so how was he supposed to think differently about her or other muggles at that point? Sure Lily should have probably sided with her sister, but you can't hold children to adult standards of behavior.

I'm more miffed with Petunia for the decade of horrific abuse she put Harry through as a grown woman, simply because he was born a wizard and had the misfortune of being orphaned. A lot of that she would have been straight up jailed for if the authorities found out.
