Oh, I fully agree that Petunia is truly terrible as an adult & should be locked up. I still disagree that Snape's shitty childhood justifies his obvs. very early anti-muggle stance (esp. because JK makes clear KKK/Nazi parallels with the Death Eaters and anti-muggles sentiment), although I get your point at how a child might become that way just like child Lily probably doesn't act as a teenager/adult would in siding with their sister. Granted, teenage Snape who is exposed to muggleborns & Lily's muggle parents should have known better. Harry grows up in even shittier circumstances and doesn't go all "Muggles are eViL."
