He was shown crying and cowering when his father was shouting at his mother, once in book five.

  Rowling said later in interviews that his father used to *whip him* and was extremely resentful of both him and Eileen because of their magic.

Yikes, I'm not ready to believe something this dark without a source for it, so I'll withhold believing such a twisted thing until I have proof, can't stomach whipping. Source please?

Merope did eventually leave, but not until after her father and brother were imprisoned, so I'll give you that. I'll say this though, as someone extremely close to somebody who went through domestic violence, I can understand why she didn't leave for around two decades until now, but Eileen had magic, which not a single person here can claim to have. In the case of my friend, I think magic would've sold 90% of her problems. Also, the difference between Merope and Eileen is the former was born into an abusive environment, and the latter actually chose to marry him and even stay. The first signs and she can very well have used her wand to make her muggle husband cower. I'm not blaming Eileen, I guess like McGonagall's mother, she had hope, didn't she? No excuse for neglecting her child though, unlike Minerva, Snape had a crap childhood.
