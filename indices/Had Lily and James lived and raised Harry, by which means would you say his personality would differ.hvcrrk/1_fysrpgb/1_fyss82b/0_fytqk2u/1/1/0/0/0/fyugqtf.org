He's shown cowering and crying a lot while his mother is being brutalized in his memories. Rowling said later in interviews that his father used to whip him and was extremely resentful of both him and Eileen because of their magic.

As to why Eileen didn't leave, domestic violence is pretty complex and there are lots of women who don't leave even though it looks like it should be easy to people from the outside looking in. Her and her son's lives would have been a lot better if she had, but you could ask the same thing about why Meriope Gaunt took so long to leave the Gaunt household where she was abused so badly by her dad and brother.

It's worth noting that abusers rarely start out beating on their significant others. It tends to build up gradually to that with a grooming process that involves isolating them and tearing down their self worth so they feel responsible for the change in the abuser's behavior toward them, and that they deserve it.
