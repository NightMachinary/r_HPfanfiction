When in the text was it mentioned Tobias abused Snape himself, whether physically or otherwise. Haven't read the books in a while, can't remember the quote. He was a neglected child, which is never okay, but I don't think he was outright abused. The only one we seem to get a glimpse of bearing the brunt of that, is Eileen herself. And if you ask me, she should have never married him or had a child if he was going to be such a jerk about it. Also, isn't Eileen a witch? Couldn't she just like...leave very easily?
