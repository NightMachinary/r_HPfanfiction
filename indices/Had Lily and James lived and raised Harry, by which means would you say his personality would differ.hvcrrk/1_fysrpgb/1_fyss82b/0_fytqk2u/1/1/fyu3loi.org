Eh, having an abusive Latino parent or stepparent doesn't justify being racist towards Latinos even if one is a kid. And that's pretty much the real life counterpart to the fictional character's treatment of muggles.I do think that's the difference...between thinking something is "freaky/weird" and thinking of someone as "lesser than human (just a mug-)." But I get your point that is was accidental magic...even then, if your friend accidentally almost kills your sister and shows little remorse it's pretty shitty to keep hanging with them even if it was an accident.
