If you're going to excuse child-Petunia for being a butt to Lily, keep in mind that Snape was also a young child at the time and it was accidental magic. He wasn't trying to injure her. Plus he'd spent most of his childhood being whipped and neglected by the one muggle who should have cared for him so it shouldn't have been surprising he wouldn't think much of them at that point in his life.
