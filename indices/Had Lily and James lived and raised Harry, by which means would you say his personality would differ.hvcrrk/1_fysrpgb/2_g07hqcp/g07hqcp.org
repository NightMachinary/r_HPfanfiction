Wow exactly what I thought. James was defenitly spoiled, I think Lily was too, being the favourite daughter. She was basically a nicer version of Petunia. She wasn't a bully, but could defenitely be shallow, overbearing and bratty sometimes. And the people she loved could do no wrong : aka how she turned a blind eye to Snape, Petunia and later James flaws. The same would be for Harry.

I think Harry would be a nicer version of Dude, regarding personality. Or a slightly nicer version of his father, as you said. I imagine Harry having another sibling exactly because they were young when Harry was born. A way more young sibling though, 6-10 years of difference.

I like to think that Harry would eventually became close to Hermione and Rony and would still marry Ginny, but in different circumstances and a way rockier start. Hermione and Rony would defenitly dislike Harry, and they would became friends in the later years after a lot of time sharing the same classes. Ginny relationship would be the basically same but with a "random girl in love with popular girl that don't know she exists" cliche undertone.
