One alternate Harry raised by James and Lily that I really like is the one from Imprisoned Realm linkffn(2705927).

He's...complicated, due to the environment he grows up in - he has a more loving home, true, but he also grows up in the midst of a worsening war due to the fact that Voldemort never left. He doesn't escape the ramifications of the prophecy, which has some serious consequences for his personal development and the turns the story takes.

I won't go into more spoiler-y details, but I really like how the author handled his characterization and the effects that a changed upbringing had on him. He retains almost all of canon!Harry's good qualities: very loving and protective of his family and friends, kind, smart, athletic, a natural leader, with a particular knack for improvisation and on-the-spot solutions. There's also some noticeable differences, however. Without the Dursleys holding him back, and with the awareness that he's essentially the Chosen One and the immense pressure that brings with, he's more academically brilliant than canon!Harry, but also develops something of a subtle mean streak (that due to spoilery reasons gets worse later). He has a slight ego and tends to overestimate himself, but not to the extent that it would make him a jerk like a teenaged James or Malfoy. Both James and Lily would've been watching out for that, and also he has more serious problems occupying his attention, namely the war. Instead, his precociousness and tendency to keep things to himself (a trait that canon!Harry also exhibits) lands him in some truly awful situations that only he can get himself out of, with considerable cost. Overall, he's a fascinating character study that's still recognizably Harry, but with a few significant differences that drives the plot of the tale.

Another alternate Harry that I really like is the one in Brightest Witch of Her Age linkao3(9344273). It's a story centered on a GWL!Hermione, but it puts a fair bit of focus on a different Potter family too.

In it, Lily dies, and Harry is raised by James and Remus. The author is brilliant in that she's managed to portray a different Harry, as a side character, within the limited space of the story, astoundingly successfully. It's in that sweet spot of "this is still recognizably Harry, with the same fundamental personality, but also has enough differences that can be tracked to the environment he grows up in" that I really love. It's a very unique characterization that you'll have to read to understand the charm of: he's easy-going, insanely funny, humble, loyal, and perceptive (which canon!Harry actually is, when he's not stressed out of his mind). He doesn't always need to be the center of attention (like old James), but he's always watching out for the people around him and ready to take things over if need be. You can just /feel/ that he's covering a lot of things with his easy-going facade and sense of humour. When you read to the end you realize that everything about him has to do with the fact that he grew up with two war-weary, grieving adults, and he ends up taking on part of their emotional burden and other, smaller burdens early on, in as unobtrusive a way as possible so as to give them space, and that's why he's the way he is: watchful, compassionate, always dependable at moments of crisis.

One memorable quote (of which this fic has many): /"His father taught him how to fly, and he tried to learn how to smile--wide, wild--from how his mother did in photographs. "/

Essentially, I think there are some things about Harry that won't change no matter how he grows up: he is a naturally compassionate person, which leads him to develop a moral compass that's sensitive to the injustices of the world, as well as making him perceptive when it comes to other people. He's intuitive, smart, and naturally charismatic. He deals well with crisis situations. It's also important, I think, to take into account other factors: if James and Lily survive, does it mean the war is still not over? In which case, with two parents who are active combatants, he would grow up quite different from a Harry who grows up in peaceful times. I think it's almost a given that a Harry raised by J&L&godfathers would be more sociable than canon Harry, likely more academically brilliant too. The hero-complex is less certain: if the prophecy is still in effect, the hero-complex would only get worse, not better, given that even if he doesn't grow up consciously knowing about it, he would almost certainly subconsciously react to the unspoken expectations of the adults around him, and try to take on more than he can deal with, alone.
