Yeah, the author has some great AU takes done in a similar style that you can check out, but personally this one is my favorite, mainly due to Harry's characterization which is really one of a kind. Done with such limited space, too, and it makes so much /sense/.

Definitely check out Imprisoned Realm, too. A fairly big chunk of the dramatic question there is pretty squarely centered on "what sort of person is alternate Harry, really", and the question of how he got there. It's a truly fascinating piece of character study, done with a fantastically original plot.
