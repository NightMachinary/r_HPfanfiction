I think he would be mostly the same, though definitely more confident and sociable. I think he would also put more effort at school because he would have someone to make proud of him. In canon, it was even mentioned how Petunia got angry with him whenever he did better at school than Dudley, but if he was raised by Lily and James, it wouldn't have happened.\\
I think he would have more friends, but also different friends - Neville comes to mind since Alice and Frank were in the Order.\\
He would definitely be more aware of what is happening in the magical world (obviously!), but at the same time, he would be pretty clueless when it comes to muggles.\\
I see him mostly as someone who is smart and cheeky and brave; someone who would be very protective of his family and friends - taking example from James. I think he would have siblings, probably close in age. It's my headcanon that James, although adored by his parents, was a little lonely as the only child, so he would probably want to have at least two children, and close in age.\\
But I don't think James and Lily would allow him to grow evil, arrogant, mean or anything like that.
