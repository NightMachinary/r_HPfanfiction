I read a story a while back (can't remember the title, sorry) with James and Lily living, so Harry grew up almost entirely in the magical world. His only knowledge of muggles came from duty visits to the Dursleys, who were as nasty as in canon, so Harry developed a dislike of muggles which he hid from most people but couldn't shake off. I think that could have happened to him. He'd also be generally happier and more self-confident, picking up a lot more of James's character traits.
