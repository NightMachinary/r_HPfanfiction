It's not due to living under it as a baby, but Harry in linkffn(A Black Comedy) /does/ have ridiculous skill with the Fidelius Charm and the fic is pretty cracky. A key mystery figure is nicknamed and referred to as "That Fucker," for instance.

(Obligatory warning that its humor has not aged gracefully at all and is liable to rub folks the wrong way. Despite that, the plot still holds up pretty well IMO.)
