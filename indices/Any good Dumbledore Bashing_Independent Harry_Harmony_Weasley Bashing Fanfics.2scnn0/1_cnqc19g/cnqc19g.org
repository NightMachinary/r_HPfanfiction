Bobmin's [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset Over Britain]] Is pretty fantastic, extrememly long. Believable in its bashing, but is also a great story. Again it is really long, each chapter being about 30 or so pages... and there is a sequel that is just as long. So you're in for a pretty epic ride.

Just fyi, you'll need to make a profile on that site for it
