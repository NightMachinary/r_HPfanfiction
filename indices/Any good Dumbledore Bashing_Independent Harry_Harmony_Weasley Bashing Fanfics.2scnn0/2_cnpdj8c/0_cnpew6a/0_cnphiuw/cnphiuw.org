Having the right to an opinion doesn't make it any less ridiculous. Bashing is a juvenile excuse for people so pathetic that they despise a fictional character to shit on them. It's impossible to have a good story contain bashing for the simple reason that bashing negates characterization and character building. You can like them all you want, I've read a few myself, but they can't be good.

EDIT: /Some/ comedy based stories can be an exception.
