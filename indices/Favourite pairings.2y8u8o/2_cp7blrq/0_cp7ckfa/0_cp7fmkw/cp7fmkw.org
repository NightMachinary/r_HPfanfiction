That's pretty much my headcanon, that she's not evil per se but simply mad. Perhaps originally due to an abusive marriage with Lestrange, a man she was forced by her family to wed (an event which in turn spurred Andromeda to work up the determination and courage to go against her family lest she suffer a similar fate)? I like it since it's quite plausible and allows for a fairly agreeable Bella, personality wise, in fics that focus on her.
