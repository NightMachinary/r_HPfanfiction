Earl of the North was a great fic for its time for like the first 15 chapters. Then Harry does nothing and it degenerates into kinda crap. That being said it was a pretty fresh take on Azkaban Harry and for its time period it was a great story. Now it may look cliche, but it kind of invented some cliches.
