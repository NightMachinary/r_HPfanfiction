Man, it's been ages since I found them. /Wanders off the rummage in the depths of his archive/

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1512196/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Black-Owl][Harry Potter and the Black Owl]]: Well hidden in the depths of time and no listed characters. The story is a bit simple, the 'twist' is basically obvious from the beginning and then the characters bumble about for ages but the I remember the Harry/Minerva stuff being OK.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7443406/1/Forever-is-a-Long-Time][Forever is a Long Time]]: Much easier to find as it's recent and listed as the pairing. It's actually OK.

- Here Where I Stand at the Turning of the Years: Sadly this one went away some years ago and I've never been able to rediscover it.
