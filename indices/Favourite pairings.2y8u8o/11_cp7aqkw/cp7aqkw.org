Mostly I like to see something different. If the pairing is different then there's a good chance to story does something different too.

Harry/Fleur Harry/Bellatrix Harry/Tonks Harry/Padma (or I /would/ like it if it bloody existed) Harry/Katie Harry/Susan Also I'll admit to being a sucker for Harry/Narcissa.

Oh, oh. Harry/Minerva McGonagall. There's like /two/ fics with a [[http://imgur.com/gW3WE][de-aged Minerva]] or time-travelling Harry that try this.
