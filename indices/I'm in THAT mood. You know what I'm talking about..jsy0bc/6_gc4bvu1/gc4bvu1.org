I know the feel. I'm not sure if I'm just bored of everything or I've gotten way more picky in my old age. I've resorted to looking through all 100k+ fanfics, regardless of pairing or tags, just to see if anything catches my eyes.

Anyway, here's one where Marge Dursley adopts Harry (don't worry, she's nice in this story. It's probably the only fanfic where I really like her). No pairings yet as far as I can tell other than Marge/OC. It's not complete, but it's part of a series that's still being regularly updated.
