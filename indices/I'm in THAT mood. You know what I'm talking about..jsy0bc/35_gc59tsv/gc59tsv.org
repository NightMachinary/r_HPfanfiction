[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We Are the Golden Trio]] It's not really that long and in some parts the writing made me cringe a little but I enjoyed the plot. Accidental Time Travel fic. The Golden trio gets sent back in time with baby rose. What are three 11 year olds to do? Well, turn the world into a better place.

I thought it was a fun read, and enjoyed their interactions with one another and the past.

From what I can remember this 2 part series is well written. Harry becomes haunted by the mistakes he made in the war and what the public wants/sees him as. He shuts almost everyone out and works on figuring out how to Time Travel so he can avoid all of this mess to begin with.

This series includes 2 fics, over 200k words, and from I remember it does justice the the characters.

Accidental time travel. Harry gets sent back in time after falling through the veil. He has his memory intact and is determined to change everything.

I don't recall the writing being amazing, but this story made me laugh.

This fic is by the wonderful person who brought us Debt of Time, definitely not as long. It is well written, and I enjoyed reading it. The pairing threw me off at first, but I actually grew to like them being together.

Hermione is sent back in time during a battle. She thought she was saving Harry but ended up saving the wrong Potter. Or did she? Lily dies as she did in canon, but baby Harry still has his father and Sirius is never sent to prison. Hermione is determined to fix the future by fixing the past.

I love time travel fics where Harry gets a normal life at the end.
