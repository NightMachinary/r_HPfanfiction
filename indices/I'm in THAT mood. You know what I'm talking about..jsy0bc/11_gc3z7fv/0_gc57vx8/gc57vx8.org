I anti-rec Ghost Of Privet Drive. It has awful Dumbledore bashing, it loves Death Eaters, everything goes way too smoothly for the main character, the writing is very windy (I skipped pages at a time), ... . Its only saving grace is that the self-insert is not that of a teen. Also beware that there is no Hogwarts in the first book.
