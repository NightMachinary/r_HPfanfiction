Time/dimension travel - Inquisitor Carrow series by littlewhitecat - during second year summer Harry gets sent to 41st (?) millenium, lives there for couple hundred years, becomes space marine inquisitor in the process (not as cringy as it may sound, author pulls it off /really/ well), and gets thrown back to Hogwarts. Book 1 starts with him arriving /back/ in Hogwarts. It gets very different very quick. Very enjoyable, in my opinion. Knowledge of wh40k lore is not required, important things are explained. First book - linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens)

Fix It - linkffn(Ghost Of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe) - random guy gets isekai'd into a ghost-like entity, tries to help Harry have a functioning family. I think it may have had a rocky start but otherwise good read.
