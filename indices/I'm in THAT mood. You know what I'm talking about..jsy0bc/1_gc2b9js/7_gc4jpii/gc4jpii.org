The OCs are interesting and the writing is technically sound but I just can't get over a few points. (I've only read about maybe 15 chapters)

1. Hogwarts as some backwards ass school. I can buy the existence of other magical schools in Britain but I just can't read fics where Hogwarts isn't the best magical school in Britain if not the world.
2. Hermione as a supremely powerful witch. I prefer fics where Hermione is smart but not once in a generation type deal. If in your fic magical knowledge = magical power then my headcanon is Hermione is a tier below people like Snape, James, Bellatrix etc. If magical power is separate from magical knowledge then my headcanon is Hermione is probably just a slightly above average witch (I don't remember her doing super powerful stuff in the books).
