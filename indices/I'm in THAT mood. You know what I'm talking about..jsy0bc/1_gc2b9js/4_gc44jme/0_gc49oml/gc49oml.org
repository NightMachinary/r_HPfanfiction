Thanks, and I'm delighted you like the OCs. I didn't originally intend to write so many, but they keep turning up on their own. For example, I had almost no notes on Lucinda (Ryan's mother) except that she was a witch who married a Muggle. But in her first scene (chapter 26) she arrived with a huge personality, and she still surprises me at every turn.
