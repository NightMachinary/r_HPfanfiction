I also recommend this. It's a lovely fic and even if some say the plot points are recycled, this fic is a good post-war story that actually conveys the kind of life Harry would lead, as opposed to the endless rehashing of Voldemort we've all read, or the variety of pairings of established canon/fanon characters.

The world building is very good and the OC character cast is by far the best out of all the fics I've read.
