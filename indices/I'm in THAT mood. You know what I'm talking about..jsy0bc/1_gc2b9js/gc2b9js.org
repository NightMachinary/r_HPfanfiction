It's not complete, but might I suggest my fic, Loose Cannon? It's a postwar story in which Harry deals with celebrity and growing up (categories are Humor and Hurt/Comfort). It's also hella long (750K+ words, with weekly updates) and highly bingeable.

My writing improves over time, but the first chapter should be enough for you to decide whether you like it.
