It's definitely not bad, it's just that nothing REALLY happens in the story and the plot points that do occur are cycled and recycled in a repeating pattern with little true payoff (Harry makes minor mistake, minor mistake works out as far in harry's favor as possible, Harry is awesome and perfect for a chapter or two, Harry has lots of sex and falls in love, Harry glows, Harry makes minor mistake... rinse and repeat).

It's a really enjoyable story and slice of life stuff is really hard to come by. Especially stuff that is well written like this is. It's just...hard to take in all at once because the story has felt the exact same throughout.
