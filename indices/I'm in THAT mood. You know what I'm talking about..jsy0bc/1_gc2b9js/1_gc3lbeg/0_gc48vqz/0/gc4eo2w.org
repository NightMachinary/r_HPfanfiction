that sounds great! I think I'll take it slow as I read it and maybe binge more quickly in 2021 so I can match the speed. I've read another fanfic where they released it serially but then halfway through gave up and I was reading weekly at that point. let's say I did not take that disappointment well at 15 years old haha
