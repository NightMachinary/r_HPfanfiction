Great question ... I've written 125 chapters so far and published 94. I don't work from an outline, so I can't predict how many more chapters remain. It's definitely more than half-done, though.

Hmm, that suggests it'll be maybe 180 chapters, and I'm publishing a chapter a week. Which means I'll finish posting in July 2022, unless I take pity on the readers and drop the entire thing once I'm finished.
