I started reading just because, the he killed off |hermione| and shit got... interesting. Dude dabbled with rituals, showing what happens when you fuck up. Harry doesn't trust Dumbledore, mostly thanks to Fantasy media and assumptions, when Dumbledore is a good-ish man trying his best with a shit situation. The world doesn't bend backwards for him(not until he gets strong enough to make it bend.)

All in all a fun read. It has a sequel, also complete. And a third one just started.

I'd suggest giving it a read, there are lemons but they are skippable with no plot lost(at first) this guy managed to fit plot in porn, its amazing
