Okay so Dobby wants to be Harry's elf rather than a free elf, which leads to many positive things within Harry's life. I don't want to spoil anything but I'll go by the tags available and say that Harry becomes a goblin friend. A bit cliched at points in the beginning with the world building but is overall so cute and greatly improves. Sirius is an important factor in Harry's life, and he gets a therapist. Ugh I loved it.
