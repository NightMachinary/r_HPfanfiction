Honestly, it's been long enough since I read the original fic (and I've both slept since then /and/ read a zillion other things in between) that I don't remember a ton about it. But it's one of those ones that's stuck with me, where pieces of it come floating back and make me want to re-read it (so I'm glad I was able to track it down, because I think I'm going to do just that, and then read the additional stories that have been added since).

I've always been a sucker for a get-another-chance fic, and I'm a true sucker for all things time travel. There was a lot of really unique and creative stuff in here, and I really appreciate that it's not just a rehashing of canon. I also appreciate that there's not much bashing to be had. Also, it's long, and easy to just get swept up into the story without having to stop any time soon, but also without it dragging on and getting dull and repetitive.
