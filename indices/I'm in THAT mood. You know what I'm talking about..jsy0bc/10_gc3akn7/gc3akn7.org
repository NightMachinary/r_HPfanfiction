I've been wracking my brain all morning to remember the name of this series of fics. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/481666][Harry Potter and the Road Not Taken]] may be something like what you're looking for. With all the stories in the series combined, it's definitely epic-length. I'd start with The Boy with Kaleidoscope Eyes.
