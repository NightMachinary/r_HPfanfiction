  A “stray” obliviate from a dissenting blood purist hits Hermione as she's debating on the Wizengamot floor for House Elf rights. As a result, she loses the last 5 years of her life. Her most recent memory is Fred coming back to life in the Battle of Hogwarts. She doesn't remember marrying or falling in love with her husband. In fact, when the healer asks her if she'd like to see her husband, she thought Ron would walk through the door. Instead, it was George. This story follows two, parallel timelines. In the first, Hermione struggles to find her place a world built by a different version of herself. In the other, George traverses before, during, and after the Wizarding War, finding himself more and more drawn to the most dedicated witch he knows. Too bad she's in love with his brother.
