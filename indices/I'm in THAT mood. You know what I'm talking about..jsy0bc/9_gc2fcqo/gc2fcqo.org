I am not sure about how much you will like it, but I liked A Marauder's Plan - linkffn(8045114). It has a few unique aspects that I haven't seen much elsewhere.

Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth has a MoD!Harry OP!Harry, but it doesn't have that much action. More character interaction and just Harry being a big brother - linkffn(10610076)
