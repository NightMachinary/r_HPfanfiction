Of course, story is one part of it. Especially the first one. I really liked how they turned Voldemort's plans to suit them. I also like the politics part of it. It highlighted how the politics part of the "war" is also important.

The second one I enjoyed the Harry Sirius and the Harry Regulus interactions. I don't why, but the idea of a big protective brother Harry really appeals to me.
