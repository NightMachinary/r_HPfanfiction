Does Snape count as a Death Eater?

Hmmm.

Well, I'm not sure if this fits your criteria, but I love it and I'll suggest it anyway. There's a fabulous plot twist that isn't revealed for a really long time.

One of my favorite series is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Linear Circle series]]. It is great for rabbit holes and world building.
