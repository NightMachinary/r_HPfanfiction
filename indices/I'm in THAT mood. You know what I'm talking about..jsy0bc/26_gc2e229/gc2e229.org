Just started listening to Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth. 89 chapters and over half a million words. Still being updated. Is rather silly but internally consistent with it's premise and the characters appear to act appropriately. Also the first 5 chapters didn't make me rage quit in disgust and author notes are short.

And because you asked me not too, Tom/Harry or Harry/Death Eater fics are shit, people should feel bad for writing them and us for reading them.They are a Twilight of our Harry Potter Fanfiction.
