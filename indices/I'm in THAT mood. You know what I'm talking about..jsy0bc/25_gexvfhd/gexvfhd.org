Harry potter and the Temporal beacon. Harry and Hermione continually return to their 3rd year picking up more and more knowledge as they go. Friendship with Ron wavers in and out depending on how he acts during each time loop but no bashing. Unfortunately it is not complete, at least not to my knowledge but it is very long and definitely binge worthy.
