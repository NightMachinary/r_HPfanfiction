I cant recommend The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie enough! Its an epic. 153 chapters. Complete. Includes time travel, no bashing, and no pairings with order members and death eaters. There's 2 versions. Fanfiction has a cleaner version without the most of the smut. AO3 has very detailed sex scenes and they are graphic!!! I would absolutely recommend both. I literally laughed and cried along with the characters. Its kind of a mystery at first but its all completely explained. The ending is perfection and so satisfying! I could talk about this fic forever! It follows the canon story very well but with a twist. I swear its better than the books themselves!
