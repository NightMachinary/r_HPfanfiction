I have quite a few! This is the one I'd recommend right off the bat if you want anymore let me know!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278]] Hermione Granger's Hogwarts grammar for delinquents on the run. (Drarry) now this one's bloody hilarious! It's about 90,000 words The characters are lovely, and I love the world building in general. Centers around the premise of what would happen if harry never went to Hogwarts and the gang finds him afterwords during their camping bit in the seventh book. (Also! This Author has a lot of other excellent stuff!) ((also also if someone could remind me how to use the bot for AO3 that would be great))
