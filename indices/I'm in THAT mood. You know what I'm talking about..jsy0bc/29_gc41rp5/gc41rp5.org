Not completed but updated last July. Survival is a Talent by ShanaStoryteller

Draco/Harry paring. No smut. Canon Divergence. Over 367,000 words in 23 chapters.

“In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone.

Their best isn't perfect”

I like it. It's really funny and sweet.
