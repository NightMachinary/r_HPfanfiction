#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Her big yellow eyes opened slowly. Those stupid two-legs had brought her and her young with them to this place so far away from their home. She wasn't pleased with them but would go along with it for now. There was a rustle in the bushes not to far away from her cage. "Well, well if it isn't a little Dovahkiin," she said. - Warning for Yaoi. If you don't like it then don't read.
