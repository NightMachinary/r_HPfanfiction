I suggest Benefits of Old Laws by ulktante. Sane Voldy, politic world building, and the best part is that it's complete with 109 chapters!

Alternatively if by dimension travel you mean crossovers, I recommend Viing Gut Zii Yah by ZeldinaDreamermoon. It's an Elder Scrolls xover where Harry spends a few years in Tamriel, and the rest of his life on Earth. AU from GoF.
