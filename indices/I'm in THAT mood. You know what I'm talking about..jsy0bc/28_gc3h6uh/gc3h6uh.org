[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11720199/1/Clean][Here's]] a trilogy for Dramione that's looong. It's absolutely incredible. I follow the author on twitter and she's one hell of a writer. Slow burn. There is time travel at the end of the third part. I cried real tears.

If you're into fics where the pairings are basically the same but Snape and Draco are civil with Harry, might I also suggest [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2801806/1/A-Time-and-Place-to-Grow][this saga]]? It's a four part series and holy Christ does this author have true command of the universe. There is spanking involved, but it doesn't really hold much sway in the true plot. In essence, after Sirius dies, Snape unwittingly becomes Harry's new father figure.
