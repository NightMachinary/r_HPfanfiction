  Too much smut for the sake of smut.
#+end_quote

I think this is only going to get worse as FFN has been cracking down on smut.

  Filtering is good, but lacks a "without" option (I want a story featuring Snape and Luna but unlike 99% of those on AO3, without Harry).
#+end_quote

I think the filtering is terrible, primarily because of the following points. They allow you to list as many characters as you want so people end up listing every character that appears in the story and half the fics in the database show up on every search.

I've considered contributing to AO3, but their codebase is kind of a mess and it isn't easy to get it set up for development, at least last time I checked. I'm working on a fic review/rating aggregator instead.
