The problem is that the "-Harry" part is for the word "Harry", rather than the character. Search for -Harry in all of Harry Potter stories, and logically, you are left with 0 search results, as all of them have the words "Harry Potter" in them (under the fandom listing).

There is no equivalent to FF.net's "without" filtering.
