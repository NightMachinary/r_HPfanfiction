Problems with AO3:

- Too much slash.
- Too much smut for the sake of smut.
- Lower amount of users causes a lot of uneven distribution of favorites/comments to quality.
- Filtering is good, but lacks a "without" option (I want a story featuring Snape and Luna but unlike 99% of those on AO3, without Harry).
- There is no division between minor character and major character in the DB. On FF.net, if I select a character, I know he'll appear prominently in the story. On AO3, you will get a thousand where that character doesn't even have dialogue (unless you select one of the following: Harry, Draco, Hermione). Loads of people will list every character that is even mentioned in the story, and that one will be weighted exactly like the main one.
- UI/UX is less sleek.
- Specifically for Harry Potter, there are /far/ fewer stories (FF.net has well over 10 times as much). Not nearly as bad for other fandoms though.

Overall though, FF.net not only has more HP stories than all other fandoms combined, it has more HP stories than all other fandoms and all other HP sites combined, has a few killer features, and doesn't suffer from over-tagging induced confusion.
