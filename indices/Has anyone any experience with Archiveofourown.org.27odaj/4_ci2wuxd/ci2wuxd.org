I'm signed up for it because I think it could be something special, but it needs to veer itself away from the erotica side and tone the hell down with it's tagging system (seriously - allow a small summary and main characters but include a "show more" to view the rest -.-)

I would love it if they had "competitions" or something whereby a prompt would be given (i.e. James Potter survives Voldemort survived but is a broken man raising Harry - which would include an untainted Sirius) - something like that would be a deal-maker for a lot of people, and as time goes on it would almost be a search function.

EDIT: I'm looking through it now and one tag is "It's not the creepy kind of underage" you seriousssss?

God I wish I had time to make my own fanfic site, perhaps in the next few years after I get my own place...
