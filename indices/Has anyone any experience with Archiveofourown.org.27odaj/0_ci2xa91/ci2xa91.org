Fanfiction.net has been around since forever, and has been around all throughout Harry Potters life cycle. Most Harry Potter fanfiction went up there first by default. AO3 only launched in 2009, 2 years after Deathly Hallows was released. The rate of new Harry Potter fics has dropped since the height of the book series popularity, and AO3 wasn't around to take advantage of the lull between books that provided the momentum for ff.nets collection to grow.

For newer stuff, AO3 has a slightly closer ratio of fics compared to ff.net, for example ff has 5.6k Frozen fics to AO3s 1.3k, and 24.1k Once Upon A Time fics to 10.3 on AO3. So for more recent fandoms, AO3 is a bit closer in terms of numbers, but ff.nets longer history as the primary Harry Potter archive gives it a massive advantage at 684k to 56.6k on AO3.

It's been said in other comments, but the tagging system can be as much a curse as it is a blessing. For example, ideally, searching for Remus Lupin would produce stories in which he plays a major role, at least, that's how I'd like tags to work, but in reality, you will often end up with a massive list of fics in which he has only a minor role, such as an appearance in one chapter. The ability to set unlimited tags results in over tagging, which can render them equally useless as not having them at all.
