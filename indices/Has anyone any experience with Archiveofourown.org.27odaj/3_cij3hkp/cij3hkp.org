AO3's probably my favorite fanfiction site since fandomination went under. It could use a lot of rehauling, but the fact that you can imbed pictures in stories and display the whole work at once (I don't have home internet so I use wifi to save chunks of stories to read later, so the ease of hitting "all chapters" then "select all" for copy pasting had been amazing) won me over.
