I'll be honest: I came looking for an awkward Ron/Hermione moment, but when I got to the part about Luna dressing up the chickens, I knew I'd found something even better. Now I'm going to go back and read the rest of your story to see what other delights I've been missing out on.

And I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who remembers /Between The Lions/.
