What I immediately think of is /GoF/ where Molly instantly believes the worst about Hermione re: Krum/Harry and treats Hermione rather poorly (even after her own children tell her that what Rita wrote was all lies) when it's none of her business at all who Hermione songs.

She'd believe Hermione to be a loose woman and Ron a naive boy led astray.
