Since there doesn't seem to be any practical magic involved, I'd guess Astronomy is entirely to do with magical theory; maybe the positions of the planets and stars have certain effects on magic, with some spells being more powerful under certain conditions. The reason with never see it is because, for the most part, it's not important for the minor level of magic they learn in school.
