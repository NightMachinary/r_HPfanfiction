I think it's a core class because JK didn't really think it through. Just look at the timetables o.O

A more serious possible answer: my head canon.

It's a science class, and more or less the same subject that we would take as a university course. Astronomic events don't effect witches and wizards, because that's divination and not science.

Then there's the relationship to Potions and Herbology... which is just like the relationship between various branches of science. Think chemistry vs biology (botany) vs physics or something similar. The relationship can be measured, and isn't open to interpretation... like divination is.

We learn about jupiter and its moons, and in history we learn about goblin rebellions and flame freezing charms. They're both non-magical subjects - they aren't interesting for kids to read about ad nauseum.
