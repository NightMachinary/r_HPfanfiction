Because there is no canonical connection between magic and the stars outside of werewolves and maybe the odd potion ingredient. The class also seems to be centered around memorisation and the learning/writing star charts. And the only screen time the subject gets is the OWL exam where McGonagall is injured.

I feel like you can do quite a lot with the subject, but not a lot of original concepts as there is little which hasn't already been done to death in other fandoms.
