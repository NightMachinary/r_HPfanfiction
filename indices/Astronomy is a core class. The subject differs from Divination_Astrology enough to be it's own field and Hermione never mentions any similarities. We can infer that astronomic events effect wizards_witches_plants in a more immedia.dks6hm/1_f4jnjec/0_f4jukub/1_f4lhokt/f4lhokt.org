Well, the /why/ is because you're inferring its use in canon. It's never explicitly stated, outside of the weird centaur stuff, that wizards use astronomy directly.

For instance, it could just be a relic of old-timey 'science'/education. It fits right in with how we imagine reclusive scholars from the medieval times doing - sitting in a tower, looking up through their self-made telescopes, etc. So Wizarding education might have once included it because it was part of a well rounded education back then, and just kept around.

Part of it too is JKR taking inspiration from 'normal' current courses to put in a magical context - potions is similar to chemistry, ancient runes (the canon ones) to learning greek letters, etc. Astronomy is something that a lot of people enjoy, and is included in a lot of science classes - while still feeling a bit exotic/different.

Can it be expanded upon, like how Ancient Runes becomes a much more interesting course on rune magic in the fandom, or arithmancy becomes useful for making spells instead of just math-based divination? Of course. Why don't people do it more? Well, likely because it's not seen to be as interesting. Astronomy based magic, in my mind, would center around rituals/natural magic increasing in potency with the cycle of stellar bodies. That could certainly be interesting - but, for instance, I'd find myself more drawn towards fleshing out runic magic or enchantments before astronomy.
