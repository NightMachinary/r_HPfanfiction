It's difficult to come up with something that doesn't feel like you've taken the idea from fandom X. And most authors are not interested because canonically, it is not an important subject but unlike Runes, it is not really possible to make it potent as it would only empower other branches of magic. Astronomy would be a buff, not the ability which wins the day.
