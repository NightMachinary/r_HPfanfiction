My best guess would be that the reason it appeared initially in the books is because, while it's a science, it still has something mystical about it. Observing celestial bodies has been around probably seen humankind came along, yet even after all this time we still know very little about what's out there. In addition, it had been used as a means to structure our time, when to undertake certain activities (sow, harvest, rest) and most importantly (for the magical world) to determine when unique cosmic events occur that may or may not be associated with magical events (in many cultures the midsummer is associated with very high magical activity, in many cultures the time of the Halloween is associated with an opening between world of the living and that of the dead, etc).
