2, 3\4, 1. When I'm reading fanfiction I don't want to be reading the same story as the books, if the thing you've changed doesn't change the story then skip to where it does and have you're changes as a prologue. There is always something to be said about knowing where a fanfiction is going to be, so that you can enjoy the different journey. Finally, the last two are often interchangeable.
