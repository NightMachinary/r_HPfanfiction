When I say "Total AU" I'm referring to the kind of stuff that's barely even recognizable as a HP fic. If the characters' personalities are different, the magic system is completely changed, and it's set in the 1400s, at that point I feel like it's not a fanfic, just an original story with a coat of Potter-colored paint slapped on.

Most fics I've enjoyed do rehash bits of canon here or there, though the better ones do it quickly as an aside or a brief description rather than making me read through something I've already read (so. many. /Sortings/...). Sometimes, if it doesn't put me off completely, I'll just skim such scenes; it comes back to bite me on occasion, with the author burying a plot-relevant detail in the midst of the canon regurgitation, but that's not going to stop me.
