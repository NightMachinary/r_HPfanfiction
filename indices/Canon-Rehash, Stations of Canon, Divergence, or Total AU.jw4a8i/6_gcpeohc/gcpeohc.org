I tend to prefer the single or double cannon divergance. My fic linkffn(13677583) has two points of divergance: a dark lord pre-grindlewald tried to make the elder wand his horcrux, (didn't work, it got him killed and Albus still used it for years) and my crossover ppl decided "I don't want to live on this planet anymore. Almost anywhere else is safer!" It's my first real fic, and I'm still improving my writing, but check it out if you think HP cannon doesn't have enough dragons in it.
