Yeah, I like the stations of canon for how they impact the character dynamics. And in fanfic I want to see how characters react differently and tell their own story.

Eg, I like the Goblet of Fire with the ball and favourite person. I also like the jealous friend after the champions are announced, but maybe there's a fourth friend who can sort the trio out, or maybe it's not Ron who's mad and the fight goes differently. How does this affect Moody's clues, what does this say about our Harry, can we trace anything back to the AU point?
