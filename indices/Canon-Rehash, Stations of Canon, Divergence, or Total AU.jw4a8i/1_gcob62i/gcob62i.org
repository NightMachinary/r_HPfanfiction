3/4, 2, 1.

My favorite stories are total AUs and divergences that acknowledge the unavoidable stations of canon in passing. Or at least try to breathe some new life in them. Unfortunately, even many so called divergences force stations of canon. The most annoying is the need to stick to canon friendships and dynamics.
