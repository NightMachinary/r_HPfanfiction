I like fics where something happens differently and Brigs even more changes to the story or canon compliant fics focused on characters that barely exist in the books or are dead before the books start.

Fics that rehash canon events to the dot are boring. There's nothing more disappointing than reading a story where for eg. James and Lily survive the Halloween and find it exactly the same as the series.

I also dislike total aus. I'm reading fanfiction because I want more stories in the universe I love. If I want to read something completely different then i won't look for it on FF.net or ao3.
