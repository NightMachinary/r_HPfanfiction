I love canon-rehashes! My favorite ones are the ones that keep nearly all of the plot points from canon, but explore certain parts in greater depth or from a different perspective. I've gotten myself engrossed in fics that retold the exact same plot points, but from say Justin Finch-Fletchley's or Viktor Krum's POV. I've read others that explored the Shell Cottage parts but this time focusing on Hermione's recovery. These are some of my most beloved fics.
