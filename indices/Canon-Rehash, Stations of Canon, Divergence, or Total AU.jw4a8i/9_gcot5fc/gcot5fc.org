I like point of divergence fics, but my favorite category might be one you didn't mention: filling in missing details from canon, with only the briefest mentions of the stations of canon, if absolutely necessary. How did Mad-Eye mentor Tonks? How did Andromeda and Ted get together? What was Remus doing between the wars? Stuff like that.
