I don't like AUs because the sole reason I am reading fanfics is because I liked the original story. If you are going to write something completely different, may as well write an original story for which I can even support you financially. I usually prefer to read canon-compliant stories but from different eras or significantly different perspectives than Harry's. I am OK if there is some canon divergence occurring towards the end and even perfectly fine if the epilogue is ignored. I'm also fine if a story explores what-if scenarios but if characters or the world diverge too much from the originals I am back to point one.
