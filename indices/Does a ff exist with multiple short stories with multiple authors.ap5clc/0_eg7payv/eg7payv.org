The closest I can think of is "The Bunny Pool" that was started by Genuka on AO3. A whole bunch of authors, including myself, post our bunnies in chapters. Some have exerts of what they thought it should go like. Anyone can claim a bunny, a bunny can be claimed by multiple people, and it not only has crossovers but straight up different genres.

Sorry for not finding exactly what you are looking for.
