Occlumency isn't even the only way to deal with Veritaserum: The subject could be Memory Charmed to recall events differently than they actually happened, maybe Confunded (not Conf*o*unded!) into believing a falsehood, or perhaps even Imperiused to say whatever their puppet-master wants them to say. I'm pretty sure there's also stated to be an antidote in book 6 (thus why Dumbledore can't just dose Slughorn to ask about the Horcruxes).
