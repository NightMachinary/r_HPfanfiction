it should also be noted, on top of what everyone else is saying, the term 'truth' is VERY subjective and changes depending on the individual.

If a person truly, and honestly, believe a lie, no matter how insane, he will tell the lie under influence of the truth potion. Basically if you gave an actual flat-earther a truth-potion, they would tell you the earth is flat.\\
That is another reason why it is unreliable as hell.
