I think that /pure/ Veritaserum can be fought with Occlumancy in a kinda U can use it to not answer at all. But headcanon says and I'm pretty sure I read that somewhere is mixed with a sufficient powerful babbling potion U would be compelled to say /something/ and then the Veritaserum kicks in and that /something/ is true.

An from what I remember out of canon it would make sense.
