The problem with Veritaserum is that it doesn't provide /objective/ truth. Someone dosed with Veritaserum can only ever provide the 'truth' as the they know it, perhaps even worse, it might only provide the truth as that person believes it.

Aside from that, the issue with things like Veritaserum and Pensieve viewing, is that in the magical world, seeing is not believing. With Transfiguration, Illusions, potions like the Polyjuice and even time-travel, the simple fact of the matter is that someone can't ever be certain that what they saw is what actually happened.

That's not to say that truth potions and memory viewing isn't useful, it's just that they aren't the slam dunk that they might appear to be.
