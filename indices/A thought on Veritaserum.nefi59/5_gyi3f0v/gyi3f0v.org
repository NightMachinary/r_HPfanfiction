As I responded to another user, occlumency is never linked in canon to veritaserum. There may be an explanation of why it's not more often used... Kruschev for example said that Stalin would often get people really drunk at his parties so that they'd start spilling their secrets so he used to drink a lot to develop a tolerance to alcohol. I think something along those lines may be an explanation. Furthermore BCJ was under Imperius for almost 12 years and then spent another pretending to be someone he was not so his mind could have been quite weakened.
