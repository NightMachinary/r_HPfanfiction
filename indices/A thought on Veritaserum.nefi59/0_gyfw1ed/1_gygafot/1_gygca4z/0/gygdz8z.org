I actually disagree slightly with this interpretation, as a grammatical/structural matter. Harry makes two separate alternative suggestions: Legilimency and Veritaserum. Dumbledore counteracts each separately and in order: Slughorn's Occlumency talent is the response to the suggestion of using Legilimency, and his carrying of an antidote is the response to the suggestion of using Veritaserum. I don't think you can legitimately infer from this that Occlumency is also relevant to Veritaserum.

Edited: what I mean to say is, I don't think you can legitimately infer from this that /Dumbledore is implying that/ Occlumency is also relevant to Veritaserum. His reference to Occlumency is a response to Harry's suggestion of using Legilimency.
