I don't think canon ever links Veritaserum to Occlumency. Occlumency is just the opposite of Legilimency. One helps you block your mind against intrusion while the other intrudes on your mind. Veritaserum is a potion that makes you spill secrets (whether through questioning or just like alcohol rendering you unable to keep your mouth shut is unclear) so completely different animal.
