Certainly. Lots of fantasy films can fit on the fringes. The live-action version of Road Dahl/'s *The BFG, for example, seems like it could totally be about the tiny pocket of barbaric full-blooded Giants we hear about in Giants. And *Bedknobs & Broomsticks/ can easily be about a "late-bloomer" Muggle-Born discovering her power via a spellbook which somehow slipped below the radar of the Statute of Secrecy.
