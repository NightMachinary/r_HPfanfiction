Following the Roald Dahl idea, Matilda is a Muggle-Born witch, Willy Wonka is another muggle-born who got in massive trouble with the Ministry and sagely keeps away in his factory, everything in The Witches, James and the Giant Peach is the result of Muggle Baiting, so on and so forth.

There's a reason Philosopher's Stone reads like a Roald Dahl book.
