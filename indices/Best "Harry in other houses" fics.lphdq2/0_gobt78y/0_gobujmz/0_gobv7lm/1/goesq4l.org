Golden Age by zeitgeistic is a great Hufflepuff Harry fic - it's not humorous; it's a great take on Hufflepuffs.

ETA: It occurs to me that it might not be exactly what you're looking for, because Harry doesn't start out as a Hufflepuff - he's resorted there in eighth year, after the war. (not a big spoiler, as it's the whole premise of the story, but just to err on the safe side).

I never get the bot to work but I'll try.\\
