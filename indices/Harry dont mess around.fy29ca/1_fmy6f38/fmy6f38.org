Of course while not exactly what you asked for you could try Atonement by old-crow where he uses a glock against the deatheaters.

Or you could try Dark Recompense by mathiasgranger where he uses bombs to handle the deatheaters

Down the Rabbit Hole by Mathiasgranger harry advocates for tough handling of captured deatheaters

linkffn(5750894)

Wizards Suck by Ares.Granger where harry works with the British government to take out the deatheaters

linkffn(9802351)

And then my personal favorite is Asymmetrical Warfare by KUCrow1997 where harry gives his opinion on Voldemort's name taboo
