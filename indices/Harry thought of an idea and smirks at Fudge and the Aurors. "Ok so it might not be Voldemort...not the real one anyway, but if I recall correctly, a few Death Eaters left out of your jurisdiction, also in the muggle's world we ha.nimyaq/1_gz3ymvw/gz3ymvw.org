Huh, that gives me an idea...it was technically Peter Pettigrew that killed Cedric on Voldemort's orders, but he's supposed to be dead too.\\
What if, faking their death was S.O.P. for Death Eaters fighting a losing battle? Peter pulled it off with an explosion, his animagus form and a willingness to lose a finger, but most other Death Eaters could do it with a polyjuiced victim and Imperius. Or some magical delayed explosives and a well-timed apparation. Or an inferius with transfigured features. Or a hungry dragon with...well, polyjuice and transfigured inferi cover a lot of ground already. Or they could use Horcruxes too.\\
 \\
Come the graveyard, a whole ton of Death Eaters show up, but when Harry escapes and tries to warn Fudge, he's sceptical because "You've named just about every Death Eater confirmed dead in the last war!"\\
"They were definitely alive! They were definitely in the graveyard!"\\
"You-Know-Who and a couple of dozen of his followers rose from the dead in a graveyard to fight again? Preposterous, you've been reading too much Muggle fiction!"\\
 \\
And then later, when Harry is proven right and Voldemort and several of his 'deceased' Death Eaters are proven alive, the wizarding world collectively shits itself because a) someone or some/thing/ apparently has the power to bring the dead back to life and b) they're with the bad guys.
