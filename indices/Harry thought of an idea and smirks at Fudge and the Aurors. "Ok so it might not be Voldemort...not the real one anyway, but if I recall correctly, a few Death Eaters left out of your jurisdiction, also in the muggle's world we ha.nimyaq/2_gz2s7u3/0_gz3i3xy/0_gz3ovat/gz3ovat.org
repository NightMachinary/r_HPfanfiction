The 'I'm not like other boys/girls' that desperately put down same sex girls/boys in front of crushes. Think of nice guys, who insist they'd treat a girl right and then turn around and insult her when she turns them down. And quirky girls who complain about other girls liking stereotypically girly things, as if not liking girly things makes them better.

They think they are unique, which wouldn't be a bad thing in itself if they didn't think they were better than their own sex and stopped insulting same sex people to prop themselves up.
