  Dursleys, knowing Harry would have to die, keeping info from him
#+end_quote

Most of the "shady" stuff Dumbledore did is result of JKR not being able to make her own plot excuses persuasive. Dursleys - living with them protects Harry. How exactly? JKR apparently didn't thinks it is important to explain, expecting audience to just go along with it. The same situation with her not bothering to explain how exactly Fidelius works. Situations isn't helped by the fact that a lot of fanfics are written by people who didn't even bother to read books, opting out to movies that dumbed things down in further. It is clear from the books that Dumbledore is intended as good and well-meaning person who is forced to solve several trolley problems along the way, but JKR implementation of this leaves too many edgelords with excuses for Dumbledore-bashing.
