I think the show don't tell principle really hurts her here - we see Harry in a multitude of locations over the summers, including the modern wizarding version of a heavily fortified fortress (Grimmauld Place), a standard wizarding home (The Burrow), and a hotel in the main shopping area of the wizarding world. Yet no one ever comes and attacks Harry while he is at those locations.
