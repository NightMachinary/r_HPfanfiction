It is implied that is not house that protective, but rather Harry's ability to ricochet Voldemort spells and burn him on touch is maintained up 17th birthday (instead of dispelling shortly after 1 November 1981) because Harry himself considers house of his mother's relative his home. However:

1. JKR never bother to clarify it, so my interpretation as good as any.
2. What was the point of keeping Harry at Dursleys after Voldemort's resurrection, since Voldemort's resurrection included vaccination from Harry's defense.
3. How exactly all of this protected Harry from Death Eaters?
