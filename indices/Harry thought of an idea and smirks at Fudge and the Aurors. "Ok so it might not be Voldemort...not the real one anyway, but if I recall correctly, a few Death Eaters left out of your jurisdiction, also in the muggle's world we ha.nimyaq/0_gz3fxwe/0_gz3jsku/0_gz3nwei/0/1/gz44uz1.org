For the most part, there's a couple legitimately awful things (Dursleys, knowing Harry would have to die, keeping info from him) and a lot of shady stuff, but he's been flanderized into a monster worse than Voldemort himself, not helped by a lot of fanfics going that route. In the same vein as Ron the Death Eater.
