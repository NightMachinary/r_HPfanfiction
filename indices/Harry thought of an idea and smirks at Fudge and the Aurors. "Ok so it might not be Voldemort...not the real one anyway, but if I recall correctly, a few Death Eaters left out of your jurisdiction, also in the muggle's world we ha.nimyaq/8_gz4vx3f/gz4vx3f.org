In book 2 of the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2030536][Harry of El]] series, Harry (in conjunction with Sirius and remotely aided by Remus) prevents Millicent Bagnold (who is /not/ a Thatcher-style war leader in this series) from trying to get Fudge kicked out of office by presenting the theory that Voldemort's apparent return (as part of a mass breakout from Azkaban) was actually faked by Peter Pettigrew and all that was really needed was an increase in the support for the DMLE.

The scene can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27758908/chapters/67950748#workskin][here]] and is continued in the next chapter. As a mark of his restored sanity (gained via soul-shredding the person his spirit possessed and absorbing the fragmented remains), Voldemort finds it mildly amusing that /Wormtail/ is publicly declared the main villain while also being reluctantly impressed by whoever came up with the idea.
