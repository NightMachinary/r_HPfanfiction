It's not done yet. So far I have reduced 9.7K words to 8K.

It's a second chap. First one (Ron POV) ended in Dumbledore and first year Harry appearing in the Burrow after some major discovery by the Weasleys. Then, as I was reading the chap2 draft (in Harry's POV), I realized I was almost 4K words in and Harry hadn't arrived at the Burrow yet. My older self thought that for some reason it would be a good idea to write almost 4K words of Dumbledore picking up Harry from the Dursleys.
