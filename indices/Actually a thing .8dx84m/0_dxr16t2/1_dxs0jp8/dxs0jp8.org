Well I think it is pretty opened, it could actually be that one of the maraudeur is pranking Sirius, encouraging him to do something by telling him it's a muggle thing.\\
I was more thinking in that direction myself when I had the idea of that little bit of dialogue, but I thougth I could leave it as opened as possible and see if someone had a fun and surprising idea.\\
Maybe I left it so opened as to be more confusing than interesting ?
