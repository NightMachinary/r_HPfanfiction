I really don't think that working with Hagrid every day would be boring or particularly bad! I mean, the expulsion part would suck but I think Hagrid would somehow make everything worthwhile. In a similar vein, I tried looking for any "Harry raised by Hagrid" stories a while back and couldn't find any :'(
