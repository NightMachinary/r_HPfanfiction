When I said thirty or so, I included Harry and Fred in the count. If Voldemort is to act in character, he would probably get pretty quickly bored of ruling Magical Britain and pursuit other greater things... I mean he pretty much does that in canon, leaving the Death Eaters to rule however they please while he is off on his quest for the Elder Wand. So I imagine him becoming more of a legendary godlike figure... maybe the magical equivalent of Big Brother. Everyone has to adore him but he doesn't really do much other than exist as a threat, while his Death Eaters make sure that his narrative is kept as law, as well as the fear of him.
