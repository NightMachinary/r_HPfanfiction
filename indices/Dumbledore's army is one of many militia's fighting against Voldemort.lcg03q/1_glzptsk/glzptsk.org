Isn't that what happens in DH?

In a realistic setting (well as realistic as you get in JK's world) thirty or so teenagers would stand no chance against Voldemort's forces (or probably not even Voldemort himself). Their greatest advantage was that they mostly resorted to school rebellion against three teachers that had to walk on eggshells around them since some of them were children of the sacred twenty-eight, as well as the Hogwarts defenses when Voldemort attacks the school.

So I'd rather imagine the story taking place sometime in the future when a bunch of witches and wizards had time to get an understanding of the regime's inner workings, had time to train under a powerful master or mistress and the Death Eaters have grown complacent. So basically the DA would be for the Death Eaters lead government what the Death Eaters were to the previous Ministry in the past.
