#+begin_quote
  Cast back in time, Harry isn't quite certain what to make of this period, nor the hell hole she's landed in. The one thing she is certain of is the fact that those bloody Shelbys are trouble, and for once she'd like to be left out of it. But the Devil doesn't play fair and neither does she. And if they want trouble, she'll give them literal hell.
