Pretty different fic, where different witches and wizards of Diagon Alley establishments make Harry his own personal island getaway hidden inside a locket, iirc. Think of Scamander's trunk in Fantastic Beasts and ramp it up a hundredfold, and you get this story.

I haven't seen anything like it, however, [[/u/MagicMistoffelees]]
