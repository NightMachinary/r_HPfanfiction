I think a lot of people have issues starting a fic after Hogwarts has started or in the middle of some changed status quo from the canon. It can get really annoying to have to sit through Harry's first three years at Hogwarts just to get to the important piece of information. When I read the first chapter of Prince of Slytherin I was so happy, and then I realized it was in media res.
