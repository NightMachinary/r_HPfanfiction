I think people start their fics too early, or don't bother ageing up their protagonists.

In my story, which begins after HBP, Harry is in a relationship with all three Black sisters, and we all know they are even older than his parents, so I made sure the relationship didn't start until Harry was 18, going 19.

I know it's unrealistic as is, but at least he's an adult, and not a fourteen year old boy.
