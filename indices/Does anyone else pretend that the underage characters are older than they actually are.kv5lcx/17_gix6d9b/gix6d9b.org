I don't read the kinds of fics you mention, but I do picture the students how they looked in the movies for the most part but with book details like Hermione's hair and teeth, Harry messy hair and eyes (when it's a mental close shot), or Ron's freckles and lankiness. Now, for PS and CoS it's not a problem because the actors were the actual age of their characters, but then it becomes complicated when you reach PoA and the later books because then suddenly they all aged two/three years in between. I'm uber bad at estimating people's age so it really doesn't help, but I developed some kind of trick in which I imagine them as they were in a movie closer to the canon age, so CoS for PoA, PoA for GoF, and so on and so forth.
