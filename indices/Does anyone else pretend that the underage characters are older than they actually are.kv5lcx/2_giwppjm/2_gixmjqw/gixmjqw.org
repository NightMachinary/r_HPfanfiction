  And they try to explain it away by saying harry wants what he has never had but this is often shown better by having harry push limits etc

Or other less overt childish things.

I know off a 14 years old that lingers by his 7 years old foster sister room, at bedtime, and just listen to the bedtime story the foster parent read, as if it was for him.

Basing my thinking of that, I guess we can have Harry trying to have childish things that he didn't have, but being way more subtle than "sitting on lap at 16".

Maybe, he picked up some magical toys in Diagon Alley, and found them fascinating, and plays with them....and no one tell him that they're actually for the 6-8 years old age range.

We could have Snape read the newspaper or some article about potion aloud, because something make him angry or annoys him in the piece, and Harry encouranging it with some questions or "can you repeat that, not sure I understood well", because maybe it isn't bedtime stories, but at least he is read to.

Older teens can and will try to recapture childhood they didn't have. But not exactly in the form they would have when they were actual children. And it can be sweet and all. But They have some self-awareness and they are very self-conscious. It's always more subtle than "let's just have him act like a 6 years old".
