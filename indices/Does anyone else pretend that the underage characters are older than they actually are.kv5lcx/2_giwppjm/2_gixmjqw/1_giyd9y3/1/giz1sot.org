As a not particularly sane individual, I'd have no problem sitting on someone else's lap in a public forum, except in my case it'd be for a gag or something, not because I didn't sit in mommy's lap enough as a child. My mom was in a wheelchair because of leg injuries so I literally COULDN'T sit on her lap without causing her pain, and by the time my aunt and uncle adopted me (because my mom was slowly losing the ability for self-care, let alone childcare) I was "too old" to sit in laps or be picked up. And the only people to seek out hugs in my childhood were all either wheelchair bound, really old, or both, so picking me up or dealing with a hyperactive brat in their lap just wasn't feasible. Even for Santa pictures I'm only sitting on Santa's lap in about 6 photos, and I'm in 26 of those things, given that it's literally the one time a year me and my cousins are ever in the same place for long enough to consider commemorative pictures viable.
