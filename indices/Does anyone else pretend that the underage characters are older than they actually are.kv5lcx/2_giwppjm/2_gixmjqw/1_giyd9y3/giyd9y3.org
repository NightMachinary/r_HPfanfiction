That's exactly where that stuff should be. I mean... Im cringeing so hard at the mental imagery of 16 year old Harry sitting on Snapes lap in the great hall, in front of /everyone/. That doesn't sound like something any sane person would want, regardless of childhood trauma. But in any of the scenarios that you just described, It's a bit subtler and sadder, more realistic. I'd definitely read a fic that tackled those issues like that.
