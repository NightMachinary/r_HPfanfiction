I also hate the opposite where older teens act like 5 year olds. Ive seen this in alot of snape adopts harry or severitus, where they will have 16 year old harry sitting in Snapes lap at dinner and i am like what? I stopped wanting to sit in my parents lap at 9. And they try to explain it away by saying harry wants what he has never had but this is often shown better by having harry push limits etc. They simply want the six year old fluff with the plot of 16 year old harrys drama and action like why its so cringey
