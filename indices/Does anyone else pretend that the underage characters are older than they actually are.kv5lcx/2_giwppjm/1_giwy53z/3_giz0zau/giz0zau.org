As a dude who has been stuck at 6'4" since 7th grade... people stopped picking me up before kindergarten, so I became the picker-upper. As I am now 26, I will still go and throw one of my 20 year old cousins over my shoulder and prance about just because I feel like it.

Everyone accuses me of being too touchy-feely, but they're all just cold and practically touch shy. I seriously don't remember the last time I saw anyone in my family hug each other. And that's not counting last year's reasons for avoiding contact.
