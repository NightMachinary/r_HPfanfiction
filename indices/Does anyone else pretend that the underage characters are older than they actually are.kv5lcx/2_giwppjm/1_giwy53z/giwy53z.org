  I stopped wanting to sit in my parents lap at 9.

My brother read a meme once that was something like 'one day your parents put you down and never picked you back up again' and my Dad was like 'oh yeah??' and picked him up. My brother was 6'6" and 250lbs+ at the time and my Dad completely threw his back out. His doctor scolded him and made him do physical therapy for six weeks.

Whenever I see stuff like Snape carrying Harry to bed to tuck him in, I always think of that and can't stop laughing. I know they have charms and spells but that's still what I picture in my head.
