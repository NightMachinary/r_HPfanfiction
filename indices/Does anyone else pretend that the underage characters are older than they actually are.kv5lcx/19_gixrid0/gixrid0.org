No, I just remember how randy I was at 14 and assume boarding school allows more opportunities than living at home. 13 years olds used to be married off and mothers... Why would it be hard to believe a society that clings to such outdated dress and social mores wouldn't also allow older/younger relationships that make modern folks feel squicky?
