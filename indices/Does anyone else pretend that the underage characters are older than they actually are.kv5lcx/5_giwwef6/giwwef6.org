I imagine I'm just seeing it all through a maturity filter. Like characters' witty repartee is actually, 'no you', level insults, but we see mature back-and-forths. When characters go have sex and they're too young, we see sex, but what actually happened is them holding hands or something equally innocuous.

Otherwise, I just throw up my hands and walk away, but that's when the author just isn't trying.
