Ok, when I'm reading Fics,

I've gotten a lot more picky with time. Generally I skip or speed read through years 1-2. It's usually the same things in a different presentation, so unless it's really good writing, I don't enter it too often.

I read from year 3 onwards.

Generally Fics - most with the heirs and whatnot, are extremely focused on politics and power play; it eases it when I try to imagine them as older and fortunately the "Date where you meet your soul mate" A.K.A Yule ball isn't until year 4, so I don't need to go through much romance at that point and you can ignore the weirdness.

When I write stories or fanfics -

I was in boarding school as a kid, all the way up till graduation, so the dynamics and how kids work in boarding school generally makes it easier for me when I write.

My school was in the mountains, and unfortunately or fortunately from where I'm standing now, we didn't have good connectivity with internet and phones.

Landslides and what not.

So I have a lot of letters I wrote home so I can remember the things I did and was interested in from when I was a kid.

So when I write, I can imagine the characters as a kid.

But if I'm feeling particularly lazy, I write from 15-16 years old; because it's a lot easier and you don't need to worry about the age and maturity as much.

Also it's easier to do divergence from year 4/5 onwards with fanfics because changing things from below year three has a rather large ripple effect.
