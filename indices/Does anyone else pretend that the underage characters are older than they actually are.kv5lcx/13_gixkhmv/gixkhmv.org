I think Hogwarts works best when aged up - because most of the stories people tend to want to tell are more adult than the books.

Personally I'd make it either start at 14 (so that students turn 18 at year 4, which would then make OWLs a good point for education stopping/ the equivalent of a secondary education), or start at 18 (for more university age). The former allows for a year or two of still essentially being children, but more mature + more actual adult years than canon. This can also open up for more advanced magic with either one.

I'm not sure why some people don't want to do that TBH - if wanting to do a story that simply doesn't work with 10 year olds (eg, politics focused) just bump up the ages.
