Mostly I see that when characters are doing more adult things, usually sexual, but not excluding smoking, drinking, or heading up an army.

It's hard to write characters at the right age sometimes. Add in things like Harry's lack of normal socialization and Hermione's precociousness, and that complicates matters. I suspect that's why some people write time travel: Harry may be 8, 11, 15, but his mind is anywhere from 3 to 50 years older and thus he speaks/acts older. Throw in some characters marveling at his maturity and it's all good. Theoretically.
