I sometimes headcanon it as magic affecting the mind to mature witches and wizards faster, sort of as a safety precaution given how dangerous a wand and the magical world in general can be. This thing is that most fanfiction seems to be written by/for late teens/twenties, so we don't find realistic eleven year olds that interesting.
