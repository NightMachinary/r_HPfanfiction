Check out D&D for some great horrors. I particularly recommend the Aberration and Abomination categories of creatures.

The Worm That Walks could be interesting, if you pulled a Rowling and turned them unintelligent (a la her Dragons). Imagine a quadrupedal dog-like thing made of swarming maggots.

Ahuiotzls and Flumphs are also fun.
