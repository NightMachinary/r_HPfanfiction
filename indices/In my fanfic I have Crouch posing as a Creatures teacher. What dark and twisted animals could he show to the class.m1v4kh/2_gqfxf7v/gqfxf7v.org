Don't even. He has them learn crup obedience training (the fourth years hand raise puppies, teach them to be calm and good so they get certified to be therapy crups for the Janice Thickly Ward), how to groom and pamper knezeles (the fifth years spend the year raising the kittens who go to be adopted and help squibs), the 7th years have a joint herbology project to create a garden plan that helps pixies, bowtruckles, and gnomes. Everything his benign and banal. Unicorns, bumblebees, and little fish that glow in the dark.

His students see all that is fragile, fair, and friendly.

They are then taught about how muggles test chemicals and drugs on the helpless animals. How they use vivisection to study. How monstrous those beasts are to the world.

Voldemort doesn't even have to ask them to take the mark.
