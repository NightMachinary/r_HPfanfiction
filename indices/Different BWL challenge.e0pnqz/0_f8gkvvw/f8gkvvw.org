linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) has most of what you're asking for. It's a gen fic where Neville is the BWL, and Harry's parents are in St Mungo's. Harry himself was brought up by the Dursleys and is unaware of magic until right before he starts Hogwarts. As the Dursleys never told him about his parents, when he first sees them in St. Mungo's he's determined to use transfiguration to fix their brains. It's really well written.
