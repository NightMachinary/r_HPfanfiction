That Old House is so sweet and fluffy it will make you smile while your teeth fall out and your brain turns to cotton. It matches all of you requirement minus one, it briefly touches on Harry's previous relationship with Ginny but only enough to say that it didn't/couldn't work out. I've read this one a couple of times and I can't recommend it enough.

I'm trying to think of a bellmione fic where Hermione gets sent back in time by an older Bellatrix Lestrange and falls in love with a teenage Bellatrix Black but for the life of me I can't remember the name of it. If anyone could give me a link that would be nice.
