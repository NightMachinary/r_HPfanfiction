[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] HarryxGabrielle

#+begin_quote
  A man who is lost in his own country. A girl who needs her mate to survive. A tale of Quidditch and romance, of anger and betrayal, of friendship and enmity. A story of the power of hope.

Touches on some of the points you didn't want, but I still highly recommend it.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]] HarryxPansy

#+begin_quote
  When Pansy finds herself on the wrong side of Voldemort, she persuades her parents that only one person could help them. Harry. A story that looks at what could happen if Harry had someone who loved him, someone who would push him, and someone who would back him financially.
