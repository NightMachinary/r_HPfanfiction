The armies of Good and Evil stood on the empty plains, ready to attack.

"CHARGE!" shouted Voldemort.

"CHARGE!" shouted Harry.

The armies collided, and spells flew. After about thirty seconds of pure chaos, a voice rang out across the battlefield.

"Hold up, hold up, wait a /second/!"

Everyone stopped and stared at the pink-haired auror.

"Lemme just check something real quick. Who here is /not/ me?"

Harry and Voldemort raised their hands. Nobody else did. Suddenly, each and every soldier on the field morphed into the same pink-haired auror. "Why are we even fighting, if everyone here is me?" asked one.

"I dunno, but its fun. Non-lethals only!"

Voldemort and Harry stared as their great battle devolved into a gigantic, every-Tonks-for-herself paintball battle. "You know," began Harry slowly. "I was wondering why that umbrella stand had started attacking /everyone/."
