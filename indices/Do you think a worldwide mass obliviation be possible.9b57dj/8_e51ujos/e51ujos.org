If you can have a quick response time I think mass releasing an aerosol potion into the atmosphere would be ideal probably some mixture of memory eraser and a compulsion. Otherwise I think a ritual would work but it would need a lot of focus(using something like stone henge) and a lot of power (multiple wizards/sacrificing magical virgins or dragons or something)
