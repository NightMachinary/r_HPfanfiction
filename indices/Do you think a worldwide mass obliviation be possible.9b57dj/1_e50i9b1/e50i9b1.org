Fidelius Charm. There's nothing anywhere that says that it's restricted to a small place or single house.

For anyone thinking otherwise, I'll point something out. Before Fantastic Beasts people would have argued to death that you can't use an Undetectable Extension Charm to put several large open air biomes into a briefcase. Then the movie comes out and we have just that.
