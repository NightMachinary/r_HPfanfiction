My interpretation is the secret is stored in the secret keeper's soul. So when the initial secret keeper dies then only those they told know the location and the secret is stored in each of their respective souls and they become secret keepers themselves. When the last secret keeper dies then the secret no longer has a soul to hide in so it the becomes known to anyone who knew before the Fidelis and learnable to anyone else.
