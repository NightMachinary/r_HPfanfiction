I wouldn't say that is the problem with the Fidelius Charm in application to Horcruxes or the prophecy. It's a question of ownership. Both are secrets (which meets the first ownership), but the point of the Fidelius is that the person who has the secret they want to hide has to trust someone else with the secret to protect it. So who owns the secret of Horcruxes or the prophecy? Same for an entire city or whatnot.
