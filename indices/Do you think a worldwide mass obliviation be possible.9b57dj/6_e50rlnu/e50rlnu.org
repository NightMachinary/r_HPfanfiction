Well...in the Ilfracombe Incident, a vacationing family of wizards (the Toke family) were able to Memory Charm everyone on the beach to forget the dragon attack. Though, they did miss one ('Dodgy' Dirk), whose lilo floaty thing was punctured by the dragon.\\
And with the incident at the Quidditch World Cup in Goblet of Fire, Mr Roberts was heavily disoriented afterwards, in part due to the Memory Charm that was placed on him.

So...perhaps the effectiveness of Obliviation depends on the 'strength' put into the spell and the impact of whatever memory is being removed or broken up.\\
A swooping dragon? Surprising and a bit frightening, probably relatively easy to forget with memory charms. Personal property damaged by the aforementioned dragons? A little more oomph might be needed.\\
The attack on Mr. Roberts on the other hand would have been incredibly frightening, gone on for a while, and probably been painful for him too. Such an shocking event might have been incredibly difficult to obliviate away, and doing so still left a (hopefully temporary) impact on his psyche.

So, I suppose the question of whether a worldwide Obliviation is possible...maybe it'd depend on the magnitude of the incident?\\
If it were something relatively-mild like, say, somebody vandalising the moon (confusion and curiosity and 'how the heck did that happen' inducing, but not emotionally devastating), it'd /probably/ be possible to obliviate most of the population into forgetting it happened. If you could contact every of-age wizard and get them to do their community, that'd probably solve things right there.\\
Something a lot more devastating though, like, say, a global lycanthropy pandemic, might be a lot harder to Obliviate away, especially if it results in a lot of deaths. You'd need specialised Obliviators to handle the shock, possibly employ memory-potion mist, and if it happened on a global scale there might not be enough bodies to Memory-Charm everyone with sufficient power and skill.

There's also the question of news sites, personal blogs, the Internet as a whole, gossips on the phone, TV broadcasts...I imagine that on a smaller scale, wizards could hack into individual webpages to hide incriminating things from view or maybe insert 'magic text' that Confounds anyone seeing it, keep tabs on major news outlets to Confound/Obliviate them and hide the evidence when necessary...maybe even save up a bunch of EMP bombs (magical or otherwise) and detonate them to fake a solar storm induced disruption of electronics?\\
Aside from that...wizards don't exactly have good future-sight or find-this-thing magic, Seers being pretty rare, so their chances of preventing a major incident are questionable in the first place. And time travel to change events that have already happened can be risky, so...hmm.
