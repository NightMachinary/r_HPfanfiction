  There's also the question of news sites, personal blogs, the Internet as a whole, gossips on the phone, TV broadcasts...I imagine that on a smaller scale, wizards could hack into individual webpages to hide incriminating things from view

Not sure if it'd be needed. HP magic can work on a conceptual level so there might be a way to remove all that without doing that. Maybe make it so the information is on the internet but anytime a muggle looks at it, it just doesn't register. Like there could be wiki pages right now about magic but we just can't comprehend them.
