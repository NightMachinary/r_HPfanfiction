Certainly possible, but probably not the kind of spell that can be found on page 32 of the Standard Book of Spells. I imagine such a feat of magic would require special circumstances/ingredients rather than just a wand and incantation.

On the plus side, there's evidence from Fantastic Beasts that you can also obliviate documents. I've always amused myself with the idea of a wizard obliviating the internet, or putting a curse on it.

Ultimately, however, I think such a mass obliviation would be unnecessary, even in the event of a mass exposure of magic. In that situation, I think wizards could simply have Muggle authorities declare it a hoax, and then the "why Muggles prefer not to know" factor will do the rest of the job. Only conspiracy theorists would continue to believe.
