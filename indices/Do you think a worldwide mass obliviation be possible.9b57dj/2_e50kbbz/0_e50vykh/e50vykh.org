  Millenia ago, I would have had no trouble calling the man a god. Now imagine what the entire world of mages could do.

Why only millenia ago? If a being demonstrated the logic and science defying magic of the HP universe to me, I'd have no issue with calling them a god, for lack of a better term.

Of course, then they would explain to me that there's a whole society with people born with such ridiculous powers, which would put it into perspective... a little bit.

But why would I be any less impressed now than millennia ago by a person turning into an actual cat? Actually I'm probably more impressed because I know how insane that is from a biological and physical standpoint. Ancient people believed all kinds of ridiculous stuff, they'd just adjust to now experiencing one of their tales for real.
