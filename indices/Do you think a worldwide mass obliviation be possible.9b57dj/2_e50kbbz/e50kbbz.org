Possible? Yes. Almost anything is possible with the magic in the HP universe.

Think about this: Voldemort's jinx on the DADA position. Whatever he did, it literally sets /fate itself/ to arrive at a particular outcome, that the position will only be held for one year. In other words, Voldemort alone was able to make a particular future event occur repeatedly and jinx the /idea/ of something. Millenia ago, I would have had no trouble calling the man a god. Now imagine what the entire world of mages could do.

More to the point though, the existence of such a thing would also explain the timing of the Salem Witch Trials. At the time, people were traveling around faster and longer all over the globe. Scientific innovation was exponentially increasing in the wake of the Renaissance. And now the muggle violence towards their kind was spreading to the newest piece of undiscovered territory, one that had almost infinite boundaries in the minds of many. Who wouldn't be scared of this?

The various magical leaderships (impromptu no doubt) across the world likely were or already had been trying to segregate the magical and muggle worlds. But maybe the greater awareness led to a plan to perform a single, mass spell on a global scale. Instead of wiping simple memories of living minds, they would change the memories of minds that had already died, changing the recorded histories to remove any links to the magical world.
