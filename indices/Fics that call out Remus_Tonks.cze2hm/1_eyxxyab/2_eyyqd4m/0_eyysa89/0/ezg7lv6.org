Why should the coward (he wasn't there for Harry like ever! At first he didn't look for Harry before Hogwarts and at Hogwarts it took Dumbledore asking him to work there as a professor for him to crawl out of his hole and after Snape exposed him as a werewolf (note: He was dangerous, too he forgot his potion and nearly attacked the trio and this also let Pettigrew escape!) he vanished and wasn't seen again till the order was reformed!) get a break?

Seriously, Mr. Absent deserved the tongue-lashing Harry gave him (still, I agree that he wasn't the right guy for Tonks and I give him credit for admitting it and wanting to end the relationship or hell, not even start one!)!
