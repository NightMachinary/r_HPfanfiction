I don't think Harry was made out to be the villain, I just think that Remus was obviously pissed that he was called out and Ron and Hermione genuinely don't understand what it means to grow up without either of your parents around (alive) so they reacted like they thought they should, and were just sort of confused as to why Harry would yell at Remus like that, because I think that they haven't actually stopped to think about what Harry lost that night, and what that would do to him losing both his parents.
