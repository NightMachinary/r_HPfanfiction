No...not if he didn't want it, this is such a misconception IMHO - especially since men don't have reproductive rights (note: I am not saying that men should be able to force women to have an abortion, but I think they should be able to walk away within the same timeframe that a woman can get an abortion in (unless he didn't know, then the countdown will start from the time he was told!))

It is just unfair that women can do stuff like manipulate birthcontrol (poke holes in condoms, use the sperm from a thrown away condom (that's why sports-stars are told to flush theirs down the toilet, so that this can not happen!), stop taking the pill etc.) and still get money from men, while they can easily (note: I am not saying that abortions are super easy, but compared to paying for a child for 18 years or more they really are!) walk away (abortion or even giving the kid up for adoption (without the father being given the child if he wants it - no, if it is adoption then the father is not automaticall given custody!))
