This is what many fans assume. But Rowling said in Remus's biography that they weren't involved before the end of HBP. That Tonks admited she liked him and Remus avoided her, so she got depressed. And even in the scenario where they do get together and then split up, girls who rite those fics make it seem like Remus is a terrible person for ending the relationship when it's obvious he has serious concerns. Then Tonks gets to scream at him at some point and everyone is on her side. So it doesn't even matter when the relationship starts, it ends up seeming like a complete disaster. People want to make them get together to make it make more sense, but it's even worse because issues are unnresolved. Besides, this scenario ignores the fact Remus felt from the start it wasn't a good idea to be in a relationship. There's no way I'd believe he for some reason agreed to start a relationship at once and then changed his mind. It took grief and persuasion to make him start a relationship with her. And like op said, it's always Remus's fault, no matter the circumstances.
