I mean true there was very little we saw. Though we could have seen bits and pieces would have made sense in the end then without having this uncomfortable context and feeling like their hook up and having a kid was a cheap way to parallel Harry's parents. But Rowling has a thing for being sympathetic about onesided romances that seem uncomfortable.

Snape and Lilly, Merope and Riddle Sr, Hermione and Ron when she thought he wasn't into him and only Lavender.

These are all people who fell very hard for someone who they were never with. In Hermione's case this is more her and Rons inability to express their feelings for each other. And its the most tame, but Rowling is sympathetic about physically lashing out if you think you have your feelings be spurned.

Snapes obsession with Lilly did bring him over to the side of good but is uncomfortable considering he lashed out at her kid for looking like his father. And that he never got a reason to be good apart from his obsession with Lilly. So for all you know him never getting over a woman who was happily married and didnt want him was a redeeming quality for someone who never once indiicated he rejected the death eaters philosophy.

And Merope is a straight up rapist whose sympathetic because of her horrific backstory while her victim is a guy whose side is never explored and is depicted as being perfectly fine after being brainwashed and raped. Until Riddle jr kills him for being a muggle and/or not raising his kid.

And thats just in the HP series for the Fantastic beasts one she is sympathetic towards Queenie for brainwashing Jacob to marry her. Even if he loves her marriage is his decision not hers and she almost took it from him. And his rejection for her is all it took for her to join Grinderwald who is clearly depicted as evil at this point. And this character is still considered sympathetic

So if it was on its own I would have assumed ya there was more to the relationship we didn't see. But in the context of these relationships I am way more suspicious if it wasnt just one sided pining and her repeatedly confessing and him repeatedly saying no till hes pressured into saying yes.

And I see things critical about their relationship but never sympathetic towards Lupin when they are let alone critical about the one sided feelings being forced on someone. Maybe he did love her and just needed time. But he deserved that time not to have his friends pressure him so much he hooks up after a funeral.

So ya I wanna see more fics call out how unsettling this is and not hook them up since this is something I dont think I've seen and therefore want fics about it or featuring it.
