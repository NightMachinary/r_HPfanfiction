Of course men are the bad guys in HP:

Rowling is a (radical) feminist and she was/is also single-mother who had to raise her child in bad conditions!

Her writing shows that, most intelligent characters are either older men (and gay, too so not threatening toward women - hell, Flitwick is intelligent, but he's so tiny that most women wouldn't be challenged overcoming him physically) or women (Hermione, McGonagall, Vector, Sprout, Bellatrix even)

Look at how she writes men (at least the important ones, characters like Neville are ok - but they aren't super important either):

Harry isn't all that intelligent, he's not curious and his self-preservation instincts are bad, too - same goes for Ron (the other main character)

Then there's Snape, pining after long dead Lily Potter/Evans

Voldemort is basically A-Sexual (we don't know that he ever loved anybody except magic)

Dumbledore (and Grindelwald, too) is gay

etc. etc.
