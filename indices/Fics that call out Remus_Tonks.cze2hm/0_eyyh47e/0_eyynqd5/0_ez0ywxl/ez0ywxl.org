That's fair enough. Another one that rubbed me the wrong way, more than Tonks and Lupin, is James and Lily. He harassed her all their teens, and she despised him, then suddenly she's in love and they marry.

I'd say the Hermione one is the least like the others, because she and Ron were already friends. They already liked each other as humans, so Hermione having a teenage girl level of spitefullness is pretty believable. Even the most rational, mature teenager can be proper cunts at times.
