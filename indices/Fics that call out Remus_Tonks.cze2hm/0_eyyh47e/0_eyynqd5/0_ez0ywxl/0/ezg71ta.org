Was ist truly harassment?

Seriously, James may have been an asshole but I doubt he harassed Lily!

He harassed, bullied and attacked Snape (and Lily defended him, but I doubt he directly targeted her even once!)

Also: Not everything perceived as harassment (you can get charged with that today for looking at a woman in a way she doesn't like - "Your honor I felt so violated, it was like he was undressing me with his eyes!" (after that, she'd turn on the waterworks and if the man is unlucky he's now punished for sexual harassment!))
