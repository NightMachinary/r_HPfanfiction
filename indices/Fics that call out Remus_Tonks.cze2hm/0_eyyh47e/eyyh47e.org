I think there was probably more that we didn't see. It's more than likely that there was a thing happening between them, that he then tried to end. Her patronus was a wolf - and as far as Harry knew, they weren't together at that point. So I suspect that they had had a fling, at the least, and then, possibly triggered by Sirius's death, Remus realized it was far too serious and she deserved better than him.

It certainly makes zero sense that a crush would bring Tonks down to such misery, and change her patronus. But, I suppose there is always the trope of falling desperately, deeply, and truly in love with someone despite an actual relationship. Rowling isn't noted for her romances...

*edit Plus, I always liked the way it sort of all happened out of Harry's viewpoint. Because Harry was occupied by other important shit, things like two people he barely knew falling in love, breaking up, getting back together, all happened off screen without his knowledge.
