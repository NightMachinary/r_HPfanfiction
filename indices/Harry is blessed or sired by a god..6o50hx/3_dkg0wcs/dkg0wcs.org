Later parts of The Lone Traveler Series have Harry interacting frequently on behalf of gods, including being blessed by a love god that grants him a golden patronus that can remove the Dark Mark from a person (Karkaroff), and eventually becoming God of Free Will. He also regularly has Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters with the Boss.
