The sacrifice-protection is Dumbledore's opinion which is never directly confirmed in canon, and we know Dumbledore is capable of, at best, highly misleading answers, like his explanation of Snape's hatred for James (â€˜He saved his life.').

WBWL usually have Dumbledore as an antagonist so it's plausible for him to be lying or mistaken.

Also in DH while searching for Gregorovitch Voldemort murders a women who's trying to protect her children without triggering any special effect.
