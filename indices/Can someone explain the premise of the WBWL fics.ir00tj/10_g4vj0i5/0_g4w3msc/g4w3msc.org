Yes, yes, I am aware fanfiction is fanfiction.

I prefer my fanfiction to logically make sense, and the idea didn't make sense to me.

I simply asked someone to explain how writers of said fanfiction made the concept of the WBWL make sense. I, however, did not ask for you to state the obvious.

The kind people ahead of you have already explained the different ways in which these authors write this trope. Although I appreciate your very literal reply, it was a bit unnecessary.

Have a wonderful evening. ;)
