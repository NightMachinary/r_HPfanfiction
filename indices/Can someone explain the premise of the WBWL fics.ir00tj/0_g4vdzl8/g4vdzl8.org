Canonically, you are completely correct. Some WBWL fics do keep to that premise, but change who died for the kids. I've seen grandparents, babysitters, house elves, Sirius, Remus, and maybe a few others take Lily's place. James' parents and Sirius are at least purebloods, so it's conceivable that Voldemort might give them the opportunity to join him, so the sacrifice could work like in canon. It's harder to believe that Voldemort wouldn't just kill a house elf that was in his way, but maybe he thought Snape really needed someone to do his laundry.

But most fics just toss the sacrifice out completely and come up for some other reason for Harry and Twin to survive. Usually it's something along the lines of "Harry is just so powerful that he killed Voldemort all by himself."
