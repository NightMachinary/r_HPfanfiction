It's true that a mother's love is typically seen as being particularly significant, and magic could reflect that. But that's getting into headcanon territory. I think a grandparent's or godparent's love could be justified in working just as well, if an author wanted to take that path.

Accidental magic can do a lot, but killing Voldemort as a baby does seem like like too much. But most of those fics take the OP!Harry route in one form or another anyway.
