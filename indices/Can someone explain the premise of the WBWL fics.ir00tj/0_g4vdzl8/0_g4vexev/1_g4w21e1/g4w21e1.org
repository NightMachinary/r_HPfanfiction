I doubt anyone who read beyond the Boy-Who-Lived propaganda thought it was Harry. (Of course, the way Rita Skeeter and Fudge led everyone by the nose implies less than stellar things about an entire population.) Two incredibly bright students marry and spend months in hiding waiting to be attacked. That's the motivation and means to create some then-unknown protection magic. If it truly was a mother's sacrifice alone, what makes it different than all the other mothers who die for their kids?

Which also brings in my next favorite reason why Voldemort died: he wasn't trying to kill Harry, he thought turning the prophecy child into a horcrux would be a lark and made a mistake converting the process to work on living subjects. Lily's sacrifice created some protection, which then absorbed all the protection spells Voldemort used to prepare the vessel. Or his soul was too cheesegratered and it exploded him when he removed another chunk (which is WHY nobody made multiple horcruxes to that degree). Or he simply bungled part of the ritual, stuck the ENTIRE rest of his soul in Harry, and the shade we see came from another horcrux. Why else would it appear in Albania, then do nothing for ten years? Quirrel was looking into some weird magical effect that just so happened to contain the horcrux.
