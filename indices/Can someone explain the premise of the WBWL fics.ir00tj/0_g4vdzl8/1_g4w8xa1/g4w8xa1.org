I've read one where it was the prophecy that did it. Voldemort tried to thwart a prophecy and got "punished" for it. Dumbledore tried to control the prophecy so his punishment was that everything he did backfired.

It was an interesting concept, since it delved into Divination. But I ultimately dropped it since I couldn't decide which was worse between the atrocious grammar and what felt like EVERY cliche ever.
