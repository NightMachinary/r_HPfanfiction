You are right by cannon. Thing is, the whole thing was always kind of confusing (was Lily the first person to take an Ak for their children? Cause the spell seems kinda common place for criminals) so many authors decide to create their own mechanisms and reasons to explain it (and some ignore it and just say outright that the baby survived because of his plot-armor) I... can't really blame them. I mean, cannon was too vague on the matter and the explanation had many holes and, well, part of world building /is/ tweaking the systems so everything fits.
