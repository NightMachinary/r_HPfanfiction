Some WBWL, like Den of Snakes, have Lily still die. James was away at the time and came home to an explosion. Sometimese someone else dies to protect Harry & twin. Quite often it's Sirius or Remus, as Harry's/twin's godfather. Several times I've seen an older sibling, 2-3 years old, die. As far as Voldemort being willing to spare Lily but not the substitute, that's rarely addressed. I think I've seen it twice or thrice as "there's no need for pure blood to spilt, step away from the half blood brat."

I have also read fics where it's the power of prophecy that explodes Voldemort. Either something additional after Snape was thrown out, or a completely different prophecy and Dumbledore obliviates Snape to believe he heard the canon version. So the "true" prophecy is something like "The Dark Lord will be invincible as long as he doesn't personally kill someone related to him, else his family magics will turn on him as a traitor" and Dumbledore sends Snape off with the fake bait.
