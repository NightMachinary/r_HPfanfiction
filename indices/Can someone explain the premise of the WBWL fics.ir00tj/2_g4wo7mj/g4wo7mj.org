The most believable WBWL fics I've read have still had Lily die leaving the magical sacrifice the same with only James surviving. In The Secret Rune the Potter's still died, but the Dursleys could only take in 1 kid and the GWL needed the blood wards more than her sister.

Most alternatives I've seen to Lily dying are based on either:

a) Voldemort asked the person to move aside for some reason and they didn't creating a willing sacrifice. The most interesting version I've seen of this was in The Archeologist where Pettigrew asked Voldemort to spare his goddaughter, who then refused to move aside and was killed, thus protecting her brother.

b) They completely throw out the sacrifice and use something else to explain the phenomenon like an entity, a soulbond, a bloodline ability, or they completely ignore it. In some, which twin was attacked wouldn't have mattered while in others only the true BWL would have survived.

I enjoy the WBWL trope a lot, although most of them are poorly written and often include a lot of bashing. Still, I think it's an interesting approach to nature vs nurture and can be very well done.
