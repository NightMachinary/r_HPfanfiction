Eh. Taste is subjective. I don't really enjoy the one you referenced, 7th Horcrux, Delenda Est, Alexandra the American, or a number of others recommended by lots of people on this subreddit.

And that's fine. Just enjoy the ones you like and recommend new ones to keep the stories commonly featured on here from getting stale.
