I'm actually happy you posted this as I just finished reading this fic. I saw it recommended as a near-flawless piece so perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, but I really disliked it and wondered if I was alone. I'd be happy if anyone wants to discuss it with me. I'll add some stuff I did like at the end so I'm not just complaining! (Also I'm sorry this ended up a bit long!)

First of all, I think the author's biggest mistake was to rename Harry. He was already fairly out-of-character to begin with, so with the new name he pretty much became an OC. I honestly don't think it would have been all that confusing if only his last name had been changed, since other-Harry does not appear all that much in the fic.

As an OC, it becomes even more blatant how perfect Hadrian is. He gets a place in his original group of friends pretty much immediately, teachers and students alike instantly take a liking to him, he puts the bullies in their place, is good in all his classes and a god in Ancient Runes, rallies a huge group of friends around him with little effort... I swear, in the chapter where he gets his OWL and NEWT marks I thought to myself ‘I bet this dude will get the highest marks ever achieved in Ancient Runes history' and yup. That predictable. Due to this, absolutely nothing exciting happens. There is no suspense. Everything always goes Hadrian's way. Even the frostiest characters warm up to him quickly. That is, except his counterpart since naturally, the fic needs a bad guy! He just can't be smart or otherwise Hadrian wouldn't look better than he does.

Speaking of other-Harry, I feel like the author just glossed over an explanation of why he is the way he is. The explanation that he was spoiled just did not do it for me. If he had just been arrogant, sure, but he was just downright hateful. Why would other-Harry hate werewolves when his father's best friend is one and he pretty much grew up with another one? I think the author was trying to paint him like James and Sirius were in their schooldays, but missed the mark.

Some other miscellaneous stuff that bothered me: the characters the author clearly doesn't like are either completely left out of the story (Crabbe, Goyle, Ginny) or are portrayed as one-dimensional bullies (Cho). I get that it's a different ‘world' in that sense, but so much is the same that those changes felt off to me. Second, why bother sorting Harry into Hufflepuff when he was going to be ignoring most of that House and sitting with the Gryffindors anyway? Third, why would Cedric hang out with a bunch of fourth years? I thought it was realistic for him as a prefect to show an interest in Hadrian, but to hang out with him and his friends constantly? No.

Okay, points I liked: I thought Orion was a really interesting character and besides the fact that the person who made his life hell was other-Harry, I think it was a fairly realistic portrayal of how an ‘out' werewolf would have to cope at Hogwarts. I liked how Sirius and Remus behaved towards him. In fact, I liked the characterisations of most of the canon characters. I appreciated the lack of romance too. Overall, I liked that the story was mostly focused on characters and friendships instead of a plot we all basically know already, but I wish the author had let some other characters do some of the heavy lifting instead of Hadrian effortlessly organising everything left and right.

As for OP's last question, I have started reading a lot of recommended fics and dropped them just as quickly. I usually know within the first 10,000 words whether I like the fic or not. I only continued with C'est La Vie despite my gut feelings because it came highly recommended. I think the only fic so far that I continued and ended up liking was A Long Journey Home.
