A lot of it is personal. I like it, but I like suppaHarrys.

What constitutes good for a fanfic? Is it a different standard than for original stuff? I love Moby Dick but only Melville wrote it. There's 700k fanfics in the Potter section of ffn. I love to read, always have. Is Joyce better than Doyle or Kipling? I don't know, I just know I'll read a Sherlock before Ulysses.
