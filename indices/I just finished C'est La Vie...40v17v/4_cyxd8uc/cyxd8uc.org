Pretty much anything by cywscross (author of /C'est la Vie/) qualifies. The author is constitutionally incapable of completing more than a one-shot and basically recycles the same character throughout all his/her stories, the over-powered emoStu.

Sometimes, you're just in the mood for such a story. Guilty pleasure territory. Other times, you go for something more interesting.
