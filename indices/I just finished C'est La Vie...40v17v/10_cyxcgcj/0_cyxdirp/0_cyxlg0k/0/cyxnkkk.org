Well part of it is that for some reason (possibly Emperor Hadrian and his Wall) people think that Harry is too much a commoners name for the Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Black, and Hadrian is far more lordly.

For me, it's less about the specific name Harry chooses. If Harry starts referring to himself as Hadrian (or whatever) in his mind or the author uses it anywhere but in dialogue or other characters thoughts, then he basically becomes an OC in my opinion.

E: Oh, and Hadrian is used in tons of fics.
