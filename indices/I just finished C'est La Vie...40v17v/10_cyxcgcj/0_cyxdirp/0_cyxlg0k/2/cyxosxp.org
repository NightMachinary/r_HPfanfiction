Well, there are a whole bunch of other names you could use without sounding like an extra from Julius Caesar; Henry is a name that is very close to Harry (in fact, I think Harry can be considered a diminutive for Henry), and still sounds natural enough to be an actual person's name, not some adolescent edgelord's (which a Harry who calls himself Hadrian is almost invariably bound to be) idealised conception of himself. Changing his name to Hadrian comes off especially ridiculous since Harry is a name that /already/ has royal/noble connotations in England, so there's absolutely no reason to make his name sound more regal, even if you are part of "Lord Potter-Black-Something-or-Another" coterie.
