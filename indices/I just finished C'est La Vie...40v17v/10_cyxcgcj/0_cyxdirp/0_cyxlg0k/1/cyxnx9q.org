It's part of the Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor family of cliches. A cheap excuse to make him sound more regal or something like that, but ends up coming off as a complete character replacement. It can be used well, such as in one fic where his legal name was some form of not-Harry but everyone still called him Harry anyway, and the plot point was that he never even knew his real birth name.

In others, it's a sign that his middle name has also been changed, to Sue. He's suddenly lost all the characteristics that made him what we love (and love to abuse to be honest) and turned him into a god among men, untouchable by mortals, ruler of Hogwarts by some metaphysical hogwash, able to put the wizarding world on its head with a nod at the wizengamot.

It usually appears in stories that also tick the other vomit enducing cliches such as the chapter long shopping trip; the insanely helpful goblins; the blood test that shows infinite wealth, hidden magical powers, and curses place upon him; and light-side bashing that boils down to ridiculously stupid actions with a complete lack of reason, such as potions.

Thus, Hadrian is something that sticks out as a story destroyer, and is why we complain about it. Most of the stories that have it wind up with the exact same plot-bustingly powerful Harry with no enemies and no failures, meaning there's nothing left for the story to do, except maybe write some smut.

And so the story gets few to no reviews total, and the ones it gets are generally flamey, and the author either quits the story or tries to salvage it in another fic. The fabled Knights of /New get to see all the utter shite but most of it never comes up again. It won't seen when sorted by reviews, it won't be on fav lists, and they rarely pass the 40k word threshold.
