If any downvotes /do/ come, it will probably be because of the way you're expressing yourself:

#+begin_quote
  90% of the people here have no sense of what taste is
#+end_quote

Regardless of whether this is true or not, it really doesn't add much to the discussion, and it comes off as caustic.

What would /facilitate/ discussion, however, is explaining what /you/ thought was off about the fic. It would help others see your viewpoint, at the very least.

Personally? "Hadrian" throws me off. I can't read a fic with "Hadrian" everywhere without getting a headache.
