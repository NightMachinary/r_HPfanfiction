200k? Hah, The Legacy by storytellerSPw could stand to lose more than half of it, at least 350k. You probably could cut about half the chapters to ~3k, delete a quarter of the chapters entirely, and rewrite the rest to about 7k and have a somewhat decently paced fic. Currently the chapters are just under 10k each.
