No need to delete something just because everyone might not agree with you. I think we've been relatively good with that, as a sub, so far, and I hope we can maintain that culture!

Anyways, to answer your question, yeah. A lot of stuff in fanfiction can turn out to be disappointing. Perhaps the most prominent example, for me, is linkffn(Delenda Est). It has a healthy start, and it had /so/ much potential. By the middle, though, I was just reading it out of hopes the author would dig himself out of the hole he made. It never did happen, and I could never bring myself to finish it.
