I've read maybe four chapters of C'est La Vie before dropping it, so I can't really comment on its quality, or lack thereof.

As for starting a fic that disappointed, then continuing with it - I used to do this a lot a few years back. A huge list of poorly done Azkaban stories, Dark Lord stories and Rehashes I stuck with because I found those tropes interesting. Nowadays, I'm far more fickle, I suppose you could say. Even the smallest things are enough for me to drop something.
