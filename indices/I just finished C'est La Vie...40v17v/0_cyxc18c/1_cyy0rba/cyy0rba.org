I have to agree with TheBlueMenace. I get annoyed by changing his name to "Hadrian" for no reason that is necessary to the story. So many do it "just because."

But in this story, he really does need to be distinguished from the Harry Potter of his new universe. So he can't be either Harry or Potter.

Maybe "Hadrian" isn't the best choice, but it could be worse. And frankly "Hadrian" kinda fits in with a lot of other wizarding names, given how many have Latin origins/roots.
