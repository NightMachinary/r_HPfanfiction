This comes from two major litigious parties:

- The authors themselves, which JKR doesn't seem to mind but you'll note many archives refuse to get any more threats from Anne Rice et al.

- Movie studios like Warner Bros, who own a lot of HP's visual/merch IP.

In the early 2000s, WB was well-known for sending cease and desist notices to fansite webmasters and fanfic archives where people would add movie stills or promo shots as covers of their fics. I personally helped clean up a couple of sites in a tripod webring to be sure we had adequate disclaimers and minimal high-res promo stills.

This is a problem to this day. Remember a couple weeks ago when Harry Potter With Guns made the front page of reddit? Yep well that sudden popularity caught some attention from WB and guess what they had to take it down from harrypotterwithguns.com

Boo.
