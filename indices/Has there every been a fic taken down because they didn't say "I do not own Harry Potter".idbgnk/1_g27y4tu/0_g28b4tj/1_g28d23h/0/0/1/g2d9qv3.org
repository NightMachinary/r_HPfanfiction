Um. Isn't the protagonist like seven years old or something in the first book?

Been ages since I read it, and I do recall it being slow, but it didn't find his stupidity that grating... I wonder if I'd still like the original trilogy now that I'm older and pickier.

(I can tell you that I HATED the last pair of books, however.)
