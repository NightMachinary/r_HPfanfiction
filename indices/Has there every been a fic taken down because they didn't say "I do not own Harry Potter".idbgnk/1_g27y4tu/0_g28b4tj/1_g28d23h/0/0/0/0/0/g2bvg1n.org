Wow. You perfectly encapsulated all the reasons why I hated these books too! Every time I hear that the Assassin's Apprentice is a 'great book', I try reading it again, but am turned off after one page - which is a surprise, since I can rarely ever let a story go.

Glad to know that it isn't just me.
