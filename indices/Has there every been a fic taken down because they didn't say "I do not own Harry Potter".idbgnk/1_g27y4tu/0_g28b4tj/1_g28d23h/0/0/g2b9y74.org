I read the first Assassin's Apprentice book and I got pissed off that (A) Almost all the characters were dumb. (B) Spoilers for Assassin's Apprentice:

The assassins almost never killed anyone and seemed really reluctant to do it. If you're writing about assassins you should be willing to write about assassination. I think maybe one person was killed in the entire book and it was made very clear they were evil first.

One of the worst parts is that the main character is painfully stupid and passive. He finds his enemy's base and doesn't tell anyone. He finds out he has a superpower that would be really helpful so he never explores it. He has enemies but never thinks or worries about them.

Although I have read on forums that the main character is meant to be stupid per the author, it got to be really frustrating. You can see what is going on sooo obviously and yet it eludes him. There are no unexpected twists or turns it is like "Who might have tried to hurt me? Oh, he hates me and had means and opportunity and I was hurt with his special technique. Ghee whiz who could it be?" I just found it rage inducing to wade through. This isn't Watson to Holmes, or Hastings to Poirot, this is more like Harry Potter from the perspective of Crabbe and Goyle.

The pace is stupidly slow too. This story needs proper editing and could be trimmed down by at least half if not two thirds. It is mostly mundanity, a literal day by day sequence filled almost exclusively with junk (much of which isn't plot relevant). Ages spent on his writing lessons to no effect etc. And the main character makes no friends so there are few relationships being built in this time making it more pointless exposition.

That is the other problem. The main character almost never speaks. It improves slightly towards the end but it makes almost all of the talking into exposition where one character is just talking AT our protagonist. Really frustrating.

The king intentionally surrounds himself with betrayers and incompetents and then is constantly betrayed. Funny that.

There are lots of references to the castle/keep yet with all the towers and internal gardens it sounds like a very late medieval palace rather than a fortified building. Made it hard to picture in my head.

So yeah, I expected one of the best fantasy series of recent times and ended up with a story that made Methods of Rationality look good.
