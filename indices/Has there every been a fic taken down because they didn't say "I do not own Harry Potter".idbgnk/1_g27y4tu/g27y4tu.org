As I understand it, in Ãže olde days of fanfiction, it was not uncommon for fanfics to be targeted by copyright/trademark complaints. A lot of early fanfiction was hidden away to avoid the attention of authors and publishers. Anne Rice was particularly anti-fanfiction, to the point where I'm pretty sure ffnet still prohibits any content based on her works. The disclaimers are something of a holdover from the dark times and something of an attempt at protecting oneself if some author or their publisher decides to get a bug up their arse about fanfic again.
