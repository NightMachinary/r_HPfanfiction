IANAL, but from what I understand, /at best/ such a disclaimer may be a defence for a /trademark/ infringement or maybe consumer fraud lawsuit (i.e., representing your own work as that of someone more famous). It has no bearing on copyright, though /maybe/ some copyright owners might be less inclined to send a takedown notice or to sue if they see the disclaimer---but that's their decision, not a legal bar.

To what extent fictional characters and settings are copyrightable separately from the text and the plot is, AFAIK, a question that has not been adjudicated in any court unambiguously; and nor has the question of whether it's fair use (US) / fair dealing (UK, Australia, and others) been adjudicated unambiguously.

Personally, I hope some author sues and the fic writer fights it out. The worst case scenario is that the court decides that characters and settings are copyrightable---but since fanfic sites already act as if they are, nothing is lost; but if they can convince a court that they shouldn't be, that's a lot more freedom for fanfic writers.
