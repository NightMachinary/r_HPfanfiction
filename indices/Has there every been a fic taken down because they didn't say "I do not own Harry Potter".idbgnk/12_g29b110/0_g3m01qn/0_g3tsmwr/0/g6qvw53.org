By "good" I meant the story wasn't an apparent random set of sentences without a coherent set of characters or plot. I'm pretty sure that everyone can agree that a story where the main protagonist and every reference to him has been removed (without any attempt at rewriting), the story falls apart. For example, take the Star Trek episode. "City on the Edge of Forever" and remove every reference to Kirk and Spock. Would you have a "good" story left? Or would it look like the ramblings of what might be an idea for a story?

If the story you write depends on an element or elements from the original story in order for it to be considered ready for publishing without requiring arewrite, then your story is a derivative.
