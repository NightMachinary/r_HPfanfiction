  Basically, if you remove the "original's{" elements from the story and you still have a good story, you're not a derivative work of the original.

I don't think this is an actual legal test, particularly since it requires the court to assess whether a story is "good".

In the The Star Trek case, sounds and such are forms of /expression/ and are therefore generally copyrightable, whereas characters and settings in literature are /ideas/, which generally aren't.

That said, /Warner Bros. Inc. v. American Broadcasting Co./ seems to imply that characters are copyrightable, so it looks like that has been tested in court after all. This is unfortunate.
