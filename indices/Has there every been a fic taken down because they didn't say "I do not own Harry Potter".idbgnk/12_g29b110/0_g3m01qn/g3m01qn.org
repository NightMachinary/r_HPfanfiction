Actually, it has been somewhat litigated. See derivative works.

Basically, if you remove the "original's{" elements from the story and you still have a good story, you're not a derivative work of the original.

Thus, a story featuring James T. Kirk in the Star Fleet universe on the Star Ship Enterprise with its crew as seen on TV is derivative, because without those elements the story makes no sense.

However, writing a story about a Starship captain with an alien first-officer and a cranky doctor, with no mention of the ST universe.,that's not a derivative work.

Just as an aside, notice that all Star Trek merchandise and stories are copyrighted and trademarked according to Star Trek The Movie. That's because when the copyright for the ST episode came up for renewal, the lawyer renewed only the first two years of the series and missed the third (because the original studio for the ST series was purchased by Paramont before the third year started and the lawyer didn't think to check. This threw the entire third year scripts into the Public Domain). However, when someone went to release the third year without Paramont's permission, Paramont pointed out that they still had all the BACKGROUND sounds on copyright from the first two years, and those would have to be edited out. Thus, the third season has not been released by a third party. Too much work.
