So a lot of Authors state that fanfiction is ok as long as the writers make it clear they don't own the work. Hence the disclaimer. It's also a safety feature for the fanfic writer so the lawyers don't come at them.

I strongly dislike authors who don't allow fanfic of their work. FanFiction can be rich and provide fans with more. It doesn't erase the original work. In fact I've found fanfic can increase fans for an author. I've only watched a number of shows and read a number of books solely because I came across fanfic for them
