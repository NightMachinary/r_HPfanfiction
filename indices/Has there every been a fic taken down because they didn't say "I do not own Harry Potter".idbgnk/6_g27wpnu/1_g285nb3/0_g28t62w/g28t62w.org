Yeah, I put disclaimer on my author's page and ignore it afterwards, but it is just to avoid discussions about this nonsense. And of course the only benefit of these disclaimers is that we have beauties like linkffn(Petrification Proliferation by White Squirrel), where the author made those disclaimers into the separate art form.
