There shouldn't be, because that statement is completely meaningless. What really matters is the consent of the original author (which JKR apparently gave), and if it comes down to the litigation the amount of money the author of fanfiction made on it (which is zero, so zero times anything is, right, zero). There was some other rather crazy author in early 2000s (I forgot her name) who made a lot of bad blood around accusing people of plagiarising her work, who is the source of all those nonsensical declarations.
