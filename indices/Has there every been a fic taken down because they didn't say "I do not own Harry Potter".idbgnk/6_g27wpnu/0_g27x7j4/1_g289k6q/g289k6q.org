I suppose it's a weird middle ground. Like these people do put in a lot of work but they also have no real obligation to finish their work. It's the same with the whole Skyrim paid mods fiasco, where the mod creators had no obligation to actually keep the mod updated and working even though they would be making money off of it. But if they were contractually obliged then that'd open a whole another bag of issues.
