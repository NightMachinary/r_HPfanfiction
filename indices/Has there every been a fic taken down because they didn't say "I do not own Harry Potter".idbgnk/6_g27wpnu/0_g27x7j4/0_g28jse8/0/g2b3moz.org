Also banned on ff.net but I've still seen mentions of “P*****n” in there and stuff. They're us usually promoting them for their original work that's like 20 sentences, but everyone knows what they're really for.

Honestly though it doesn't super bother me morally as long as it doesn't bring any legal fuckery down on fanfic in general (which I guess you get around using those few chapters of original works). Don't see how it's that different from a Minecraft channel, like, you didn't make the game, obviously, but you built something cool in it that obviously took you a bunch of time; it's not like anyone thinks these are completely original works so it doesn't feel like plagiarism to me either. Don't think anyone's making a career out of it either, probably just enough to upgrade some computer parts every few years. Just my two cents.
