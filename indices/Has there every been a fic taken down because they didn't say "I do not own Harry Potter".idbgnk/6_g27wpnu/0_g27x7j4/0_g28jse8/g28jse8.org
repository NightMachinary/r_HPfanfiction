For ao3 at least, they forbid any mention of your patreon or other donation sites on your fics, for that exact legal reason. You can say, link to a tumblr, and on your tumble profile have a patreon link, but the link can't be hosted on ao3.

Overall ao3 is a fucking godsend in the world of fanfic, iirc they have a team of volunteer lawyers specifically to defend the site, the works, and the authors of, from shitheads like Anne Rice and other legal stuff.

They're also part of a larger network/organization of fandom related sites, one of which I think is fanlore, dedicated to preserving fandom culture and history.
