imagined power, especially over adults. I'd extend that to as young as 15. If the teacher tried to force anything(without using actual force) using their "power" they would find any sensible person reporting them to the school(and a minor's case, their parents/the police). Are their people who would bow to the "power"...yes. Are they the majority...i'd have to say no.
