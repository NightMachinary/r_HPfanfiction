For fanfiction? Also, you have to remember people can basically teach right out of school it looks like. Say Tonks had to go there because a teacher was needed, so they sent an auror. If it's sixth or seventh year, and they had feelings or were dating prior, is that bad? If course SS and anyone else though is a big no no in my opinion, because he's how much older while they're in school still.
