In real life, I can totally see this. Especially because of the differing circumstances. If you get right out school and start dating, sweet. Otherwise, it looks really unhealthy. A huge thing though is requirements. In HP, can't you teach right out of school? Whereas in life, you normally have to spend four years at college before you have the requirements. Also, lifespan is a huge thing. Five years seems like a bigger gap to us since we have half the lifespan.

Edit: Again, I'm in no way shape or form saying that it's okay in life. I'm also saying that it's a bit different in the HP Fandom.
