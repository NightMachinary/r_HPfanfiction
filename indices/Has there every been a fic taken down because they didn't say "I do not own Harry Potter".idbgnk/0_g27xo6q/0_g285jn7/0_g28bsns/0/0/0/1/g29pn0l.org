The only good teacher student romance storys ste the ones involving time travel such as Hermione meets snape when they are both only 6th years sort of ones or the ones where they have somehow gained immortality and are closer to 200 years old the 150 where 20 year really doesn't matter. The rebirth ones aren't bad either.
