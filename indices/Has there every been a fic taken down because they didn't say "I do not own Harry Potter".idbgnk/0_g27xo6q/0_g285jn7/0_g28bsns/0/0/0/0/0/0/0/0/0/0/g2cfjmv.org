I stand by what I said, since I do not believe fictional work is a sound argument for converting “evil” intent, but you make very good points. It is vilified (rightfully so), but art- particularly the majority which is fluff- is not real life and shouldn't be held to the same standard.

I have to say, the absolute funniest thing to me was reading up on US law to verify your comment is that the third “tong” of the US obscenity law is “does it contain value as art” because apparently a judge/jury has the power to decide if art has value
