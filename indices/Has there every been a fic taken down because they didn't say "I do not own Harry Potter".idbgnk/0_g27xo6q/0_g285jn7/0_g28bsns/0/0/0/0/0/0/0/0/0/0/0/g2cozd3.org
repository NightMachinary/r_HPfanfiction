The way I see it, it's the intent part that makes it an issue. I agree that art is an exception, but then the problem will always come down to how is it supposed to be judged or verified as art. Like you said, it's ridiculous that a jury should be a deciding factor on that, but then it's equally so to pass off every instance as just art assuming the creator says so. So what other choice is there than to let other people decide.

It would be stupid to look too far into a lot of things that could fall into question, since many are quite obvious as being art, but examples like the story I described aren't so cut and dry. Was it intended as art or was it an outlet showcasing the author's intent in real life to some unknown degree. It's not like that was just part of the story or it was looked at as bad or someone was trying to stop it, it was the sole purpose of the story and was written as if it was desirable. Intent is understandably punishable in the law for a lot of different things, so it's not like responding to it for this would be inconceivable.

So if the intent is punishable, and a work gives reason to believe it is displaying intent for pedophilia, or murder, or rape, what's to be done? Death threats get jail time, but that's because like you said they are a directed threat in real life. So we have possible intent with no specified target, so you can't jail them, but should the work still be circulated if it was made for that purpose? I personally don't think it should, and there's no part of me that thinks otherwise because even if that story was written as art, i don't see how it adds anything of value to society or to the people who read it. The only real argument that can be made for keeping it is entertainment, but then I also don't want anything around that supports that type of entertainment in the first place. All things considered, censorship is not the worst solution here, even if it's also not the best.

It's a wash, though. Like I said, it's fine if you disagree, I'm certainly not going to judge you for it. But I'll stand by what I said, same as you.
