Just because it's a relationship with a large age gap doesn't mean it's pedophilia. They could actually like each other despite the age difference. Not that I'm defending actual pedophilia, but sometimes people don't see teens as children. They see them as a potential partner and not a little kid they've known. That doesn't explicitly mean it's bad.

That being said, I don't like Snamione. But I think she can make her own decisions.

Pedophilia has been a new trend on Reddit recently. Grooming is everywhere, etc. Every relationship has grooming. How do you think you're get someone to like you? You show your best qualities and do this and what not. The thing is, people only like to call it grooming when it's between an older person and a younger person (not necessarily between an adult and a minor). Grooming isn't trying to get someone to like you. And, regardless of the first half of this reply, everyone needs to calm the fuck down.
