You are misusing that word, even though its a common mistake. It would only, by definition apply before puberty.

"Pedophilia is termed as pedophilic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and the manual defines it as a paraphilia involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty. "

Give it a read. Neither the article or myself condone sexual abuse of children. It just better to be educated.

​

I just get annoyed by words being misused as hateful labels.

Pedophilia would work if its an adult with a 1st year(female) student

Hebephilia would be better for the 2nd and 3rd year female students

Ephebophilia would probably cover all the other girls/young women.

​

Guys hit puberty later generally so those "years" wold be different for them...

​

​

As for everything else... honestly i find A lot of pairing sick and am disgusted by ANY words written about them.

Is Hermione/Snape any worse than Harry/Voldemort(no matter the age). Or what about Hermione/Draco, a "racist", elitist, spoiled, bully paired with one of his victims?
