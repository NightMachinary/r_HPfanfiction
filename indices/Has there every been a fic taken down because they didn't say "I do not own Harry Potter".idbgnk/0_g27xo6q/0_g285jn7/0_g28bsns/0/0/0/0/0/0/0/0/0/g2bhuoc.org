Yeah, it was user error, but there are still lines that should be drawn. Hate speech is rightfully and legally censored daily. Death threats, which are entirely fiction until acted upon, are illegal and punishable under the law. Fiction written by certain individuals is used as evidence when diagnosing mental problems and treatments, which becomes censorship in all but name. Slander is illegal. While there is room for debate about the sexualization of minors to some degree, with stuff like age of consent and same age couplings blurring the lines, the sexualization of pre-teens is pretty universally vilified, and is the basis for the US laws banning fictional works of minors committing sexual acts. The list goes on.

The point is, fiction is censored all the time with good reason in many cases. Maybe you disagree with me about were the line should be drawn, more power to you if you do, but there is no denying that the line exists.
