The tags exist for the dual purpose of easing the search for people who want to read those fics and for people like you to use the “exclude” filter (on ao3 anyway).

I find that it's better to adopt a libertarian stance on most stuff like this, as people will write whatever they wanna write and you can't, and shouldn't, impede on their freedoms- until real people start getting hurt. Encourage writers to tag their works for sensitive/triggering material so you can both enjoy using the same website without disturbing each other.
