By definition it wouldn't be... by the common use of "pedophile" use for anyone who does something sexual with anyone under the age of consent(or for some people anyone under the age of 18) it is.

But as the link i posted points out, Not all pedophiles are child molesters, and not all child molesters are pedophiles:

"Pedophilia is not an act, sexual assault is. This incorrect use of the term "pedophilia" needs to be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse are sometimes pedophiles, the meaning of the terms does not concentrate on it. Not all people who have sexually abused children are pedophiles. /Only/ when an offender has a /primary or exclusive sexual interest/ in */prepubescent children/* is when he can be called a *pedophile*.
