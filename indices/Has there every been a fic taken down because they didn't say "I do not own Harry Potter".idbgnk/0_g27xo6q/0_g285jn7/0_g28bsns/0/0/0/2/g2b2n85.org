Honestly, I assume most of the people who enjoy reading it (and many who are writing it) are girls around Hermione's age in the story who identify with her, and who have a weird teacher crush on Snape, doing it out of some kind of fantasy fulfillment (and who hopefully would still recognize that anything even resembling that in the real world would be abhorrent). Doesn't make it right or okay, just my guess on why someone would enjoy those stories (plus, out of a list of options for who could be reading those, it's the least creepy in my mind).
