Eh, I can agree with that for the most part, but there are limits. I remember one time I wasn't paying attention to tags and clicked on a H/G fic on ao3, it had her as a ten year old being stripped naked and cooked by her family before sexualizing the canabalism of "her love" Harry eating her alive. It was so poorly written and so out there I didn't have a clue what the hell was happening in it, and once I did I noped out faster than I ever had in my life. If I thought it would do anything I would have reported the story, and I was and still am genuinely concerned for whoever it was that wrote it.
