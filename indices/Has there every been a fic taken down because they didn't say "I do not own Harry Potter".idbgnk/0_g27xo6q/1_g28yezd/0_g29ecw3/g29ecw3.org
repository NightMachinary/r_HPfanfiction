Now that you mention it, I feel like JK herself took a lot of the ideas from post-HBP, pre-DH fics for the Deathly Hallows. I remember the scene of Bill and Fleur's wedding in the summer culminating with a Death Eater attack and people seeking refuge at the Grimauld Place being quite common. Also Harry being the final Horcrux and the final battle beginning with a siege of Hogwarts were quite common as well, but that that was the intent was quite obvious.

I also remember this particular fic (I think it was called either "The Seventh Horcrux" or "The Secret Horcrux) which was completed before the release of the Deathly Hallows where the author predicted that Ravenclaw's heirloom was a crown (in that story Auntie Muriel's tiara was a replica of it) and it was located in the Room of Requirements exactly at the same location as the diadem in DH. The author also kept an emphasis on the fact that Harry had to die, but eventually uses the Golden Snitch to create a Horcrux but puts Voldemort's piece of soul in it instead of his.

Also a lot of stories ended with Harry meeting Dumbledore or/and his family in the afterlife immediately before or after his final confrontation with Voldemort.

Then there was the Godric's Hollow attack scene but that one should have also been quite intuitive.

I felt like OotP and HBP were far more different than fans would have expected (that was about the time when the HP fanfiction community was at its beginnings), but when I read DH, I felt like I've read a lot of times before.
