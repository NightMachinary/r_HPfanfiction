Yep, dunno why you got downvotes, though “foreshadowing” is maybe a bit strong for that “found a room full of chamber pots” that Dumbledore mentions at the Yule ball. Maybe “references” or something, but still, this absolutely happened.

Same with the diadem being in the RoR, people were making a big deal about that because Harry found it in HBP when he hid the potions book, and same with the throwaway mention of the “heavy gold locket none of them could open” in OotP. They were heavily theorized on places like Mugglenet to be some of the remaining horcruxes, so it's really completely unsurprising to find them cropping up in fanfic before DH. Plenty of people were theorizing then about Harry being one too, though not as many as were talking about those two items.
