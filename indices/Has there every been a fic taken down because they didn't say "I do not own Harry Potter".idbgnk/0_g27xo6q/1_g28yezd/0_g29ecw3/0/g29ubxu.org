No she didn't.

This is what makes her a good writer. She built everything up with clues to the reader that some clever people could have guessed what was going to happen.

Harry being a horcux: 5th book had hugeee signs.

Locations of the horcruxes... Not unsurprising for one to be at hogwarts. Makes sense for the plot and voldemort. And there isn't that many places she could have put it that hid it from Dumbledore. She even mentioned the tiara when Harry entered the room of forgotten things in the 6th book.

Attack during the wedding... We knew there would be a wedding at the end of the 6th book. Good time to enter an attack.

She's always been great at foreshadowing. One of her best skills as a writer is her mystery elements.

The things that were unpredictable, like the hallows, had no similarities in fanfiction.
