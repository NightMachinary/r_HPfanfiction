  The things that were unpredictable, like the hallows, had no similarities in fanfiction.

The Deathly Hallows as a group no, but even in DH, only the Elder Wand arc spans throughout the book and there were definitely fanfics about Harry getting a stronger wand or some sort of weapon to beat Voldemort. Everyone knew about the Cloak of Invisibility and the part played by the Resurrection Stone was replaced in other stories by other means to finally talk to his family.

Regardless, you might be right and JKR did a lot of foreshadowing. I was still very young when the books were being released so maybe my brain overlooked some details. Even so, when I read DH first time it felt like I had read it several times before and I could easily guess where it's going. I sort of wished JK left more red herrings such as the unopenable door at DoM.
