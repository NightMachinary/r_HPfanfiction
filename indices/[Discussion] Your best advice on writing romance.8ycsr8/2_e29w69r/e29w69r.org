I think it really depends on if the story is centred on the romance or if the romance is a background thing in the story. Stories are about conflict, people overcoming challenges etc. If the romance is the centre of the story then you have a much harder time coming up with a genuine conflict that doesn't sound like teenage drama or stupidly contrived. You also need to decide if the conflict/challenge is in the couple coming together or what they face as a couple, you could even do both but than can feel like a drag without a clear division. A story does need an end, throwing challenge after challenge for the sake of putting more words on the page fatigues the reader very quickly and often the sources of conflict come across as increasingly outlandish. If the romance is a background of a story then make sure the story needs it before you put it in there.

With regards to what people find attractive, it can be anything for anyone. I once had a friend describe what he found attractive in certain people's noses over several pints before concluding his perfect nose on a girl was like a ski jump. Arse and eyes are a shallow but valid attraction. I like the way some people sound, their accents the way they use words at times. I come from a place where the local accent is being lost and a nasty hideous accent is creeping in from what was the London slums before they were cleared out. Its made me very aware of how people sound.
