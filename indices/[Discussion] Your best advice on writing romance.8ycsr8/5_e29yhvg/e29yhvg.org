Well, it kind of depends on what sort of romance you're referring to. Slow burn is going to be different than whirlwind, for example. Are you looking at an opposites attract? Hate turns to love? There are all different sorts of romance, so number one is figure out what kind you're going for.

The heart of all stories is conflict. Internal or external, there has to be some sort of conflict in the story. Is there something keeping the lovers apart or something throwing them together in an unexpected situation? An example of the latter is the movie Romancing the Stone. Joan Wilder is pressured by the external conflict of finding the jewel to save her sister, so she's forced to hook up with Jack Colton to achieve that end and romance ensues.

One thing to definitely avoid is contrived situations. The conflict must be something concrete and real with real repercussions within the story. A simple misunderstanding won't do and stories that have a misunderstanding as the main plot device are a huge pet peeve of mine. None of this "I saw you talking to [Dean, Neville, the Boggart] and I knew that meant you weren't interested in me!" Baloney.

As for what's attractive, that's going to be up to you and the characters you write about. There are the external, obvious things such as hair, eyes and body shape but don't forget the internals as well. Sense of humor, wit, general attitude (optimistic, pessimistic, loyal, introverted) ... all of these contribute to one person being attracted to another. When you're writing, put yourself in your POV character's shoes and think about the other character--maybe there's something in them that you yourself are attracted to--and highlight it. Try to avoid overly-flowery or descriptive words when highlighting a feature. For example, hair. Hair doesn't have to be long, flowing locks that caught the sunlight like a mountain stream. Hair can be a nice chestnut brown that framed her face perfectly, making his heart beat faster.

Take your time, think about what kind of romance you're wanting to portray, what the main conflict of the story is and who your characters really are and start writing it down.
