Late but a few thoughts:

- You don't go from strangers to in love overnight (breaks suspension of disbelief). Make sure to explore the stages of attraction, casual dating, serious relationship, etc.
- Agree with what others have said about body language - extremely important. I think physical contact that isn't sexual is very underrated. And the characters should be drawn to each other's physical traits too - ie searching for someone's hair across a room.
- Conflict is key, especially if the relationship is the focus of the story. There are only so many ways to generate conflict in a relationship so it can be predictable but here are some options ** External conflict: Family member disapproval, lives in danger, illness/deat ** Internal conflict: Cheating, jealousy, miscommunication, misunderstanding, information asymmetry (one partner knows something the other doesn't), partners want different things, pregnancy, etc

My favorite trope is when one partner thinks the other is dead. It's cliche but the angst and reunion are so fun. I also enjoy stories where a hetero couple has a kid but the male partner is unaware. Good luck!
