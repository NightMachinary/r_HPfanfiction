If you're writing a romance story, then it should be tied in with the conflict. /How does problem x affect character a and b's relationship? Does it drive them apart? Bring them together?/ If it is a romance that is budding, but not the center of the story, then I should be able to digest their relationship with relative ease.

Unless you're writing some sort of casual sex story, the main characters should NOT be having sex by the second date. If they're teens, the relationship is going to be awkward, painful, and cute. Adults seem to date a little more smoothly, but teens have some serious drama.

Finally, make the characters realistic. Take Voldemort (gross, I know). He is a literal sociopath that canonically cannot feel any form of love due to being conceived under the effects of a love potion. You'd have to change some serious character background to make him capable of being in a good relationship that could end happily. My point here is make sure characters have chemistry. Whether they end up together or broken apart, there should be some sort of chemistry that starts the chain of events.
