Make it natural, don't force it on the characters. Build it alongside your story and make it feels organic. I'm not a writer so I can't give you better advice but for me, this is the essential. One thing that makes me drop a lot of fanfictions is that the romance is unbelievable, I mean, there is no romance, no chemistry no nothing and then suddenly, in a matter of 2 chapters, they are a couple, so try to build your characters in a pace and as you present them to the readers, you present the romance alongside.

Sorry for any English errors, it's not my mother language.
