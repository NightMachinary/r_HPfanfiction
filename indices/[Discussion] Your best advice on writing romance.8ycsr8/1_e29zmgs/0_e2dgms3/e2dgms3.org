I'm not an experienced writer, so maybe take this with a grain of salt. Speaking from a reader's perspective.

  Maybe someone finds a guy's glasses dorky and dumb-looking while another thinks they make him look cute.

Going off of this one a little bit: To me a lot of romance is just characters /noticing/ things.

Maybe have your character mull over the fact that their love interest has one particular expression that matches to a feeling, or maybe they can't figure out the emotions behind it. Or they have a nickname they really dislike. A little nervous tic- tapping their figures, tucking hair behind their ear, rubbing their neck. A particular laugh that's different from normal. Hell, maybe they pronounce something in a particularly endearing way. A stutter when they're flustered. Anything! It makes them /unique/. It's a bit of depth to a character.

And don't get me wrong, I don't want six paragraphs talking about a particularly cute cough. Just mention it. Hell, do it mid dialogue. Then have their love interest break them out of their thoughts. Then they're embarrassed, and you can give /them/ some depth with how they deal with it.
