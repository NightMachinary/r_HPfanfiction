Tonks is nearly 7 years older then him, has a full time job, loving parents, and was raised magical.

They have nothing in common, has almost all of the problems of even someone Fleur and even more distance.

For them to even meet involves her intentionally giving up sleep or taking sick days so she can guard his house on and off for two months while remaining unseen. As a metamorphigis and someone with a muggleborn parent she would in fact be the most capable of remains unseen leading to her presence being the least noticeable to Harry.

She's a neat character but any relationship has to be contrived from the ground up.

The only interesting bit is you'll generally end up reading AU's which are almost always better.
