Yes! I dislike Remadora even more than my indifference towards Honks.

Tonks is such an underrated character, there could be so much more done with her, the creative advantage is limitless, and seeing her metamorphmagus abilities be used for only smut is so annoying because she could be so much more!

And the whole “true form” thing is so annoying to me, and I have no idea why. Sure I get that Harry has taken her walls down (or something like that) but something about it makes me feel icky. Perhaps because the idea is so stupid, she can open up to him in other ways, and she's settled on a form that she loves and that's that.

So many Honks fanfics are just self-inserts where she's every good personality trait ever and it really grates on my nerves
