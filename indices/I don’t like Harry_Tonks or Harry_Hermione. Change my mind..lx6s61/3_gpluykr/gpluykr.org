Honks get bonus points for not being Remadora, one of few ships I outright dislike rather than feel indifference towards.

I also always liked the idea of Honks in universes where Harry takes on the Auror job and where she survived, with them making a great team and getting closer over time. She's an interesting, and underused character.

The most common Honks by far is "true form" shenanigans where they're somehow forced together in 5th-6th year (usually with Tonks tasked to protect Harry). I was never really a fan of that version of the ship, mostly because it features a Tonks that doesn't really have agency and only serves to be a pretty face for Harry to be together with.
