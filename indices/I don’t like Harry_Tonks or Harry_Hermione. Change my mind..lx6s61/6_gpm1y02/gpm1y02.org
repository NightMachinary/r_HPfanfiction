I can firmly say that Harry/Hermione is my least favourite ship. I dislike any ship between members of the golden trio, but Harry/Hermione seems to become the default pairing in so many fics, and it's always so boring.

I actually like Harry/Tonks, though. I just wish there were more good fics with the pairing.
