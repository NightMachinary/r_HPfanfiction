Your dislike seems to be stemming from authors and their bad fan-fictions rather than tropes themselves. I am sure there is some Harry/Hermione story where Hermione has flaws like a real person and is not a self insert and there is probably some fan-fictions where Tonks is master spy and/or assassin for a secret branch of Magical Law Enforcement or some such thing and uses her shapeshifting for things other than satisfying her partners fetishes and fantasies.(although I am not sure about Tonks one since there are not as many Harry/Tonks fics as Harry/Hermione fics).

If you want you can write such stories. For example I would like to read a story where Hermione acts like a SJW only to realise the errors of her ways too late and struggles to gain back her friends trust. Likewise Ä± would like to read a story where Tonks is basically magical version of Black Widow or some similar thing.
