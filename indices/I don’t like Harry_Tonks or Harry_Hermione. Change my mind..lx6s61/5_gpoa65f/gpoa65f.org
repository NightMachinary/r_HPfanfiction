For Harry/Tonks, try 'Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass' by Temporal Knight. Honestly, if you don't like the ship in that story, you probably won't ever like it. (I'm not saying it's the best Honks story, just a really representative one). It's time-travel, and does address the age difference thing later on.

In terms of Harry/Hermione... there's no real 'representative fic' to recommend. Like, there's the Robst-likes, the post-war wistful ones, the fluffy short fics, the non-Robst Ron-bashers, the fem!Harry ones, the Harmony-plus-others fics, the clearly written by literature nerds ones, etc.
