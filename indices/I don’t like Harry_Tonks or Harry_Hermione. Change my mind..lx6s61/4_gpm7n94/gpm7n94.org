I have no problem with Harry/Tonks, as long as he's out of school first. She's seven years older than him, so any relationship when he's underage is just creepy (like those female teachers who sleep with their high school students).

Just noped out of a story where 12-year-old Harry is crushing on Tonks, which is completely normal and believable---but she's encouraging it, which sends us right back into creepy territory. Sadly, most of the Harry/Tonks stories I run across have him still in school, often with her a seventh-year student of 17 to his eleven-year-old firstie.* ::shudder::

*This only works with JKR's "bad at math" syndrome. When they first meet in canon, summer before 4th year, he has just finished 3 years of school while she's just completed a 3-year auror training programme. Thus, they did not overlap at Hogwarts. (Unless they did.)
