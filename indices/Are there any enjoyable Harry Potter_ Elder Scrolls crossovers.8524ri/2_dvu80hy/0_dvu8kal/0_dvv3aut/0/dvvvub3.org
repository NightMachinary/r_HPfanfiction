Sorry about how long it took me to reply, FFN was down when I first saw this and then I forgot about it entirely.

The dialogue just seems very stiff and has odd word choice sometimes.

#+begin_quote
  "Let your blood drop on top of the parchment." answered the older Potter "It is enchanted to reveal somehow certain details about the owner of the blood."
#+end_quote

Just as a quick example, I have no idea why he would specify on top of the parchment. Something like "Let your blood drip onto the parchment", or "Get your blood on the parchment." would work better, imo.

And then "It's enchanted to reveal details hidden in your blood." The main issues with that sentence is the 'somehow' which just makes it sound weird, and the 'it is'. Contractions are important; not using them makes things sound very robotic and formal. Which is occasionally something you want, but not in a random conversation between family. The rest is fine, really, though the 'owner of the blood' bit is a /little/ odd.

And later Harry says some skeletons are 'loitering' around some ruins. Which is a term I've only heard used in the legal sense. That may be a localization thing, or maybe your Harry is supposed to be using big words for the sake of it.

I'm trying really hard to be constructive and clear, but I'm not great at this.
