I was afraid it would be something like that.

The stiff dialogue and word choice comes from both my experience (or lack of) as a writer, and my limited vocabulary (as English is not my native language). Not trying to make Harry use "big words", as you said. I just thought those would be appropriate for the situation.

Regardless, thanks for replying.
