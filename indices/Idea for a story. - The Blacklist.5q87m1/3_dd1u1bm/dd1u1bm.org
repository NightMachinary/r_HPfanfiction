There is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1869273][a Drarry fic named The Darklist]] on the blacklist that's really well done. There are a bunch of interesting mysteries in this fic and a twist I didn't expect at the end. The whole thing feels AU enough that the slash shouldn't feel OOC. Worth the read I think even if you're not a slash fan. Linkao3(1869273)
