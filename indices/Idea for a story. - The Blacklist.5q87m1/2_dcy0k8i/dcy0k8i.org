I'd think Severus Snape during the first war would be the best expy of Red Reddington. Death Eater turns his coat and helps the Aurors hunt down more of them while trying to keep it on the down low so Voldemort doesn't find out. Maybe Voldemort was planning to hunt down the traitor before he got blown up by an infant.
