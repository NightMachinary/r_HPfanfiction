Well, that was basically what Harry was doing after the War.

It was perfectly reasonable for an Ex Death Eater/Snatcher to turn on his former comrades. Karkaroff did it after the First War. Snatchers, being opportunistic thugs to begin with, might exploit Ministry's temporary lack of manpower to curry favor with the new regime. After all, that Potter kid offed the immortal Dark Lord and that Weasley matriarch killed the dreaded Lestrange Bitch in single combat. Such powers were not to be trifled with. Better join them now when they still needed people. Cook up some sorry tales about being press-ganged (partly true) and deliver some marked ones to the Ministry would set you up nicely.

The Dark Lord's inner circle was among the richest of magical Britain, pissed off winners would undoubtedly make them PAY. Poor Death Eater A didn't have much gold, hadn't really committed any major crime apart from a few vandalism and a couple imperiuses for fun, he also happened to know a fleeing inner circle member's hideout, so A stood a good chance in avoiding prison if he turned early. He might even profit handsomely if he offed that inner circle member.

Harry was truly incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, demanded a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers. Kingsley was very happy to oblige, so the Revolution began in earnest.
