Man, I really fucking hate it when authors do that. I mean, I completely get leaving to go to better things; they don't owe us anything and should do what makes them happy. But every time an author just takes everything down it feels like a 'fuck you' to all the people that enjoyed what they'd written and might want to go back and read it again.
