I couldn't agree more - The only instance I could disagree is where digital space was limited, but I don't believe that to be the case with FF.net.

Edit: So I finally went and looked at the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1137344/esama][author's fanfic page]], and it appears that they actually intended to tell everyone "fuck you" based on the fact they cleared their profile and left "Love, the selfish bastard". Shrug, some people are just assholes.
