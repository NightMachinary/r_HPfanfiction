I've done some googling, and i'm pleased to report I've found an archive to esamas work on the DLP forums. I'm not sure if it's a complete archive, but Alone Together is definitely there.

The dropbox link is [[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/92776639/Esama.ZIP]]

And if you want to verify for yourself, the DLP page is here, the link is two thirds of the way down, posted by user esperjones. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=608767&styleid=6]]
