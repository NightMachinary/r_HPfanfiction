Also, EWE kinda pensive fic: linkffn(Brighter Morning) Harry has different kids

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1846319/1/Brighter-Morning]]

And a personal fav, Case 129

It's a case fic that's gritty and genred. It's a noir, dystopian senario with a highlight on wizarding law enforcement. The main characters are rando graduated slytherins.
