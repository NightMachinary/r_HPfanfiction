Let's assume that NEWT courses are all combined (Hogwarts loses students and the remainder drop some classes), and all other courses are doubles. Professor Snape, teaching a core class, has 10 lower classes and 2 upper classes. Let's say it's two sessions per week per class. That's 24 sessions.

He can handle 1.5 hours per class. He's got to do about five sessions per day -- perhaps two in the morning and three in the afternoon. And he gets one free period. This gives him 36 hours of lecture and labs, plus patrolling the halls, overseeing detentions, cleaning and maintaining the potions classroom, and so on.

(He could do two-hour classes and not die, but that would be a bit grueling for him.)

Now let's look at it from a student's point of view. Seven core classes as opposed to Professor Snape's twelve classes. Students in years 1 and 2 spend, on average, half as much time in class as professors. Hogwarts needs to double its teaching staff.

Anyway, that would be 14 sessions per week in years 1-2, 18 per week in years 3-5, and call it 12 per week in years 6-7. Split across five days, we're looking for 3-4 classes a day at most.

Ever wonder why the Marauders had enough free time to be pranksters and still become Animagi? Or how the twins managed to make their products while still in school? It's because they had so much free time compared to a normal working schedule.

edit: this does mean it's a bit silly for Hermione to have enough trouble fitting three extra classes into her schedule that she needed a Time-turner. She'd still have had more free time than Professor Snape!
