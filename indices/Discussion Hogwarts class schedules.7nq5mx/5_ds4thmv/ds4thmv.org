Here's my headcannon: (Without extra teachers [or handing out rare ministry artifacts nilly-willy], and without inconsistencies like the Gryffs having Divination and Defense alone but being paired with the Slytherins in Snape's class)

For Potions, if years 1-3 have two classes a week, and years 4-7 have three, that adds up at 30 hours for the teacher. (2[hours]x2[sections]x3[year grups] + 3x2x2 + 3x1x2 = 12 + 12 + 6 = 30)

For Arithmancy, it would be three classes a week for all years. (3x2x3 + 3x1x2 = 18 + 6 = 24)

For fourth and fifth years, that would be a full schedule if they've got three electives - in my headcanon, there are some theory classes in Astronomy -, so there'd be 29 classes in a day and 1 at night)

I know this goes against some stuff in the books - but then again, JKR had Umbridge's first class on a Saturday -, but that's the way I made it add up.

We /do/ know that there are at least six slots a day (the first Monday - /cough/ Saturday /cough/ - in fourth year was History, double Potions, Divination and double Defense.)

EDIT: Stupid markdown\\
EDIT 2: Maths mistake, 3x2x3 = 18 not 12.
