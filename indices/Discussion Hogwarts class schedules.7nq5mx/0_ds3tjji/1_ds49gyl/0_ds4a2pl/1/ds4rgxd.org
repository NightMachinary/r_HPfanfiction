Well we also need to consider that you can likely take such tests outside of school, or perhaps in the years between OWLs and NEWTs. There are other possibilities beyond taking 12 classes the same year.

And I agree about the 1 professor per subject bit, but I have always thought that since Harry misses much the final 2 years or so, we simply don't see enough. Perhaps there are TA's or teacher assistants just like in college who sometimes teach or take over classes.

Although JK Rowling's material was full of contradictions and somewhat messy canon, so there is always that.
