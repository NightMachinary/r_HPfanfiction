Well, I did some of the math.

A lot of this is guesswork, since precise times are very hard to come by. Also, some of the books (especially OoTP for some reason) actually mention the specifics of Harry's schedule a fair bit, at least in terms of having X class on Monday morning or Y class on Wednesday afternoon, so I could have tried to come up with more specific details, but that would have taken me a bit too far into the realm of contradictions, since Harry's class schedule doesn't seem to be the most logical thing when you look at it all-together (or at least as much of it as you can piece together). Also, it's really hard to find specific citations of their class schedules, most of that info is randomly scattered through the books in tiny little tidbits, and I didn't feel like taking the time to read through the entire series again just for this purpose.

In addition, the closer you look, the more contradictions you find. There's the example I mentioned of multiple people earning twelve O.W.L.s, despite time travel being required to attend twelve classes. And, there's the fact that there's no way the teachers could simultaneously fit seven years and four houses of students into their schedule without /tons/ of overlapping. If the average subject takes up only two class slots per week (a conservative estimate), even if /every/ class had two houses in it at once, a professor would need to teach twenty-eight classes in twenty slots. Although, come to think of it, N.E.W.T. classes generally have low enough numbers to combine all four houses, so if all of those were fully combined, the number would actually be twenty-four. But we know that many classes took more than two blocks per week (there would be a double and it would happen on multiple days), and many classes only had one house in them. Hogwarts could not possibly have functioned with only one professor per subject.

*TL;DR:* I did the math, but in order to avoid contradictions, at a certain point I stopped doing the math and instead just made some common sense assumptions.
