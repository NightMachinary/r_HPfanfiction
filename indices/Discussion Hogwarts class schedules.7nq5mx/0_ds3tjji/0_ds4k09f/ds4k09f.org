fwiw, when I laid the class schedule out in excel, the bottleneck was on the teachers. They simple didn't have enough time in the day to actually teach everyone. Like, years 1-5 are split into 2 groups, and then there's year 6 and 7, which means 12 classes for one teacher. Even split up into A and B groups that's not really enough time if the classes are of any significant length as well as the ability to have a "double" class.
