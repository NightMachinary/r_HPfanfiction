The one thing I can think of is a two-week schedule, with classes being doubled for one group in week 1 and for the other group in week 2. My own university did this, whatever the reason.

I doubt this is what is actually happening and instead it's probably just another showcase of Madam Rowling not being good at maths, but I figure if one wants to have something that fits and works with just one teacher per subject it's probably the easiest explanation that makes any kind of sense.
