Not counting Astronomy in the evenings, there are four standard class blocks per day. The "standard" class time is about 90 minutes, with doubles being up to three hours. Two blocks in the morning and two in the afternoon.

Your average third through fifth year student probably has at least 80% or more of these class blocks filled, meaning they would have either three or four classes every day.

First and second year students have less subjects and more free time. Sixth and seventh year students have fewer subjects, but more intense classes, so their schedules are probably just as full.

Some reasoning below:

First and second years only take the seven mandatory subjects. Third through fifth years must add at least two of the five possible electives. So most people took nine or ten classes. Hermione was only able to take all twelve with a time turner because of overlapping classes (and I think that there were multiple overlaps) so I would hazard a guess that 10 is the maximum under normal circumstances. (Except Bill, Percy, and Barty Crouch Jr. also got twelve O.W.L.s so that doesn't really make sense.) Once you get your O.W.L.s, you're more are less considered qualified, and the N.E.W.T.s are much like advanced study. Students are expected to drop a number of subjects at this point, especially since they need certain grades to secure a spot in N.E.W.T. classes. I'm not sure there's even a minimum number of classes one must take at this point. But by the time you get to this level the classes you do have probably have way more double lessons filling the blocks anyway.

But let's consider the scenario of years 3-5, where most students will have 9 or 10 classes. Younger students get more of a break and advanced students are just specializing in specific subjects, so these are your years with the full schedules, at least in terms of the number of subjects.

The first classes of the day begin at 9am. There are two morning classes with a bit of a break (probably a very short one) between them, or it's one block if you have a double. Lunch probably begins at noon, since the afternoon classes begin at 1pm. Curfew is at 9pm, at which point students must be back in their common rooms. However, besides the time I'd expect to be set aside for dinner, students need time in the evenings to be able to use the library and study with students in other houses. So dinner has to start pretty early. It actually begins before 5, since Harry once went to dinner early in order to grab some food before a 5:00 detention with Umbridge. Which means there can be only two class blocks in the afternoon.

With five days of classes per week, four blocks per day, that's twenty class blocks up to be filled by ten classes. So then you've got to consider doubles, and repeating classes. If half of the classes were doubles (reasonable since we frequently hear about doubles for the five most "core" classes) and half of the classes meet twice a week (probably a conservative guess considering the frequency at which we hear of the same class on different days), ten non-astronomy classes would fill your schedule. Most students during these years probably have 8 non-astronomy classes, so that would leave you with an 80% full schedule. This is mostly dependent on how many times a class meets per week, so 8 classes could easily fill your schedule too.
