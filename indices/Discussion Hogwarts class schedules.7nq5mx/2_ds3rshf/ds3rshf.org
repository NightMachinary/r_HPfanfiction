So I worked out a whole class schedule for one of my series -- I had to add multiple teachers per department to make it all work, but what I have is four per day for first years, with six total class slots per day total. Once students get to third year, they'll be taking five to six classes a day, depending on their schedule (by classes, I mean class blocks -- some classes are double lessons).
