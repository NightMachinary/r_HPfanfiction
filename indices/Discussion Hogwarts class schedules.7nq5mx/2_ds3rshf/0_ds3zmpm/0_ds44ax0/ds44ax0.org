I made a table in a google doc with each time slot and which classes were offered during it. Since my fic focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all in Slytherin, I figured out the schedule for them. Once I got to figuring out the schedule for the upper years (3rd and beyond) I scheduled some classes at the same time (ie Runes and Muggle Studies). For 6th and 7th year, the schedules are super messy because in my AU there's more class options, so class overlap was figured out depending on which classes my main three needed to take.
