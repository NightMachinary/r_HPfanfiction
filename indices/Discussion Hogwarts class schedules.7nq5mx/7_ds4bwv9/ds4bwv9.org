I always go with five hours a day (Sometimes that means five classes a day, and sometimes it means four classes (Like when they have double Potions). Like an ordinary British school.

I had a whole schedule set up for the school once... I can't remember what story it was, but I do have it on my SD Card... :o

EDIT: Found it. I actually did six hours of lessons per day (I always thought it was five like an ordinary British School but I guess I couldn't fit everything into twenty five lessons) but for Year One I gave them four lessons of everything but Flying (Which happened on a Tuesday during fifth period) and Astronomy (Midnight on a Monday, sharing it with the Seventh Years :p). They also get four free periods a week, which I suppose would be Study Hall more than free periods.

I also found out that I only did Year One and Year Six for some reason but I have spaces for all Seven Years. :)
