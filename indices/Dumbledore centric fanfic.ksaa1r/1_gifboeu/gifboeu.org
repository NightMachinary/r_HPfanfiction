Beside Me... Always is an 82-chapter, 600,000-word retelling of Harry's story from Dumbledore's perspective. While I haven't read it in a long time and it may have weaknesses I didn't notice when I was younger (I was a far less critical reader back then), I remember enjoying it at the time as one of very, very few stories that I felt did Dumbledore justice. Hope you enjoy it.
