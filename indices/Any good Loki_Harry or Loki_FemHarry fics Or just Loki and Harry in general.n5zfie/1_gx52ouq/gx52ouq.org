[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17121188][The Best Avenger, According to Teddy Lupin]] is a short sweet Harry/Clint fic. Highly rec. *Summary:* The only thing Teddy wants for Christmas, besides the new Cleansweep, is to meet Hawkeye aka the best Avenger.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13038294][Waiting]] short Harry/Loki soulmate fic *Summary:* Harry's soulmark words are not written in English. Loki's are. It makes things complicated for both of them. And it means a lot of waiting

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1272098][Your Soul is bound to mine]] is a brilliant series. Every work is Harry paired with a different Avenger (Soulmates) slash and het. Highly rec
