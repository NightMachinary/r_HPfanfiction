I think after it being a part of him from the get go, Harry becomes used to it for the most part except the obvious connection and the consequences of it. Probably never gets a headache again after it's gone. Overall that one horcrux was probably the weakest of them all because it was accidental and Voldemort had already split his soul 5 other times and I assume each time it was split, the soul he put in each was a smaller part. It never did possess him or try to overcome him like the locker or diary. I do like when fanfics use it to help influence the actions of the Dursleys. We know what they can do to a magical being so imagine what it would do to someone that at the very least dislikes them who couldn't fight it at all. Any negative thought etc would have been magnified and of course Harry would have been hated. Petunia wasn't a witch and was jealous of Lily and didn't want anything to do with her because of it from what we know. Imagine seeing her nephew show up, no explanation beyond a letter. Magic split the sisters apart and now she has to look at her magical nephew as he grows up, look at his eyes and see Lily. The pain and suffering, the jealousy and hate are made worse by the Horcrux influencing her and Vernon.
