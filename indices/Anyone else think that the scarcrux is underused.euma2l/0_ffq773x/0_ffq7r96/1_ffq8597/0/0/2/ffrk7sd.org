Harry is clever and cunnings, WHEN he fells the absolute need to. Something often passed over is that harry was a damaged child form the onset. he was already conditioned to only do the bare minimun, and the mind seldom is logical (ironic isn't it) so he already had a mentallity to only do as well as he needed in EVERYTHING unconsiosly. Clever is clever, no matter if it was a fluke gamble from a 12yo, a logic leap on a fucked up time-paradox or a double bullshit pretending to be dead and then getting lost in the haze of battle. thing is he really only put his gray matter between his ear to work, when he absolutely felt cornered. I can tell you that 80%; if not more, of our traumas and fixations are devolopted on our early childhoods. Just think about it and connect the dots.
