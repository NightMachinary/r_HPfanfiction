I don't in any way mean this as an insult to you now, but you must have been a spectacularly stupid child if you wouldn't have thought to hide something you didn't want found under a floorboard you knew was loose. I don't remember when this happened specifically, but I looked it up and it appears he did this in the fourth book. He was 13/14 at the time. I wouldn't consider it clever for even a young child (I'm honestly not sure why you think hiding something in a floorboard is any more clever than a closet or under a bed, it's a pretty common idea), but at that age you'd have to be a downright idiot not to think of it.
