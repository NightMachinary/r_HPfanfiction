What is it about loose floorboards that makes them special to you? Like, if someone has something they don't want their parents to find and they know there's a floorboard in their room that isn't nailed down, what about that situation makes you think someone wouldn't put two and two together and hide their stuff in the floor? You make it sound like you think everyone that isn't super intelligent and hasn't been abused is borderline retarded and wouldn't be able to think of a better way to hide something than just tossing it in their closet. At this point, it's not even Harry's cleverness I'm talking about, I'm just honestly confused about why you think this is such an odd thing for someone to do. I'm also not sure why you think you'd need to have a particularly stressful or harsh life to have an item you want to hide or protect.

I don't know man, you don't come off like you're too stupid to walk and talk at the same time so I think you're just underestimating how simple an idea this is.
