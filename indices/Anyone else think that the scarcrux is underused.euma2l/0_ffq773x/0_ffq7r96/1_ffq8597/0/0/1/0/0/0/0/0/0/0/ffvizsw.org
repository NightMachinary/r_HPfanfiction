You know that's not actually true in real life, though, right? I get we're talking in a subreddit dedicated to a children's book series, but you know real life isn't a children's book series, right? In real life, the simplest plans are the ones people think of first because they're so simple and obvious. Hiding something in a loose floorboard is very simple and obvious, so most people will think it. That kind of story-telling cliche is what authors that can't think of actually clever things to write fall back on.

Even your own logic doesn't make sense. In the beginning of this thread, hiding something in some floorboards was apparently complex enough that doing so makes Harry clever because most people are too stupid to think to do it and putting them under a bed or in a closet is the simple and common tactic. Now you're saying that the simple tactic is actually the clever one because people won't think of it for some reason (???) and hiding something in a floorboard is actually so stupidly simple that most people will overlook it.
