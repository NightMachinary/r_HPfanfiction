It might not be cunning perhaps, but definitely clever to say the least. I don't know about you, but I was pretty stupid as a kid, maybe if I had been treated like Harry, I would have used different means to make sure I was fed, but yeah, I don't think a lot of people would think about hiding stuff in a loose floorboard.

Under the bed, or in a closet is typically where you tend to hide things, under a lose floorboard is pretty clever (at least, imo).
