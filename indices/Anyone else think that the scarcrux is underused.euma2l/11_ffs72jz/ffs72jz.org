I can't remember details, but at least one fic I've read has his holly-and-phoenix wand no longer be a good match for him once the scarcrux is gone. I've also seen it change his magical signature (which I don't believe is a canon concept).

In the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] series by flamethrower (Snarry, still in progress), a horcrux in a living being has to destroy something in the host to make room. It's determined that, in Harry's case, it's his sense of self-preservation: he only acts when it will protect others, disregarding any thought to his own safety. It explains why he puts up with the Dursleys' behavior.

In a few fics, such as Some People Never Learn from Their Mistakes by Elvirakitties linkao3(7483032), "Tom" talks to Harry in his head.

Many fics have Harry's magic damaged by the removal/killing of the scarcrux.

On a side note, I like the fics where Harry gets hit with an AK either at the end of the TriWiz or in the Ministry, and the horcrux is gone ahead of Dumbledore's schedule. (A guilty pleasure are fics where the goblins or some other agency remove it, because of course Dumbledore's hubris would not allow him to even research whether others can remove it.) One fic I've read (The Accidental Animagus, perhaps?) has surgeons physically remove the scarring, which goes all the way through his skull into his brain.
