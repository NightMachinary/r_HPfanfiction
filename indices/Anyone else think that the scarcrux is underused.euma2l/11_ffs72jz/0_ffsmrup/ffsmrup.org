I like the idea of the wand not being compatible but I much prefer something like Cadmean victory where Ollivander uses the Phoenix feather in a new wand

I do like fics where the horcux is removed early but dislike the bashing same with the removal via muggle methods because i prefer to think of the hot tux as attached to Harry's soul rather than just being stuff skin deep
