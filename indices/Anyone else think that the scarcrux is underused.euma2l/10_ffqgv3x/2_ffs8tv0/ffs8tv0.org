Well, Harry was able to handle most of the horcruxes (terrible conjugation: shouldn't it be horcruces?) without setting them aflame, including his scar itself. (The only ones he never touches are the ring --- which he only saw after the soul fragment was removed --- and the snake.) The diary didn't react even when the soul shard was active, when Harry was communicating with it. We're never given any details on Lily's protection (surely she's not the only mother to refuse to move aside to let her child be killed), but from the given facts it seems that it only affects Voldie when embodied.
