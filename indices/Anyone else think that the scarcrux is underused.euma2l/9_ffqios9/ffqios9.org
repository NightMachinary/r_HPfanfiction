The scar Horcrux is the magical concept I despise most in all of canon. It makes no sense IMO that Voldemort, after just being defeated by Lily's protection, is able to overcome it with only a piece of his soul.

That's why I try to get rid of it as quickly as possible in any of my stories. I also don't enjoy it as a plot point because by my logic, it should not be there in the first place.
