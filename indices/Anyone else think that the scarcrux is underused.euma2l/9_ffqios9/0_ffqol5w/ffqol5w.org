In some stories it says that most of the protection magic was spent fighting Voldemorte's 'Avada Kedavra'.

And then Dumbledore uses the protective magic to protect the Dursleys' house, causing it to need more time to recover to fight the scarcrux, and as the years went by Harry needed the magic to recover from injuries and malnutrition.

And each school year the magic was used to help Harry get through the challenges of the year.

I know that this theory has many holes, but it is the best I found.
