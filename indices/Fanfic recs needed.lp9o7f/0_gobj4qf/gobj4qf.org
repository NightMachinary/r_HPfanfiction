linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) --. Remus and Sirius during the 12 years in Azkaban. The ending is very Grant/Sirius/Remus and I loved it.

The following are stories from authors I adore that focus on Black Family stories. So any of their works are worth reading.

linkao3(Practical Applications of Arithmancy by JanuaryGrey) linkao3(They're Hiding Inside Me by TheDivineComedian) linkao3(The Dog Days of Summer by Marie Kavanagh)

If you want more romance focussed Wolfstar then linkao3(Dress Up in You by MsKingBean89) linkao3(Text Talk by Merlywhirls)
