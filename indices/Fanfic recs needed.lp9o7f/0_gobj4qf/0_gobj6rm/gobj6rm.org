  Sirius is in Azkaban and Remus, for want of a better option, is getting on with his life. Sirius can only remember the worst parts of his life and Remus can only continue trying to live his, but eventually their separate threads must collide.*complete* (at last!)

  Sirius knew there would be consequences for taking Muggle Studies rather than Arithmancy like his parents wanted. His father always had a way of driving the point home though.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  Kate Heightmeyer sees Atlantis from a different perspective. She is the voice of reason behind the daily chaos, the note of stability amongst the cacophony of crisis. Kate's story intertwines her life pre-Atlantis with her experience as the resident psychologist, witnessing her fellow women's triumphs and insecurities, sharing in their victories and defeats, in the little moments that build the Atlantis mission into what it is.
