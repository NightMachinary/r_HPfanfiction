  Sirius Black and James Potter are successful and famous tattoo artists. Their manager Lily insists they hire a piercer to cover their busy schedules, and Sirius does not approve of that idea even slightly.This fic is now completed, but there's still sequel action going on at Marauder Ink 2: Black and Grey(if you think there's a tag missing/something I've overlooked, please get in touch - either comments or on tumblr (jennandblitz) and I can update things!)
