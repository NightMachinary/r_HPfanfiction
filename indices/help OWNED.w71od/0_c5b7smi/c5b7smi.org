I just googled, and it looks like a fair number of people are looking for this fic not being able to find it. From some forums I found, it looks like the author went by TwilightDarkness82, if that helps you find it. It also claims that the author currently writes Twilight fics under the name Deavlynn.

At this point, it looks like your best bet is trying to contact the author directly. Lost fics is becoming a serious problem, you might want to consider going through and saving copies of your favorite fics if you have time, because a lot of the classics from the golden age of HP fanfic are starting to disappear.
