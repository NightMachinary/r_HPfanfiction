Hello, I'm looking for a copy of Tears falling into darkness by Evil Minded as the autor took it from several sites. Do you happen to know where I could find it?

It date from around 2010, it was a story of a really abused Harry who when he arrived at Hogwart got to live with Snape. It was a really long story but incompleted.

Thanks for your help
