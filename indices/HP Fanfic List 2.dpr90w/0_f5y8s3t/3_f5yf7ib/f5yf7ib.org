  Cedric's death marked Harry. It made him think. Really think. About life. About death. What it means to live and what is important in life. His priorities change. His perception of the world and people within it changes.As he evaluates his life until now, he comes to the realisation that his life has never been his own and that he was never truly alive. Determined to change that, he makes a decision; he is going to take his life into his own hands. He is going to be the only one in charge of himself and his happiness. Because he wanted and deserved to be happy. He wanted and deserved to live without people meddling and trying to control him, without trying to hurt him. He was aware people would be confused. They will have questions. Some will support him, some will absolutely resent him. He still wasn't sure who will fall into which category, but he honestly didn't give a damn about it, because almost nobody seemed to give a damn about him either.

  Gringotts and Hogwarts have failed to hide it, so as a last resort Dumbledore turns to the only other place that can rival them. Nurmengard, warded by two of the brightest wizards of all time and almost faded from memory. But hiding it from one Dark Lord puts it within easy reach of another and it might just be the missing piece that lets him escape.Idea credit to Darth Krande, written with permission.

  Hermione was by no means an expert in Dark Magic, what she needed was someone who was. Gellert Grindelwald, one of the most powerful dark wizards of all time, was certainly no fan of this 'Voldemort'. Maybe they could reach an agreement.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better.It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  Harry Potter felt like two different people on even the best of days. Life was a series of duties, of appointments to fill, of masks to put on. There were four different masks he was wearing, and personally he thought it worse than when he had been at war.Then he comes across the battered journal of Abraxas Malfoy...He always knew that his 'saving-people thing' would get him into troubleBig Thanks to @bellachrome for both helping beta this and for writing all of Tom's POV scenes <3
