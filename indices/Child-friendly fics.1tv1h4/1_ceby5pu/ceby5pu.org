[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/][Just a Random Tuesday]] by Twisted Biscuit. It is focuses on an adult (McGonagall) rather than any of the kids so don't know if that will be off putting, but it's got no sex stuff or violence.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1963825/1/][Mine]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/483952/][Gillian Middleton]] has several sequels. Totally kid-friendly given that Harry is 5 years old.
