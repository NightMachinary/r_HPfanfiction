I really enjoyed Finding Why by B. A. Ware recently. It's poorly edited (grammatical and sentence flow errors) but very kid-friendly until the veeeeery last chapter or two, where there's one implied sex scene and a scene the next morning in bed together. It does not say "naked" or "penis" or anything but it's pretty obvious what's going on... I would have been OK with it at 10, especially after all the awesomeness of the first 94 chapters.
