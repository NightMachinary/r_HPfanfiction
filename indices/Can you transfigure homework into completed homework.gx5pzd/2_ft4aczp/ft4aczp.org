Maybe? All in all we really don't get much information about transfiguration in cannon and so need to speculate a lot based in other fandoms and HC's.

Personally I don't believe the person would need to memorize everything they want written, such a focus would be humanely impossible and we know that even 11 years-old manage to do it in less than a week of learning the subject exists, this points to transfiguration being much easier than this, I believe that this particular HC came from FMA.

But my HC is that the person would have to have a clear idea of what they would want in the homework, or it would be like asking an accountant to build a spaceship, they can't create something if they don't have any idea of the final product.

Adding up both we have that the person wouldn't need to focus in details on every world written to transfigurate homework but would need to know the subject being written about, so I believe that while they could do it the student would have no control about how the information was passed to the paper. Like, there is a big difference between explaining in four paragraphs what is mathematics, talking about it's history and uses, and just writing “IT TURNS A NUMBER INTO ANOTHER” in letters big enough to fill the same space, technically both fulfill the general purpose of talking about the subject but no professor in the world would seriously consider both of the same quality.
