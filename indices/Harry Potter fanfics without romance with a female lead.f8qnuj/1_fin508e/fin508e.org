I know a few good plot focused fics where romance is just a side thing mentioned here and there. Not many fics completely without romance, except for those unfinished ones still in second year or so. Here's fics I read with female leads, in no particular order:

Linkffn(New Blood)

Linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist)

Two Slytherin Hermione stories without much romance. Not much beyond the first two years.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Hermione oriented story with romance barely mentioned in the sequel.

Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5) is actually Neville centric, but he's the villain while Hermione is the hero.

Linkffn(Coven by Naidhe)

An entire coven of witches, although their close friendship could turn into romance if the next chapter drops... If that ever happens. So far they've only committed murder together.

Linkffn(The Daring Win)

Umbridge centric! Definitely strong female lead, no romance!

Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider)

Petunia centric! Strong female lead, romance with Sirius mentioned on the side but not very explicit.

Linkffn(A little child shall lead them)

Time traveling Hermione changed history because she loves Harry, but now she's twenty and he's one. Can't really make anything happen there.

Linkffn(Just a random Tuesday)

McGonagall centric! Strong female, no romance!
