When I copypasted some chapters, I changed every name to Bob and deleted last names (except when it was something like Mr. [Name], in which case, I entered Jackson). I didn't remove any references to plot points (such as magic, or ki, or spaceships, or superpowers, etc.) since it would be super tedious and may dilute the style (for example not having fantasy elements in a fantasy fic would make it just about a trip to someone else's country for something like LotR).
