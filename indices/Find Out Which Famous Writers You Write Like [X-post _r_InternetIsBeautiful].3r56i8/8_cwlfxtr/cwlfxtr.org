Well, firstly this is going to end up pretty flattering whatever crap gets entered. I tried chapter one of My Immortal and it said JK Rowling. Probably because it uses the names used in the Harry Potter books. Or an approximation of them, anyway.

That said I was still rather happy with my results. For the most part my stories are meant to read fairly similarly to JKs work. And, for the most part, this says they do, but that's probably down to the shared characters. Much more pleasing is the fact that my LotR crossovers are similar to Tolkien, my original sci-fi ideas read like Douglas Adams and Arthur C Clarke, and my Dickensian London story reads like Dickens.

So that's nice.
