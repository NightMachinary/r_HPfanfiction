I got a lot of different ones too. (Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, David Foster Wallace, J. K. Rowling, and H. P. Lovecraft) For me, at least, I can tell that there's definitely a stylistic difference between all of them. It does seem like there's a slight similarity between what I wrote and what it's saying it's like (at least for the authors I've read) but I'm probably stretching it.
