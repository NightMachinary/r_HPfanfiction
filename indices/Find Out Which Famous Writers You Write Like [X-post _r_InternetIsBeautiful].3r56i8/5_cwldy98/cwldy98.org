My HP Fanfiction is JK Rowling (go figure, but nice to know I nailed it)

My Buffy fanfiction is Ursula K. Le Guin (earthsea, etc) which surprised me since I don't remember actually reading anything by her..

My current project is barely 3k words long, but apparently it reads like Edger Allen Poe... I'm not sure what to feel about that since it is my first truely original fic in a long time... interesting I guess...
