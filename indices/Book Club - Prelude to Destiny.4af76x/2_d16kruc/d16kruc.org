I loved it. It was well written and the story was pretty well paced, although the end came fast. Lily's character was developed really well, building on some of Harry's character traits in canon. Similarly for other canon characters.

Some of the OCs were good, [[/spoiler][especially Gertrude, and I loved the twist at the end with her and Sirius.]]

I also loved [[/spoiler][the game - I now have an unsatisfied desire to play lasertag again.]]

Thanks for bringing this to Book Club.
