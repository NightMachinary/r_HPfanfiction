I'm new here, but I stumbled upon this post so I hope it's okay if I interject -- Prelude to Destiny is one of my favorite J/L fics. I really like the [[/spoiler][parallel development of the J/L relationship with the R/L.]]. I think the characters are well developed and rounded out, and the OCs are interesting -- especially Gertrude!
