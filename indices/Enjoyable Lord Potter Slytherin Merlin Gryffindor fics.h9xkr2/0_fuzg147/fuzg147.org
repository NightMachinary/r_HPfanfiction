There's mjimeyg's linkffn(Ah, Screw it). There's no real romance to speak of, but it is a harem fic(most of the romance, what little there is, comes from the girls in his harem trying to seduce him, and him doing his best to make them happy without actually allowing himself to be seduced. It's a Peggy Sue fic. He thinks he's too old, they don't care.)
