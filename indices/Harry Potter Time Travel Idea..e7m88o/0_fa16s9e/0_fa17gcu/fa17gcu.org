The Black are an influential family. He could decide because it reminds him of Sirius. And during Harry's stay at Sirius's place. He already has some knowledge of the Black family. So he would decided with something he already knows of.

The coordination and implementation of Reincarnation puts me off tbh. I find it unrealistic.

I also don't like having an powerful character from start, but as I said.. because of the de-aging caused by the time Turner he will have to remaster his skills again. He has knowledge of them but can't outright perform them.

Why Slytherin? It is where most of the death eaters come from. In order to put a cap on Voldemort's recruitment effort, save Snape because of the debt he owes him, remove the stain upon Slytherin.
