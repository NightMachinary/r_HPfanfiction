Rather bland and generic. Why black? Why not something else, rosier? Selwyn and what not? Why slytherin? Why not hufflepuff? Why not reincarnation? Instead of coasting previous experience, how about he has to learn everything starting from walking and so forth. After all, human brain reaches maturity around 20-25 years of age and mature brain does not fit in a baby skull. No matter how mature he thinks he is, childs physiology limits him, he needs naps etc. So no obnoxious little twerp that thinks he comes as a genius and prodigy instead of possessed demon child? How about having vague memories in his previous life? Learning to somewhat trust those memories he has deeply rooted distrust for dumbledore & co.
