It's definitely not new ground. I would like Harry to be Independent from Dumbledore in this regard, follow somewhat in Tom Riddles path. Similar but not the same. Effectively this is a story about a Tom Riddle who does everything he did in Hogwarts, except killing and creating Horcruxes, and becomes somewhat of a Dumbledore; strong wizard who champions values of equality and fairness.

It's not simplistic as you stated. Which I like simplistic fics, but I'll try to use realistic reasons for the complexities that shall appear.
