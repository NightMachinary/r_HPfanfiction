This is not exactly new ground. It sounds quite similar to quite a few Time Travel stories out there. At least in the ground work of it. Time travel HP stories are my favorite so I have read a shit ton. Honestly most of the concept sounds same old same old.

But I will give you credit for the last little bit...

  Because he knows Voldemort is coming, he creates his own Death Eaters. Called the Order of the Midnight Sun. It is made of friends from Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw. Hydra is creating his own Death Eaters to combat Voldemort in the future. They train in the dark arts, defense arts, mind arts, ancient runes, protective magics and spell creation.

It would be interesting to see a story where Harry gets the jump on Voldemort and creates what are effectively his own Death Eaters. The way you describe it comes off as sort of a combination between Death Eaters and Order of the Phoenix in terms of personality. A group less about pure blood supremecy and politics, and more about simple power, knowledge, and control.

There are stories out there where Harry does things somewhat like this, but it is usually a lot more simplistic. He gets Dumbledores help and works with the early Order of the Phoenix, or he turns the future death eaters "good" through various methods, or he turns into another Dark Lord himself, effectively stomping out Voldemort early and taking control on that front.

But I have not come across one with him going in the direction you describe.
