I've actually been working on a story with a similar-ish premise you might be interested in. PM me if you want the google docs link; it's got 10.5 chapters at the moment, but it's not fully edited yet (though I'm working on that).

It's got:

- Incubus Harry (with stupidly strong but nonstandard mind powers)
- Dark but not edgy/angsty Harry
- Mind Control themes (although not quite the same as what you posted)
- No bashing
- Mild AU

  - Voldemort had Satyromania on top of his other issues.
  - A lot of people are bisexual, the world is generally more sex-friendly.
  - The events of the first three books/movies happened slightly differently.
  - Pansexual Harry, Bisexual Ron, and Polyamourus Hermione in a three-way friends-with-benefits relationship.

At the point it is in the story, there hasn't been much yet at the school itself, but I eventually plan to have him have his way with a good portion of the student body (and being set during GoF, that includes Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students too).
