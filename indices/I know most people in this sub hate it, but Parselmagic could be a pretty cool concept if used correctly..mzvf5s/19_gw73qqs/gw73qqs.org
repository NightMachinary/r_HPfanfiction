I'm reading a Fem!Harry x Tom Riddle fanfiction on Ao3, it's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24970723/chapters/60450031][Appetence by elysian_drops]] and the author has an extremely well written headcanon that Parselmouths are more than just people who can talk to snakes. And it makes sense!

The mouth of a Parselmouth has a different structure than the mouth of a normal human being, it's more similar to that of a snake, which allows them to make the hissing sounds of Parseltongue. When they bite someone, their canines become longer and sharper to pierce the skin and reach the veins. And a Parselmouth's bite is lethal, because they produce their own venom which is extremely deadly and can kill someone in a few minutes for muggles and a bit longer for wizards.

There is no antidote for a Parselmouth's bite, nobody knows anything about it because of how rare Parselmouth's are.

Only another Parselmouth can survive Parselmouth Venom, but even if they don't die, it's gonna be painful and it'll take weeks for their body to completely eradicate the Venom and they're gonna be weak, sick and constantly feel tired until the venom is gone.
