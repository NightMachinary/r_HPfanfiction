I have no idea if it's hated, but most of the time it does not get near as much credit as I wish it did.

I recall that some years ago, in fics, it was a popular idea that parselmagic could used for healing, but it seems to have died down.

Sometimes, indy!harry has some kind of block on it, but it's never actually explained- it's just ''dumbledore thinks it's dark and bad and somehow blocks it'', so that's inventing something like, out of the blue, and being super unhelpful about explaining what that ability does.

I agree, in canon it's used mainly to lock things, or keep them protected. I'd say that's a theme of parselmagic: it locks, it keeps information private (though it's not confirmed to have a written system, I think), it protects, it hides etc.

As for magic purely in parsel, maybe it's very exclusive, idk, family magic? But it could also be just another way of saying the spells. I think there's a difference between having a spell that does the same thing as accio in parsel and hissing ''accio'' in parsel, and that is very much something I'd love to expand, but I don't have the creativity for it.
