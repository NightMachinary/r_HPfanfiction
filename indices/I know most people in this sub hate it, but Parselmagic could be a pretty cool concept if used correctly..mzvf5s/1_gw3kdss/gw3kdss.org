  Out of curiosity, why does the idea of Parselmagic get such hate? Is it just because it's an Indy!Harry thing, or can it do too many things in fanon?

Both for me. It's usually a trope featured in the same borefest fics with edgelord Hadrian, Gringotts, Weasley/Dumbles bashing and lordships.

Also due to the nature of these fics the "parselmagic" tends to be extremely powerful and makes everything else irrelevant.

OP characters need to face opponents/challenges appropriate to their power level, possibly just or more powerful than themselves. For instance, Goku and Superman are constantly being challenged in power/weakness and have to find a creative solution to win, like train more or use their wit.

Edgelord Hadrian on the other hand just casts his wandless^{TM} parseltongue family magic - accompanied by some edgy tantrum - and everyone else bends over.

Also in canon Parseltongue is just a language, with objects being enchanted to only respond to it. You could to the same with any langague really, like Klingon and only Star Trek nerds would be able to interact with the enchanted objects.
