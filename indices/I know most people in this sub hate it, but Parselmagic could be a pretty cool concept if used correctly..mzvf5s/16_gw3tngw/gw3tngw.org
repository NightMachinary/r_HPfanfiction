The reason I dislike "parselmagic" is that it goes against the spirit of the rest of Potterverse magic. Potterverse has, as one of its central themes, a certain equality of opportunity to what one can do: with general smarts, hard work, and good teachers, a Muggleborn can perform the same magic as the heir to the most august of bloodlines.

Exceptions exist (parselmouth, metamorphmagus), but they don't let one do that much over and above what the Hogwarts curriculum allows. A universe in which inborn (or bloodline) talents actually had a strong effect would look very different and fascinating in its own way. However, it would require additional worldbuilding, which entails giving other characters inborn talents of comparable potency. That raises the difficulty of pulling off the fic significantly.

On the other hand, most of the time it's just a plot device to give Harry yet another unearned power-up; and then you might as well just say that he has a ginormous magical core.
