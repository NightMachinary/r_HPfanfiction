IMO anything can be a cool concept if one puts enough passion, effort and skill behind it.\\
No such thing as a bad idea, only bad execution of an idea.

however, fanfiction, like any creative art form, is 99 % bad to mediocre and 1 % actual good stuff and therefore it will be rare to see difficult ideas be done great.
