Parseltongue in canon is just a language. Some things are enchanted to respond to passwords in that particular language but it could be done with any human language. Also why need to say the spells in parseltongue when you can cast them nonverbally? Unlike parseltongue which Dumbledore also understand despite not being a parselmouth, no one can really guess what's in your mind if you are a good occlumens as well. So I think canon already offers us a more efficient alternative. If parseltongue is used in a creative way I think no one complains. If it's just used as an overpowering device, the story in itself is shit and it typically has bigger problems than parselmagic.
