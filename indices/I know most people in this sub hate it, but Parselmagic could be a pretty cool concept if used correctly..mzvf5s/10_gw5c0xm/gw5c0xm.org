Absolutely. Maybe tie it to the fact that snake's perceive the world in a very different way to humans (in a far more metaphor-oriented magic system). Parseltongue has fundamental differences to human languages. Countering a spell cast in parseltongue without knowing parseltongue itself is difficult simply because the counterer doesn't have the same instinctive understanding of the underlying metaphor of the magic.

On a related note, experienced mages tend to pick up several "casting languages" for the variety of metaphor and intent each language and culture provide.
