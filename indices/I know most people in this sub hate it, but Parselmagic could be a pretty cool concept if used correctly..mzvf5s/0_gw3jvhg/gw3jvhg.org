I don't think parselmagic actually gets hate at all. From what I've seen people actually like fics with it. The problem is when the parselmagic is done poorly and turned into some divine level unbeatable magic that requires zero effort. When portrayed like that it's just bad/lazy writing. Its like in a lot of powerwank/op Harry fics where he becomes god tier without effort by abusing some facet of magic. A lot of times readers like the branch of magic but what the fic does is just bad.
