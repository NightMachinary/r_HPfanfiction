I hope you are not being sarcastic lol

Dumbledore wouldn't be able to help Harry in any way since he can't read or understand parseltongue.

And just because Harry can it won't mean he will be able to master all parselmagic available to him in little time.

I see this as a good way of removing some of the misconceptions for parselmouths. Imagine Harry saving people in front of a crowd by hissing at them.

Again, parselmagic healing wouldn't be something too OP. He wouldn't be able to bring people back from the dead or cure every malady the world has known. No healing saint Harry who finally finds the cure for lycanthropy or can heal any mental damage. With dark magic, in some cases he might be able to lessen the effects and in some less â€˜dark' completely recover people from them. An example would be Dumbledore's cursed hand, Harry might, with the help of Snape's potions, slow the curse giving him more time or lessen the pain/after effects of the curse, but Dumbledore would still die from it.
