  Out of curiosity, why does the idea of Parselmagic get such hate? Is it just because it's an Indy!Harry thing, or can it do too many things in fanon?

Because you can either take it to the extreme, any language works for such an actions, or atleast, any magical language works and then it turns into a shitshow as people learn rare languages just to take advantage of it, or you limit it to parseltongue and make it a birthright, which always leads to familial magic.
