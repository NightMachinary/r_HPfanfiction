It is a cool concept, but you yourself prove why people hate it with your first sentence.

It's not ever used as a cool concept. It's just giving arbitrary superpowers to magic.

There's no such thing as a "parsel lock." Every fic I've ever seen that uses "parsel magic" uses that concept, and it's nonsensical.

Tom Riddle and Salazar Slytherin put a */password/* onto an */enchantment/*, and that */password/* just so happens to be in an obscure magical language. If Dumbledore put a mermish password on the gargoyle to his office, did he use a merlock? Is that mermagic?

I'm not trying to insult or attack you, but this is exactly why people don't like it. It's certainly why I don't. Casting magic in parseltongue, if you could manage it, would carry some distinct advantages. Nobody who wasn't also a parselmouth would know what the hell you were doing, for starters, they'd have to blind guess what was about to come at them. And just like how certain languages are more or less conductive to things like math or expressing artistic concepts, you COULD make the argument that since it's all just rolling hisses, that parseltongue is a language that is uniquely suited to freely casting spell after spell after spell, with all their translated incantations just rolling into each other in one long sibilant hiss.

But nobody ever uses that. That's never what it is. It's always parsel locks and unique parsel spells and other vague and ill-defined superpowers.

The advantages of learning how to freely use parseltongue are that you've effectively just cheated silent casting for every spell that exists with zero effort, because nobody knows what your words mean and you can always quietly hiss under your breath. And that you can put passwords on things that nobody will be able to ever open, because you put the password down in an impossible to learn language.

I'll do us all a favor and refrain from bringing up how Ron got into the chamber in DH.
