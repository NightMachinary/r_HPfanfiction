I think that Parselmagic is super cool. It would be something like creating spells or charms but making the incantation in Parseltongue instead of Latin, That would be such a big privilege because only parselmouths could cast them (or if someone learns to speak it ? Ex Ron in DH ? )

But yeah, I don't get why it's hated. I think it has something to do with the type of fics where it's used. It's most of the time some super independent Harry that makes 0 sense. But if used well it could be really cool in a fanfic
