My headcanon is that spells specifically designed to be used with Parseltongue incantations are almost exclusively in the area of Healing, when talking about European spells. I'm not sure what other non-European cultures with significant snake presence in their folklore associate it with, but whatever Parseltongue spells these cultures produced would be in the area that they associate snakes with.

I don't like it when Paselmagic is made out to be super OP though, it would be like any other language on Earth. The only real edge I think it would be fair to have over magic in any other language is to make any Transfiguration/Conjuration of reptiles easier, and obviously making passwords only vulnerable to another Speaker.

I also love the idea of an alphabet being created for it at some point in history.
