People hate everything lol this is fan-fiction so anything and everything is on the table to expand on and make it great or horrible. I like parselmagic as a cool concept. It adds another unexplored layer from canon. How about we fans just enjoy the wonder of what is possible. I may be downvoted but honestly I love all of the interesting tropes of how Harry and company could have did things, from Lord Potter Black to Harry is Salazar to Dumbledore means well or evil. It's endless possibilities. So I agree with you OP, it definitely is a cool concept.
