I mean true I guess the better question is who you prefer to see in a more antagonistic role. They could still be morally complex but the narrative isn't really siding with them and their flaws are a bigger problem even if they aren't the main antagonist or anything. Like for example in book 4 Ron is in a more antagonistic role. His flaws are causing more problems for alot of people and he's being kinda a dick. But he's not like a villain or anything. The narrative is critical of him but I wouldn't say its bashing him.
