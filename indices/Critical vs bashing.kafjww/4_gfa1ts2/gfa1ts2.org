Bashing is a very unfair assessment of a character. As a rule of thumb I'd say, bad traits are blown out of proportion and good traits are swept under the carpet. Critical judgement allows more objectivity or character studies and is more like assessing both sides of the coin and not actually bashing them for their bad deeds.

And moving on to your last question, it kind of applies to most characters. I don't want them to be praised and their bad traits forgotten but I also don't like to see them bashed. People are complex.
