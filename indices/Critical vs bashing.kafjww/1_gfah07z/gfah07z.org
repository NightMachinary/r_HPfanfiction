If you want to get specific about characters or setting stuff, bashing is highly relative, depending on how you see the characters or setting stuff in question. Ron is a perfect example. Interpretations of his character vary wildly. For people who see him as a feckless, disloyal moron, stories portraying him like that aren't bashing. For others who see him as loyal and good, him being disloyal and prejudiced will come off as bashing. Whether those interpretations are canon or not is another question, but whatever the answer to that is, people still have those differing interpretations and thus these conversations about bashing will remain affected by that difference.

Without the specific examples, however, bashing is basically just the difference between criticism and critique.

Criticism focuses entirely on the negative, to the exclusion of any even mildly positive aspects. It's simply "This is bad, here's why." It's why we make the distinction of 'constructive criticism' - it's still negative, but it's an attempt to help you build yourself up.

Critique involves a more rounded analysis covering both the good and the bad of a thing. "This is bad, however it's not that important because of this reason, and can even be countered a little by this other thing that is actually quite good."

A good character analysis is a critique - to go for a spin of the cliche: Dumbledore is a manipulative spider who wants to control all of Magical Britain, but he also fights against Voldemort and is actually trying to help people with his machinations.

If you take out the good and just have 'Dumbledore is a manipulative, whiskered old wanker who wants to control everything', that's just criticism (and not even constructive criticism at that), and that's what most people perceive as bashing.
