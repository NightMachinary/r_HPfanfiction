Bashing is, first and foremost, not about criticism, exaggeration, or even making someone a villain, as it is about /degrading/ and/or /disempowering/ a character. All major characters have both virtues and flaws, and bashing is often about removing the virtues from a character, with flaws coming to the fore being a secondary effect.

For example, Canon Dumbledore's virtues are his power, his wisdom, and his benevolence. Take away his benevolence (e.g., stealing from Harry, discriminating against the poor oppressed Slytherins), his wisdom (e.g., making foolish decisions around the protagonist), and his power (e.g., turning out to have had feet of clay magic-wise all this time), and you get a typical Manipulative!Dumbledore.

But, how many Manipulative!Dumbledores make for a villain half as compelling as Dolores Umbridge?

For another example, Canon Hermione's virtues are her brilliance, her sense of justice, her independence/proactiveness, and her generosity. A bashed Hermione tends to lose out to the protagonist academically (i.e., take away the brilliance), take it poorly but do nothing to address the problem (i.e., take away the generosity and proactivenes), and obsess over and be paralysed by "rules" and "authority" (i.e., take away the justice and independence).
