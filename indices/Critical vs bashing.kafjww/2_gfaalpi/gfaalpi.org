I always find bashing stems from when an author doesn't know what to do with a character. They don't want to leave a character out but the character doesn't have a place in their plot, so they just bash the crap out of them.

Its perfectly fine to be critical of characters as no one in the Harry Potter universe was perfect. It's a whole another thing to say this character has no redeeming traits and should be insulted mercilessly.

If you can't say anything nice about a character just leave them out.
