It's usually Snape tbh but if not Snape uhhh maybe Molly? She does some shitty things I'd be happy see people be critical over since its not really in canon. But I hate Molly bashing. I don't think I've seen Molly critical stuff just Molly bashing and Molly being cool and no in-between I guess. Hermione kinda the same but someone already said Hermione.
