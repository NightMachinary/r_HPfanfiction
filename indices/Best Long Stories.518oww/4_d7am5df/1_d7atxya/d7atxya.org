[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]] link. I second the recommendation - I loved this story a huge amount. The first two chapters aren't representative of the rest, but if you don't like it by the end of the first arc (about 6 chapters, and after the first fight) then it's probably not worth sticking with. There's also a lot of Worm fanfic out there, although it's mostly on spacebattles.net. You can find lots of links on the wiki page for [[/r/WormFanfic]].

Back to HP fanfic, linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) is really good and recently finished. It's a Romione story with espionage, intrigue and politics but also some really great worldbuilding and fight scenes.
