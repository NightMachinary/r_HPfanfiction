Haha! I can yet again recommend linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black). It's rather different from most fanfics, but if you enjoy intrigue, politics, and strategy, it's a most excellent fic.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/black-knight-harry-potter-au.395017/][Black Knight]] (Black Pawn until the start of the fourth year) is a fanfic over at Spacebattles, who removed Hermione, and instead puts in another brilliant muggleborn... who ends up in Slytherin. It's a rewrite of a fic called Brightest Witch in the Darkest House.

linkffn(Forging the Sword) is likely something you've read before, but if not, it should be high on your list. Even if you have, I've found that it's well worth a reread.

Now, you didn't specify Harry Potter fanfic stories, so I will recommend giving [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]] a try. It's 'realistic' superhero fiction. Not in the sense that powers make scientific sense, of course, but in that there's a realistic portrayal of powers on society (they've existed for about 30 years at story start), and that there's never moments where you want to scream at the characters that /if you just use your powers in this way that's been demonstrated before, the fight will be over!/

The characters are very strong too, especially the antagonists, none of whom feel like just another stereotypical bad guy, but rather real people with goals and motivations. It also has a wordcount of 1.7M words, which is basically equal to the ASoIaF series.
