I feel like I can deal with it being unfinished. It was somewhat frustrating at the end since it stops at a cliffhanger but overall I am very happy that I decided to read it and it is still one of my favorite AU Harry Potter worlds. It is divided into 6 "books", with it stopping a few chapters into the 6th book so if you want a more satisfying ending, just stop at book 5 . It is a long long story though with many adventures, plots, mysteries and following multiple characters. I honestly really enjoyed most of them even if some of these stories and plots are not finished at the end.
