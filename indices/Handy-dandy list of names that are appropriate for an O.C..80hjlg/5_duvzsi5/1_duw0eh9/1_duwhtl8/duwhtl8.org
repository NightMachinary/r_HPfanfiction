One needn't necessarily have an especial "deeper" meaning to a name. Rowling was ridiculous in her naming tendencies at times, and it hardly matters how /she/ would name an original character when it's an /original character./

It depends on various things: your writing style, how much value you want placed on names within the narrative, et cetera. It's perfectly valid to choose a name simply because you like the sound of it, or because it calls back to a particular period or character trait more than it has a "deeper meaning".

Calling a character "Marilyn", for example, can give the reader an immediate impression of the character - false or true - without necessarily pointing to an author-led Blue's Clues episode.
