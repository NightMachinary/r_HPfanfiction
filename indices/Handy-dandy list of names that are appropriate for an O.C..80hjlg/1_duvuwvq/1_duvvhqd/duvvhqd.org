And from above, Laura = laurel, Camilla can be changed to Camellia, and Marguerite in French is daisy. Silvia also means wood, Chloe means green shoot, Rhoda means rose and Yolanda means violet. Rosalind would be the best if you want to pair Harry with a Black. (If you can't tell, I put a lot of thought into naming my O.C.s XD)

Also it doesn't have to be an exact flower name. One of the meanings of Ginevra is juniper, Susan means lily, Padma means lotus, and Daphne means laurel (which is why I use the latter three for my non-canon pairings).
