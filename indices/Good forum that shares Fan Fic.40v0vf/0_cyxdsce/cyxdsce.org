Regular members of DLP visit and comment here, so you might get a little grief for expressing your enthusiasm. It would be like saying 'Hey, did you realize that the Force Awakens is actually a sequel? There's this whole collection of old movies with related storylines!'

You are very right, but it's not news to us. Glad to see that you appreciate the value of the site.
