To be fair, what Karinta said was completely true.

"Please don't rec that" - It goes against DLP culture to advertise its existence and attempt to gain new members.

"They're a bunch of cynical bastards" - Which is true.

"Tastes are highly idiosyncratic and unrepresentative of the fandom" - In a fandom full of m-preg, slash, incomplete sentences, and a bunch of other shit, I'd say it's a compliment to us by saying we're unrepresentative of the fandom.
