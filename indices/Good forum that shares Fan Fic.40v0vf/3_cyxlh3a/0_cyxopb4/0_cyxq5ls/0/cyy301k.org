  In a fandom full of m-preg, slash, incomplete sentences, and a bunch of other shit, I'd say it's a compliment to us by saying we're unrepresentative of the fandom.

So everything good: you guys.

Everything bad: someone else.

The bizarre attempts from that forum's members to visit other sites and brag about the inherent quality of the DLP Brand is childish. So far as I can tell you just have a different flavour of shitposter than can be found here. At the upper end of the spectrum, there is no difference in the quality of stories discussed here or there.

Your mods do come here and tell this subreddit's members to kill themselves in oblique ways, so I guess /that's/ different.
