  So everything good: you guys. Everything bad: someone else.

That's not what I said. Go re-read my post.

  The bizarre attempts from that forum's members to visit other sites and brag about the inherent quality of the DLP Brand is childish.
#+end_quote

Again, go re-read my post. “It goes against DLP culture to advertise its existence and attempt to gain new members.” Quite frankly, DLP members do not give a damn about what other sites, including [[/r/hpfanfiction]], say about us. The only time we react is when people do shit like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3m6kb3/upload_dlp_fics_you_have_and_share_it/][this]] where they show complete disregard of DLP authors.

The only time I remember quality being discussed was during the WbA fiasco and the eloquent “DLP are assholes” thread. Other than that, we didn't talk about DLP quality unless it was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3m6wyo/a_little_clarification_on_what_dlp_is_for_please/][directly asked]].

  So far as I can tell you just have a different flavour of shitposter than can be found here.

Go look into my post history and you'll find that most, if not all, of my posts are helpful, insightful, and positively received.

  At the upper end of the spectrum, there is no difference in the quality of stories discussed here or there.
#+end_quote

No. DLP takes into account of technical writing, plot progression/pacing, character development, and a myriad of other factors in critiquing fanfiction. So, stories like 0800-Rent-A-Hero and Cadmean Victory (that are almost universally praised on this subreddit) are considered “almost recommendable” in DLP.

  Your mods do come here and tell this subreddit's members to kill themselves in oblique ways, so I guess that's different.
