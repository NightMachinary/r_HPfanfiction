  Takes place after the final victory over Voldemort.A moment of greif fueled rage is misplaced and lives are changed.Harry seeks out a new life abroad; one of duty and honor, though the life he left behind is still calling him home as events conspire against him. Eventually,he finds his heart.Some similarities between this and others of my stories,though this one stands on its own.
