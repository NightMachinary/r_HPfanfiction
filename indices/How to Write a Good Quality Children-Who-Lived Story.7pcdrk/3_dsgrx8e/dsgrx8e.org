Alright, I see two issues with your premise.

1) The Dueling circuit as main plot point of a fic where the MCs start at age 11. Either the girl is ridiculously overpowered, the duels are boring or you have years filled with nothing but filler. Unless she is on Merlin's level a first/second year witch would be useless in a duel. Children duels do not sound very interesting due to the limited amount of spells used. Even a fifteen year old girl would realistically stand no chance against people on the level of Dolohov or the Lestranges. During the Battle of Hogwarts Bellatrix was fighting Ginny, Luna and Hermione to a standstill. That is the level an international competition would be at. Hell, Harry never won a duel against Voldemort without some very unlikely circumstances.

2) Snape as a mentor. Just how and why? Lily came up with something to kill the worst wizard in living memory. James wasn't bad at fighting either. Just why would the girl need a mentor? I mean, her parents know how to sneak into Hogwarts so it's not like they would ignore that their daughter is having a really horrible time in the castle.

There's also the fact that Snape became a Death Eater. You know, the war criminals trying to kill muggleborns like Lily. I can't see Lily overlooking that, especially after the leaked prophecy and the reason for Snape's "redemption". Because loving a married woman is really creepy. Why is Dumbledore keeping Snape around in the first place? He is not anticipating the need of a spy. Maybe the "redemption" convinced Dumbledore to keep him out of Azkaban but why let him teach for a decade? Snape is objectively a bad professor who knows nothing about teaching. He might be a prodigy in the subject of Potions but he cannot convey that knowledge.
