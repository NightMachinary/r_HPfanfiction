Yeah, Snape makes not much sense.

Also, I'd not start the story in first year. With Voldemort dead, most of the canon plot has been rendered moot, so you don't need to have kids be the heroes, and all the trouble (useless adults) that causes. If you want to focus on duelling and mentor Snape, why not start after Hogwarts and have Snape be an accomplished duellist, and have him get involved that way?
