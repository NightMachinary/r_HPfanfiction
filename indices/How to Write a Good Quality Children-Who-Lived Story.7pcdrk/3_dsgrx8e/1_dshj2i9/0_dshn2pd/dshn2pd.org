1) The low level and age duels are boring unless the characters are OP. Imagine giving two teens swords and telling them to fight with far too little training and muscle. They will botcher techniques and it will not be very interesting to watch. It's like children and football. Having them train is alright, even small tournaments and local leagues (Hogwarts duelling club) but there is a reason why there are no international competitions below a certain age. And you can learn football a lot easier than mortal combat.

2) Snape did not even consider that Lily would forfeit her life for Harry. He wanted her spared so that he could have another go.

The Death Eaters are not a political party, they are a magical SA/SS ripoff. A terrorist organisation. And by voluntarily joined them Snape performed an inexcusable act in the eyes of every Muggleborn (this includes Lily). He was working towards a genocide, towards a Final Solution. A Muggleborn Holocaust. I don't think you realise how vile that group was. When in power they turned Azkaban into a concentration camp. There is no way a Muggleborn could forgive that. Snape was a member of the inner circle, was marked, not just some unimportant underling. He only avoided a lifelong relationship with the Dementors due to Dumbledore +abusing his power+ intervening. And let's not forget that Snape was the one who painted a target on the Potters. I can see him living in another country. But even a working relationship with a Potter? Seems impossible in the light of his crimes.

As for Lily and James helping their children. In the scenario you outlined (total abandonment, hostility), Harry&Twin have no one. It is not too far-fetched that James (or Lily) would sneak into Hogwarts and spent time with them in that case. They are loving parents. They have a near-perfect invisibility cloak. They would not leave their children alone in a castle six hundred miles away. A parent's first obligation is his/her child so the Diagon Alley book club will have to make due with a member less. If they had time for their children before Hogwarts then two hours each day or even twice a week is no problem.
