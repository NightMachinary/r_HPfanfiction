I also don't get the point of isolating the kids. What do you gain by cutting off their social network? Are you so fond of a bunch of junior Nazis (Draco and friends) and OCs with a canon name (Daphne is mentioned once in the entire series, and only because her name starts with G and she's in the same group as Hermione)?

To be honest, the most important (and most original) part of the story seems to be the duelling focus. The whole "Slytherin means she'll be isolated" stuff seems pointlessly emo (or a forced setup to make Lily fall in love with a junior nazi like Draco, or an OC with Draco's name). Having her keep her friends despite being in Gryffindor, or putting her in another house, and having her meet Snape as an adult on the circuit might work better.

(Also, Slytherins probably weren't that infamous in Lily's time - she was in the slug club, after all, headed by Slughorn. If Snape doesn't take over the house and turns it into a Nazi youth group, I don't think Slytherin would have a really bad reputation - Slughorn would have managed to restore the damage done by so many Slytherin Death Eaters, and would likely have kept the students from turning into open bigots like Draco and his ilk.)
