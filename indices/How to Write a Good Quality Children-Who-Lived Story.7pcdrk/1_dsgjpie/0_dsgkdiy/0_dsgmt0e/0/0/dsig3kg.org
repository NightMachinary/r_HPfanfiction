James and Lily would know a lot of people. James grew up in Wizarding Britain, both went to Hogwarts, both were in the order, and after Voldemort's death, they were likely minor celebrities. I simply don't get the "girl who lived was put into Slytherin, let's drop her" attitude. Especially since I doubt that Dumbledore would care. And if Slughorn stayed on as head of house, then I don't think Slytherin would have an evil reputation anyway.
