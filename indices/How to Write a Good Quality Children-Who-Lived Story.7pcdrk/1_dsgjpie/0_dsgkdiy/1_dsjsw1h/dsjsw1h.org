  The wizarding world has always struck me as both heavily segregated and affected by prejudices and biases. I believe that-born of a Light-affiliated family- that the number of contacts within the Magical world would be limited. I could foresee families such as the Weaselys, Longbottoms, etc, forming connections with a fledgling Potter family. *fledgling as in this generation of Potters.

Reread books, fanon is influencing your perception of wizarding Britain too heavily.
