First off, I think your idea has merit. Second off, I think you're going to need some solid divergence and world building to pull this off. One of the biggest obstacles to overcome will be Snape -- why is he teaching DADA? What happened with the Death Eaters? What is his relationship with James and Lily Potter? As a reader, I wouldn't buy canon-Snape being on good terms at all with the Potters, so you'd have to establish why your Snape is different.

You'll also need to establish why the GWC is sorted into Slytherin. Maybe she wants to make something of herself beyond her fame, maybe she's just very clever.

The other thing I see a potential issue with is the friends. Like you've said in one of the comments, eleven-year-olds are fickle creatures. That being said, I don't think they'd completely abandon the GWC. What I think is more believable is that they start giving her the cold shoulder because she's been sorted into Slytherin, GWC is upset, starts making new friends, and then when the old friends try to rejoin her, she decides to ignore them because she's still mad (or something along those lines).

I think with the changes in backstory/divergences/worldbuilding you need, you could probably start in first year -- you don't necessarily need to tell first year in 60k words, but you could tell it in several chapters, just to hit the highlights.

Again, I do think you have a good idea, and one that I'd read. I think it just needs to be developed a bit more. :)
