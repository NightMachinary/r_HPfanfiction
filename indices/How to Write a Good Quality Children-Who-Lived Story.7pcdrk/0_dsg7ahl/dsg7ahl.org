Why are they sorted into Slytherin? Is there some reasoning, is their personality suited for Slytherin?

In general, the real issue with twin/sibling fics is the sheer amount of absurdity injected into the plot "just because".

Create real plotlines. Yes, there will be some strain and tension in Harry's relationship with his sibling. Fame will cause that. No James and Lily won't ignore and abandon one child. According to canon, they were both good people who valued family.

I know you've probably read HP&BWL, but linkffn(Anti-Hyphen) is quite good too.
