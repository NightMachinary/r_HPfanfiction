I would love to have a trained actor read my favorite fanfictions. I know there are podfics and youtube videos out there where they read out random fanfics, but I normally stay away from them because they tend to be read in a bland, monotone voice that takes all the life out of the characters. Instead of fleshing out the characters, they read them as if they're, well.. /reading/, not acting.
