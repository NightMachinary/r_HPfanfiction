I'm pretty certain I have obsessions I don't realize when I write, but I'm not sure what exactly I do. I already know in all of my unpublished stories, I work with an O/C that is part self-insert (though appearance is usually way different) and part "whatever personality fits the fic I'm going for."

However, since everything I write devolves into smut, intentionally or unintentionally, I will admit that I am /obsessed/ with the word *thrust*.

; ; I can't not put it in a fic. I just love it so much. It's such a good sex word. ^{^{don't}} ^{^{slay}} ^{^{me}}
