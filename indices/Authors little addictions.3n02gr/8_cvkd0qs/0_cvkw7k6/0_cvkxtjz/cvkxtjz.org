All authors have little topics and tropes they like and I think they're relatively aware of them. Our writing is a reflection of ourselves, things that interest us, things we may want to read. Not like the specific pet details mentioned in this thread, but more like overall themes and archetypes - writing crutches, too, that they rely on when they can't bother to write something better. It's quite fun to parody yourself.

My schtick is all about emotionally stunted heroines and overly emotional heroes, and my writing crutches include food-related metaphors and lists that come in threes. People notice my archetypes, but its only been in a positive way, in that it's a reason why they read my fics. I notice more myself, but that's an author's lens for you.
