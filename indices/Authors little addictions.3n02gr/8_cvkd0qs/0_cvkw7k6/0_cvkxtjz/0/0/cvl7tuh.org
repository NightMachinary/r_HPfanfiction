Oh, authors love talking about this crap. If you made this clear, you'd have essays all over here ;)

I write because there are certain stories I hardly ever see done well, stories I wish I had growing up. I had a hard time finding heroines I could relate to. My lead character tends to be a girl defined by her intelligence. I don't mean just a "smart girl." It's like the difference between Sherlock and Tony Stark; both are geniuses but only Sherlock's genius defines his personality, his relationships, and most importantly, /his flaws/. That's something I almost never see for female characters; I rant about it [[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/post/82265005880/talk-to-me-about-the-dark-side-of-nerd-girl][here]] in more detail. Smart female characters always rub off as a male-fantasy version of the smart girl--too ideal and without agenda. I want to see smart heroines who struggle with their pride and cynicism and morality but are unashamed about who they are. Genuine, complicated conflicts.

And the emotional hero is an accidental result of that. They're good foils to my main characters, and fill the role that's usually handed to the lead female role--the love interest, the emotional heart, the moral compass.

So writing these archetypes is very important to me in that they brought me to writing in the first place, and I'll continue to write them in different ways. I've written anti-heroine who wields power with both relish and reluctance, but also a childish genius that no one takes seriously and a femme fatale whose allegiances are uncertain. There's so much to explore still, even though it's a common theme I've been writing for a long time.
