No problem. I think it really depends on the reader/writing combination. Reuse of the same character in the same situation is extemely irritating to readers, and in general, unnecessary. I agree with that, but for people who like that situation, they eat it up. I think when it is a writing style, it is easier to see past, but when it is a situation al la Sinestra, it is irritating. Personally I haven't run into many writers who do this but I find authors who put the same character in the same situation for every story lazy and not entertaining to read.
