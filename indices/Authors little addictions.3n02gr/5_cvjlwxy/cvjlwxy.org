I haven't, but as an author myself, I can tell you we all have those things we constantly use because we love them. This could be a plot point, a phrase or a way of creating a story. Authors create stories because we love them, more so than the few who give the people what they want. So, you will always find a common thread between the stories of a single author, even the use of the same character.
