As a writer I've found myself coming up with certain explanations for why I write characters the way I do and having to carefully ration how many I use in a given story.

It's tempting to just throw every cool character detail you've thought up for, say, anxious-and-somehow-broken post-Voldemort Hermione into every story you write, but if you do you'll leave yourself either without cool character details or repeating yourself in your next story that jumps off from a similar place.
