I think he's talking more about the fact that a lot of stories will bring them together and then in the midst of Voldemort and everything else throw some minor problem at them that spirals into them either breaking up (temporarily) or being on the verge of doing so and then (usually) Harry making some grand gesture to save the relationship.

I'm not saying this doesn't happen in normal relationships but I've seen this stuff happen several times in one story. Once is alright but after that we can stop with the angst and concentrate on the actual story. Also the problem is never solved by them simply sitting down and talking it over like normal people, it's always some melodramatic explosion that makes little sense.
