I don't mean mad as in 'oh I want Harry and Ginny to be together'. It infuriates me because it's such an obvious pull on the chords of the reader. And it's obviously filling in space, because we know how it must end. There's no necessary reason to go through turmoil just for the sake of it.

Once, I tolerated perfectly well. And then a second time. But I'm pretty sure I've never found a story where they come together peacefully and stay together without a dramatic disruption.
