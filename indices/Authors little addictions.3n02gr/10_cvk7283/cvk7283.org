Giving Harry and Ginny a relationship problem for the sake of it (in a cannon piece). We know they were in love. We know they end up with kids pretty soon after. We know you're going to have to fix them up before the end of your story, so don't bother. Leave them alone. They're happy.

I've read series and a few of non-related from people and they insist on a roller coaster trend for them every time. Drives me mad.
