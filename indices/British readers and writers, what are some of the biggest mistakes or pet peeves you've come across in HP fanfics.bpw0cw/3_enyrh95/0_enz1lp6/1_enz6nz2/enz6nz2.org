You'd just say ‘he walked to his favourite pub', or if the time is important ‘he walked the 15 minute journey to his favourite pub'/‘he walked to his favourite pub, which was only 15 minutes away' etc. We don't use streets or whatever as a unit of distance, more the time it takes to get there. Some people use miles, but in my experience that's more an older people thing, or for longer distances e.g. ‘their walk was 7 miles long'.
