To quote another comment I made:

  Honestly, if I were writing it, I wouldn't include directions at all. British cities grew in a very sprawling fashion, and can be a bit confusing to navigate if you're not familiar with them. I think giving the travel time would probably suffice, since that gives a general idea of the distance travelled without having to describe numerous turns and street crossings, etc. Maybe include some landmarks like, say, a park the character passed, if you really want to flesh it out.
