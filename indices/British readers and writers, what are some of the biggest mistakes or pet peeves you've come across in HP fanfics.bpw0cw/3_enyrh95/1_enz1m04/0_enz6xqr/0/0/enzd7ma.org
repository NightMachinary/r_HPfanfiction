In that case, yes; that's a totally appropriate, but even then, it's not so much of a distance thing. Boroughs in London (born-and-bred Londoner, can't really speak for anywhere else) are not uniform, and (due to some pretty interesting history) many of them are some really really really wacky shapes. You'd never really use them to measure distance - for example parts of one borough might be 20miles across, and 2miles across at another part of the borough before widening again. Like I said, pretty whacky. I almost always measure in terms of time; it's an hour on the tube to central London, it's a 30 minute bus to the river, it's a 15 minute walk to the station
