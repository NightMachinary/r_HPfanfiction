I might say "In the next borough." I wouldn't say "A borough over," it sounds American.

Or, perhaps, "So, pretty close to here? What is it, (n) minutes away by tube?" or "What is it, (n) of a mile?"

BTW, bear in mind the saying 'British people think a hundred miles is a long way and Americans think a hundred years is a long time.' Distances within London can be very close in miles and yet very 'far' in perception, depending on how straightforwardly they are connected, and that's largely true for the rest of the country too.
