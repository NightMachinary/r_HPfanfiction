How about the use of boroughs? For example, below is a snippet of a story I'm currently writing:

Hermione laughed as she ducked her chin. She didn't know why but she suddenly felt rather embarrassed in front of this stranger. "Um, well, I guess you could say that. But I'm from originally from Britain. London, to be exact."\\
"London's a big place," Harry said, holding out his arms as if to show just how big it was.\\
"West Brompton," she said. "My mum and dad moved back there during the summer."\\
"So, pretty close to here? What is it, like a borough over?"
