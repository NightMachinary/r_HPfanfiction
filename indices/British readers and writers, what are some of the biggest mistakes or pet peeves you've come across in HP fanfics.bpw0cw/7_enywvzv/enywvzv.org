Not British but I hate when people try to imitate the accents the way JKR did. A lot of people don't know what Hagrid, Fleur and Seamus really sound like so they'll just make it up. JKR did it in such a way that when you read it, it actually sounded like the accent but some fan fiction writers just throw in a load of letters and hope for the best. Like Seamus will say “Ah-ree Poh-ta” that's not even a little bit Irish, it's way more cockney. He would say it like how dumbledore says it in the GoF film after he reads Harry's name out (so out of character on Micheal Gambons part lol) other than that it's just lazy writing like when they say things like ‘mom', ‘trash', ‘ma'am', ‘dollars' (I mean really?)
