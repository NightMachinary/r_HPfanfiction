You know it's so weird but (as a Brit) I remember this being a problem in the summer as a child when we had picnics or (to my mum's frustration) I would leave an apple core on the side or something. But it occurs to me that it hasn't been a problem for several years and I don't know if it's because I no longer live in a rural place.
