Goddamn, I wish the ants stayed outside my house. Every bloody summer they invade the kitchen (and this year for some reason they're popping up in the bathroom). Last year I went into the kitchen and found like 20 of them running over an empty glass that'd had orange juice in it.

But also yes, flies are a serious fucking bother.
