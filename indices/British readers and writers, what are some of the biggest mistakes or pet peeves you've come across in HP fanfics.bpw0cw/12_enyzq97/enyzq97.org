Here's one: I've read a fic that mentioned food being left out and ants getting in it. I've lived in the Caribbean and I fully appreciate the threat of ants getting in food (especially sweet food), but in Britain ants stay outside the house and even outside they're not nearly such a threat for food. Flies are more of a pest.
