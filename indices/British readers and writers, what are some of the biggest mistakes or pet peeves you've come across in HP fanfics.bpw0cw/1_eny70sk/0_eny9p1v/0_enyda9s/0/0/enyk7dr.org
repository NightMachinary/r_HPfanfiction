As a French, I honestly don't know if this is a mistake or not. There is so much cliche on France (and French) that you can present French as pretty much anything from the pinacle of romantisme to retarded barbarians ignoring the most basic principle of hygiene, and still fit at least one cliche.

For Harry Potter, it's a bit difficult. Sure the rosbeefs are hated on principle, and we expect the same courtesy from them, but I don't really remember any problems with the Irish and the Scots, so not sure which relation would be the best, book wise.
