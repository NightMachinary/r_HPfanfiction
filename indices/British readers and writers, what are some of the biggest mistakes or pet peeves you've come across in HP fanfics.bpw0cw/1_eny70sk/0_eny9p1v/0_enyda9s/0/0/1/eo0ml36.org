LOL Its pretty much the same as we brazilians and the argentineans (idk the way its spelled, gonna google it later.)

EDIT: oh, its argentinian. Why did I think it was an E I don't know. Well, they are pricks, in general anyways, always calling us monkeys in a derrogatory way. OFC, that's a stereotype, but that has been my experience with them.
