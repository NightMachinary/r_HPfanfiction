I guess, the separation of 2 world happened during the XVIIe century, so even if some events would already have happened like the 100 years war, other, as Napol√©on would not concern them (though I saw in some fanfic that the French would be a little pissed at Brittain who stayed pretty safe on his side of the sea while Grindelwald ravaged Europe and I think it's an interesting point).

Also, some character in canon are said to have French ancestry (mainly the Malfoy and the Lestrange), and people don't seem to care about their ancestry (more concerned by the fact they are killer/ terroriste).
