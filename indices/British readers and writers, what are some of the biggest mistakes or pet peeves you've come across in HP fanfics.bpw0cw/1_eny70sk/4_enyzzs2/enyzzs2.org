I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion for this, I'll go with the horrific but as someone in the UK for the first time right now I'll have to say this...

The rudest people I have ever had the displeasure of meeting I thought this was an internet meme, if one more tries to push in front in a que I'll be inclined to headbutt you. I'm really trying to stay calm and collect as a visitor to other countries but I'm starting to believe I'll get cheers instead of jeers if I tell the next French person doing something cuntish to F off.
