I usually use £25 per galleon. School books seem to cost one to two galleons for example, and I don't think even Lockhart's books would cost up to £100. A wand costs about 7 galleons, so that'd be £175, which I consider a bit cheap for an essential, reality-altering tool (Maybe the ministry subsidizes a child's first wand?). In general, I find prices in HP are inconsistent. That said, Rowling isn't an economist and it doesn't really matter in canon.
