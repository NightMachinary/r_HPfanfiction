Nope. Thats not true at all. When Molly shopped for school stuff for all of her children attending Hogwarts in the second book, she spent ~ a galleon for ALL school supplies.

  Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys' vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag.
