Yeah, but she barely bought anything new. Most of the stuff the Weasleys have is at least second-hand. This was second year, so she'd have to have bought supplies for 5 children with at most 2 Galleons?

Though now that I think about it more, I believe I got the prices of the books from old Pottermore or sth. Maybe a better comparison would be the Weasleys' trip to Egypt?

They won 700 galleons, and spend almost all of it on their vacation. So that's 700x25= £17500! I don't know about others, but I don't believe I've ever spent even a quarter of that on a trip (And that's with magical transportation, too!).

Meanwhile, a scoop of floo powder costs 2 sickles (about £3), and I assume that's several floo trips, as you only need a pinch (?). So even at its most expensive, a trip to anywhere in Britain is £3. What the hell did they do in Egypt to spend so much money? Sure, international travel is more expensive, and they had to pay for food and lodging, but still!

Conclusion: As I said before, the prices in canon are wildly inconsistent (and there's nothing wrong with that)
