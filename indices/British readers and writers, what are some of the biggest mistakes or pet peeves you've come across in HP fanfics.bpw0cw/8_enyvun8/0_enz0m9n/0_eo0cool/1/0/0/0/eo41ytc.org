  Yeah, but she barely bought anything new. Most of the stuff the Weasleys have is at least second-hand
#+end_quote

Well, yeah, obviously. But even for second hand stuff that would be super cheap. And you cant get second hand potion ingredients.

  This was second year, so she'd have to have bought supplies for 5 children with at most 2 Galleons?
#+end_quote

Pretty much, yeah.

  They won 700 galleons, and spend almost all of it on their vacation. So that's 700x25= £17500! I don't know about others, but I don't believe I've ever spent even a quarter of that on a trip (And that's with magical transportation, too!).

I mean they bought Ron a new wand too. They likely put some money away too. And you're using your own conversion rate. Wizarding economy is vastly different from the muggle one.

  Meanwhile, a scoop of floo powder costs 2 sickles (about £3),

Does it? Where did you get this from?

#+begin_quote
  , as you only need a pinch (?).
#+end_quote

I believe so.

  What the hell did they do in Egypt to spend so much money? Sure, international travel is more expensive, and they had to pay for food and lodging, but still!
#+end_quote

I mean it's an old egyptian tomb. That's likely about as big(in fame) as Disneyland. Plus travel, food, new wand, lodging, maybe some other stuff

  Conclusion: As I said before, the prices in canon are wildly inconsistent (and there's nothing wrong with that)
#+end_quote

The problem is that you are thinking like a muggle. Their economy doesn't have to opperate that way.
