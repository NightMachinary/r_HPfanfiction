Dragon products are available, yes, that doesn't make them cheap. The only thing we know from canon is that the liver costs a galleon per ounce. I agree that there's likely a fair industry around raising dragons for slaughter, I just don't think that would make them cheap, there's clearly a great deal of cost involved.
