Honestly, if many of the people who do this tried to make it more authentic, it would probably turn out worse. You can only get so far by looking up differences online. Like, I'm an American who's consumed a lot of British media. I can recognize many different accents/dialects, understand vocabulary differences and slang, etc. But I don't think I could write something that would convincingly pass as having been written by a native Brit, especially if I was trying to make all the characters accurate to the part of the UK they're from.
