The number of snakes in Surrey is grossly overestimated! And the type! There are four types of snake that are native to Britain and all of them are EXTREMELY RARE!! The number of times I've seen Harry gardening and oh look! A grass snake! Or an adder! (If it's a dark Harry fic) NO! Harry would not find a snake while gardening in suburban Surrey! The Dursley's do not live in a house that backs out onto f*cking moorland! I live in London; I walk in the Surrey hills; the only time I've ever seen evidence of a snake was when I was in DORSET on the SOUTH COAST! And he'd be far more likely to see a black adder when he was at Hogwarts; they live in the Highlands of Scotland and the Lake District, the likelihood of seeing one any further south than York is astronomically low. Sorry for the rant, it's one of those things that just really gets to me.
