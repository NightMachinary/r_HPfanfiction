I didn't know they were that rare tbh. When I was younger and living in West London when we got to the point where we didn't cut our grass for 6 months to a year we would end up with snakes in the garden. There was one point where we finally cut the grass after a year of not doing it and we found 5 snakes cause we accidently killed them with the mower. And it's not like we lived in the countryside or anything this was in the suburbs of West London in Ealing.
