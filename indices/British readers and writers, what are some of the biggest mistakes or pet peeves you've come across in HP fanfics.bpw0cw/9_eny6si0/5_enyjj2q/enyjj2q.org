  You don't go to the restroom or bathroom, but to the loo

Not always.

You'd be more likely to use bathroom in a more formal conversation or to a teacher ("Please miss, can I go to the bathroom" vs "I'm going to nip to the loo"). Also there are places where the bathroom and the loo are different rooms (one is a toilet and the other has the sink and bath/shower), they're not standard but they're not uncommon.
