While technically the royal family are German, the only king recognisable as German was George the first of Hanover who ascended to the throne in 1714 - the subsequent monarchs have all been born in Britain. While the surname of Saxe-Coburg wasn't changed to Windsor until 1917, with the rise of anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, I would think that 212 years is enough to firmly call someone British. Additionally, Elizabeth I, Tudor was even more certainly English, and her name was spelt with a ‘z'. And for anyone saying that Anne Bolyne was French, and that that might have had an impact, she wasn't; she lived in France, and spend time in the French Court, but she was born in England, and the Bolynes had been an established part of the English nobility for many years. In conclusion, I'd say spelling Elizabeth with an ‘s' is in fact far more uncommon than spelling it with a ‘z'. Good question tho. Thanks for letting me stretch my history muscles. :)
