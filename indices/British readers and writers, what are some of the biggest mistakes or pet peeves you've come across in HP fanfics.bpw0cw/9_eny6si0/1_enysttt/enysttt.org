Not a Brit, but I try to be accurate in writing these things, and I'm confused about a few:

- Is "bathroom" one of the changes that was still made in the American editions of the later books (when they were making fewer changes)? Also, my UK edition of Book 1 uses "toilets."
- Isn't the Queen's name still spelled with a 'z'?
- Vernon had a rifle in Book 1 (albeit obtained by sketchy means). Also, the handgun ban was not passed until 1997. How hard was it to get guns in the 90s?
