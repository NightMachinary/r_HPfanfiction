Vernon was able to get hold of a shotgun, while out somewhere rural, presumably from a /very/ dodgy friend, because what he did was not remotely legal, but with the rampant, obvious child abuse, the out-of-control son and his general demeanour, I'd guess he is used to bending the rules and got it from a Smeltings alumnus and old mate.

There was no sign he ever kept one in his suburban home, and it would be unusual if he did. Not unknown, and, as you say, not difficult, but unusual.

If he was rural, I'd expect him to have at least a shotgun.
