As an American redhead (of which their are proportionally fewer redheads) this drives me crazy. Suggesting that Harry likes Ginny because she has red hair like his mother is about the equivalent of suggesting I find Prince Harry attractive because my dad is also a redhead. My dad and Harry don't even have the same color of red hair, and continue to lack any other physical traits in common. This continues to be very dumb.
