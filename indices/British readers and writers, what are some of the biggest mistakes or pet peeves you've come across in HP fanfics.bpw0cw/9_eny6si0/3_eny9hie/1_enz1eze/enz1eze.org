  Ethnicity wise, Britain is a very different place than California or Florida.

That depends. I'm a native Floridian, was born and raised here my whole life, and it's safe to say South Florida is very diverse, while North Florida not so much. Of course, there's still plenty of different ethnicities in North Florida, but it's nowhere near as diverse as South Florida.
