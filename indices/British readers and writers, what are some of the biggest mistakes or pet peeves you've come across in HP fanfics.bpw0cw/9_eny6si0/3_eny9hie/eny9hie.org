I want to add that in the 1990s, Britain was an overwhelmingly white society, with 93% of the population being white and 5% Asian. Even today, after lots of immigration, white population still stands at 88%. In 1980, blacks made up less than 1% of the population, and that's the key reason I don't think a black Hermione is likely. Ethnicity wise, Britain is a very different place than California or Florida.

British population is far less religious than Americans on average. It's significantly more open in terms of sexuality. Age of consent is 16 years, and those complaining about years 6 and 7 characters shagging each other are silly IMO.

Legal drinking age in Britain is 18, and 16 accompanied by an adult.
