As a Brit this is mostly correct, but there's a few qualifications I'd make here: • they still have school trunks, boot only refers to the trunk of a car • bathroom is as acceptable to use as loo • same with telly and TV • Elizabeth is still a pretty common name, in my experience moreso than Elisabeth • bloke is more common than dude in the time period the books are set, not so anymore, so you can change depending on when you're setting your story • red heads are more common in Ireland, Wales and Scotland where it's around 10% of the population in England it near 5-6%
