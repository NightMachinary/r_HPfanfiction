Not a Brit, but even I can identify these mistakes:

- Calling Britain “England”, and it's especially outrageous to say that Hogwarts is in England.
- There's no trunk, only booty
- It's not trash, but rubbish or waste
- You don't go to the restroom or bathroom, but to the loo
- Pudding is not what Americans think
- You put on a jumper, not a sweater; similarly, you wear a trainer, not a sneaker
- You change nappy, not diaper, on Hermione's cute babies
- Grangers want to watch telly, not TV
- Colour instead of color, neighbour instead of neighbor, humour instead of humor
- grey!Harry vs gray!Harry, Greyback vs Grayback
- Elisabeth, not +Elisabeth+Elizabeth
- Our glorious civilisation, not civilization
- Don't call him a dude, he's a bloke
- Football, not soccer, you silly Americans!
- Guns are hard to come by in Muggle Britain, unless you want to imperius Muggle guards and soldiers
- Red heads are common in Britain, and Lily and Ginny don't look alike at all!
