The idea of Harry having hospital bills as a kid always pulls me right out of the fic. I know for yanks hospital bills are a major concern but in the UK you just turn up and everything's free.

Also, things being in dollars just seems lazy to me. As does the idea of there being housing 'blocks' anywhere.
