At GCSE and A-level a letter grade would be A*-G. These represent UMS (uniform mark scale) chunks such as 100-90 = A* which is fixed from year to year, however the raw marks needed for the grade boundaries change according to the difficulty of the exam/assessment on a national scale.

This means that if an exam one year was deemed to be particularly challenging by the exam board, then a raw mark of 54/60 may correspond to 100/100 UMS. The following year with an easier exam you may need 60/60 for 100/100 UMS.

In this case you would receive an A* grade, with a raw mark of 54/60.

For class tests these are often made up of past exam questions (from a central database) or made up questions, and either way the raw mark to UMS isn't calculated and students would receive a mark of '54/60 = 90%' instead.
