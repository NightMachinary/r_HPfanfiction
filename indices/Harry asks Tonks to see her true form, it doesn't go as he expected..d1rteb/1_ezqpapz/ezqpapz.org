Okay. I wrote this, and it went in a bit of a different direction than I'd thought, but what the hey. Harry's characterization in this scene is inspired by a a few harem fic Harry's I've read, and Tonks is about as unimpressed with him as I was when reading these fics...

--------------

Tonks looked a little forlorn, there she sat in one of the deep chairs in the living room. After she'd accidentally broken three soup-plates and one vase, Mrs Weasley had gently but firmly told her to go sit down and stop trying to be so helpful.

Harry slid down in the chair next to hers. Strictly speaking, he had /not/ been told to sit down and stop helping, but he figured that he could take a little break before anyone noticed. Besides, this was an excellent opportunity to get to know the Metamorphmagus a little better...

She looked up. "Wotcher, Harry," she said, not /quite/ with her normal cheeriness.

"Hi, Tonks." He looked at her. She was rather pretty, with her heart-shaped face and slender figure. "Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?"

She looked at him then. "Is it about my /true form/?"

"Er... what?" He blinked.

"That's usually what people ask when they want to ask personal questions," she said lightly. "Well, the less vulgar ones anyway. The /more/ vulgar ones tend to revolve more around /certain parts/ of my body, if you know what I mean."

"Oh." Harry immediately shifted gears and tried to pretend he hadn't been looking at her chest. "No no, that wasn't what I was thinking at all."

She scrunched up her face and cupped her breasts, which immediately grew much larger, stretching out the fabric of her shirt. "Because yes, I /can/ blow these up like balloons. Or shrink them down. Even make them vanish completely. It's why I never wear a bra."

Oh. So she /had/ noticed that he was looking. "That's, well... I wasn't going to ask about that!"

"Oh, so it /was/ about my true form, then?"

"Yes! I mean, no! I mean..." Harry desperately tried to get the conversation back on track. This wasn't going at all like he'd thought. "Look, you have so many forms," he tried, letting his voice go smooth again. "And I saw how the others made requests at dinner... I just thought it had to be a little upsetting that they command you to change your appearance like that..."

"No, why should it? It's a challenge, Harry. Fun for them, good practice for me. I'm good at it too," she said proudly. "Took me /ages/ to get that good, but now I only need a couple of seconds to completely change my face. Look!" She scrunched up her face again, and before Harry's eyes her pretty features morphed and grew less pretty... now her face looked disturbingly like that of a female Kreacher, with a bulbous, snout-like nose and bloodshot eyes.

Harry instinctively backed away ever so slightly. Kreacher's wrinkled face on Tonks's shapely body was not his idea of a beautiful sight.

"One second," said Tonks, running her fingers over her face to feel its shape. Her voice had turned somewhat hoarser and deeper, even if it wasn't quite a copy of Kreacher's bullfrog-like croak. "And I didn't even need a mirror."

"That's... nice," Harry managed to say.

"I hardly ever get to do this, Harry!" said Tonks, her hoarse voice really suiting the indignant tone. "I have this ability to change my appearance to whatever I want, but all too often I don't get to /use/ it. I can't change willy-nilly out on the street because the Muggles would panic, and even when I'm inside among witches and wizards they usually tell me to keep to a familiar shape. Do you have any idea how /frustrating/ that is?!""

"I --"

"You know when I was at Hogwarts, the teachers told me I had to stay consistent? Watched me like /hawks/ so I wouldn't suddenly try to change into someone else to get out of trouble, or cheat on tests. The only thing I was allowed to change as I wanted was my hair, because they bought my excuse that I couldn't control it that well."

"But --"

"Of course, /sometimes/ I did manage to fool them... there are a lot of fun things an imaginative Metamorphmagus can get up to at a place like Hogwarts..." Her ugly face split into a disturbing, wolfish grin. "But I won't sully your innocent ears with details. Come to think if it, some of those fun things was probably exactly why I wasn't allowed to change in the first place...."

"All right, all right, I get it." Harry once more tried to steer the out-of-control conversation back under his control. "You enjoy shifting, and that's fine. It's an amazing ability and you're very good at it... I just thought, well, like I said, you have so many forms. Don't get me wrong, they're all quite lovely! But I'm sure your /true/ form is even lovelier..."

Tonks sighed. "Harry. I understand that you don't quite get what it means to be a Metamorphmagus, so I'm going to tell you this once. This /is/ my true form." She motioned to herself, Kreacher-face and enlarged breasts and all.

"It is?! But --"

"And so's this." She scrunched up her face again, and this time her entire body shifted. Two seconds later, a girl who could have been Harry's twin sister sat there, with long black hair and a slender build, even a lightning-bolt mark on her forehead. "And this." Harry's twin was swapped out by a blonde, handsome man in his forties. "And this." The handsome man shifted into a buxom woman with supermodel-looks. "And this." The woman once more changed into a form closer to the one Tonks had started out with, with pink hair and a heart-shaped face.

Harry could only stare. He felt slightly dizzy after seeing all those changes.

"I'm a Metamorphmagus, Harry," said Tonks seriously. "I don't have /one/ true form. It's not like there's one basic shape and then everything else is just an add-on. /It's all me./ When I was little I was always changing form and colour depending on my mood... then I learned to control it and could change depending on what I /wanted/. I have no idea what I would have looked like if I'd never changed at all."

"So..." Harry said slowly. "You don't really have a true form then."

"Weren't you listening? It's /all/ my true form. My true form is that of a Metamorphmagus. A Metamorphmagus changes. That's the whole point. The form I'm in now is one I'm fairly comfortable in, so I decided to make it my default... but it's no more or less /true/ than any of the others."

"...oh."

"Yep. So, next time you want to flirt with me, do us both a favour and don't try cheap phrases about my so-called true form. It doesn't make you seem deep, it just reveals that you don't have a clue what you're talking about."
