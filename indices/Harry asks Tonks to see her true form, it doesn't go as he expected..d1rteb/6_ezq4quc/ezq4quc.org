you want to see my favorite allusion to that trope? here is it:

"Waiting on the muggle side of London, Tonks really had to wonder how she'd gotten roped into a date with a kid that didn't look quite as young as he should, nor act like it.

Ah yes, of course. He'd been funny, charming, very persistent and depressingly enough, more interesting than her usual brand of suitors. If she had to put up with one more idiot who thought he was being clever by asking what her 'true form' was, she might have seriously started considering the use of the Cruciatus as a corrective measure. The fact that she'd also found him rather attractive was best not considered. That way lay confusion."

For Love of Magic (Chapter 10)

â€‹

A short ridiculing note, is all that it deserves, is neither clever and I don't think it would be unusual, I mean if I had a girlfriend that can change forms I would be pretty curious if she had a "base" form.

Another thing is the "everybody asks me to look like the girl of their fantasy except you" trope... somehow fanfics intend to paint all non-Harry males as insensitive idiots with half a brain cell that don't get that a girl wouldn't appreciate being asked to make herself look like another girl. I mean C'mon!,
