We would have to debate if a metamorph does have a "true form" at all...

As for Tonks? If this "true form" exists? Then I'd think she would look like Bellatrix in her youth and she morphs so much (excessively you might call it!) because she does not want to look like that crazy, murderous bitch at all!
