*Here you go. Have a tragedy.*

--------------

Harry was hanging out with Tonks in Grimmauld Place, the summer before his fifth year.

"So, err, Tonks, what do you really look like?" he asked curiously.

Tonks's typical cheery demeanor vanished immediately. Her eyes were as sharp and furious as her cousin's. Then, this, too, left her, and her whole body went slack. Her shoulders slumped. Her gaze dropped to the floor. "I don't know. I've never known; I've been shifting and changing from the moment I was born. It didn't stop until I was around nine years old, when I finally got control over my abilities and /made it stop/, but...it didn't matter by that point, because however I was supposed to look was long gone to me." She lifted her gaze to Harry, gave a small, forced smile. "At least the teasing stopped, though. The ever-changing girl wasn't too interesting to her classmates anymore, then."

"I'm sorry," Harry stammered. He left the room quickly.
