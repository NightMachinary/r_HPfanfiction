The only Fem!Harry I have read is /A Long Journey Home/ by Rakeesh (enjoyed it).

I am wondering about Fem!Harry/Snape stories. How do writers get around the squicky feeling that Snape (unintentionally or not) pairs with H to recreate what was lost with Lily?

Canon Snape is the prototypical "stuck-in-the-past" guy. So it seems a bit odd that when he does get in his first mutual relationship he overcomes the social hurdles of a 20+ age difference, a student/teacher history and pairing with the kid of his childhood friend and unrequited love? Each one of those factors is not impossible to overcome (it happens in real life for sure) but to overcome ALL of them? If it is a time-travel fic then at least the age issue is resolved. It seems like unless their was a strong incentive, why choose H over choosing someone more compatible or just continuing the single life? What draws him out? If Snape starts with canon characterization, the simple fact of Harry having different bits this time doesn't seem like enough to fundamentally change Snape.

*So, I am genuinely curious*, how do writers get around this issue? What plots devices and character developments are usually used? /Are they compelling enough?/ Or is the issue not addressed? Should it be?

Thanks!
