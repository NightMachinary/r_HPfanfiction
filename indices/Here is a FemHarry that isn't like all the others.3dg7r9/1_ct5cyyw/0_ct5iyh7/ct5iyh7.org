As a Snarry fan, the fact of the matter is the best Snape/Harry does not really have canon characterization of Snape. Canon Snape is a creep. Fanon Snape is a tortured, deep hero. Canon Snape is obsessively fixated on a girl who he hadn't talked to since he was 16, and who died when he was about 20, and it has become so twisted inside him that he becomes something almost like Gollum, fixated on the precious.

Fanon Snape discovers that what he felt for Lily was a pale imitation of love, compared to the true parternship and respect and connection he feels for Harry (or fem!Harry as the case may be). Usually he comes to understand that Harry's life sucked and Harry has dealt with hardship, just like Snape, while Lily was beloved by her parents and lived a charmed life (until her untimely death). This understanding that Harry brings helps Snape realize that what he felt for Lily was a crush, an infatuation, not true love. Canon Snape could never get to that point, because he was too obsessed with his own pain to see anyone else's.
