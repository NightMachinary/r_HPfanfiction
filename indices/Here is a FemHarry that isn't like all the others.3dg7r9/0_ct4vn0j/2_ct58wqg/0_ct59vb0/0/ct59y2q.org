  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet

  -A while back, I wondered what might have happened if, instead of being stuck with a child whom he viewed primarily as James Potter's, Snape had to protect a child he considered predominately to be Lily's. -I also wanted to augment and explore Harry's extraordinary capacity for love, an aspect of the series which intrigued me and which I'd have liked to seen more of.-I have rated this fic as "Mature" both to account for future chapters that have not yet been written, and because this pairing, particularly in the context of this fic, where Harriet and Snape know each other from her first year, is one that many people may find hard to accept. My rating is meant in respect of that distinction.-Cheat Sheet: If you want CoS, start with Ch 1. If you want PoA, start with Ch 15. If you want GoF, start with Ch 49. GoF is still ongoing. -Finally, sometimes I quote from canon, but I don't have it marked because that always really jars my reading experience. Considering that this is fanfic, I'm sure you're used to assuming that anything you recognize belongs to JK Rowling, who deserves all the credit. We wouldn't be here without her.

  Hollis Potter walked into what she thinks is the final battle of the war that's been raging for the last six years, only to find, when it's over and she's officially lost everything, that she's not where she's supposed to be. Or, rather, she's not when she's supposed to be. She wouldn't have made it as far as she did without being stubborn, however, so she pushed past the surprise and the grief and decides to change it, no matter the cost. --Cross-posted on FanFic: Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. [Slightly Edited/Reworked]

  This DOES NOT reflect my actual attitude towards God. I believe in Him, and I know He loves us - I just don't think that Hollis would think so. As far as I know, Harry was never exposed to church or to God, and I think the lack of knowledge in addition to what he had been through would've made him less inclined to think well of Him.

  What if Harry Potter was born a girl and known as Rosalie Potter? How might it change the dynamics of life as the most famous teenager in the Wizarding World? At the end of Rosalie Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, war has broken out in the Wizarding World as a result the attack on Hogwarts. Forced to spend the summer at Grimmauld Place for her own safety, Rosalie learns more about herself and the people around her than she ever thought possible. Relationships form, friendships change and she learns just how much the people in your life influence who you are and who you have the potential to become.

  A/N: Hi all! This is my first HP-verse fanfiction! This is a repost from other sites as I have posted elsewhere. It's a WIP currently that I am just returning to after an enforced break due to real life dramas, but I am back writing again now which is very exciting. I hope you all enjoy it. Just something for you to consider while reading, while I've read over this for spelling and grammar, etc myself, I currently don't have a beta reader, so I apologise if I've missed anything.In this story Harry was born a girl. He will stay a girl throughout, but most of what happened in all the books up the end of the sixth book stay true to the plot. I'm not going to give you a background to the plot because you should be able to pick most of it up from the story line.Please let me know what you think :)~Quill ********************************************************* Disclaimer: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by JK Rowling, various publishers including but not limited to Bloomsbury Books, Scholastic Books and Raincoat Books, and Warner Bros., Inc.
