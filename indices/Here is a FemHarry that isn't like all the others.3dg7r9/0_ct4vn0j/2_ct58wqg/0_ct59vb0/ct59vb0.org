I've tried. I can't really get over the underage sex worker apologist feel to it, though.

My favorite fem!Harry by far is linkao3(The Never-ending Road by laventadorn). I also like linkao3(Life As She Knows It by Meg_NeverMore) and linkao3(Gravity by SlytherinsQuill). They're all fem!Harry/Snape but none of them are underage.
