I don't know what those other guys are complaining about at all. There is nothing wrong with a good sized paragraph and they shouldn't be grammar shaming. They're not obese, bloated, and wordy, they're beautiful, big structured, and heavily detailed. I can't belive they have never heard of health at every structure. All paragraphs are equal in usefulness no matter their size or shape. Just because someone who has a PhD in literature they automatically have all the answers and are always right and get to make up al the rules? It is a sad state of affairs when we let someone who so openly hates and oppressed larger entities rule over all. Why are concise paragraphs the only sign of good writers? You can't be a good writer if you make your paragraphs a little on the hefty side? Whale I'll tell you what, they don't get to tell you what makes a good writer, only you do. You're the only one that matters, and I say make your paragraphs as big as you want and let your sentences run wild and free and hell don't even bother with punctuation Take back your freedom to express you self any way you want! Fight the man, man! If they don't like it they can just go back to not offering you professional work exactly how they were before you wrote that paragraph. And if the readers don't like it too bad, you don't need their stinking praise and applause!
