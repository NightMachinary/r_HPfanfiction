To follow up on the last point. The epilogue shits on the memory of the fallen by allowing people like Malfoy to live a normal life instead of rotting away in a prison cell for murder, terrorism and treason.

Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore were no good people. The later might have had good intentions but he fucked up, badly. And yet Harry spits on all the dead by naming his son Albus Severus. Add in the casual disregard for Ron assaulting a muggle and that is the reason these characters get bashed, just for the last chapter of the books.

And the books are far too forgiving towards people like Lupin, who was a coward, an asshole who broke his wedding vows within a year and did almost nothing to help Harry (the Patronus lessons were part of his job and even those were not that good since he saw that Harry was not getting the spell to work and yet set the dementor/boggart free) and you have more reasons, why certain characters are portrayed negatively.
