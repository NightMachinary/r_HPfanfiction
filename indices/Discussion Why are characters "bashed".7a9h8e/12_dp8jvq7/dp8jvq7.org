Fact 1: Most fanfiction is shit writing.

Fact 2: Bashing is shit character design and writing.

Any story that has bashing in it is by default bad. Bashing takes away a character's third dimension. A bashfic-Ron or bashfic-Dumbledore will never be well done villains, because everything that makes a good villain is taken from them. They will not learn, they will not grow with the challenges, they won't adapt or overcome. Bashed characters are a caricature of the actual character where their worst flaws are exaggerated and their better sides forgotten or ridiculed. Why are they written? They're easy to beat. To some they may even be satisfying to beat. Authors dislike, or even hate the actual character and find satisfaction in taking away everything that would make the character interesting, followed by ridiculing and beating the empty husk that is left over.

Why is it popular? I think for the same reason the "Transformers" movies are popular. Its mindless. They're easy, black and white. And to be honest... consuming it isn't bad. I cannot blame someone trying to find something that lets your brain go into standby and just consume.

But I'm with you. I don't find the appeal in them either.
