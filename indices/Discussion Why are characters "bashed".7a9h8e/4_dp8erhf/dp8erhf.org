Part of it with Ron is because if you don't write him well, he's kind of a waste of a character. He can be written well, but people focus on the easily inflated ego, the temper, the inadequacy complex.. Which admittedly is a part of Ron's character but he's more useful than that.

He is the Wizard Friend, the one who understands the culture of wizzardly affairs. Hermione knows magic, but Ron understands Wizards.

It gets weird when you have a more knowledgeable Harry (lets say if he was raised by magic users) but Ron's role still makes sense as one who is intrinsically tied by his relations to the Ministry .
