The process goes something like this, I suspect:

- You read a fic in which they're bashed.
- You realize that the bashing has roots in canon.
- This colors your view of the canon character.
- You write a fic.
- This view of the canon character bleeds through.
- You decide to give them their comeuppance.
- You forget to justify that in story.

I did that in a story which I wrote for NaNoWriMo. But then, it was NaNoWriMo, and I killed Ron Weasley off twice.
