  First of all, many fanfiction authors are ... not good.

Most fanfictions authors are bad.

  Then there's the tendency to look at the world in black-and-white, which is so typical of the US where most authors live. Disney is a perfect example of that. The heroes are all good with no bad characteristics, the villains have no redeeming features. JKR managed to create ambiguous characters with both good and bad sides.

JKR was just as guilty creating black-and-white world, since Voldemort and his Death Eaters almost had none redeeming values. (Malfoys' love for each other hardly qualified, as many Nazi monsters were also 'loving family persons')

  He's a lazy glutton, and starts out being borderline abusive towards Hermione
#+end_quote

He and Harry were both slackers. At least Ron as a Pureblood could afford to slack off, whereas Harry couldn't. Hermione was once a jerk as well. For example, if you had been on the receiving end of Hermione's Wingadium Leviosa showoff, what would you have thought? Ron didn't even insult her directly, but merely complained to his other friends. As for calling someone abusive, what about Hermione? She physically assaulted Ron for kissing another girl, even though she wasn't in a relationship with him.

  Dumbledore is a particularly difficult character. He makes so many mistakes, and contradicts himself so much, that the only conclusion is that he's either evil or massively incompetent. He always knew that Harry would have a bad childhood, and then he hides vital information from him to ... spare him? He always knew that Harry would have to face Voldemort, and does nothing to prepare him for that. He has several powerful positions, but doesn't make sure that justice has properly been done in the case of Sirius Black. Sirius Black was supposedly Voldemort's right hand man (or something like that), and wasn't even questioned before being thrown into Azkaban.

Dumbledore is the worst written character in the entire Series. He is nothing but a dumbed down plot device so kids could play heroes. On the other hand, if you give JKR a pass, then Dumbledore's in-story behaviors were one of utter incompetence and criminal negligence. He completely failed as a political and military leader. Someone like him should be bashed worse than Neville Chamberlain or Herbert Hoover in history.
