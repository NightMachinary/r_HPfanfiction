This is a good point. Dumbledore is leading the magical UN, the magical parliament/highest court of Britain, the Defense committee and a bunch of other important positions. It is his job to see that everyone else does their work correctly and make sure that something important like a war crime trial goes over without half of the accused bribing their way to freedom. That was his job and he failed miserably.
