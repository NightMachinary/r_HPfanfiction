People keep attributing Dumbledore with this god like ability to do everything. He tried and he failed to get the other death eaters convicted. He's just a fallible man. Gifted sure, but fallible like anyone else.

We also don't even know what actual political authority Dumbledore had or if it was a ceremonial position.
