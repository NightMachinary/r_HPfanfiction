We don't even know how that happened at all. We don't know whether he had help or how he did it, or even exactly when he defeated Grindelwald.

Dumbledore was just one of the most visible during the Death Eater trials. It took a whole government to fail for the Death Eaters to get off. Dumbledore couldn't force the government to imprison people. He wasn't the dictator. He wasn't even Minister. He was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot; a position you can be easily removed from as we saw in Order of the Phoenix. His only real job was being the head of Hogwarts. Influential, but not one that has the authority to throw people in prison.
