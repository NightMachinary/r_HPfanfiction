First of all, many fanfiction authors are ... not good. They write shallow, 2-dimensional characters based on just a few character traits, so the characters end up as caricatures of themselves.

Then there's the tendency to look at the world in black-and-white, which is so typical of the US where most authors live. Disney is a perfect example of that. The heroes are all good with no bad characteristics, the villains have no redeeming features. JKR managed to create ambiguous characters with both good and bad sides. [[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/][Miyazaki]] is a master of that.

The plot also raises questions about the characters' personalities and motives. Ron is a brave and loyal friend, but his irrational jealousy often trumps that loyalty, which creates problems. He's a lazy glutton, and starts out being borderline abusive towards Hermione.

Dumbledore is a particularly difficult character. He makes so many mistakes, and contradicts himself so much, that the only conclusion is that he's either evil or massively incompetent. He always knew that Harry would have a bad childhood, and then he hides vital information from him to ... spare him? He always knew that Harry would have to face Voldemort, and does nothing to prepare him for that. He has several powerful positions, but doesn't make sure that justice has properly been done in the case of Sirius Black. Sirius Black was supposedly Voldemort's right hand man (or something like that), and wasn't even questioned before being thrown into Azkaban.

Not to mention that Hagrid in effect /kidnapped/ Harry from his own godfather. Harry was /immediately/ sent to the Dursleys, even before Sirius became a suspect. And then he was /left on the doorstep in November/ with just a letter telling the Dursleys that they now had another mouth to feed, and /btw your sister is dead/. Many fics use that to remove Harry from the Dursleys and give him a happy childhood somewhere else.

How did everyone know what Harry looked like? Why was Remus the only werewolf to go to Hogwarts? Why did he keep his distance from Harry, even after 3rd year?

The plot raises so many questions that it's easy to answer them by attributing central characters with incompetence or outright malice.
