I think a big part of the problem is that most fanfiction authors read fanfiction, so fanon and canon eventually start blurring together. If you read the Harry Potter series back in...let's say, High School, and for the past few years you've only been reading fanfiction, you're probably going to associate fanon character traits with how the characters actually act.

Sirus suddenly becomes a swag master who hits on anything with a vagina. Dumbledore's eye twinkles are secretly legilimency and every single action he takes, including small actions like eating some spaghetti and taking a shit, are merely steps in his plan to sacrificing Harry for the Greater Good.

Ron is a lazy glutton who would gladly sell out Harry for a knut, and won't let Harry get any form of happiness without being insanely jealous about it. Hermione is a sex goddess with rockin tits and no physical flaws whatsoever, and she also has an IQ of over 1000. She is always right. Always.

Severus is either a pedophile who fucks Draco on the daily and would love to crucio first years, or he's just a whiny bitch going on about 'muh Lily' and swears total loyalty to Indy!Harry despite years of mutual hatred.

I was once talking to a friend of mine who hates Ron; when I asked why, he mentioned the usual 'oh he betrayed Harry at the tournament and the Horcux hunt' and then he said that Ron called Hermione a mudblood. I was speechless for a moment, asked if he was 100% sure on that, and he said yes.

Another problem is that, well, I personally think that JKR didn't have every single plot idea planned out when she started writing the series. Some stuff might have been thought of (stuff like Severus loving Lily, for one) but overall I doubt it. So when we look at the actions of characters in later books, it makes their actions in previous books look dastardly when it wasn't intended to be.
