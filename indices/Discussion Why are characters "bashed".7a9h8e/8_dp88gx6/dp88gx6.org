I think many writers are sick of certain characters being portrayed too 'light sided', so to speak. While I find it well rounded that Rowling had genuine, well thought out and consistent flaws for the main characters, I feel that some of the surrounding elements did not appropriately act.

Everyone thinks Ron magically matured post-BoH, despite abandoning his friends in their most dangerous adventure yet (and it wasn't even the first time he did this! Tournament, yeah?)

Everyone thinks that Dumbledore is still an infallible man, even though his desire to keep secrets and manipulations caused pain, suffering, and death to many people.

Or Molly Weasley, and her flaky attitude towards Hermione in 4th year was somehow easily forgotten.

A lot of writers, myself included, like having fictions where these flaws don't magically disappear, that some people don't see these characters as inherently good. Now, I draw a line at the absurdity of some of the excessive and OOC fictions out there, but a lot of people view bashing as a portrayal that these characters, canon wise, are incapable of being anything but good. Ron was an ass. I expect him to eventually grow out of it or get worse. Molly is a bit judgemental. Dumbledore left a magical child on the doorstep of magic-hating people.
