Yup. That's why you'll also see fics of people getting revenge on Umbridge much more well-received than others.

But most people have a few characters they dislike beyond Umbridge. For me, it's Ron and Snape. For some others, it's Ginny and Molly. For some it's Harry himself. And I think people with these preferences are more likely to enjoy fics that bash their "least-favourites".
