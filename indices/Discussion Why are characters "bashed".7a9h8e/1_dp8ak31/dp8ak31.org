Let's see:

The romantic obstacle is always bashed, because laziness and stupidity. See: Ginny in Harry/other fics, Ron in Hermione/other fics, James in Snape/Lily fics, Lily in Snape/other fics, Harry in Draco/Ginny fics.

Because people writing wank fantasies want their protagonists to be all self righteously lecturing, which can't be done unless they strawman the other characters and take away their ability to argue reasonably. See: The whole indy!Harry genre.

Because it is edgy and oh-so-cool.

Because fanfiction by its very nature is an echo chamber of unoriginal opinions. If someone writes a particular kind of fic, then everyone starts writing the same kind, to the point that we have purely fanon templates of several kinds of fics. Fandom breeds stupidity.
