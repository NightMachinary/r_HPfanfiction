For me, the word bashing means the story isn't well written. Good characterization is one of the pillars of a good work. You can dislike a character and still write them well. Declaring "bashing" in your story summary is basically admitting you just created a strawman to beat on and not a fully fleshed out realized character. Fully fleshed out characters don't have to be likable.
