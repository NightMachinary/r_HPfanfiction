Your three main characters are:

- Harry, whose main virtue is attendance and doesn't seem terribly curious or interested to be in a school of FUCKING MAGIC, or about his parents, or anything that happens to him
- Ron, who occasionally fails even at that
- Hermione, who beats Ron for attendance and /also/ seems to give a shit about being in a school of FUCKING MAGIC, even if her interest is mainly that it's a school and not, you know, MAGIC, and also she has some skill that she seems to gain through her own efforts, and also she's got occasional bits of common sense (ie let the professors handle things when you can, since they're better at magic, better studied, and it's their actual job)

It's not surprising that she's put on a pedestal sometimes. You just have to blur away her flaws a bit to make her a worthwhile protagonist, instead of giving her a personality transplant as with Harry and Ron.
