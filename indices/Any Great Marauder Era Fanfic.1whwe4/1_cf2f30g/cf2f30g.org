I'll second The Life and Times, and also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3323816/1/Commentarius][Commentarius]] by B.C. Daily. It's L/J and novel-length, (slightly AU because it was started pre-HBP where we learned about Lily and Snape's backstory), and is Lily-centric but a LOT of marauder shenanigans and great characterization. I've been reading this fic for six years.

Also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9465821/1/Buried-Treasure-and-Transmogrify][Buried Treasure and Transmogrify]], another very good, long L/J fic.
