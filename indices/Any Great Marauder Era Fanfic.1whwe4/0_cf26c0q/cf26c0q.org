Depends what you're looking for... I know two authors that have really managed to make this era their own:

Wilhemena Willoughby generally writes short (under 10k words), but powerful pieces that are definitely worth a read. They span the Marauders' school years, mostly, but there are a few of Lily and James' married life, from memory. I would definitely recommend "That Elusive Aha Moment" and "The Anatomy of a Bromance". [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1473497/Wilhelmina-Willoughby]]

MarauderLover7 is another good one: his/her stuff spans quite a few years (there's one with Remus being bitten, and then there's one set in the post-Hogwarts, Order days, and then obviously quite a bit of their school stuff). I'd recommend "White Flags" (completed), but the shorter stories are all very good too. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4684913/MarauderLover7]]

Now onto story recs:

CokeBottleK's "All Right, Evans?" is a very good 6th year fic; quite long, and very intricate. It basically pieces together everything that's hinted at in canon, and the characters are very dimensional and well done. There's a 7th year sequel (already over 100k words) that the author's working on now. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8528896/1/All-Right-Evans]]

JChrissy's "Before They Fall" is also supposed to be quite good, but I haven't read it, so I'm reccing it based on what I've heard. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=315315]]

And then, of course, there is the classic "Shoebox Project" (Sirius/Remus, but focuses on the other Marauders too) that's very well done,and very funny. It's set during their school days, and the authors have also drawn a lot of pictures to accompany the story. It's very clever. [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/]]

Hopefully these keep you busy for a while. :)
