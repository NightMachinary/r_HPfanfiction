[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8944615/1/The-Marauders-Notes][Marauder's Notes]] - Spans 6th and 7th year, not much pairing, mainly L/J, and it's written in a form of charmed notes, passed in class. It's a fun read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want to Make a Memory?]] - Haven't read it in a while, so I hope it's as good as I remember, but it's basically a story of Marauders from their first year to that fateful Halloween.
