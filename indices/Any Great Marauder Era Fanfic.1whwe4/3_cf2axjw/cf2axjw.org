[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] is a WIP about the first few years of the Marauders. It's a bit slow-paced (103 chapters and they're in the summer after their second year) but I think it's more than worth the read. We often see the middle and the ending of the Marauder's friendship, but it's rare to find a story that chronicles the beginning in such detail.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] is something of a classic in Marauder era fics, though it has suffered from a slight Seinfeld effect. A lot of authors consider L&T a big part of their head canon, which can make the original fic feel a bit cliche.
