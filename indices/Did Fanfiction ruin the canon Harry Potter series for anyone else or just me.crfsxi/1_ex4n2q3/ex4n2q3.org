I wouldn't say that reading fanfiction /ruined/ canon for me, but it did cause me to look at the original books in a different light. Then again, rereading the books with my adult perspective probably would have caused me to be more critical of them regardless of any fanfic I read. In particular, I'm less forgiving of some of the character flaws that were played for laughs in the books but in retrospect are egregious.

I still love what JKR made, and I love the fact that she created such beautifully fertile ground for others to build upon. I can examine the flaws in the things I love without losing my love for the work overall.
