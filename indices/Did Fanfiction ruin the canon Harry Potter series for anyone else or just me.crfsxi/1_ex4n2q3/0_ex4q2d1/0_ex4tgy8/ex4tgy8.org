Discussions on this sub led me to realize more of Hermione's flaws, including the one you mentioned, but when I re-read the first five books, what stood out most for me is Ron's flaws and the black-and-white way the narative treats bullies.

Regarding Ron, during my re-read I noticed things like what he had to say about his Squib relative, his complete lack of caring about the topic of slavery, his gawking at Neville's parents as if they were an entertaining spectacle, etc. As a kid I just glossed over that, but I'm less forgiving now.

Regarding bullies, until book 6 the Harry Potter series follows the same narrative trend of other YA novels such as /Ender's Game/: When the main character is tormented by a bully the MC chooses to take matters into their own hands rather than get help from an adult. The MC retaliates with even greater force than the bully used, giving worse than they got, and the narative congratulates them for this eye-for-an-eye win. Looking back, I recognise how I internalized that message from this and other books, and realise it's not a good message to give preteens. Attempting to resolve conflicts that way in reality creates a whole mess of worse problems.
