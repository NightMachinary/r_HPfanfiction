I think Ron's character, and his character flaws, fit in with how the rest of the Weasleys are portrayed. Namely, the narrative tells us they're great, the Burrow is Harry's home away from "home", but when you look closer, the shine comes off them. Some readers handwave it with "Oh, all families have their troubles and flaws", but goddamn, sometimes this family gets real toxic.

Here's how the story tells you that the Weasleys are meant to be good and heroic to our plucky orphan eyes:

  Life at The Burrow was as different as possible from life in Privet Drive. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.

  The end of the summer holidays came too quickly for Harry's liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at The Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up in Privet Drive.

In reality, the Weasley parents buy Percy a new owl for making prefect, while Ron gets a secondhand junk wand. Fred and George bully Percy and change his badge to read "Bighead Boy", and scar Ron for life with the spider teddy bear prank, while Molly is too busy doing something else to enforce discipline. The term "scarlet woman" gets tossed around the house and Ron ends up bringing it to school, a parallel to the Malfoy family teaching Draco to throw slurs like "mudblood" around at school. Mrs. Weasley says "That's everyone in the family" when Ron gets his prefect badge, leading to Fred and George's "What are we, next door neighbors" line.

  "I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!"

  "What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?" said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.

Though just like the narrative treatment of bullying that you mentioned, in this case, the narrative is incredibly tolerant and accepting of people deemed "heroic", to the ridiculous extreme of Harry naming his son after Snape and Dumbledore.
