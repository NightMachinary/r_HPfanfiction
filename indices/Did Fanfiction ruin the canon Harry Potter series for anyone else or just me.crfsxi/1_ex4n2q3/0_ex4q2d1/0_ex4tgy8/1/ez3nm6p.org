  what he had to say about his Squib relative, his complete lack of caring about the topic of slavery, his gawking at Neville's parents as if they were an entertaining spectacle

It would be perhaps better to mention actual flaws? He has nothing to say about his squib relatives, his view of elf slavery is shared by the vast majority of magic users (and are justified in canon) and he ceased his attempts to see Neville's parents (it doesn't seem he actually saw them) the moment he learned about them being tortured into insanity. I don't see how any of this is egregious.
