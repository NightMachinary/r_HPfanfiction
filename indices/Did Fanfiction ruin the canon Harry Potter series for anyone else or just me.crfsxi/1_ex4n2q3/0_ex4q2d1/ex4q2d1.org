  I'm less forgiving of some of the character flaws that were played for laughs in the books but in retrospect are egregious.

What are these character flaws, out of curiosity?

The one that stood out for me, re-reading the books in a post-social media era, was Hermione's textbook "Not Like the Other Girls" personality. Her closest friends are boys, she has no girl friends even after living with a bunch of girls for 6 years, is proud of her low-maintenance appearance, and is disparaging toward other girls for having girly or feminine interests. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth, because Hermione was held up for a long time (in my mind, and in other people's) as an example of a great female character/protagonist/deuteragonist.
