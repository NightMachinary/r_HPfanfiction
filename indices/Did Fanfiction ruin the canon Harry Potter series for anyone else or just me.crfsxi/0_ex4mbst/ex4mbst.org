Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

Sometimes it's the other way around. Like, I have a rotten spell and every fic I try reading ends up sucking for a few weeks. Then I revisit the canon series and it feels like a breath of fresh air.

If you ever get sick of Ginny slipping Harry love potions, all Slytherins secretly being misunderstood saints, Harry inheriting half of london because his great great grandpa was Godric Gryffindor or eleven year old children speaking with each other like they're in parliament --- reading the actual books can be a good palate cleanser to set your head straight.
