  reading the actual books can be a good palate cleanser to set your head straight.

Something that I've rarely seen fanfic do right (outside of crackfics) is a serious Harry who lashes out with moments of snarkiness. That situational humor that fits the context and characters involved is one of the best parts of Harry's character, and makes him loveable even when he is being angsty or powerless, the most frustrating parts of his character. This is how the books remind me why I love Harry Potter all over again. And humor like this is timeless, so it's still good in re-reads, unlike OOC character humor exaggerating traits for laughs, eg "Ron stuffs his face like a glutton" or "Dumbledore laces his lemon drops with loyalty potions". Nor does it age as poorly as referential or "punching down" humor. (See: A Black Comedy and the midget parts.)

  Harry's Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked round and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.

  "Do you remember me telling you we are practising non-verbal spells, Potter?"

  "Yes," said Harry stiffly.

  "Yes sir."

  "There's no need to call me 'sir', Professor."

  The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione.

  "Why were you lurking under our window?"

  "Listening to the news," said Harry in a resigned voice.

  His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. "Listening to the news! Again?"

  "Well, it changes every day, you see," said Harry.
