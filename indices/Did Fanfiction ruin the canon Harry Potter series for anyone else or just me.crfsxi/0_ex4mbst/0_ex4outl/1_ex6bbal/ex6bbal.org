I think part of the problem is that the snark disproportionately happens around the Dursleys in canon, and most fanfic authors either make the Dursleys worse than canon and/or get them out of the picture as soon as possible. That, and it doesn't show through in the movies as much. Personally, I wish I could write snarky!Harry better, but it rarely seems to flow naturally in my stories.
