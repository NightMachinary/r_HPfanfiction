This is why I really don't like the humour in the Black Comedy and don't understand why it's so popular. There are some fics that capture Harry's sassy humour though, they are just rare in fanfiction. Some examples I can think of that do include some of Harry's sassyness and sarcasm are linkao3(Harry potter and the problem of potions) and linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom)

  “Students are my punishments for my sins.”

  “You must have an awful lot of sins, then,” Harry said, and froze as he saw Professor Snape's expression
