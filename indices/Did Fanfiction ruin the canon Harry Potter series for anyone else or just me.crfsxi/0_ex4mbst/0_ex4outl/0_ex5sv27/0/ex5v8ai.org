  This is why I really don't like the humour in the Black Comedy and don't understand why it's so popular.

It has the "popcorn humor" of a frathouse comedy. Like the fanfic equivalent of Zoolander, it features zany character antics, which, due to the suspension of disbelief in crackfics, don't have to follow the rules of OOC that more serious fics are expected to adhere. Memorable, quotable zinger one-liners, like Zoolander's "But why male models?" or "Is this a house for ants?".

But just like Zoolander, it's very obviously a fic of its times. The social attitudes of the early 2000's were far less thoughtful and diplomatic than today's sensibilities. A house elf named Nappy and "teehee, no homo" jokes aren't that funny in this day and age.
