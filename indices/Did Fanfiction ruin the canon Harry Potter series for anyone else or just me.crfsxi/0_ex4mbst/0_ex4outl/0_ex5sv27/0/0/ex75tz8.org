A Black Comedy would be a lot more forgettable if it didn't have what is actually, IMO, a pretty good plot. Granted it doesn't really kick in until...I think chapter 10 or so? Before then it's all fratboy hijinks with Sirius, but then Voldemort and That Fucker start taking prominence and there's the twist over That Fucker's identity at the end.

I agree the exact humor and jokes used haven't aged well, but the bones of a good story are still there.
