  But just like Zoolander, it's very obviously a fic of its times. The social attitudes of the early 2000's were far less thoughtful and diplomatic than today's sensibilities.

Is this humour not still popular with certain groups of people though? I always thought it was due to me not being a guy and disliking 'frat boy' type humour in general. There are still a lot of comedy shows and movies I avoid today because I find them not funny and distasteful just like this fic.
