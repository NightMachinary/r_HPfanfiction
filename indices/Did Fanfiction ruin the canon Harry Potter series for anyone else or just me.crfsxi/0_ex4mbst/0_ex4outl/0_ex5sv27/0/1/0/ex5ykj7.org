  Is this humour not still popular with certain groups of people though?

It is. If you go on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/a-black-comedy-by-nonjon-m.5224/][Dark Lord Potter]], a HP fanfic review forum, it's one of their top-rated and most-discussed fics. The users there give it plenty of praise.

From my experience, the userbase there is a big fan of Indy and powerful!Harry fics.
