Fanfiction kind of did ruin canon for me. I grew up with HP and always but it on a high pedestal. I started reading fanfiction when I was about 13 and haven't stopped ever since. With time I noticed how many flaws there are in canon. My dislike towards the movies didn't help it either.

Though I think book 1-5 are still alright.
