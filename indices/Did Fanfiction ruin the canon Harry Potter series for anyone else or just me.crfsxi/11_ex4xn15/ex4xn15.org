Partially I suppose. Many fanfics add new twists to canon or offer interesting alternatives such as AU fics. So canon HP is just meh compared to the more novel fics.

But Rowling's prose etc is better than fanfic authors. Sure. I've come to the point that I must admit canon HP is a mediocre series. Plenty of plot holes, poor development compared to other professional authors. Canon HP is just a cherished childhood memory. For me, its either fanfic HP or top-notch professional writers.
