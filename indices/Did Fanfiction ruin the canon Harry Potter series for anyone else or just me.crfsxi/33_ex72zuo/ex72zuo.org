Fanfiction will never ruin Original series for me. The HP series are leagues above any Fantasy/Adventure writing that I've read. No offense to some really awesome Fanfiction writers out there, but there are very few authors who can match the brilliance or story telling and flow, that JKR did with the original series. (Not sure about her latest venture into Wizarding world or Tweets that's ruining a lot of people's Head canons though).

I can always go back to the original series and read them with the same obsession as I did so many years ago when I first came upon them.

Oh, and did I mention British Authors have their own Charm to their books, that I'm yet to come across in my own Nation's authors (Which is an English Speaking country) or American Authors.

I see the same Idyllic charm in Roald Dahl, Enid Blyton, C.S.Lewis etc.
