It's definitely made me more critical of many aspects of canon, and I'm always going to mourn the missed potential. Honestly though, a lot of it for me was just getting older. The books were such a staple of my childhood, and I read them over and over, but after a while I grew out of them a bit. By the time the 6th and 7th books were released I only read them once apiece and then continued on my merry way with fan fiction. By that point I enjoyed the fics that had dynamic plots and interesting world building (grown from the world I already loved), more than I enjoyed the books themselves. I will always love them and hold them in my heart though.
