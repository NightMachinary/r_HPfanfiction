I agree with you, in canon the wizarding world, at least to me, seems like it doesn't really change for the better and the losses on the Light side really do not result in a win for the good guys or maybe its a depressing win. So reading a fanfic with more of a "happy" ending just feels better for me.

But I must say that canon Severus is an awesome character, complex, conflicted, and a right nasty bastard, but still awesome.

(I tried some different synonyms of awesome, but really, to me that is the word that defines him. Definition of awesome: extremely *impressive* or *daunting*; inspiring great admiration, *apprehension*, or *fear.*)
