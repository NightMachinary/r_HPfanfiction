HP isn't my main fandom and it's one of those series I have a weird relationship with, in that I enjoyed the canon once upon a time, but now I've sort of... I don't want to say I've outgrown it, but I was never really in love with/nostalgic for HP in the same way that I love(d) a lot of my childhood favourites. In that sense I've found a lot more satisfaction in fix-its and other fanfic than I have in the original canon, purely because they tick my “This is what I wanted to read” and “Shiny new story is shiny” boxes. A lot of what I read is divergent to the point of almost being origfic.

With a couple of my fandoms, the world feels very wide to me. There's more of a sandbox, although the canon itself is more ‘closed'. I could cheerfully read six novels' worth of slice of life in those fandoms. This is hard to explain well, sorry.

HP isn't one of those for me.
