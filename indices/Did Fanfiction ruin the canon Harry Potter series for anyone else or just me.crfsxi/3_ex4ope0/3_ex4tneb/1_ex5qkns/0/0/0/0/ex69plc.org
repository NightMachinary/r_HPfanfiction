  To be fair, with GoT, the ending wasn't the problem, it was the way they executed it. The ending was rushed as hell, and entire plot threads were thrown out to get there, which is what makes it bad. The ending is almost certainly going to the the ending GRRM gives us in the books, it's just that it won't be as badly executed.

GRRM said that the show was killing off people he wasn't planning to kill off (or straight up not casting characters he'd planned things for), and it was creating an alternate timeline as the narrative consequences of those deaths and absences made it diverge from his plans for the books. I agree that we'll largely see the same ending, but there could be twists we weren't expecting.

  Also, while I've never read a fic of higher quality than canon, I've certainly read fics that I've enjoyed more than canon, weirdly.

My absolute favourite Harry Potter fanfic right now is The Dogfather by Hollimichele. It's an incredibly touching kidfic that makes me smile every time I re-read it. But I know it doesn't even touch canon in terms of quality.
