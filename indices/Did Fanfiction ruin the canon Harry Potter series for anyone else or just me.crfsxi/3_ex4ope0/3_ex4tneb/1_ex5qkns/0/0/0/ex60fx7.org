To be fair, with GoT, the ending wasn't the problem, it was the way they executed it. The ending was rushed as hell, and entire plot threads were thrown out to get there, which is what makes it bad. The ending is almost certainly going to the the ending GRRM gives us in the books, it's just that it won't be as badly executed.

GoT rant aside, I agree. The quality of a series cannot be judged until it's finished. Many fanfics have started off brilliantly, and then have been completely derailed later on, while others read like trash initially, but later chapters elevate the quality. Also, while I've never read a fic of higher quality than canon, I've certainly read fics that I've enjoyed more than canon, weirdly.
