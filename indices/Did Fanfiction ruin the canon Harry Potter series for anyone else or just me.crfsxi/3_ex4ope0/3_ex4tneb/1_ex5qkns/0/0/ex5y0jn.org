I was just being snarky because the claim that Victoria Potter, a fanfic that hasn't even finished second year, is better than Harry Potter canon, seemed ridiculous.

After the Game of Thrones finale, I don't fully judge serialized work until it's complete. Who knows what fuckery the writers of a work you enjoy will think up to poison the ending?
