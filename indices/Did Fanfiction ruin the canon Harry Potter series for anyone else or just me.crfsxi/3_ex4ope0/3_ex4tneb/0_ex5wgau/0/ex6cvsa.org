I don't think they're even commensurate. It just doesn't make sense to judge fanfic on the same scale as canon when fanfic either draws heavily on canon or is so different that I'm likely to lose interest (though that might be just me).

There have been a very few fics where the author has successfully done something as /big/ as JKR did (in worldbuilding/storytelling, not length), and a very few where I was blown away by the quality of the writing (yours being one), but I don't see a way of matching those two things together.
