I think the gaps in the worldbuilding provide a tension that increases the impetus for fanfiction. Rowling's Wizarding World has a specific mix of extremely minute details combined with large gaps/plot holes that's like catnip for fanfic writers. Many other fandoms with similar popularity (Star Wars, Marvel) don't have as much fanfic out there as Harry Potter.
