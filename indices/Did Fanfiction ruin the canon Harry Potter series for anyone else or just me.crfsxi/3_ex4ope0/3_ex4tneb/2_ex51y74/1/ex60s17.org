  Say what you want about JKR's shitty worldbuilding
#+end_quote

I'd be the first to call out JKR's sloppiness, but honestly it doesn't matter. JKR is a terrific worldbuilder and this entire community is a testament to the amazing world she built. It doesn't matter how old Charlie Weasley is, because that's not what Hogwarts is about.
