I found that in "Harry Potter and the Natural 20". Never read anything funnier, and really liked some of the ideas of the fic aside of the lulz crossover thing.

Like Lucius Malfoy being a gigantic bastard but who doesn't want Voldemort to return, because he actually has a much better plan to ensure pureblood supremacy : through politics, putting a loyal pureblood in every important job at the ministry, and ever so slowly pushing the muggleborn out of it, making them poorer an poorer with cleverly worded laws and regulations, and in the end make them unable to afford even wands.

That and some DeathEater were actually scary, like Bellatrix or Young Voldemort (diary) who completely fuck the MC over and actually outsmart him.
