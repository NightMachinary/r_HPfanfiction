Individual fics may not be better than canon but they often give a lot more depth to certain characters and groups than canon. Slytherins in the books are mostly a one dimensional group of bad guys. The better members include Andromeda who we know almost nothing about, Slughorn who plays favorites and ignores non important students and Snape who may as well be a villain. At least fanfiction tries to portray slytherins as a more balanced group. Voldemort/Tom Riddle are also given way more depth in fanfiction than canon.

As a whole I do agree that no fanfiction comes close to being as good and complete worldbuilding wise as the original Harry Potter books. The fact that all of us here are still reading and writing HP fanfiction based on the books and not on some random fanfic speaks for itself.
