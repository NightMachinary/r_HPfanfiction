Canon isn't "new". I already know the canon story and reading it again wont do much for me. However, it's better written than most fanfics. When I read fanfic, my expectations are usually really low. That way I can enjoy fics even if they're poorly written.

I usually read fics losing myself in them, inheriting emotions from the protagonist on a strong level (this is why I dislike tradegy, heartbreak or similar). This works far better if I don't know exactly what is going to happen. It also works better the more I can relate to the protagonist, because there's less disconnect between what he does and what I would do.
