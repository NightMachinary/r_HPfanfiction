No screw canon ive ways hated canon Harry I just never liked how he never tried to better himself even knowing that every year people are out to get him he never tried to learn the loop holes or better magic never learned rituals and dont get me started on he's love for he's parents makes no sense he didn't even know them idk maybe it's me but if someone killed my family and i found out I had magic I'd try to better myself by all means to be ready for the enemy the moment Harry faced vold in first year should of been that moment of Slytherin ambition sadly he became a Weasley instead
