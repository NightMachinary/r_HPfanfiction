The opposite for me. I don't like the majority of HP fics because they retread canon with worse writing and awkward interpretations of the characters and lore. I tend to prefer stories outside of canon that seek to expand the world without 'refining' it.

We may have grown up a little, realized that JKR isn't a perfect writer, but for my part no fanfiction has even come close to affecting me the way her books did and have done.
