As a fan of particular ship in HP Fandom (Drarry to be precise), I couldn't read any other good stories with Harry/anyone else. I was really disgruntled and I wasn't sure I could go back to Canon. Surprisingly, when I tried re-reading Canon, I could. I even tried reading Harry/Ginny stories and I am really fond of them. I still can't stand Harry/anyone else though, like Hermione, Fleur, some Slytherin girl, some Ravenclaw girl etc, which is really tragic coz there are good Fanfictions out there with these random pairings.

In my head, Canon and Fanon are just two separate worlds I suppose. I will blame Fanon for me gaining an 'involuntary' respect for Snape and some other awful characters in Canon. That changed because of Fanfiction, and I'm not happy about it.

You know what ruined Harry Potter series for me though - Crimes of Grindelwald movie.
