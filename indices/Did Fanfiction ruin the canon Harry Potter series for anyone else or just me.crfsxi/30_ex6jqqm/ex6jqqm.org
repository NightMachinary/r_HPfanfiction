Fanfiction provided potential and alternatives that I didn't get in canon. So in that regard it satisfied my need for Harry to be powerful, because throughout the books the thing that always made me so mad and sad was his lack of agency and choice in many instances. But canon will always be the best for making me laugh. The prisoner of Azkaban was the funniest in my opinion and no fanfic that I have read has reached this level of humour.
