I did a small study one time: the average length of an HP story on ff.net is 10,000 words. There are 800,000 of them, so a total of 8,000,000,000 words. Now using the “rule” that 90% of everything is crap, that leaves 800,000,000 words of HP writing that is good to great. There are just about 1,000,000 words in the 7 books. That means that Rowling has written significantly less that 1% of the best HP literature, and that's just counting ff.net 😀
