Fanfiction has made me aware of many flaws in the canon story, so I definitely see it as a more average series than the masterpiece I saw it as when I was younger.

A problem I have with fanfiction though, is how so many fanfics try to address these problems rather than just write a completely different story. Sometimes people write a fanfic /just/ to try and fix something, rather than write an actually interesting story. People go the manipulative Dumbledore route because of him leaving Harry on a doorstep etc., but that's usually just substituting a plot hole for a boring, one-dimensional antagonist.
