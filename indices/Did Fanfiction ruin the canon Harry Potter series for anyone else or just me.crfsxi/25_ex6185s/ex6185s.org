When reading fanfic I usually separate that world from the Canon one. Especially if that fic is AU or has OCs in it. I just think of it has a way to explore ideas and what ifs, we all tend to ask ourself what if this and this happened ecc; I find it amusing and interesting to explore how a certain character would react in certain situations. Some fic have the power to add on to the Canon world, though, and those are usually the best written ones. Personally I love a good fanfiction that keeps the character as close to Canon as they can, but I don't mind OOC-ness (?) if it's justified. I'm currently writing one so obviously I know that it's incredibly difficult to do so, so guys don't be too harsh, 'cause it's really hard.
