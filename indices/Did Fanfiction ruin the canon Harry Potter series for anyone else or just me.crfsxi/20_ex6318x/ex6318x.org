For me, it didn't. The original series was written for the first few books at a low point in JKR's life & she made the decision to (largely) not change the estsblished rules or retcon anything once she transitioned into a wealthy author with resources.

Also I take the books as they are - stories for kids, yes, but stories more specifically /aimed at British kids, mainly boys, in the 1990s/. She didn't have the resources or the ambition to aim for anything more. The fact they became well loved outside that intended demo is a bonus, not a primary achievement.

E: Intrigued by the downvotes - what's up with that, folks?
