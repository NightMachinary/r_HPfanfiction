Not books, JKR is exceptionally great story teller, especially on the low-level scene/dialogue writing level. Whenever I feel smug about her, I pick the bug and I am usually quite quickly conquered by how well written her dialogues and scenes are.

However, yes, the movies are mostly gone for me. I shown them to my children (again) couple of weeks ago, and I just couldn't stand movie!Hermione any more. It is just horrible how whole balance of all relationships is destroyed there.
