  Plus while I know the books describe the school uniform as having pointed witches hats, that always struck me as weird and cheesy and I ignored them in the books. In my head pictures, they didn't exist. And seeing them in film was even worse than on paper.

Wow. I was exactly the opposite. By the third films they stop with the hats and such and start going round the school in jeans and t-shirts. I was so annoyed by that, the pointy hats and stuff always seemed integral to me.
