Yes. I started into HP fanfic after GoF. Prior to that I'd occasionally re-read the series. After reading some absolutely fabulous fics, I only read the subsequent canon books once. And I hate JK's ending. I never liked the horcrux concept. And that epilogue? No thanks. I watched the first movie just to see what they might be like and never watched another one. Harry's eyes weren't even green. I've read the articles, I know why they aren't, but it's such an integral concept to the books that I just couldn't get past it. Plus while I know the books describe the school uniform as having pointed witches hats, that always struck me as weird and cheesy and I ignored them in the books. In my head pictures, they didn't exist. And seeing them in film was even worse than on paper.

So yes. HP fanfics ruined canon for me.
