After rereading the series a few times, I couldn't stand it anymore. This is a few years before I started reading fanfiction. Canon ruined it for me, but when I found out what fanfiction was, it truly gave me pleasure in the series. Because it explored different routes, or expanded in some areas where the book didn't. Or perhaps it took a different route, leading to a completely different story. It wasn't just simply Harry surviving, or the plot giving him just enough to get through the task that it had in store. Rather, it was and is Harry learning and exploring more of the wizarding world and not just Harry using the bare minimum to get through.
