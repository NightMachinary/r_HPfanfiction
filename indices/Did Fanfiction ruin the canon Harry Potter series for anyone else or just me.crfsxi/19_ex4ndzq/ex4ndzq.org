I wouldn't say ruin but I certainly don't think it's an amazing read as I thought as a child. So many dumb things, so many wasted potential. You can't deny Rowling became a hack around book 3 with the hole time-travel fiasco and how she kept adding random things and reconnect them later. Voldemort looks so cartoonish by book 5, the adults are completely useless early one and even later. The awful romance, the stacked Gryffindor cast with so little use of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. The absolutely merciless writing against Slytherin and the stupid desire to kill all the characters in the last books. In the same way, I just wish I could read more fanfics that explore those things and don't focus so much in Harry.
