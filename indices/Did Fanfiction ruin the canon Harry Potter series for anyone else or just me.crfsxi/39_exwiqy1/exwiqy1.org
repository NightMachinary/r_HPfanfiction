Yeah, though the time or two I started writing a Harry Potter fanfiction and needed to reference Sorcerer's Stone, I noticed that the writing was a lot better than I remembered. Not that that's surprising, I /did/ read the Harry Potter series 7 or 8 years ago and haven't reread any of them in the last four years other than the first few chapters of Sorcerer's Stone.
