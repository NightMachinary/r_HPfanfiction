Not reading it, no --- rather the opposite.

But writing it, with all the rereading and analysis of canon, made me hyper-aware of the weaknesses in writing and plotting, the obvious sketchy research, afterthoughts, and plot holes, and (unintentionally, I'm sure) Rowling's own prejudices.

So the answer to the question is yes.
