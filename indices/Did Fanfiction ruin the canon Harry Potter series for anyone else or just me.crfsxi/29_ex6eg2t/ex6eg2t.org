Fanon emphasizes plot wholes or aspects of canon that I disagree with or wish Harry had dealt with differently, but I find Fanon rarely portrays characters in a nuanced way. Dumbledore is either incompetent/arrogant, wise/kind, or manipulative - very few stories will incorporate all three into their story. Same with Harry - he's generally written as more proactive but (unless it's a crossover) the writers will then twist the story into a pretzel trying to keep as many elements of the canon plot as possible, even when they say it is AU.
