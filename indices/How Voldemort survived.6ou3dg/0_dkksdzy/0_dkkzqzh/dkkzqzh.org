  Harry survived AK? How? Most common theory is that he survived because of his mother's love. But Lily wasn't the only mother who love their kids or died for them. Why only Harry got this strange AK survive ticket but not other people in magical world.

Yes, well, that one is a misconception that some people can't seem to be able to get over. Lily's love did play a part, yes, but it was only one piece of the whole puzzle; certainly, it is a very visible puzzle and it is not a lie to say that Harry did survive because of Lily's love, but it did not happen /just/ because of it.

The whole thing begins with Severus bringing Tom the prophecy. In doing so, he'd earned something, be it gratitude or trust or something else, and upon realising he'd condemned Lily to death he used that which he gained to ask a favour of the Dark Lord: to spare Lily, to give her mercy. For /some/ reason, Tom chose to do what Severus begged him to, meaning that it was one of the few, if not the only, situations when he would genuinely offer someone mercy.

And so Tom did give her mercy, he did proclaim that one person can survive and he is offering it to her. Unknowingly to him and to her, his own magic, and mayhap Lily's as well, bound them when the deal was made. Then, in desperation, Lily begged him to trade mercy for her for mercy for Harry; but she did not attack him, she did not break the deal he gave her, and so in killing her because she annoyed him he accepted her deal, he took the mercy he'd offered Lily and gave it to Harry. That left him with the target, whom he could not strike down now, but he did not know and thus he did try, making the very magic that bound him to honour the deal he himself had offered strike back and slay him.

So, in the end, why was it that Lily's sacrifice was the only one that did work? Because she was the only person who genuinely could choose, whose choice genuinely did matter, who chose to sacrifice herself. All the rest of the mothers of children slain by Tom either weren't given mercy and were simply collateral damage or chose to run when they were. And as for Tom himself, well ... he was a brilliant kid, certainly, but time and again we've seen that at times he has problems understanding that intent and feelings can actually matter.
