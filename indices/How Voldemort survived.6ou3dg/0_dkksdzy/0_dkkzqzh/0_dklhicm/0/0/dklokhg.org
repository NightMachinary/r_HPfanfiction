It's far fetched? Yes!

It's logical? Yes!

Better than 'you mum loved you so you survived AK' theory? Yes.

Not only Harry was protected but his blood relatives were protected too due to connection through blood. And the thing that finally trumped this protection was resurrection ritual that used Harry's blood.

So yeah, Ritual based on blood does make more sense than 'sacrifice and love' when all the mothers love and die for their kids anyway.
