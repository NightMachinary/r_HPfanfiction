Harry's deal did practically nothing. His 'sacrifice' didn't save anyone.

And don't forget that it was Dumbledore that told Harry that his mother's sacrifice deflected AK. Dumbledore isn't exactly the one to tell the RIGHT thing when he is actually actively molding his lamb for sacrifice.

Remember:

“Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - page 624 chapter 37, The Lost Prophecy

And the scene with Snape! Dumbledore had been preparing Harry for ultimate sacrifice. Harry's survival meant Voldemort will have at-least one Horcrux alive. He had to die.

Anyway the point is 'love and sacrifice' didn't do anything when Harry did it. People still died! No one was miraculously protected by anything.

Inb4 No, his sacrifice didn't contribute to him surviving AK. He actually got hit by AK. AK, by nature, rips off the soul from body. Harry had two souls. After AK Voldemort's sould left since Harry's soul was whole and powerful than tiny piece of Voldemort. Had Harry chosen to die at King Cross then Harry's sould would have left, leaving behind an empty body of Voldemort's soul. Thus creating two Voldemorts.
