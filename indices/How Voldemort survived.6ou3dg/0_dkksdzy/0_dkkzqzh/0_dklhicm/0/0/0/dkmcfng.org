Even so, you pointed out that it was “far-fetched”, when my theory at least has a basis in the books because Harry did precisely the same thing, i.e. made a deal with Tom to spare someone (or in this case many someones) in exchange for his life; seventh book, by the way. Meanwhile, your own counter-theory to my “far-fetched” one has no basis in anything the story gives us and is nothing more than a random idea.

You can put whatever you want in your own stories, but when you say that someone's idea, one that actually has some kind of basis, is far-fetched, and then give a counter-proposal that is even more far-fetched and has no basis whatsoever, it will not make people think that there is any logic in what you are doing because it sounds like denial.

Also, the blood protection thing could be Dumbledore's doing, for all we know. After all, he was the one who wrote the letter for the Dursleys, and he certainly knows some obscure magic, so it's not a given that Lily's sacrifice is responsible for the whole “protected due to living in the Dursleys' home” thing. That one /might/ have been a ritual, for all we know. Though, obviously, you are free to think differently when you write your own stories.
