This extensive, far fetched and distorted theory is not needed. Just say that Lily did some insane ritual that protected Harry.

She tied that protection to Harry's blood and Voldemort's spirit or magic. that's why every time Voldemort tried to hurt Harry he wasn't able to do so.

It's far better than the lame "Lily's love" theory. Seriously! The only mother who 'chose' to protect her kids?
