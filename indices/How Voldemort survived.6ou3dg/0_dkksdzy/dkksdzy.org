That's your concern? That's the least confusing thing of that night. Compare it to others:

- Harry survived AK? How? Most common theory is that he survived because of his mother's love. But Lily wasn't the only mother who love their kids or died for them. Why only Harry got this strange AK survive ticket but not other people in magical world.

- It's thoughtful of Dumbledore to send Hagrid exact to pick up Harry.. No? I mean his godfather was still alive. And Hagrid didn't hand over Harry to Sirius because "Dembledore asked him to bring Harry" to Pivet drive. How did Dumbledore even know Voldemort attacked Potter family that night? Did he have someone 'watching' over Potters like he had Ms Figgs watching over Harry?

Any many more!
