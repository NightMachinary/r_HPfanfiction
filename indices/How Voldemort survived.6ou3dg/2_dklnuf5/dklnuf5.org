I believe Harry did die, and that it was Voldemort's soul that kept him alive. We know that Voldemort intended to use Harry for his last Horcrux that night. He prepared his soul to be split and inserted into a Horcrux, and I think that Lily's sacrifice destabilized the ritual. Hence, Voldemort's soul was successfully ruptured, but in the process he lost his body. This would also explain why other children never survived the AK. Though their mothers sacrificed themselves, the attacker wasn't intending to make a Horcrux.

Another possible theory is that Voldemort's last soul container belonged to Gryffindor, and Gryffindor's lingering presence in it refused to be occupied by dark magic. The artifact was destroyed, and Tom lost his body in the backlash. Without a soul container, the Horcrux went into Harry.
