In the AU I'm creating, I have something along roughly these lines:

[there is a well-known but forbidden ritual (that is tied into the history of the idea of 'purebloods') that Lily finds info about somehow. Considered very Dark b/c it requires human sacrifice. She constructs the ritual circle in HP's bedroom. Plan is that if Voldie gets to them, she'll trap him in the circle as the human sacrifice. James delays Voldie long enough for Lily to prime the ritual. Voldie AK's Lily, then, unknowingly, steps into the ritual circle. It triggers when he starts to cast the AK at Harry. B/c Horcruxes, the ritual consumes only part of his soul, the rest escapes. The scar is actually sowilo carved into his flesh and bone by Lily to begin ritual.

Conveniently, this allows me to have a good, but severely misunderstanding Dumbledore (for example, he thinks either Sirius was the true betrayer, and deserves Azkaban, or he gave Lily the info on what he thinks is a very Dark ritual, or forced her to do it, and therefore deserves Azkaban. He is afraid of prejudice against HP if him having had ritual performed on him becomes known, so he purposely blocks trial, thinking Sirius is guilty either way, and this way protects HP](/spoiler)
