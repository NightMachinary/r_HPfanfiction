I loved it too, but around OotP it became too much like the books. The characters are great, the story is well-written, but I expected changes, and instead, almost everything went the same way it did in the canon. Too bad. There are so many stories where Harry is raised by goblins, McGonagall, Malfoys, Sirius, Remus and Merlin knows who else, but so few where James and Lily survive and aren't neglectful dicks.
