[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/111713][Everyone Lives AU]]

If I remember correctly, everyone lives (literally). Harry is raised by his parents, Remus and Sirius are around (I don't recall what happened to Peter). It's well-written, but I have to warn you it's mostly canon rehash with a few changes (at least until OotP, I stopped reading in the middle of 5th book).
