I'm not sure why the hell nobody recced this one, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] has sections of a female Harry in the past, Ancient Egypt, Medieval Britain, and a couple others interspersed with sections of the present. It's a really really great story imo.
