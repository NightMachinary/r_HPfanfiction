This [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fapnkx/master_of_deathharry_excel_collection_help/][thread]] has a link to a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hhzXz1gjLoTW0QMNPqdwcpUj0QuOrZ5IdEYoyXDwtvE/edit#gid=0][google sheet]] that's a collection of MoD fics someone made a while back. It's got 72 fic recs so far. It's also got things like word count, completion status, ships, and what makes Harry MoD in the fic as categories next to each recommendation.
