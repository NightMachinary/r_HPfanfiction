I remember reading a story years ago where under the headmasters command one of the towers turn into a flying stone dragon and the selected students climb into it , It justifies the "Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus" . I remember that it was mcgonagall who landed the thing at a very low height to scare the other schools. I think the tournament was in beauxbatons.
