It's actually a family curse, one that only the patriarch knows, and cant share with others. The exact wording has faded away into history, and as a result will never be broken, but the gist is the head of the household will hear however many complaints that they have wrought, doubled. At one point the Malfoy line was similar to the Weasleys in the amount of offspring they had, however each patriarch has decided to have less and less kids as the complainers became worse.

If was almost broken until Draco came along.
