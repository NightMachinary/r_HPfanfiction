Messer Prongs would like to express his astonishment that Lucius Malfoy possessed the necessary equipment to produce anything other than a disappointment for his bought wife.

Messer Moony would like to express his revulsion to the respectable messer Prongs to put such unholy images in his head.

Messer Padfoot would like to note to Messer Prongs that Lucius Malfoy probably DID produce an adequate, but entirely expected disappointment, if he had to call it Draco.

Messer Wormtail advises Draco Malfoy to use less products on his hair, if he wishes to stop resembling a fairy shit.

Draco threw the parchment down in fury. "wait till my father hears about this, Potter!" new words appeared on the parchment.

Messers Padfoot, Wormtail, Moony and Prongs would like to groan collectively "sweet merlin, he says that too"
