Same situation here, I honestly have no idea what I read the first year or so of reading fanfiction, I just remember reading it...I wish I could though. There are so many times when a fic will be recommended on here, I start reading and realise 5 chapters in I've read it already but I have absolutely no memory of doing so but also know exactly what happens. I'm glad I'm not the only one.
