I wish I did! I actually think that the memories I have of my first fanfiction are wrong. The earliest real memory I have of reading fanfiction is when I stumbled upon a Pirates of the Caribbean fanfiction on deviantart but I know for a fact that isn't correct since I just googled the PotC release date (June 2003) and when I check my FFN profile I created an account in December of 2001. I also know that I read fics for at least a year before I joined FFN because I remember being afraid of creating an account for some reason.
