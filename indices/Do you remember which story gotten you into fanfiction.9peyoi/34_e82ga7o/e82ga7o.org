My first fanfic was a terrible Sirius/OC Marauders fic on HPFF.com. I can't even remember what it was called.

I was kind of hooked since then. Mostly on Marauders fics. My introduction to AU came in the form of a what if Voldemort won fic called Linkffn(Marie Antoinette)

Then I moved onto FFN around 2007 after DH. Looking at my favourites list, this is the first one I added. It's called Capture about Colin Creevey. It's kind of in the same vein as Cauterize. linkffn(4715736)

Another I really loved was Too Many Faces, a short drabble about Tonks from a perspective that to this day is rarely focused on linkffn(4362613)

And my favourite was a Discworld crossover with Luna becoming friends with Death. linkffn(3487744)

After 2008 I moved on from the fandom. I came back last year and I'm have mixed emotions about it honestly.
