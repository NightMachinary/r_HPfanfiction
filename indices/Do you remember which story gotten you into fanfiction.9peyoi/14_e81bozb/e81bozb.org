It was a My Little Pony short story called My Little Dashie. I read a few MLP fics after that before getting into Bleach stories a little with a story called The Replacement Captain. Not long after that I got really into Naruto stories starting with A Growing Affection. Naruto was my big fandom for a while before I went to Harry Potter. The first large HP story I read was apparently HPMOR.
