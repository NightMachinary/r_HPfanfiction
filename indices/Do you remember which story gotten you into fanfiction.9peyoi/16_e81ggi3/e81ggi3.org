Harry Potter fanfiction:

Aside from an assortment of one-shots, the one that started it for me was probably The New Trio: The Helion Wands.

Long story short, Albus and Rose and Scorpius are the wielders of the Helion Wands, an experiment that Ollivander and Gregorovitch worked on together, trying to replicate the Elder Wand, but in fact unearthing secrets far older.

Sadly, I haven't been able to find it again...though in retrospect, that may be for the best. There was quite a bit of good stuff--a vampire DADA professor that was very loyal to Hermione for helping him get the job; a young Transfiguration professor who was a buddy of Teddy's from school; Ron telling Malfoy he raised Scorpius right, but also rather average writing.

Fanfiction in general?

That's easy--/Stars over Terabithia./ One of the best, though sadly unfinished, Bridge to Terabithia fanfics. Honestly, this one being unfinished hurts more than most HP fanfics.
