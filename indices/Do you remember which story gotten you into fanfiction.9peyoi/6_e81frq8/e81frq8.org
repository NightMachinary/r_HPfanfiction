Delenda Est. I had never really thought about reading fan fiction before, and I remember someone recommending this one. I must of read it in a couple days, I couldn't stop. In the end it's the fic that started my obsession. Its been over a year and a half, and I'm also usually reading 1 or 2 stories daily.
