Best postwar for me is undoubtedly litte0bird's works. Check out linkffn(Questions and Answers by little0bird). She's got others too mostly interconnected but out of order. Check her profile.

There's also linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh; James and Me by Northumbrian).

If you're looking for next gen there's linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided). There's also a little known series that I think is fantastic and is a tragedy that it's so underappreciated - linkffn(Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard)
