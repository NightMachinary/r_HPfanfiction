For me it was linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince). At first I was very reluctant to dive into fanfiction because I thought it would all feel fake compared to canon.

So I tried this one because it's canon compliant, a recount of HBP from Ginny's perspective. I was intrigued. It was decent enough. It read more like a YA novel targetted at teenage girls though. Ginny's whole world seemed to revolve around Harry. But it was good enough to get me interested in trying more stuff.

From there I ventured into post-war stuff because they're more compliant to canon minus epilogue. Then the general stuff. Been hooked since then. Binging about once a month.
