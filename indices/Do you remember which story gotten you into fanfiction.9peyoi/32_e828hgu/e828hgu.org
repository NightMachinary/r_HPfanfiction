I read *a lot* of NextGen fics as my first forays into Harry Potter fanfiction. The Albus Potter series from Vekin87 linkffn(4380964), from NoahPhantom linkffn(8417562), the Scorpius Malfoy series from Fiery Gray linkffn(8940909), etc. etc. One of my favorites is undeniably Blood of the Birds, a complicated NextGen fic about Albus going dark, what it's like to be Scorpius, the strengths involved in defying your family, it's really great, linkffn(6748302)
