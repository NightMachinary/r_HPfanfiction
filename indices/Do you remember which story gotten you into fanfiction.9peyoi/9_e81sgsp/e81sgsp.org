HPMoR - loved it, really made me see the unlimited potential of AU fanfiction, then promptly dove into fandom and never looked back. Been reading (and later writing) fanfiction ever since.

I'd technically seen a few others through the years previously; a short Fred-survives I think I found on the Amazon message boards, a few Bleach ones in the farther distant past, but they were mostly shorts with the specific intention of fixing my headcanon to correct something irritable in canon. I didn't really think of it as fanfiction at the time, somehow, and never got into anything beyond those few specific instances. It took something drastic like MoR to show me the real power of fanfiction which lies in freely imagined transformation.
