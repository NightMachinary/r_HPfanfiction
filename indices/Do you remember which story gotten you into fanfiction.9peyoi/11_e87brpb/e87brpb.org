The first I read was HPMoR, but it didn't really get me into fanfiction, I just read it because a friend recommended it to me. It was okay I suppose, it didn't put me off fanfics forever, nor did it pull me in.

At some point several years later I stumbled upon linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always). This (along with the other parts) was the fanfic that truly got me into HP fanfiction.

Some months later, I read linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds) and linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles). These threw me into the rabbit hole that is SS-centric fanfiction, and to this day remains what I read the most. Especially after I found out that you could filter on characters, pairings (kind of), wordcount and whatnot on FFN.
