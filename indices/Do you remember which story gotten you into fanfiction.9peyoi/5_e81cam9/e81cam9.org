It isn't complete, but I was fascinated by how intricate i found the way it weaved around and through or replaced canon materials. It's been updated 8 times in the last 4 years or so, but I wish I was there when chapters were going up more often. Looking back, it isn't the best written story on the site, but it was certainly more restrained then a lot of oc inserts I have read.
