No, I don't remember. I am fairly certain that the first fanfiction that I read was for The West Wing. And it was through Yahoo Groups. Back around 2000. Lots of Josh/Donna stories way before the show actually gave in and put them together! So I went through the Yahoo Groups phase and then livejournal and now it's mostly ff.net and ao3.

I actually didn't get into HP until around the time of the 4th movie.
