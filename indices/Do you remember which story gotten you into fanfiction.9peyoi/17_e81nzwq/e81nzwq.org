I found a weird, three short story collection on a free ebooks website. 2 about McGonagall and one post battle. I was blown away at the thought that you could alter the story to suit what you wanted to see! Mind boggling! The past battle one is still a fave, though more for nostalgic reasons nowadays. I read it once a year to remember that eye opening feeling that changed my entire life (no exaggeration, found a career, best friend and a wife... Can't argue with that! Lol)
