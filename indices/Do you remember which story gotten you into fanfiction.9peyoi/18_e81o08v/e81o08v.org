I don't remember the name or the site, but It was about some kid who got into a car accident and after receiving blood transfusions he begins to display magical abilities forcing him to go to Hogwarts. Later on it is revealed that He is Snape's Nephew, he lives close by to Hogwarts and drives up to the castle in a old mechanical VW Bug (I thought that was smart to get around the no electricity thing in Hogwarts).

I read it and decided there had to be better stories and then I found Albus Potter and the Year of the Badger and decided that yes Fanfiction was worth a try
