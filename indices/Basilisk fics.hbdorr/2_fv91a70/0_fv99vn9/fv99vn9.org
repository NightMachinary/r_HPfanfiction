Very fair about not being able to turn it off. But Tom directed it multiple times to attack but not kill students in the 50s and again in the nineties indicating it's not unreasonable to interact with it. What's more is he would have to figure out it was a basilisk in the first place without it killing him.

Secondly for as much of a dick Salazar supposedly was his main ambition was the creation of a school. The man clearly felt like teaching people. Shitting on his own life's work because of a disagreement on politics with his cofounders is just as unreasonable an idea. It having an actual purpose and it being perverted by Tom would go along with all the other instances.

It's also only been opened twice supposedly and both by Tom. It's actual purpose could very well have been tossed out by him.
