There's linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) which I think fits your requirements, but the pacing isn't for me. I might come back to finish reading if I'm bored of other stuff on my plate.

Ahsoka meets Harry Potter after she abandons the Jedi following her Trial.

It /might/ be abandoned but it's 300k+ words.
