There's not really that many HP/SW fics out there, and I guess you've probably read most of the well-known ones, so finding one that fits your specific (and reasonable) request is going to be pretty tough. That being said, I'm currently working on one called "It Takes Two to Tano" over on DLP. It's only 4 chapters deep so far, but I can tell you that there's no plans for a harem, no sith!Harry, no douchebag!Harry, no wandless magic. Hell, he's not even the MoD.
