A lot of the contempt for the scene occurs when there has been reason for change but we still see the same thing used. You've said Voldemort would use the same decisions and the like, but what if the AU had given him reason not to but the author still made scene happen? At what point did the author go from an original and somewhat interesting AU to a canon rehash fix it fic? We've read the graveyard scene. We've read it a thousand times. I don't want to read it again if you've given me a reason why it might not happen.

For example, Voldemort found out about the Triwizard because Peter Pettigrew met Bertha Jorkins in Albania. Bertha had been working on the event and knew about it. Voldemort tore the knowledge from her mind and made his convoluted plan. If the premise of your AU involves Pettigrew being caught then the graveyard scene shouldn't happen. If it happens then you've given up on being original and done something lazy. What about an AU where the events of the first book never happened. If Voldemort never discovered he couldn't touch Harry then he'd never have realised the power of taking Harry's blood over someone else's. Sure taking and killing Harry sends a statement but taking, for example Crouch snr would work to. Crouch was head of the DMLE and would have fought tooth and nail against Voldemort's efforts. Could Voldemort have collected the bones of his father before this all started and have them ready whenever he needed them?

Most people can agree that Voldemort's plan to get Harry to the graveyard was convoluted. This is often compensated by either fantastic writing like JKR had or by giving more details about why it needed to happen that way. Why not just kidnap Harry some other time? Was it just Voldemort's megalomania that made him want to kidnap Harry while everyone was watching from under Dumbledore's nose? If you make the stars align to make the graveyard scene happen then you've sabotaged an AU you've created. When it fits its fine but sometimes we basically have to reread exactly what happens in canon. It fits in something like linkffn(6256154) since there isn't a reason for it not to have happened but if you've made an AU where Harry has lived abroad for the first 14 years of his life to hide from Voldemort then you still have the graveyard scene go exactly the same way then you've wasted a chance to do something original.
