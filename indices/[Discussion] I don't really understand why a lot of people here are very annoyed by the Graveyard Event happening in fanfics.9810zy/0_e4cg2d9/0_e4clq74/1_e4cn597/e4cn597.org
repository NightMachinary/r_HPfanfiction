I can't think of any off the top of my head where it matters. I can remember a few if not name them where Harry was raised abroad until he's old enough to fight. Voldemort gets himself a new body and the story is focused on their conflict. Very little is normally said about the manner of Voldemort's return since the stories are more action focused.
