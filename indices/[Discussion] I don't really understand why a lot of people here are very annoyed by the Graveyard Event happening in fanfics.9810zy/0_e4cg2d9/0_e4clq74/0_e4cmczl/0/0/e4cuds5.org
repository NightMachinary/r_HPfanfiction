That is semantics you are arguing but it has some validity. If Harry could "delude himself" into thinking that he is giving it freely (restrains are for some reason inconsequential) he theoretically could botch the ritual (if the author implies intent basis in magic).

But yeah you can delude yourself all you want but subconsciously he wouldnt want to give his blood.
