No, you're missing the point.

Force is not decided on the side of the recipient of the force.

Force is not about not having consent. it's not even related except in that force can be used as a replacement to consent to obtain some goals.

I mean, take a beanbag, trying to put it into a container with an opening just a little too small. you can either force it in there, or gently ease it in through the opening. Nothing changes about the container nor beanbag, it is entirely a difference of approach.

forcefully taken isn't about harry's intent. it's pettigrew's intent.
