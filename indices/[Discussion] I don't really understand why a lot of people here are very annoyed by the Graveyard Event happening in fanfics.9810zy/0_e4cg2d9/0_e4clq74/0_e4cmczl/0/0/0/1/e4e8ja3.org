I'm not entirely certain I can agree with this. Because the opposite is also true.

If Pettigrew deluded himself into thinking that he wasn't harming Harry - that it wasn't his intent in harming Harry - would that mean he didn't take it forcefully? Of course not.

I think intent from both sides matter.

Of course, this doesn't contradict your point that Harry himself could decide it wasn't forceful. Just that it's not ONLY Pettigrews intent that matters.
