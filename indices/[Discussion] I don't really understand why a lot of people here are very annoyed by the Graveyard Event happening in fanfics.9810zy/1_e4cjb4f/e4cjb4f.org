Looks like the previous replies have answered this but I'll add my own reason: because it was always such a crap plan even when Rowling used it.

I mean, Voldemort has had an agent in place all year, yet only puts a plan in motion when the whole school plus visitors is watching - and then wants to remain hidden? Hogsmeade isn't covered by the Hogwarts protections against apparition and portkeys, so Moody/Crouch could have slipped Harry a portkey at any point in a Hogsmeade visit, or side-alonged him away. Easy. Wait until Harry visits the toilet in the pub and they're off.

Voldemort's canon plan relied on luck and coincidence. There are far better plans to be written in fanfic, where it doesn't have to be the climax of a book.
