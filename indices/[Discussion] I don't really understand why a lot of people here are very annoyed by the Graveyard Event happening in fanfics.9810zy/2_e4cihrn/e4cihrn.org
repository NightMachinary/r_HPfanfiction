The entire plan rests on the fact that Wormtail randomly ran in to Bertha Jorkins, one of two people in the world with knowledge of both the specifics of the tournament and the existence of Barty Crouch Jr. In any story where Wormtail is unable to search for Voldemort (usually because he is dead or in prison) or is searching at a different time, it makes little sense for Voldie to come up with the tournament plan.
