My problem is with the over-the-top portrayals, you know, where after something goes wrong, he rants - aloud - in his office about how Harry is going dark and must be sacrificed for the Greater Good ™️, while Fawkes is singing sadly in the corner wondering where it all went wrong for his old friend.

Come on, show some subtlety, don't spill the antagonist's motives and plans in some pointless monologue. Let the reader guess.
