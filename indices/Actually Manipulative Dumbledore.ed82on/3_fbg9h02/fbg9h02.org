I imagine (and my experience with such posts over a year tells me) that most people will highly enjoy reading a story like that. For some reason nobody does it beyond a one shot.

I can only speculate but maybe stories like that and being inside the mind of characters like that is not a very pleasant experience. I think stories like that are pretty rare in fantasy fiction in general. Though it's literary potential is good, I guess most people that write fanfiction for fun don't want to spend time thinking like that.

A more likely speculation though is that people don't feel confident enough in their abilities to write many Albus POV stories in general.
