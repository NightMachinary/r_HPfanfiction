It doesn't need to be done from Albus's perspective for any of these, it's just I don't like how Dumbledore is set up to be this manipulative genius in fics and effectively does nothing. It all gets lost in the fics setup, Harry goes on as if he doesn't exist and Dumbledore is on the sidelines wondering where everything went wrong.
