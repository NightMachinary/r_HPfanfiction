I know what you mean but whether it's written from Albus's perspective or not, it has to make sense for Albus's character for it to end up being a good story. Thus in the end the writer has to put in almost the same amount of effort thinking things through from Albus's perspective which (I suspect) is somewhat daunting/difficult/etc.

It's pure speculation of course. The correct answer is almost definitely much more complex and stranger.
