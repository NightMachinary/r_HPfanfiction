I think you underestimate the amount of problems you get if you write Dumbledore as an antagonist who is genuinely a good manipulator. Because if he is, considering how long he has been at things and the lack of a foil of the same level, the plot naturally becomes "Dumbledore wins" or even "Dumbledore has already won".

So then he needs a strong opponent to even have a story, and it can't be Harry in the canon era because of age alone. And if you have one---say, the Black family---then you have to explain why whatever events your took from canon still happened despite that. Or warp things so much that Harry Potter is Harry Potter in name only (raised differently, no Boy-Who-Lived at all, different parents, etc.).

It's definitely possible---for example, you could have Dumbledore's foil not be on Harry's side at all, and not care one bit about all the canon events, until some weird inciting incident moves things around---but it's hard work. It's not really surprising that most Manipulative!Dumbledore stories end up with him being arrogant and slow to adapt instead. Those basically are "Dumbledore has already won" stories where he becomes so intellectually lazy that he loses everything.

(You could also write a /House-of-Cards/-style story with Dumbledore as a villain protagonist, but that's really hard to pull off.)
