  If he's this manipulative, machiavellian figure then there is no way he wouldn't be able to work with whatever ends up coming his way.

Because he's a behind the scenes manipulator. And you can't exactly drop this big counteraction to what's happening at the drop of the hat. He has to call in favors, get supplies, send out orders, etc. Especially when it comes to the Wizengamot. Then there's bribes, favors, and all that to consider. And you can't exactly call on an emergency Wizengamot meeting out of nowhere for where Harry is staying. People will just ask "why?"

  Even if he wasn't part of Harry's childhood as a sort of aloof, protective grandfather figure to endear himself to young Harry, he'd be able to play on the same emotional beats as in canon and he could get Harry to likely think giving himself up was the only way just as easily.

A lot of that goes out the window if he has someone playing a family figure that is diametrically opposed to Dumbledore. The Weasleys and Hermione worked because they all believed that Dumbledore was made out of rainbows and unicorns. Give him friends (and their family) that believe otherwise? Or a Slytherin Harry? They will suspect him out of hand.

  Slytherin's are a dime a dozen

In the broadest terms, yes. In reality? No. Hogwarts is full of legacy sortings. "I'm gonna be Gryffindor because that's where my parents were!!!1111!one" And they get sorted there. Look at Malfoy, he was more Gryffindor than Ron. And I still think the book six events were waaaay out of character for Malfoy. Harry? Hufflepuff. Besides a few occasions of bravery, it's all to do with friends. Chamber of secrets? His friend's sister. DoM raid? Sirius.

​

That brings up another thing: Why is the sorting hat there anyways? It will just listen to you anyway, why bother sorting people?
