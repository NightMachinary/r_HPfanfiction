That's why I love the “Harry is Tom's equal in more than just name” because then it justifies any manipulation/control from Dumbledore (even encourages it!). And it's always interesting to see a war of wits between Dumbledore and Voldemort get messed up because Harry was by the sidelines, learning from both their mistakes. (And seeing Dumbledore being conflicted between his love and pity for Harry and his fear of him becoming another TMR is always better than the silly “I like this kid just fine but he shall die so that I'll share his money with the Weasleys”). But these stories are usually unfinished and/or with some form of Tomarry in them and thus, get little rec around here.

On the other hand, i started a story, not long ago, where Harry is this cute little kid not far from his canon. He becomes friend with the Twins and basically all the school. But Dumbledore, who doesn't act so far from his canon self, is truly shown as being manipulative. Every time Harry and his friends/allies get one step over him (like finding some other arrangements during the summer while still getting protection from family blood, because Dumbledore made a convincing argument), he comes back from nowhere with a way to manipulate them to do exactly what he wants. And it's so believable, that by the end of first year, I just couldn't read anymore because it was just way too much to stomach. That's when you realise that by being headmaster, knowing everyone in position of power or not, being chief warlock and at the Wizengamot, he can get absolute power so easily and just get and do whatever he wants. I think the truly manipulative Dumbledore is realistic (I really don't buy the innocent, loving old man who did nothing wrong), but if Harry doesn't change, or the atmosphere doesn't adapt, it becomes so... terrifying in a way. That's probably why we read or write so much Old Manipulator who lost his touch rather than that.
