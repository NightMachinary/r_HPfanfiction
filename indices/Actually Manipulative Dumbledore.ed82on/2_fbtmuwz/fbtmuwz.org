If Harry subverts Dumbledoor's plan, that is sort of a kick in the face and usually becomes a bashing!fic.

I always think of the bashing fics as taking the characters being bashed down, giving them 'payback' for how much Harry suffered. Having them actually be worthy adversaries sort of detracts from this.

On the other hand, you might have circumstances not specifically connected to Harry mess up Dumbledore's plans, in which case seeing him make new plans each time to account for the changing situation would be enjoyable.
