Honestly, I have only read 1 fanfic where Dumbledore is really competent as a manipulator (can't remember the fic name, it became a weird crossover with Alice in wonderland before being abandoned). A man with 100= years old experience, where the protagonists are barely able to come even against him with rituals and faerie magic and time travel.
