Are you after canon-compliant stories (maybe post-Hogwarts), divergence where they start dating earlier, AU like Ginny being sorted into Slytherin, or something else?

For the first, I generally recommend Northumbrian's stories, particularly linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh), where Harry and Ginny and their children move out to the countryside. For the second, I recently enjoyed linkffn(A Friend Indeed by kb0), where Ginny approaches and comforts Harry during his blow-up with Ron in fourth year. And one of my favourites doesn't actually have them dating, and is unfinished (technically not abandoned, but very infrequently updated), but I love how it develops Ginny's character: [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]]
