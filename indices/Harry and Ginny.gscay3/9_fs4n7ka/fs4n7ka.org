I was pretty indifferent to them to be honest. I never gave Ginny much thought until I read a really good Ginny-centric story and now I've even started paying more attention to her in my own writing. I'm not sure they'll ever by a pairing I actively ship but I would definitely be open to reading a story about them if the plot sounded neat.
