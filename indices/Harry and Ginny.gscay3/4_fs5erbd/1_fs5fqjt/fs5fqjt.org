  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.” “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly. Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4215900][*/The Hog's Head/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/MyGinevra/pseuds/MyGinevra][/MyGinevra/]]

#+begin_quote
  While I was reading the Harry Potter books, I increasingly came to wonder why Ginny did not play a more important part in Harry's life, especially after the events in Half-Blood Prince. So, with Harry pretty much ignoring her during and after the Battle, but with Ginny being the last thought in Harry's mind before he "died," I decided their story needed a remedy. The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation." Descriptions of Hogsmeade and locations of its various buildings are based on the map of Hogsmeade in The Harry Potter Lexicon. While you are at it, please take a look at my original novels, Hancock Hill and Acting Obsessed.
