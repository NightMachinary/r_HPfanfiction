Personally, it drives me up the wall and I wish authors would just take a pass on writing accents.

Part of the problem when writing accents is that the English speaking world isn't exactly consistent with their pronunciation. Not everyone thinks than cot and caught sound the same, after all.

I've seen this with author-written sorting hat songs where a stanza will quite obviously not rhyme... to me. I'm going to guess they do for the writer, however.

Stock and talk. Say them out loud - do they rhyme? Well, it depends on who you ask.
