Sorry I'm not answering your question but I wanted to give you a readers opinion on accents. I can't speak for others but I personally find a written accent one of the fastest ways to ruin an otherwise good story. If it's only a couple of sentences it's not that annoying but more than that and I'm hitting the back button no matter how good the fic is.

Carn ya see whort aye meeyan?

Unless you're really intent on writing the accent maybe just describe it and then write normally.
