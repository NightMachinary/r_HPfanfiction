Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley Freaky Friday situation! Harry drags Ron to the Goblet of Fire because Ron wouldn't believe him and through a convenient plot device, they switch bodies!

Hermione is confused at how the two are behaving next morning but thinks this is just due to their quarrel. Except "Ron" is suddenly much more pleasant to be around and not goofing off as much. He pays a lot more attention to his school work and his practical work soon begins approaching her level. He's also much more affectionate with his siblings that are currently in school and sends weekly letters to his mum. Fred and George take the mickey out of him at first for wanting to spend time with them, but then realize how useful a third member of the team can be, especially one who thinks differently from them and can spot things that they missed. It becomes a frequent sight to see the three of them in the common room with their heads together working on some new crazy invention.

Ginny's relationship with her brother improves greatly. "Ron" stops being "that git who glares at any boy I talk to". Now he invites her to join his friends when doing homework together, helps her with the difficult stuff and gives her tips for practical work that he has learned from experience. He also respects her point of view and if there is a disagreement, he opts to have a calm discussion instead of yelling and fighting. On weekends, they both spend an hour or two together in the castle grounds where they alternate between flying and chatting about their week or anything that might be bothering them. After the Hogsmeade visit in January, Ron gives her a locket as a "wanted to get you this for your birthday but had to prepare it first". The locket contains a "slideshow" of photos of the two of them flying in Hogwarts, talking in the Quidditch stands or atop the castle walls and enjoying each other's company. The engraving says "I've always wanted a sister and I got the best one". Ginny, happy and embarrassed and teary-eyed, hugs her brother who, she realizes, has now become one of her best friends and is the first person she turns to for help.

Percy and Charlie are surprised by the changes in Ron's personality when he meets them on the day of the first task and suggests that all the siblings spend the day together after the event is done. They bring along Ginny and the twins and go on a tour of the castle sharing interesting stories that happened in various locations. It goes spectacularly. Everyone, apart from Ron, is somewhat surprised by how much they enjoyed the company of their family when they would normally have gone about doing their own thing. So when Ron suggests that they do a group activity every now and then, everyone agrees that the day of the second task would be a perfect choice.

Molly and Arthur are surprised and a bit alarmed when Ron's first letter arrives. He just states that he's sorry for not writing more often and will correct this from now on. Molly smiles, knowing he's probably not going to follow this for more than a couple of weeks, but Ron's letters soon become a regular item on each weekend. He shares what he's studying, asks for advice with subjects that his parents are good at, talks about problems with teachers, discusses his plans for the future, gives updates on his siblings (without "telling" on them) and so on. This puts his parents at ease because they are more aware of what's happening with their children at school and they begin to trust Ron to act "in their place" to handle any minor issues that would need a parent's involvement. This rankles the twins and Ginny at first when they think he is spying for their parents but they notice that Ron is never smug or overbearing when correcting them, no details of their mistakes reach their parents and there has been a distinct lack of howlers since Ron got promoted to "Vice Parent". Plus, he's already endeared himself to all of them and become a regular part of their day so they don't mind when he parents them every now and then, especially since he lets the smaller mischief slide.

Turns out when you don't have a life-threatening situation hanging over your head, you have all sorts of time to hang out with family!

"Harry", on the other hand, realizes how crappy his life really is on the inside. Right on the first day of switching and then repeatedly afterwards, he has a nightmare, courtesy of Voldemort, complete with the extra headache and ketchup. Then he finds out that everyone not in Gryffindor thinks Harry cheated his way into the Tournament so there are hostile faces everywhere he goes. Even in Gryffindor, his sudden personality change is quite a jarring experience. Everyone was used to the quiet and reserved Harry Potter and him suddenly becoming brash and boastful removes the "shy boy-next-door" element that many girls found cute. He has a few dates with occasional girls, Lavender on multiple occasions, but his behavior is too Malfoy-ish for things to last too long.

Hermione sticks with Harry for a while, a very long while in her books, because she attributes this personality change to the stress of a potentially fatal tournament. So she ignores his grating behavior as much as she can while trying to help him prepare for the first task. But his non-serious attitude towards preparation is a constant bone of contention between them. This reaches the breaking point when Harry finds out that the first task is dragons and his response is to spend the next entire day flying and hanging out with Lavender. One colossal argument later, Hermione sobs into Ron's shoulder that she's tried her best to help Harry but she's giving up since he won't take things seriously.

Ron's attempts at convincing Harry fare no better and it's no surprise when Harry's performance in the first task is, in sequence, soiling himself, trying to run out of the arena, poorly dodging a fire breath and getting his scalp singed, crouching behind a rock while crying in the fetal position, soiling himself again when a fireball hits the rock, running out and tripping and landing heavily on the ground breaking his wand -- at which point Dumbledore decides to intervene for safety reasons (and to salvage what little Hogwarts' pride remains) and mark the task failed.

After this, Harry becomes a bit more serious about preparation however the damage is done and he has become a laughingstock. Since no student is willing to accompany him to the Yule ball and champions must have a partner, he has to go with the loud and clingy Professor Trelawney. (Ginny offered out of sympathy but, to her surprise, he vehemently rejected that idea). Ron goes with Luna, whom he respects much more now that he knows how weird magic can get, while Hermione has a great time with Krum. Harry hates how everyone else is having a great time but he can do little about it while Trelawney has him in a death grip.

Over the next few months, Harry's personality becomes more and more intolerable and people start avoiding the guy who "claims he can slay a dragon in his sleep but craps his pants at the mere sight of one". The second task doesn't go any better than the first one and Ron is brought to the surface by the Merpeople. The ridicules and jeers become worse. The only solace for Harry is the gold in his vault which he spends on getting too many sweets (and then spending time in the hospital wing with stomachaches) or buying Zonko products (soon confiscated by Filch). But those joys don't last long and one night he begs Ron to switch back with him.

"Ron" asks "Harry" if he knows what he's talking about. He is asking actual!Harry to pick up the pieces of the mess actual!Ron has made while in his body and in return actual!Harry will lose the close connection he had with actual!Ron's family. Ron gets on his knees and begs and pleads with Harry who takes pity on the idiot and they both go back to the goblet. They touch the goblet and their souls emerge, swirl around and go back to the current bodies, not their original ones. They try again and this time, nothing happens. After multiple attempts, they realize they are permanently stuck in each other's bodies. Ron, in Harry's body falls to the floor crying, while Harry, in Ron's body, tries to console him while his own heart is barely able to contain the joy he's feeling. After all the shit fate has put him through, he's is just selfish enough to want this incredible gift and not feel guilty about it.

Ok, so now someone please make a fic out of this. :-D
