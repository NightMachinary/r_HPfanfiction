I think the reason for this is that it appeals to a certain demographic of people, but said demographic has next to nothing in common with most fans of HP fanfiction (they're not /opposites/, it's more the fact that the common ground is minimal). Basically everyone I've talked to who liked the fic doesn't care for HP fanfiction, and vice versa -- HP fanfiction fans generally don't really care for the fic, or at least consider it overrated. Personally I don't care for the fic in the slighest.

As for the controversy, that isn't because of the fic itself -- sure, it has some iffy stuff (the Draco Malfoy scene at Platform 9 3/4 comes to mind), but that's no worse than a lot of other fics. The reason it's controversial rather has to do with the author, and the way he generally behaves.
