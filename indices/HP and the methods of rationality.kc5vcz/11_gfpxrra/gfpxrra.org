When it came out, it was new. No one else was trying to write that same story - there wasn't another OP smart!Harry longfic around that tried to be comedic, or if there was, it was less readable. It was also a part of an ongoing discussion that was going on in fandom about the ideas presented in the books.

It was also a lot fresher and more immediate in style, because it was churned out about as fast as the writer could write it. It was easier to be forgiving, because it wasn't a finished work, and the fun was in seeing what would come next. No one knew, not us, not the writer, nobody.

Now all the tropes are tired and old, the zeitgeist has moved on, and the piece has been reworked to death.

I liked the ending and overall I did like the story, but ye god it had massive flaws even at the time. It was just different and new and very funny. The dreadful parts, the good parts, it was all fun, all part of a conversation.

Even back then, the battles dragged for far too long, it was just fun watching what, as [[/u/turbinicarpus]] points out, are more archetypes than human characters.

I went back for a reread and didn't get far at all. I prefer to think of HoMM as an event rather than literature.
