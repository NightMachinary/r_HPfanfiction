I loved it. It's an intelligence power fantasy, which is absolutely not everyone's cup of tea, and I can very well see why some wouldn't be able to stand it. But it's a well-plotted story, one that manages to balance stakes and tension well, and does a lot of unique things that other fics don't. (Or, at least, didn't at the time it was coming out.)

Sure, the rationalist stuff can be a bit heavy-handed in places. Some arcs are better than others. But it's still considerably above-average in quality overall. The characterization is the main sticking point.
