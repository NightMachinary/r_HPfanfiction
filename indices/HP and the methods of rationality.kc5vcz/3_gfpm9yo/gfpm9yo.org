I liked the first few chapters, when it was more comedic. "When I come back I expect to find this shop still standing and not /in any way/ on fire."

Then it increasingly ditched the humor for convoluted subplots as the tone got darker and darker, all while the whole "applying logic and science to understanding magic" thing kinda went out the window in favor of Harry Stu. It felt like a serious bait-and-switch, which is one of my biggest pet peeves in fanfic. Interestingly, one of the author's Favorited fics on ffnet is the other contender for worst bait-and-switch fic among what I've read.
