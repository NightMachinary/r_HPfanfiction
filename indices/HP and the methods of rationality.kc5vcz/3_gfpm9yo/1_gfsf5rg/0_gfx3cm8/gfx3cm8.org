The point of the ending, as I see it, is to emphasise that learning to do better is a slow process, and that everyone on Earth is a very long way away from getting everything right. Even learning all about how to recognise and describe your mistakes just means that you would be able to produce a long list of things you're doing wrong - not necessarily that you can suddenly fix them.

There's a reason the associated community calls itself "Less Wrong", ie still getting lots of things wrong, just trying to make less mistakes than yesterday.
