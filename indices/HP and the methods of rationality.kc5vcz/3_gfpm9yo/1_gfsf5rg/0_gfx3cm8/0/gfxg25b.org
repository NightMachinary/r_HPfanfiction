That would be a decent message that matches the intent of a rationalist community, but I still think it the actual message is a bit warped in the story.

As I see it, this kind of process should be self driven to be valuable and you need a certain amount of humbleness and introspection to achieve it. Neither of which I recall to be traits of the MC.

The fact that he's forced into a semblance of this at the end of the story at gunpoint isn't good pedagogy as throughout this story we never see his bullheadedness lead him significantly astray. This kind of message has more impact if we're actually shown throughout consequences of not re-evaluating what you think you know, rather than a big external hammer at the end.
