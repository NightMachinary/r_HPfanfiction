The problem is applying science never really got explored. It's mostly Harry spouting off bullshit psychology as truth (which ironically a lot of got caught in the replication crisis) or thinking really hard and finding the right solution.

There's never a case where his non magical background leads him significantly astray. For instance, it would be more interesting if everyone had different levels of magical ability (which is true irrespective of how big your mana pool is given people have different abilities to memorize and perform precise actions especially in sequence or under pressure).

This would lead to a more interesting conflict between Draco and Harry regarding blood purity, for instance. Just like not having house elves be slaves can be more interesting.

The problem with HPMOR is it tries to position itself as a realistic setting where people use the power of rationality, but it's actually an OP power wank where people defer to Harry's bullshit. Like Mcgonagall, despite being a useless bint in canon, would beat Harry's shit in if he acted like did in HPMOR especially towards her.

And where a surface level understanding of science gives you super powers. You know, despite science being "wrong" in the real world as for instance quantum mechanics and general relativity don't mesh and more importantly being wrong in universe as it clearly doesn't account for magic. But because of the MC's pigheadedness we're still supposed to believe conservation of mass should hold and transforming into a cat is a big issue because of it.

In general, my view is that I tended to enjoy reading the story and it has some interesting ideas, but on reflection a lot of it is dumb and that is in large part because the author is a whackjob.

Also, I found it ironic that the ending is essentially Harry is so pigheaded and impressed by his own brilliance, that he had to be bound by an unbreakable vow to not destroy the world. I'm not sure how it's supposed to stand as a way to indoctrinate people into rationality in the face of that.
