HPMOR in my favourite fan fiction story by far. I'm currently rereading it for the umpteenth time due to the lack of other high-quality stories. Unfortunately, it is not for everyone. Many people are irritated by the characters, but I actually find them really amusing. I haven't noticed them being inconsistent with their actions, feelings, or opinions.
