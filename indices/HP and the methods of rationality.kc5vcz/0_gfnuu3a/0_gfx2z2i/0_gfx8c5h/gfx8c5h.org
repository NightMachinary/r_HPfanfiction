I'd actually forgotten one of the even more repellent things in the fanfic, which is that the author does /not/ have Harry making for the hills as soon as Draco Malfoy tells him he'll rape Luna Lovegood when he's old enough. I guess it was so incredibly jaw-droppingly bizarre in just so many ways I put it out of my mind lest I wonder if Less Wrong is actually sane.

("Shock value" is not a valid licence to put any old thing you want into a fanfic, ffs.)

To circle back to your statement, I'm not convinced the narrative structure /actually/ delivers any lasting consequences for Harry, especially on reading the detailed deconstruction on the web forum linked here wherein other characters get Flanderized or rendered very OOC to talk up how amazing Harry Stu is.
