I'm not sure how that chapter is repellent, given that Harry's response, rather than leaving Draco to his depraved plans, is to start plotting to undermine Draco's bigoted world view, and burn down the system that enables that kind of thinking. You can call it naive and doomed to failure, if you like, but it's hardly an ignoble response. /And/ he persuades Draco to give her a reprieve.
