I've tried to read it as well and it really did turn me off after a while.

The first sign of issues with the fic was seeing Harry go into utter dramatics over something he had the mental capacity to handle a lot more rationally (ironic for a fic with a derivative of that word in the title), and McGonagall had to basically tell him to pull himself together. [ EDIT: On reading that spork of HPMOR someone linked, oh my god, I finally remembered which section this was and Harry's overdramatic weepy bullshit was so repellent I had to skim that section even as sporked. ]

The later dealbreaker was when the author admitted to not having read Deathly Hallows and so had a fundamental misunderstanding of the interactions between Severus Snape and Lily Evans as children - and how that played into Snape's own interactions with Harry years later.

The cherry on top of that sundae was when the author had Snape purposely pose a question to Harry in a way that was calculated to elicit validation rather than have an honest discussion, and when Harry gave the best answer he could give based on the information given and doesn't validate Snape's side of things, he drops the bombshell and is like "that kid was me".

That really just rubbed me the wrong way.
