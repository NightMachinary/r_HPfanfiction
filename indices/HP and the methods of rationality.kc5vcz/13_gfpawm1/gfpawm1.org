I liked HPMOR. I know Harry and a lot of other are OOC and act like young adults instead of children. But the main appeal for me was how it changed some events of canon and made them very interesting like the Battle Magic class, a lot of other children having fun scenes, and the whole revamping of Tom Riddle as a character without changing his evilness.
