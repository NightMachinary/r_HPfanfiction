I enjoyed it, but certainly not everyone does. If you read that far and you didn't like it, then by all means, move on; I very much doubt you'll enjoy the rest.

It's a thought-provoking read, and quite funny if you like that style of humour, but the characters are not really a strong point. They're not terribly written, I've seen far worse, but they're not the highlight. It sounds like you're struggling with that.

As [[/u/WantDiscussion][u/WantDiscussion]] mentioned, if you're interested in the ideas behind HPMoR but want very different protagonists, then linkffn(Pokemon: The Origin of Species) is quite well done. Slower to update, but steady.
