I think that when it comes to how magic in Harry Potter works, you have to meet it halfway, instead of trying to correct it. Stories like Victoria Potter, or The Prince of Slytherin do it well. Methods of Rationality does not.

It's completely natural that if you write a more serious story (as is often the case with fanfics, since you have canon for 'whimsical' take on magic), you will want to try contextualise things that don't work in a more realistic approach otherwise. However, a better way to do so is to simply draw away reader's attantion from them, rather than fixing them, because then you only invite MORE scrutiny on aspects of the story that don't work at a conceptual level.
