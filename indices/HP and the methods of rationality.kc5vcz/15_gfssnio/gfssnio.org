I liked it at the time of reading and there were interesting concepts but it might be because whenever something didn't make sense to me, I just assumed I was too dumb to understand it. But now I see it just throws around a lot of scientific jargon and uses the asshole genius trope to seem intellectual. It even takes some of the logical parts of the Harry Potter world and makes them nonsensical and complains about how illogical it is. One prime example I noticed is early on when Harry is complaining about how it doesn't make sense that his bag can understand what he wants. But the thing is nothing in the wizard world is voice activated like that (except for objects with specific instructions like brooms with "UP"). In the book and movie you retrieve things from a bag with Accio which makes sense. The writer made up his own illogical magic thing then complained about it.

The pacing was also bonkers and it got too preachy at times.

Also it wasn't until I read Pokemon: Origin of Species (a series I highly recommend) that I saw how poorly the "scientific method" was utilized in HPMOR.

That said I did like the /overall/ story I guess.
