If you like “The Sum of Their Parts”, you should like this one too.

This fic is long because it's very detailed in every combat ops and many political maneuverings. The story goes way beyond Voldemort's defeat, and that's the part Harry outshines Hermione. The final battle lasts 4 chapters and is very impressive, despite not fighting Voldemort.
