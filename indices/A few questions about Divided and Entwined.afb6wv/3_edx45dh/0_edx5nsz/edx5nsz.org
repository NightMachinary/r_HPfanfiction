I do hold firm on my belief that the plot is promising. What is making me hesitate is the writing style. This story just don't seem so... Fluid. It's hard to explain. The writing feels saturated somehow, the way the author describes things seems so explicit, like ensuring us omniscience or something like that. Maybe it's because the story is like a compilation of diary entries instead of the free flow of novels. I'm not sure how to describe this feeling.
