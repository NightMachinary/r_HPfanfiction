I didn't finish Divided and Entwined, but that's mostly because it does such a good job of showing that War is Hell. I think I reached about halfway, when Dumbledore died realistically but ultimately without anything to show for it, and just...wasn't enjoying the theme enough to continue, because it definitely is long. The writing quality was good, and it really brought home how awful a civil conflict like that would be, so if someone enjoys that kind of thing more than I do, I'd recommend it.
