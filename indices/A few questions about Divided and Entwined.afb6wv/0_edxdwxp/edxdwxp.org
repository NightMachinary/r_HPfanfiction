I don't believe Starfox's writing works for everyone. I tried to start a few of his other stories, but felt the same way about the writing and the characters so I never finished any of them.

I haven't read this particular fic, but I would recommend quitting if you are still not feeling the flow and the writing after a few more chapters. There have been times when I tried to power through fics where I didn't like the writing style, but in the end they just weren't worth the frustration of reading them.

It is something to decide for yourself though. If you want to keep going you should, but it's also fine to not continue a fic that everyone claims is amazing when you don't get any enjoyment out of it.
