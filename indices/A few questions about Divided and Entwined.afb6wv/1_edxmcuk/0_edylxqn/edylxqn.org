First, the Resistance loses a lot of people. More than half of them are dead at the end. They are neither infallible nor perfect. It's just that in a guerrilla war, as long as the guerillas have the initiative, a safe haven to retreat to, and can pick and choose their targets, they tend to fare very well. And at the start of the story, the Resistance enjoys that setup. As soon as they cannot prepare thoroughly, have to react quickly, engage enemies on ground not of their choice, people start to die. Such as the fight in the Ministry, or the later engagements.

Not to mention that there are several screwups during the early phase as well, like misjudging a bomb's effect on a potion shop, or the Resistance repeatedly wrecking Dumbledore's political plans with their attacks and causing trouble for him with the Ministry. And, of course, all the trouble caused by various people going off on their own and starting their own little wars. A main theme of the story is how plans keep getting wrecked by circumstances outside the control of the various people on all sides - as happens in war.

Explosives work both ways in the story - Voldemort, having grown up in muggle England during the war, uses muggle explosives to take out the Aurors among the Order and blame the Resistance for it since, obviously, the Dark Lord would never use muggle things.

Hermione had trouble with making friends at 13. In her twenties, in canon, she was an adept politician, rising to Minister. So, that whole "She cannot lead people" is shitty fanon. But "unquestioned leader"? From the start on, Alan tries to undermine her leadership and she has to struggle to keep the others from going all "Let's just kill all purebloods". She's far from being the undisputed leader for most of the story.

Evil purebloods? Some are evil. The majority of the purebloods are normal people who merely believe the government about the evil muggleborns wantonly killing them. But, yes, as in canon, a significant part of the purebloods are bigots. This is not a story where "it was all the fault of the dozen Death Eaters! The rest of us were resistance fighters, really" is even remotely true.

Honestly, it shows that you haven't read the story.
