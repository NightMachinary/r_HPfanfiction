Brenda changes a lot from the beginning, when she is angry at her partner for using a bigoted slur, to the point where she's using the slurs herself. And as I pointed out before - people die. A lot, even, in later battles - but that happens when it makes sense. Not just to mark off "second act, set back for heroes" on the chart. And, of course, all the deaths that do happen somehow don't count, because, hey, that would be admitting that things don't always go their way, and that the good guys aren't perfect.

The murder of Umbridge at the end of chapter 1 directly caused the investigation of muggleborn suspects, which led to the Resistance going underground because they assumed the hunt had started - which also caused the actual hunt to start. Blowing up Malfoy Manor killed off several supporters of Voldemort. But it didn't get Voldemort, and the collateral damage drove the Ministry to start a war against the muggleborns - and drove a number of people who had lost family there to the Death Eaters. Overall, it did as much harm as it helped. The attack in Knockturn Alley caused wide-spread collateral damage, and once more hardened the fronts, defeating Dumbledore's attempts to make the Ministry focus on Death Eaters instead of muggleborns.

And that's par for the entire war. Actions and reactions, people growing more brutal, more hateful - that's how war tends to be, especially civil war. And yeah, two rather young - they were mentioned as a few years above the rest of the cast - Hit-Wizards will follow the established resistance when recruited since the Resistance members have better training and more experience at that point than them.

The story is about a civil war and the aftermath, when people who have spent months or years trying to kill each other have to stop fighting and start rebuilding.
