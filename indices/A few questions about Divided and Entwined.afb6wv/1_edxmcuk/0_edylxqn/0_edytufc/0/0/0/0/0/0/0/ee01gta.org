As I said, 30% casualties isn't "everything goes well". Not at all.

Poor pacing? That's a matter of taste. I, personally, don't think it's slow paced if at 1/3 of the book, 1/3 of the characters in a unit have become casualties. Especially if that also covers training. YMMV, of course. And, of course, not everyone measures pacing by the amount of casualties the good guys take.
