That's not exactly what I am talking about when you complain about everything going perfectly for the Resistance, and I point out that more than half of them don't live to see the end of the story. That's not nuances missed. That's complaining without knowing the whole story. (Not to mention that when Daphne is driven into Voldemort's ranks because her parents were killed and the reaction of her family and friends, the hardening of the Ministry's stance, is shown, that's not a nuance either.)

If someone complains that in one of your stories, a villain escapes justice, but in the same story, the villain gets his just deserts at the end, that's not a reader missing a nuance.

I'll say it again: If at the end, more than half of the Resistance is dead (two-thirds, actually, if you count the people recruited later), then complaints that they are perfect and everything works out for don't really look convincing.

Now, complaining that they don't die quickly enough would be another thing - but that's a matter of taste. Especially if they are taking losses, like Marcus, which don't count for you for some reason. Honestly, if after a third of the story, the Resistance has suffered 30% casualties, then I wouldn't call that "everything goes perfectly for them".
