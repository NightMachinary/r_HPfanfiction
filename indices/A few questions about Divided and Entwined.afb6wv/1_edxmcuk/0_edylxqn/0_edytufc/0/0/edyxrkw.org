This is my full review from DLP, because I don't feel like rewriting it:

  Also, after browsing Patron and The Marriage Law Revolution, both of which I gave up on in the first chapters, I approached this with a rather skeptical mindset. The first thing I can say is that in comparison to those two, Divided and Entwined is a major improvement as far as writing goes. Patron and the Marriage Law Revolution both started off simply atrocious, immediately giving off typical shitfic vibes. This one seemed to hold more promise, so I plowed on.

  TLDR is that ultimately, Divided and Entwined is like the white goop from Matrix: a meal that provides you with the essentials, but has no flavor and doesn't look very appetizing.

  First thing, on the technical side, the author's writing has improved, but it's still not engaging. It works. It conveys what it needs to. It does the job of letting me know what the story is. But it doesn't draw me in. There's no X factor. No hook. It's bland.

  It's clean, I didn't spot typos, but then you have things like years (as in 1982) typed as such - 1982. I don't mean the scene headers with dates, it's when a year appears in the narrative. It's more of a pet peeve, but I find it unelegant and something to be avoided.

  Another issue that plagues this fic is the structure of dialogue scenes. There's a lot of dialogue in this fic and when it arrives, you have long sections of speech, only broken up by indications of who's talking and the occasional "he laughed", "he sneered", "he did some other generic in-dialogue character beat thing". Sometimes there's a short description at the beginning to set the scene (Fudge's office, Grimmauld Place, restaurant), but after that, you're got characters just talking. No one picks up anything, or squirms in their seat. Granted, not at dialogue scenes are like that, there's some chin-scratching or tea-drinking, but it's a very common feature here.

  Another technical issue ties into the blandess of writing - the author isn't very adventurous with word choice, depending on the same beaten patterns. I'm not expecting Starfox5 to thesaurus the shit out of this, but the fic could be made much better by getting more creative from to time. Also, a lot of things are repeated over and over, particularly in Hermione's and Brenda's scenes. Like, seriously, I've seen it all before, move the fuck on.

  That last thing contributes to why Hermione isn't a very exciting character to follow. She's just going in circles, rarely stepping off the ring she paced into the floor. After the Resistance was formed, her interactions with Dumbledore and Sirius have had little to no variations, scenes she shares with Harry and Ron are either about talking boring war stuff or the love triangle, which is by now so beaten into the ground that whenever this shows up, I wish Hermione would just do something, shag each one, then sent them on their way. It's static. Unchanging. Boring.

  That's not to say that characterization in general sucks. There was some progression (Ron especially stands out here), but perhaps this fic's biggest problem is that things stay too still. It seems like a lot is happening, but I don't see the effects of this on characters. Fudge is still the same. Amelia Bones is the same. Brenda is the same. Her Auror buddies are the same. Dumbledore exhibits some changes that suggest him reverting to an apparently more bloody-minded war persona, but it's agonizingly slow.

  The biggest character development happened in the aftermath of the Malfoy Manor bombing - Malfoy's crowd changed, the Muggleborn Resistance was formed. Cool. But since then, Hermione - I come back to her because she's arguably the central character - has stayed the same. That's most of the fic that's stood in the same spot, character-wise.

  I think my favorite character was Allan Baker, just because he stood out from the bland crowd, but in the end, he was made into a two-dimensional psychopath. Which perhaps was the point, because he was a psycho with a one-track mind - but he could have been written a little better, I think.

  Now the plot. I can accept some handwaves or implausibility to get the setup out of the way. I always took the view that kids in the Potterverse "grew up" quicker than in the muggle world, simply by the virtue of studying in Hogwarts, where sinister events seem to be a feature of life. Thus, it didn't bother me much when a bunch of 15 year olds created a guerilla group to fight a war. Honestly, the fifth year was a good enough setup that, combined with Hermione's (at times somewhat sanctimonious) pointing out of parallels to fascism sold it to me. But the Muggleborn Resistance has a giant, massive problem plot-wise.

  They are infallible.

  On one hand, wizard 15 year olds are more mature than their muggle peers. Okay. On the other hand, they're still a bunch of kids. And yet, from the moment of inception, Hermione has been talking like a seasoned veteran. It's cringey to me, she sounds like a Genre Savvy tvtroper who has read all the zombie apocalypse related pages and then the zombie apocalypse happens and he applies the tvtropes knowledge and it works. The group was formed too smoothly and has been operating too smoothly. Hermione slid into the leadership role too smoothly. The seemingly opposing elements within the Resistance are all tell-not-show, no-consequence artificial flavoring that attempts to pain a more realistic picture, but fails to make me suspend my disbelief.

  I'm told repeatedly that Allan, Dean and Seamus are much more bloodthirsty, but apart from the whole Allan subplot (which in the end didn't cause any internal shake-up), none of that matters. Dean and Seamus drone on an on about wanting to murderkill all filthy purebloods, but all they do is talk. Grown Hit-wizards (one references the first war, so at least that one is like in their 30s) doesn't blink once at Hermione's leadership. The Resistance is entirely monolithic, regardless of any internal differences of opinion. There's no tension there.

  The other thing is that everything they've done has been a success. Their casualties include Martin Cokes who was nothing more than a plot device, Allan who was ultimately inconsequential and the ongoing subplot of the Creevey brothers and the Withering Curse. That's a rather great fucking record considering everything they've accomplished. Because really, they haven't failed once. All their plans work out without a hitch.

  This pattern of excellence has been firmly established, so now I'm conditioned to expect the Resistance to succeed instead of rooting for them to succeed. In a word, boring. Brenda's trap had me excited for once. I thought, this is it. The trap is well-prepared, the Resistance is outnumbered and up against trained Aurors and Hit-wizards. Nope. They all make it out and drop another bomb. Just what they've done every single time. Hit-and-run, bomb. No tension. No conflict.

  This problem is compounded by the book excerpts at the top of each chapter. You already told me that the good guys will win. Okay, wait, that's not a legitimate point. The same is true of most fiction.

  Let me try again. I have the default expectation that the good guys will win, which is affirmed by the book excerpts. In that case, the draw of the story has to be the journey (though that's also more of a general point applicable to all fiction), but the journey here is boring. The good guys have had all the success and their losses have been minor - the most notable is Kingsley, who was in the background of the background in this fic. The Resistance is fine, Harry and Ron are fine, the Order (apart from Kingsley) is fine - why am I supposed to be rooting for these guys again?

  For all the talk of how the Resistance is oppressed and hunted like animals, all I've seen is them being the top predators. The author tells a lot, but doesn't show it.
