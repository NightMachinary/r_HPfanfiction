Take this with a barrel of salt. I don't like Starfox5's fics though I did my best to give this one a fair assessment.

I'm not a fan of muggle wank and the whole thing with wizards being thwarted by teenagers with explosives repeatedly is meh. Hermione is the central character and the girl who had trouble scraping together 2 friends in canon becomes an unquestioned leader of a teenage guerilla group. I also wasn't a fan of the good guys being infallible. The bad guys take all the losses and somehow the good guys are supposed to be the underdogs. And there's a whole host of issues that comes with the author which I simply don't like: evuul purebloods, evuul Ministry, mugle wank, Hermione wank. I don't begrudge anyone if they enjoy it, but I don't, so I can't recommend this fic.
