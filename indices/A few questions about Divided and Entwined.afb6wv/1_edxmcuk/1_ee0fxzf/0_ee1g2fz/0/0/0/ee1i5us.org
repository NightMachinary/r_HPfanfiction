Disliking my work is absolutely fine. "I didn't like the characterisation of Hermione" is a perfectly valid statement. As is "the pace was too slow for my taste." and "I don't like muggle weapons used in HP stories".

Where I draw the line is when people are lying about my stories. Claiming that "everything went perfectly right for the Resistance" simply isn't true - 30% casualties (and, later 66%) is the opposite of "perfectly fine". That's not disliking the story - that's misrepresenting the story's content.
