Your point was that everything went perfectly well for the Resistance. That they did not suffer any setback. That is countered by the casualties they took. If you didn't remember it, you could at least acknowledge that you were wrong there.

Just imagine how a soldier whose unit suffered 15 per cent dead and 15 per cent crippled during a tour of duty would react when someone tells him. "Oh, guess everything went perfectly well, huh?"
