  Wounding/murdering a few.
#+end_quote

You know what would be the easiest way to do that? Attack the students while they are walking through the halls to their dorms, protected only by their prefects. If, as you believe, they would be no use in a battle, Dumbledore has divided the students and made it exceptionally easier for Voldemort to murder everyone.

  Conscripting the older kids is morally wrong.
#+end_quote

Conscription? No one is being conscripted, unless you believe it is conscription to defend your very life? Do you believe the student would lay down and die rather than fight the troll because it is "conscription?"

#+begin_quote
  but the minors are still minors and shouldn't be expected to be forced to defend themselves.
#+end_quote

No one would force them to do anything. But if I was in such a scenario, I know I would want to protect myself.

#+begin_quote
  To add onto that, there aren't 100 seventh years
#+end_quote

By upper years, I meant post-OWL students. Sixth and seventh years.

#+begin_quote
  how do you know that the people who can cast the spell AND hit the target AND not freeze up in fear would take down a troll if they all cast simultaneously
#+end_quote

If even a dozen students managed to hit, the troll is going down. Troll skin might be tougher than human skin, but t's not as tough as dragon hide. And the spells don't have to be simultaneous to compound upon each other.

#+begin_quote
  And who, exactly, is hitting a thrown club with that spell?
#+end_quote

Alright, I could agree that it might be too difficult for students, but is it outside of the realm of possibilities that a quidditch player has the reflexes to hit a club with a spell?

#+begin_quote
  Because Black knows his limits, so if he tries again, it would only be after he's made a plan to get past them.
#+end_quote

Perhaps, but would he immediately try again now that everyone is on high alert?
