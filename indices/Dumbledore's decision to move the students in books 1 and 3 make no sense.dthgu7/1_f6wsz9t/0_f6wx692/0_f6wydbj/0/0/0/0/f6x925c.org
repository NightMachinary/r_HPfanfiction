  They will be though. Not all together, perhaps, but all will be out in the open and vulnerable.
#+end_quote

That's my point. Not all of them together is much better than all together. If Voldemort has to wait even a minute to get to the next group, that's lives saved, and time for Dumbledore to phoenixport over to the new group.

#+begin_quote
  One good blast of fiendfyre could easily kill an entire house in seconds.
#+end_quote

...And if they were all together, that would be the entire school.

  Once again, there is no conscription because they do have a choice. They would battle the troll because they voluntarily do so. The prefects can't force anyone to fight.
#+end_quote

Then I don't understand your original point. They'll all coordinate while teachers are telling them to step back and allow them to handle this, and without anyone telling them what to do, they'll combine spells?

#+begin_quote
  Lol are you serious or just joking with me now? I don't think you understand that this isn't a war. If I'm camping and a bear attacks me, am I conscripted to fight the bear?
#+end_quote

Yes to both, actually. Hellstrike likes to insert the Geneva Convention into places it doesn't belong. But if someone in a position of authority tells you to fight the bear, you've been conscripted.

#+begin_quote
  Then what's the point? One professor could take down troll, no students have to fight. Unlike in canon, where there are no professors to defend the students because all the professors abandoned the students to look for the troll. You talk about how Dumbledore wouldn't conscript minors, when that is exactly what he did by sending them without professor escort to their dorms.
#+end_quote

Excuse me, what?

No, taking them out of the line of fire is not conscripting them. In their dorms, they will not have to fight. We don't know that one professor could take down a troll. We are merely spreading the students out so they aren't all in danger. If there's a gunner in the room, do you stay grouped up so he can do the maximum amount of damage, or do you scatter so he can't hit you all at once? The deal is that the students are going to get hurt if they fight a troll, period. There is, even in the best circumstances, an unjustifiable risk. Therefore, he spreads the students out so that the danger cannot find them all at once.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, there are.
#+end_quote

Haha, nope. That's some WoG that I refuse to accept. Two other girls in Harry's year in Gryffindor? Bull. Approximately eight per House per year. 32x7=224 students, 64 of whom are sixth or seventh year. The extra broomsticks, earmuffs, and cauldrons are just that: extras.

#+begin_quote
  More resistant than dragons? Unlikely. Especially if getting hit in the head by their own club can incapacitate one.
#+end_quote

They're resistant to magic, not blunt impact.

#+begin_quote
  Citation?
#+end_quote

Every time it happens in canon, they're simultaneous.

#+begin_quote
  I'm sorry, but I cannot believe that people trained to catch, throw, and beat fast moving objects in midair are suddenly useless when it comes to firing spells.
#+end_quote

...Why? They're two completely different skill sets. Are baseball players expert marksmen? No, they aren't noticeably better than average.
