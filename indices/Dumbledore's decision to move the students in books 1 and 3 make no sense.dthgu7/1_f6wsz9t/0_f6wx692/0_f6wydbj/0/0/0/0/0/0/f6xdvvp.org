  No, they're all dead because Voldemort can fly and traverse the halls far fast than students can walk.
#+end_quote

He can't fly indoors - or at least, it's pointless to. And the question is whether or not it's better to have all the targets in one location where he can kill them in one second, or spread out where he can't. Even if it only takes him 30 seconds to kill them all, which we've seen isn't the case in DH, that's still 29 seconds you didn't have for Dumbledore to get there.

  And by the time he learns about an attack, Voldemort has long since fled and is on to the next group.
#+end_quote

You're assuming Voldemort can fly faster than Dumbledore can phoenixport.

#+begin_quote
  Not if, as I suggested, there are professors protecting the students.
#+end_quote

Can't defend against Fiendfyre. I mean, shit, /could/ all the Hogwarts professors take Voldemort?

#+begin_quote
  Then you misunderstood my post. I was listing the theoretical defenses of staying in the Great Hall, not planning an actual battle with students fighting a troll. Of course the professors would take care of the troll and keep the students out of harm.
#+end_quote

The question is whether the teachers are comfortable with their skills enough to risk it.

They aren't.

#+begin_quote
  When are trolls ever subdued with magic in canon?
#+end_quote

They aren't, but spells are heightened by being cast simultaneously, such as in PoA when everybody stuns Snape at the same time and it has a much larger effect than usual.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps not, but we're not talking about someone sniping a target from 500 m away. If a quidditch beater can notice a fast moving bludger coming right for them and bat it away, can they not notice a club and hit it with a spell?
#+end_quote

Again, probably not, because those are two completely different skillsets. Also, casting a spell involves wand movement, not smacking something with a bat. If anything Beater reflexes would be maladaptive.
