  And the question is whether or not it's better to have all the targets in one location where he can kill them in one second, or spread out where he can't.
#+end_quote

Whether it's one second or a minute, does it matter if everyone is dead anyways?

#+begin_quote
  You're assuming Voldemort can fly faster than Dumbledore can phoenixport.
#+end_quote

No, you're assuming that Dumbledore knows exactly what's going on at every second (which isn't true) and knows exactly when to leave to fight Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Can't defend against Fiendfyre.
#+end_quote

Why not? The trio didn't know what to do in DH, but that's not to say a professor wouldn't.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, shit, could all the Hogwarts professors take Voldemort?
#+end_quote

A wraith Voldemort that has to possess people to do anything? Certainly.

#+begin_quote
  The question is whether the teachers are comfortable with their skills enough to risk it.

  They aren't.
#+end_quote

Are you a mugglewank author or something? Why do you consistently underestimate magicals? Yes, I do believe the professors are comfortable taking down a troll.

#+begin_quote
  They aren't, but spells are heightened by being cast simultaneously
#+end_quote

Heightened, yes. That doesn't mean it's the only way that could work.

#+begin_quote
  Again, probably not, because those are two completely different skillsets.
#+end_quote

Not really that different. Playing quidditch gives you the reflexes to see the club flying through the air, and after that, simply point a stick and cast a spell. You are making this out to be much hard than it really is.
