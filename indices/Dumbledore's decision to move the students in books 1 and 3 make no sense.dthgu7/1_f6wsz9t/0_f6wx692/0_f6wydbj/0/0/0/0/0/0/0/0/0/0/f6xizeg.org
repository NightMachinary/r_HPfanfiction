  I have a good idea what he knows. The fact that he didn't immediately phoenixport to the troll would suggest he doesn't know everything going on in the castle.

Nobody died then, though. He does show up seconds after the first students come into danger.

  He does know that Voldemort is without form though.
#+end_quote

Still doesn't know anything about what he's capable of. Also, does he actually know that?

  The simplest way. Cast your spell at it repeatedly. It will go down eventually.
#+end_quote

How do you know that will work? If it resists one spell, logically it will go on resisting that one spell, probably long enough to hurt someone.

  I don't know about you, but seeing a club fly in the air, pointing my wand at it, and casting a spell doesn't seem like some matrix level dodging bullets kind of situation, nor does it seem like it require god-like reflexes. It seems pretty straight forward.

Really. So if I hucked a baseball bat at your head, you could see that it's coming toward you, pick a spell, perform a complicated series of gestures, speak an incantation, and aim the spell - all in time to stop the bat?

Impressive, if so. I doubt everyone could.

  But not faster than a person can react to. Certainly not as fast as a bullet or a baseball.

Trolls are strong, and their clubs are large. It only has to hit one person.
