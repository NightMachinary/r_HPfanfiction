  Whether it's one second or a minute, does it matter if everyone is dead anyways?
#+end_quote

Yes? Because Dumbledore can get there if it takes long enough.

#+begin_quote
  No, you're assuming that Dumbledore knows exactly what's going on at every second (which isn't true) and knows exactly when to leave to fight Voldemort.
#+end_quote

You and I have no idea what Dumbledore does and does not know. We know he has Patronus communication. We know that he seems to mysteriously know things he shouldn't. We know that there are such things as alarm spells and functionally wards, though they're never called that.

#+begin_quote
  Why not? The trio didn't know what to do in DH, but that's not to say a professor wouldn't.
#+end_quote

Hermione literally considers it too dangerous to try to use to kill a /Horcrux/ when they have no other means of doing so available. So, yeah, probably not very easy to dispel.

#+begin_quote
  A wraith Voldemort that has to possess people to do anything? Certainly.
#+end_quote

The entire point of this conversation is that Dumbledore does not know what Voldemort is capable of. That's canon - otherwise he'd have just checked the professors for Voldemort possessions.

#+begin_quote
  Are you a mugglewank author or something? Why do you consistently underestimate magicals? Yes, I do believe the professors are comfortable taking down a troll.
#+end_quote

Travels With Trolls is a Lockhart book, so apparently dealing with them is hard enough that Lockhart made an effort to track down someone who'd managed it and steal their memories, then write a book about it.

#+begin_quote
  Heightened, yes. That doesn't mean it's the only way that could work.
#+end_quote

Then tell me about your way.

#+begin_quote
  Not really that different. Playing quidditch gives you the reflexes to see the club flying through the air, and after that, simply point a stick and cast a spell. You are making this out to be much hard than it really is.
#+end_quote

You know reflexes aren't like a Matrix slow-motion thing, where you calmly choose a response, right? A reflex is something that's only barely conscious - something either evolution or training has hardwired into your brain. Hitting something with a bat? Sure. Casting a momentum-arresting charm? Nope. Not most people, and not students or any of the teachers, save perhaps Moody. Casting a spell also takes a second, whereas a club hurled by a troll travels fast.
