  That's my point. Not all of them together is much better than all together. If Voldemort has to wait even a minute to get to the next group
#+end_quote

No, they're all dead because Voldemort can fly and traverse the halls far fast than students can walk.

#+begin_quote
  time for Dumbledore to phoenixport over to the new group.
#+end_quote

And by the time he learns about an attack, Voldemort has long since fled and is on to the next group.

#+begin_quote
  And if they were all together, that would be the entire school.
#+end_quote

Not if, as I suggested, there are professors protecting the students.

#+begin_quote
  Then I don't understand your original point. They'll all coordinate while teachers are telling them to step back and allow them to handle this, and without anyone telling them what to do, they'll combine spells?
#+end_quote

Then you misunderstood my post. I was listing the theoretical defenses of staying in the Great Hall, not planning an actual battle with students fighting a troll. Of course the professors would take care of the troll and keep the students out of harm.

  No, taking them out of the line of fire is not conscripting them. In their dorms, they will not have to fight. We don't know that one professor could take down a troll. We are merely spreading the students out so they aren't all in danger. If there's a gunner in the room, do you stay grouped up so he can do the maximum amount of damage, or do you scatter so he can't hit you all at once? The deal is that the students are going to get hurt if they fight a troll, period. There is, even in the best circumstances, an unjustifiable risk. Therefore, he spreads the students out so that the danger cannot find them all at once.

See above.

#+begin_quote
  Haha, nope. That's some WoG that I refuse to accept. Two other girls in Harry's year in Gryffindor? Bull. Approximately eight per House per year. 32x7=224 students, 64 of whom are sixth or seventh year.
#+end_quote

And that's bull I don't accept. Oh well.

#+begin_quote
  Every time it happens in canon, they're simultaneous.
#+end_quote

When are trolls ever subdued with magic in canon?

#+begin_quote
  Are baseball players expert marksmen?
#+end_quote

Perhaps not, but we're not talking about someone sniping a target from 500 m away. If a quidditch beater can notice a fast moving bludger coming right for them and bat it away, can they not notice a club and hit it with a spell?
