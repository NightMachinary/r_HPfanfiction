  You and I have no idea what Dumbledore does and does not know.
#+end_quote

I have a good idea what he knows. The fact that he didn't immediately phoenixport to the troll would suggest he doesn't know everything going on in the castle.

  The entire point of this conversation is that Dumbledore does not know what Voldemort is capable of. That's canon - otherwise he'd have just checked the professors for Voldemort possessions.
#+end_quote

He does know that Voldemort is without form though.

  Then tell me about your way.

The simplest way. Cast your spell at it repeatedly. It will go down eventually.

  You know reflexes aren't like a Matrix slow-motion thing, where you calmly choose a response, right? A reflex is something that's only barely conscious - something either evolution or training has hardwired into your brain.

I don't know about you, but seeing a club fly in the air, pointing my wand at it, and casting a spell doesn't seem like some matrix level dodging bullets kind of situation, nor does it seem like it require god-like reflexes. It seems pretty straight forward.

  whereas a club hurled by a troll travels fast.
#+end_quote

But not faster than a person can react to. Certainly not as fast as a bullet or a baseball.
