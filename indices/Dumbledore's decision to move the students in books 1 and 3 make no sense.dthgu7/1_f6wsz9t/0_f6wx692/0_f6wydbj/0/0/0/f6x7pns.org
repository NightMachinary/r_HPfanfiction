  they won't all be in the line of fire

They will be though. Not all together, perhaps, but all will be out in the open and vulnerable. Voldemort could kill one groups and move on the next. One good blast of fiendfyre could easily kill an entire house in seconds.

  The moment you make the kids part of the battle plan, you're conscripting them. That's what deputizing is. Whether they want to fight or not doesn't matter, because they aren't equipped to make that choice.
#+end_quote

Once again, there is no conscription because they do have a choice. They would battle the troll because they voluntarily do so. The prefects can't force anyone to fight.

  Geneva Convention.

Lol are you serious or just joking with me now? I don't think you understand that this isn't a war. If I'm camping and a bear attacks me, am I conscripted to fight the bear?

  And if there was a responsible adult around, they wouldn't allow it.
#+end_quote

Then what's the point? One professor could take down troll, no students have to fight. Unlike in canon, where there are no professors to defend the students because all the professors abandoned the students to look for the troll. You talk about how Dumbledore wouldn't conscript minors, when that is exactly what he did by sending them without professor escort to their dorms.

  There aren't 100 of those, either.

[[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][Yes, there are]].

  All we know is that trolls are highly resistant to magic. We have no idea how resistant.
#+end_quote

More resistant than dragons? Unlikely. Especially if getting hit in the head by their own club can incapacitate one.

  Also, yes, they do have to be simultaneous.

Citation?

#+begin_quote
  Reflexes =/= aim. Aim =/= reflexes. Aim with a ball =/= aim with a spell. Trained Quidditch reflexes =/= trained combat reflexes.

I'm sorry, but I cannot believe that people trained to catch, throw, and beat fast moving objects in midair are suddenly useless when it comes to firing spells.
