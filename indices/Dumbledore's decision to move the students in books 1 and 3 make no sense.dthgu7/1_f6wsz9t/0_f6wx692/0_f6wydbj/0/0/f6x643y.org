  You know what would be the easiest way to do that? Attack the students while they are walking through the halls to their dorms, protected only by their prefects. If, as you believe, they would be no use in a battle, Dumbledore has divided the students and made it exceptionally easier for Voldemort to murder everyone.
#+end_quote

Yeah. So he separates them, so if one group is attacked, they won't /all/ be in the line of fire. Cold equations. He can't fight Voldemort while protecting an auditorium full of kids. He can barely do it while protecting just Harry. I'm not saying they're safe. I'm saying they aren't all in danger at the same time.

  Conscription? No one is being conscripted, unless you believe it is conscription to defend your very life? Do you believe the student would lay down and die rather than fight the troll because it is "conscription?"
#+end_quote

The moment you make the kids part of the battle plan, you're conscripting them. That's what deputizing is. Whether they want to fight or not doesn't matter, because they aren't equipped to make that choice. You said only the older kids - why not the first years, too? Because it's downright criminal to allow them. I feel like I should ring up Hellstrike to talk about the Geneva Convention.

  No one would force them to do anything. But if I was in such a scenario, I know I would want to protect myself.
#+end_quote

And if there was a responsible adult around, they wouldn't allow it.

#+begin_quote
  By upper years, I meant post-OWL students. Sixth and seventh years.
#+end_quote

There aren't 100 of those, either.

  If even a dozen students managed to hit, the troll is going down. Troll skin might be tougher than human skin, but t's not as tough as dragon hide. And the spells don't have to be simultaneous to compound upon each other.
#+end_quote

All we know is that trolls are highly resistant to magic. We have no idea how resistant. Also, yes, they do have to be simultaneous.

#+begin_quote
  Alright, I could agree that it might be too difficult for students, but is it outside of the realm of possibilities that a quidditch player has the reflexes to hit a club with a spell?
#+end_quote

Reflexes =/= aim. Aim =/= reflexes. Aim with a ball =/= aim with a spell. Trained Quidditch reflexes =/= trained combat reflexes.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps, but would he immediately try again now that everyone is on high alert?
#+end_quote

Probably would have laid low, like how he hid after he killed Pettigrew, or after he betrayed the Potters. Walking up to Hagrid and giving him a motorcycle like that... he's a damn chameleon./s

From anyone's perspective, he's a nutjob who happens to do impossible shit with disturbing regularity that seems planned. Sit in Azkaban - largely sane - until he catches sight of a line about Harry in the newspapers, then break out in a month. Break into Hogwarts under Dementor guard. Who knows what he's capable of?
