  Dumbledore would certainly know it was a feint. What a perfect way to steal stone, by distracting all the teachers. How could Dumbledore not see through such an obvious ruse.
#+end_quote

You know what would ALSO be a good distraction? Wounding/murdering a few. Teachers are occupied trying to save the kid, Dumbledore has to make sure the school is safe before he can check on the Stone, even Snape couldn't sneak away. So Dumbledore had to prevent that.

#+begin_quote
  Why exactly? Voldemort works through subterfuge; him killing or capturing a large group of student would not make any sense and Dumbledore knows it.
#+end_quote

See above.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore understands Voldemort more than anyone else in the world. He of all people would know that Voldemort would not do this. It was not Voldemort's style to commit mass murder of civilians.
#+end_quote

Are we talking about the same Voldemort here?

#+begin_quote
  Yes, so tough that two eleven year olds armed with one of the most basic charms could take it down.
#+end_quote

Unintentionally, in a one-in-a-million chance. Most trolls would have kept their hands more firmly on their clubs, and most combatants wouldn't have been able to stick a wand up its nose.

#+begin_quote
  Easily. One hundred stunners or impedimentas from the upper years would certainly take it down, and an arresto momentum on the club would stop it from hurting anyone.
#+end_quote

Conscripting the older kids is morally wrong. The Prefects have some excuse, since they have agreed to an increase in responsibility, but the minors are still minors and shouldn't be expected to be forced to defend themselves. To add onto that, there aren't 100 seventh years, and how do you know that the people who can cast the spell AND hit the target AND not freeze up in fear would take down a troll if they all cast simultaneously (and they'd have to manage that, too)? Dragons certainly resist such spells, and while trolls are smaller than dragons, that means they're a smaller target, as well.

And who, exactly, is hitting a thrown club with that spell?

#+begin_quote
  I never said they did. But more importantly, you believe that because they don't sleep in the dorms, that means they can't stay in the common room for one night?
#+end_quote

Fair point, honestly.

#+begin_quote
  Ok, so if he knows that upper limit is the very entrance to each houses' common room (as I myself stated), then why abandon those defenses in favor of the Great Hall?
#+end_quote

Because Black knows his limits, so if he tries again, it would only be after he's made a plan to get past them.

#+begin_quote
  Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Dumbledore go searching the grounds with the other teachers and left Head Boy Percy in charge? Can't exactly watch over everyone if you're not present. Also, Dumbledore did not allow the dementors to look for Black in the castle.
#+end_quote

That's as may be. I don't actually remember. The point is that he can make sure they're safe to the best of his ability and search at his leisure, if indeed he did do so. Sirius is the devil Dumbledore knows, in contrast with the mysterious troll summoner.
