  whether it will be a feint
#+end_quote

Dumbledore would certainly know it was a feint. What a perfect way to steal stone, by distracting all the teachers. How could Dumbledore *not* see through such an obvious ruse.

#+begin_quote
  Separating them so that no one student/teacher has access to everyone is a sound move
#+end_quote

Why exactly? Voldemort works through subterfuge; him killing or capturing a large group of student would not make any sense and Dumbledore knows it.

#+begin_quote
  to get at the students.

  For all he knows, Voldemort will be stepping into the Hall behind the troll.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore understands Voldemort more than anyone else in the world. He of all people would know that Voldemort would not do this. It was not Voldemort's style to commit mass murder of civilians.

#+begin_quote
  Also, trolls are tough to take down.
#+end_quote

Yes, so tough that two eleven year olds armed with one of the most basic charms could take it down.

#+begin_quote
  What if it bounds into the hall while throwing its club? Are you sure you could take it down before it hit a kid?
#+end_quote

Easily. One hundred stunners or impedimentas from the upper years would certainly take it down, and an arresto momentum on the club would stop it from hurting anyone.

#+begin_quote
  The Heads of House don't room in the dorms.
#+end_quote

I never said they did. But more importantly, you believe that because they don't sleep in the dorms, that means they can't stay in the common room for one night?

#+begin_quote
  Thus, he knows that there is an upper limit on what Black is capable of (getting past the Fat Lady)
#+end_quote

Ok, so if he knows that upper limit is the very entrance to each houses' common room (as I myself stated), then why abandon those defenses in favor of the Great Hall?

#+begin_quote
  He can watch over every student without having to go look for a troll, because the Dementors are looking for Sirius.
#+end_quote

Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Dumbledore go searching the grounds with the other teachers and left Head Boy Percy in charge? Can't exactly watch over everyone if you're not present. Also, Dumbledore did not allow the dementors to look for Black in the castle.
