Book 1: Dumbledore has no idea how long it will take to locate the troll, or whether it will be a feint (it was) to get at the students (it wasn't). Separating them so that no one student/teacher has access to everyone is a sound move, and hiding them behind much more defensible dorm access points like the Fat Lady is a genuinely sound plan.

For all he knows, Voldemort will be stepping into the Hall behind the troll. Also, trolls are tough to take down. What if it bounds into the hall while throwing its club? Are you /sure/ you could take it down before it hit a kid?

Book 3: The Heads of House don't room in the dorms. This is the opposite situation - Dumbledore knows that Black is alone and has been turned back before. Thus, he knows that there is an upper limit on what Black is capable of (getting past the Fat Lady) and that he's got a plan for it. He has no idea what plans Black has made, but there's an important distinction this time as opposed to last time - Dumbledore doesn't need to do a damn thing. He can watch over every student without having to go look for a troll, because the Dementors are looking for Sirius.
