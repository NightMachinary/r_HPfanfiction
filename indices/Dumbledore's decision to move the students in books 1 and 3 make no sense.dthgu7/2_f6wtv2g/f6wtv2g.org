  guarded by six prefects, the head of house, and maybe some seventh year volunteers who want to protect the younger students. Good luck getting through them

You are overestimating the 15-18 yr olds and underestimating the fear Sirius Black, who was known to have murdered 13 people with one spell leaving a crater in the street, caused. McGonagall could take Sirius, sure, but why risk that with a bunch of children over head while believing Sirius did what he did.
