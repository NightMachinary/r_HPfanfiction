Hell, even I thought it was a stupid idea to send kids away from the one place he knew /100% for sure/ the troll actually /wasn't/ when I was barely in double digits!

Seriously, the better plan, for the troll at least, would be to barricade the doors, give Hagrid a weapon of some sort, and tell him to guard the students with the Prefects as the everything-has-gone-to-hell backup while the other teachers dealt with finding the troll itself!
