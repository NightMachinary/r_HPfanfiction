Severus Snape was a brilliant man. He was a prodigy in potions, a master duelist having an extensive knowledge of the Dark Arts, a master occlumens (which in spite of what fandom makes you believe, requires a tremendous discipline to master). In fact, I believe that had his life been a little easier (no ruthless prankings by marauders, no neglect from his parents and no obsessive love for Lily) he would have no doubt become a most talented wizard of all time. Perhaps this intellect of Severus Snape is what makes him attractive as a mentor for Harry.

But, as others have pointed out, Snape is not a good natured man. He has very little patience with children, he basically abhors Harry for being a mirror image of his father, he is biased towards his own house and has other petty quirks about him which clearly does not make him a good mentor for anyone, let alone Harry. Fanfics are all about experimentations so I for one am not so put out by somebody's idea of mentor!Snape.
