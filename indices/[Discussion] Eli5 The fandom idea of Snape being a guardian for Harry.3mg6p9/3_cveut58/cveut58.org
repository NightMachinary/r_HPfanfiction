Because fan fiction thrives on interesting characters. Harry is not particularly interesting - he's a normal kid that has extraordinary things happen to him. Snape on the other hand is /not/ normal, and the farthest away from normal there is in canon that doesn't require an inordinate amount of skill to write (like Luna or Hagrid). All you have to do is channel your anger into very few words, and that's all people really need to recognize it (which is also why he's misrepresented so much).

I think that the other (easier, and therefore more popular) is to show Snape as evil and torment him. Instant 200 likes on FFN for that. 1000 if you make it a super/indie/Harry that proves how superior he is in every way while calling Snape Snivellus, especially if he teams up with Sirius.

The fact is that Snape is a childish man from what little we see of him. There really is very little to go on. Would he be equally childish if he was put in a different situation? We don't know. Does he still love Lily romantically? Probably not - and we don't know. Does he still hate Sirius? Obviously, and it was mutual. They were complete jerks to each other, as Sirius showed gleefully starting in PoA (where he slammed the head of an unconscious Snape against walls) and until his last breath. But is this all there is to him? We don't know because we are limited to Harry's POV, and see the absolute worst of Snape.

Even with everything in the Harry Potter Wiki (which aggregates everything: interviews, Pottermore, the games, etc), there is very little known about who he is rather than how he acted. It's very open to interpretation. And most of the fandom is split among the extremes: Snape was pure evil made of scum and deserved everything bad that happened to him, and Snape was a misunderstood tortured soul that was a good man at heart.

That flexibility makes for an easy out for development of a story. And seriously, making someone else Harry's guardian would just make the story less interesting, not more so.
