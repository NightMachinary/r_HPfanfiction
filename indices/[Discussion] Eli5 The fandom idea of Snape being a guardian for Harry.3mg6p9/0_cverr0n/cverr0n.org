Snape is an interesting character. A prick who held a grudge most of his life and took it out on a kid, but also a prick who spent most of his like atoning for /some of/ his sins. Lily was his childhood friend, James was his school rival. He knows a lot of magic and is talented. All of this together makes him interesting. Seems natural this leads to the mentor!Snape.
