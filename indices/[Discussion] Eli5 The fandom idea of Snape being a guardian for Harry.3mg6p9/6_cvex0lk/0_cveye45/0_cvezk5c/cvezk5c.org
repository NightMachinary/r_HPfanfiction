Oh, I didn't mean that you were, I just thought you might not have read any of them. It took me a long time to read any Drarry stuff because the idea seemed really weird to me when I first heard it, but the fandom is full of it and there are some good stories out there once I tried them.

My explanation for Severitus is\\
1: [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Severitus_Challenge][The Severitus Challenge]]

2: Just the role Snape plays in the series. He's the outsider on your side, the one who doesn't quite "get" how normal humans act. If you like Spock or Data in Star Trek, Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Vegeta in Dragonball Z, etc., etc. you have a high chance of liking Snape.

And liking Snape, you'll want him to forge connections. Most books or TV shows deliver on this. Not Harry Potter. Snape goes to his grave misunderstood and hated by everyone. Fanfiction just wants to make things better for him. You want him and the other characters you like to get along, to have a mutual respect for each other. Canon shows this is /possible/ because Harry does respect him after he sees the pensieve memories.

Harry is another character fans want to make things better for. He's a poor little abused orphan who really needs a family quite badly, he was ready to go with Sirius like ten minutes after he found out the man wasn't a mass murderer. That was literally the only qualification he needed to go and want to live with someone who was a complete stranger to him.

So knowing all this, why not put the two together? All it takes is Snape seeing past Harry's looking like James, and Harry finding some things out about Snape's motivations a little earlier.
