Your theory is flawed. Just because you loathe the character doesn't mean that those that like him only see the movie Snape. I've liked Snape from the beginning, always believed Harry was an idiot to continue to provoke the man (yes, Harry has a part to play in the whole fiasco. Not all the blame, but he really didn't help.....example, the flying car to school, both Harry and Ron deserved that dressing down)
