It's from people who didn't read the books, or who first saw the movies and only read the books much later.

Book Snape is an evil man with an unpleasant appearance. He is shown six years terrorising Gryffindors, with a special hatred towards Harry and Neville. Then it is revealed in the last book he lusted after Harry's mother until she dropped him when he called her by a vicious racial slur, yet 'still loved her'.\\
He hates the Marauders, and seems to carry a special hatred for Sirius Black and James Potter. He is directly involved in making Sirius' last years miserable, and of course his hatred towards James is transferred undiluted to Harry. I believe that only his vow to protect Lily's child is what was keeping him from /directly/ harming Harry -- the emotional torment he put him through was allowed, though.

Film Snape is Alan Rickman. He is a stern teacher, but not an outright evil bully. While his relation with Harry and Neville is not pleasant, he is shown in a much more human light. His heel face turn at the end is actually somewhat plausible and you can somewhat believe the whole 'being such a jerk was a front' narrative that 'redeems' him. Unlike the book version this Snape doesn't seem to particularly enjoy Harry being in distress and even his hatred for the Marauders is toned down.

Snarry fans are in love with film Snape and reason that since he always loved Lily, he must've always loved Harry, too.
