I'm pretty sure they met when they were both aged nine (I'd have to doublecheck the chapter), and no, lusting wasn't part of the equation. In fact, even at Hogwarts it seems dubious to me that Snape lusted after Lily. Partly because he was so poorly socialized, I'd venture to say he lagged behind Lily developmentally and hadn't yet hit the point of dealing with relationships when the rift between them happened. He was obviously immature. But Lily was special to him - Lily represented everything clean, pretty, successful, well-loved, well cared for, financially secure - everything child Severus wasn't. Having Lily choose him as a friend was proof that he was special, too. He needed her friendship in a way she didn't need his, and losing her must have been devastating to his belief that his life would ever be validated by /that/ world - the world Lily navigated so effortlessly.

Of course he loved her. She was probably the only person who ever took his peculiarities in stride.

Remember, JKR called his expression "greedy." I think he wanted, in a sense, to possess her because he was greedy for everything he didn't have, and she embodied all those things. She was born to them.

Also, I don't see how anybody could say Snape lusted after Lily following her death. He was mad with guilt and grief; he knew he was responsible for what had happened to her, even though he didn't actually kill her. Guilt ruled the rest of his life. Lily's death also was the death warrant for any ambitions or personal dreams Snape might have had. He submitted to a life he hated in order to destroy the murderer of the only person who'd ever loved him, even if ultimately even she had been unable to tolerate his bigotry and horrible choices.

Oops, lunchbreak over. I can talk about this for hours, so I may be back to blather more later on.
