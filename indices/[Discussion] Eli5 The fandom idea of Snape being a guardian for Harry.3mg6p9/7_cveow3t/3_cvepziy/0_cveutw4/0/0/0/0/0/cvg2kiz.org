Um, I actually do think Snape loved Lily. It was a love hampered by the fact that he had no prior experience of it, no model for it, and that it began when he was a fairly inarticulate child who simply submitted to his own feelings and longings and who never grew into a self-examining adult.

But it was love, no question. Love is not a pure thing, philosophy and literature to the contrary. It's shaped by the personality of the person loving, by the slow understanding and changes on each side, by social context and skill in communication.

Hmm. Maybe in /your/ experience. But let me introduce you to my parents. Let me tell you about some ex-partners and friends of mine. I know they love(d) me, but by your definition, they wouldn't pass the test. Using that kind of strict idealization romanticizes the reality of love. People are selfish, often unconsciously so. And they have different degrees of self-awareness. And backgrounds. And assumptions. And so on.

I've been both incredibly selfish and incredibly generous towards people I love. If you try to insist I didn't love them, I will tell you where to shove your moral high-mindedness. (That's not a personal 'you,' by the way, but a rhetorical one.)

Snape's love for Lily did him no good. In some ways, it crippled his life. If he'd been able to stop caring, he might actually have thrived - might have wrung some pleasure and satisfaction out of his career as a Death Eater. Instead, he lived in a state of frustration, hopelessness (at least in the sense of anything ever getting better), heartbreak, and servitude. He stewed in malice and resentment, bound to a place that had witnessed his humiliation, his besting in love, his ultimate mistake in choosing evil. Nor did his love help Lily. Snape /tried/ - I wouldn't take that away from him. But one of the interesting moments in the confrontation between Snape and Dumbledore during the hilltop scene is that JKR describes Snape as bewildered that Dumbledore thinks it important to save James and Harry. Clearly this is a young man with no concept of right or wrong. He doesn't understand why his callousness is so horrible. He's had no training in being good. His entire life, with the exception of his joy in finding Lily, has been about clawing his way out of his miserable beginnings.

Snape is /passionate/ about everything that matters to him - love, hate, magic, knowledge, power - but he is never, ever pure. That's one reason I rejoice in his character - he's a gift to writers everywhere.

Also, greed and love do not cancel each other out. Child Snape was greedy, with or without Lily - and he was right to be so. He was an incredibly deprived child, practically feral, certainly unsupervised and apparently unwanted. He presumably envied and hungered for the easy, happy things other children possessed through no virtues of their own - and that hunger was a hundred times more admirable than curling up and submitting to fate. Young Snape fought, in the only way he knew how, to better himself - but all the odds were against him, and he was his own worst enemy. Despite that, he was capable of love, even if it was an ugly, desperate love, much like Snape himself. It's both irony and poetic justice that his capacity to love - what the books consider Harry's saving grace - was inevitably the catalyst for Snape's death.

IMO, Snape deserved his redemption arc, because redemption, like love, is not a straight, unsullied line. And for me it's signalled by a telling exchange in The Prince's Tale wherein Snape gives one clear, sharp proof of the fact that he's finally acquired a conscience, and in the process comes out looking far more sympathetic than Dumbledore (this is not one of DD's finer moments, because he teases Snape about something that isn't funny):

  "Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?"

  "Lately, only those whom I could not save," said Snape.

Too little too late, but Snape has more dignity here than the sainted Albus, and demonstrates his hard-earned grasp of right from wrong - with, I would argue, very little support from Dumbledore, who stood in the position of mentor and commander to him but appeared to view him as a useful resource more than as a human being. (Necessary disclaimer: no, I don't hate Dumbledore, in fact I find him as complex and fascinating as Snape. But I think his goodness is a very murky and ambiguous thing, whereas his greatness is undeniable.)

Shite, this is what happens when I start discussing Snape - I ramble on for paragraphs. On topic, I'd say Snape would be a nightmare as Harry's mentor, partly because it would be something forced upon him, and because, as you point out, he hates children. Being around children and stuck in Hogwarts is one of the things that keeps him stunted. (I personally believe Snape would have been a brilliant if harsh university professor, spurred on by students who were as focused and smart about the subject as he was.) And of course, despite being loyal unto death, he carries a fucking grudge like nobody's business, and it would take months - /years/ - for him to admit that Harry isn't James reincarnated, and that Harry isn't to blame for the fact that Lily died for him.

But that's what makes the idea interesting to me. Yes, it requires a long, careful development and slow evolution of change between the two, and it doesn't automatically suppose that one will ever feel affection for the other. But respect? That I can imagine. And I think the impression each makes on the other - the potential within Harry to humanize Snape and the possibility that Snape can show Harry the advantages of magical knowledge - plus the fact that both of them are Olympic champions at enduring all the shit that fate dumps on them - would create the kind of bond that gets forged in wartime. You may go your separate ways afterwards, but there will always be something that ties you to the people with whom you risked your life. /That's/ a story I would like to read.
