  But let me introduce you to my parents. Let me tell you about some ex-partners and friends of mine. I know they love(d) me, but by your definition, they wouldn't pass the test.

Are you saying that they never, ever put your interests ahead of their own? Never, ever sacrificed for you? If so, then no, they didn't love you. You might consider that moral high-mindedness, but I consider it common sense that if a person doesn't treat you better than those they hate or are indifferent to, then it's not possible for them to genuinely love you.

I never defined love /always and only/ putting another's interests ahead of yours, but if you /never/ do it, then you don't love them - such an attitude would be indistinguishable from indifference at best. And that is especially true for something really important, like in the context here.

  Love is not a pure thing, philosophy and literature to the contrary.

True. But it does require appropriate corresponding actions, absolutely none of which we see in Snape. Not a single loving /act/ that is performed /for others/. We mostly only see selfish acts which, at best, suggest that he loves himself and wants to satisfy his own desires. Occasionally we see grudgingly performed acts that he is obligated to do.

As I wrote before, actions speak louder than words.

Oh, and if it helps, defining love as sacrificing for others is the JKR canon definition - it's how /she/ is defining love in the context of her story. I'm not going nearly as far as her with that, and Snape fails to fit the definition. Under JKR's use of love, Snape falls even farther short of the mark. So far short, in fact, that I doubt his attempt would even register. So even if you personally rejected the idea of sacrificing as having anything to do with love, you wouldn't be able to ignore it entirely.

Curiously, I don't think there is a single example of Snape ever saying he loves or loved Lily. Others infer it, but he never says it. So it's not even a case of comparing his actions to his words and finding his actions wanting. Instead, we are comparing his actions to /others inferences/, and finding Snape's actions wanting. At that point, it's time to ask whether those making the inferences really know what they are talking about.

  People are selfish, often unconsciously so.

True, which is why love takes work... work which Snape never actually invests. You have to make an effort, sometimes on a daily basis, and that's another example of Snape's actions shouting from the top of the Astronomy tower that he doesn't actually love anyone. Possibly not even himself.
