  I'm pretty sure they met when they were both aged nine (I'd have to doublecheck the chapter

Do you remember where this is? That actually does sound familiar now that I think about it but I can't find it now.

(edit: is this the quote: "Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy."?)

I think you nailed it with the greed thing. I think that Snape's feelings for Lily were always possessive. He subconsciously wanted to possess Lily in every sense of the word, including romantically. He wanted to be Lily's sole best friend and her sole confidant, and anyone who displayed romantic interest in Lily was a threat to that. It's like he wanted to be her boyfriend because he didn't want anyone else to be her boyfriend.

I also agree with you about Snape supposedly lusting after Lily post-death. At that point, I think she stopped being a real person that he could lust over and started just being a general idea. He wasn't sitting there staring at a picture of her or swearing off women.
