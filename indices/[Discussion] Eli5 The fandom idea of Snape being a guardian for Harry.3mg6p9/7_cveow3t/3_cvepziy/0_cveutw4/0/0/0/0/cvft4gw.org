I agree with the "greed" idea, too. Everyone who insists on lauding Snape for having a huge capacity for love are simply taking a couple of events in the book at face value - self-reported statements from a couple of characters as if they were incapable of lying or self-delusion.

Actions speak louder than words, so what /actions/ indicate that Snape truly loved Lily? He asked that she be spared, and that's a great thing to do, but... what did he expect the next step to be? That she'd fall in love with him once her husband and son were gone? That she'd actually be happy that she survived?

Love means putting another's interests ahead of your own. Was it in /Snape's/ interests that Lily live while her family were murdered, or /Lily's/?

Snape's, clearly.

He protected Harry, but it was clearly under duress and he abused the boy as far as possible. So that's the opposite of an action showing love.

His patronus changed, but that's not necessarily love. It's grief, but it could be grief over losing something he wanted badly.

Before he died, he wanted to see Harry's eyes... except not. He wanted to see Lily's eyes one last time. He didn't care about Harry.

In the end, what Snape cared about most was how Lily made him feel: special, good, wanted, cared for. Quite understandable, given his home life. I find it hard to criticize that.

But there's no way in hell that that can be called "love".

And there's also no way in hell that he can be treated as an appropriate "mentor" for anyone. He clearly hates teaching and children too much.

I totally get people exploring how canon can be "fixed" with little changes or how characters can be "fixed" with little changes, but when you so fundamentally change a character like that, it's no longer a fix - it's an admission that the original character was too awful to be redeemed and needed to be replaced with an alternate universe version that didn't grow up to be monumental ass. And that's OK, too, just acknowledge it.
