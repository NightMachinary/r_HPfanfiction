  I actually think Snape's motives - his love for Lily - diminished him as a character

it does create a myriad of complications, doesn't it?

it's also interesting to think about snape's affection within the fabric of the hpverse. jkr consistently lists his love for lily as one of his greatest strengths; she repeatedly praises him for it and speaks of it as wholly positive, without the caveat of it being 'obsessive', 'creepy' or 'twisted', etc. i think it's implied that dumbledore and harry think the same. the only person that reduces it to lust is voldemort, which is done to show how blind he is to 'love'. if we accept that, socially and culturally within the hp world, his love for lily is perceived as positive, and everyone (dumbledore) reinforces that idea, even his creator, how/why would snape think he's doing anything creepy? or jkr has loopy ideas about the sanctity of love
