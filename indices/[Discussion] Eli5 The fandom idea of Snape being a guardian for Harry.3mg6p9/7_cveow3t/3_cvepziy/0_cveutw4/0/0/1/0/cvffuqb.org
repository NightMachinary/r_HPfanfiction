Yes, thank you, I'm aware of that. But that's not really plausible at age nine.

Later, yes of course, Snape clearly had a crush on Lily. But that's not at all the same thing as being ready for a relationship or even understanding what your feelings mean. Compared to James and Lily, Snape was distinctly behind the curve. And I find the phrasing "lusting after Lily" distasteful and reductive. James also lusted after Lily. Yes, and? Presumably Lily lusted back. But what Snape lost when he snapped and called Lily a mudblood was the friendship, the innocence, the trust, the pleasure and reassurance of being considered worthwhile by someone popular, someone he thought the world of (insults to the contrary). He lost the feeling of being loved, and he lost his one chance to learn how to love back. Remember, this was a boy no one had ever thought worthwhile before. His parents obviously didn't. He lost his only link to anything 'normal' when he drove Lily away. It must have hurt like blazes, and not because his 'lust' was thwarted.

Snape's grief and his obsessive focus on Lily after her death were unhealthy. But they gave him a purpose. And Dumbledore certainly benefited from his spy's inability to live with his guilt. He contributed to Snape's failure to grow up, because he needed Snape to stay true to the cause, and his power over Snape was directly connected to Snape's grief and guilt.

I actually think Snape's motives - his love for Lily - diminished him as a character, but the latest wave of Snape interpretation, which throws around the terms Nice Guy and friendzoning and lusting after a dead woman, take an interesting character with complicated issues and turn him into a one-dimensional creep. Snape may be a creep, but that doesn't begin to scratch the surface of what makes him complex and genuinely tragic to so many readers and fic writers. He brought about his own downfall, but 'lust' had nothing to do with it. Twisted as Snape's love may have been, it was clearly genuine, just as his hatred of James was genuine. He was, emotionally speaking, an obsessive, and it was only at the very end that he showed signs of learning how to depersonalize his responses.

But this has wandered rather far from the post topic, and I apologize for that. My time would probably be better spent packing, feh.
