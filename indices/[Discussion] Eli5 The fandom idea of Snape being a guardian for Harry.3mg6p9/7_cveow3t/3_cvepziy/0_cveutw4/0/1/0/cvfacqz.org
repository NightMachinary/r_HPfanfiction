I got the impression that Snape befriended Lily within a year or so of them starting school, but maybe I'm wrong.

Both of them were born in January 1960, which means they would have turned 11 in January 1971 and started school in September 1971. If he had befriended her a year prior to her getting her letter (summer 1970), they would be 10.

  Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy.
