  Snarry fans are in love with film Snape and reason that since he always loved Lily, he must've always loved Harry, too.

Nonsense.

Sure, there are Rickmanites who swoon over his version of Snape and pair him with everyone in the HP universe, but most of the Snarry folk I know - and I've shipped Snape/Harry for 10 years - vastly prefer book!Snape. His love for Lily threw a serious spanner in the works and was much harder for some people to accept than his death was. It threw the fandom into turmoil for a while.
