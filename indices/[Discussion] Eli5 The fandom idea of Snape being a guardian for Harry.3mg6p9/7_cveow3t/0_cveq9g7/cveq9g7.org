I've read the books, way to many times, (and they definitely stick in my head much more than the movies) and Snarry definitely can come from the books too.

A lot of fanfiction deals with AU stuff where they're 'fixing' or exploring things that /might/ have happened in canon. For example, Harry never going to the Dursleys, different pairings, Dumbledore not dying, Riddle redemption fics. In that light, a Snarry story makes sense. Maybe Snape managed to get past his emotions in first year, maybe he found out about the Dursleys, maybe he and James at least came to an understanding - who knows? However, it's all up to the fanfiction author to make these decisions, and that's the whole point of an AU story.

Also, Snape's story, even in the book, is pretty poignant. It's pretty clear that much of Snape in the earlier books derives from his childhood. Additionally, he does show courage, and loyalty to Lily, and in doing so shows that he has good traits, and might be, deep down a good person. That opens up a what-if question for writers to exploit.

I don't think anyone could be in love with either film Snape, or even book Snape. But people are in love with the idea that if Snape was /just/ a /bit/ different, he could be someone they could love.
