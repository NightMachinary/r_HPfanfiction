Because as awful as Snape was, depending on how early this happens, it /forces/ him onto a path of growing up that he should've been on like twenty years prior. And often these stories have it happen in the relative safety of Hogwarts, or have people like McGonagall checking in.

In these stories, Snape often starts out in character, but then changes. He becomes horribly out of character compared to canon, sometimes a bit too quickly, but sometimes it'll take the full 200k+ word journey. His character changes to someone deserving of that redemption arc he was given in canon, or at least close to it.

Plus, it's alternate universe anyway.

(Edit: and its usually /not/ something like being a good guardian makes up for his choices and treatment of children, but it'll be something like being a good guardian affects his treatment of everyone around him in a good way)
