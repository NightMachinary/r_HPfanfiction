Have you read [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708][The Apple Tree by Philo?]] It's not perfect, with one plot twist I don't see the point of, but overall it's great Snarry with a powerful Harry, and a believable Neville Longbottom subplot that will make you swoon.

The second by the same author is worth a read as well.
