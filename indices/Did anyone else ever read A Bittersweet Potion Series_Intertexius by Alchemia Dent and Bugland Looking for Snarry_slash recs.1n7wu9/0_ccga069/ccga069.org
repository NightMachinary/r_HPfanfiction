I left a list of recent Snarry fics [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1mn5si/ive_been_out_of_the_fanfic_scene_for_about_5/ccb7lr4][here]]. I don't know if you're familiar with [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/102577?view_adult=true][Commonplace Magic]] by Acid and Sinick, but it's one of my absolute, all-time favourite non-magical AUs. Beautiful, beautiful writing. They've written some glorious stories, most of which are archived at [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org][www.walkingtheplank.org]]. It's the best of the Snarry archive sites since that's all they host there. AO3 has a lot of good stories, too.

I hope that helps!
