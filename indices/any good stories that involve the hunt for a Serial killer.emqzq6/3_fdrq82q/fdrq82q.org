I'm pretty new so I'm not sure if its ok to post recs outside the main archives, but it's one of my favorites. "Dark Gods in the Blood" by Hayseed. It's pretty old (written around the time of book 5 so a little AU) but holds up. Harry is the victim and Hermione searches for the killer with Snape's assistance. Almost "Silence of the Lambs"-ish. Mild HG/SS at the end. [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/dark-gods-in-the-blood-pro30/amp/][Link]]
