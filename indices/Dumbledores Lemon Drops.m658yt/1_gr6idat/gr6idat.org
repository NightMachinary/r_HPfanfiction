I've seen fanfics where they were laced with calming draught, which is why he presses them on people the moment they come to his office. A kind of â€˜calm your tits' roofie to make everyone settle down and be able to discuss things rationally. I can't remember which fanfics had this particular tidbit in them - it was a throwaway, background thing. I now have it firmly as head canon because I think it's hilarious.
