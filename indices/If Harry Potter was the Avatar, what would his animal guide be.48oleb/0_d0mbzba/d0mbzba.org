Depends on what kind of fic you're going to write. Is Harry born/transported to the Avatar world? Or does Avatar stuff/characters happen in the HP world.

If the former, then you need to decide what will be Harry's primary element (Air for Aang, Water for Korra, Fire for Roku e.t.c.). For me Harry feels like Fire would suit him best, he's headstrong, courageous to a fault and has incredible will

As stated by Iroh; /"Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will and the energy and drive to achieve what they want."/

Which describes Harry very well.

Therefore, his animal guide needs to be connected to fire in some way, therefore, in my opinion, the Phoenix is the perfect animal guide.

1. It can transport anyone anywhere, so it is still considered a rideable mount technically.
2. The phoenix features heavily in Harry's life as it's part of his wand core (as well as Voldemort's), Fawks was a friend to Harry and saved him in the Chamber, Phoenix's represent rebirth, Harry died at the end and was brought back, double meaning if he resurrects as a Fire Nation citizen in Avatar world.
3. Phoenix tears heal wounds, which is something Waterbending can do in Avatar world.

Hope this helps. :)
