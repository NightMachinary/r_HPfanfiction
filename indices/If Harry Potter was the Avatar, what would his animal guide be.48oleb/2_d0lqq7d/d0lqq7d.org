Well, just combine two animals that are related to Harry in some way. You have: Lion (Gryffindor), Snake (Parseltongue), Phoenix (Fawkes), Toad (Neville's), Horse (Centaurs/Thestrals), Dog (Sirius/Fluffy), Wolf (Remus), Spider (Aragog), and the already mentioned Owl and Stag.

You also have to consider what element (fire, earth, water, air) that Harry would hail from and base the animal around that. Water = Polarbear Dog. Air = Air Bison.

I personally like the idea of a Spider Horse because of the small reference to the Nordic myth of Sleipnir, an eight legged horse with a connection to death (similar to Harry). This choice also steers clear of the obvious picks and doesn't go into the unbelievable like Phoenix Lion would.
