  Sleipnir would be their spirit animal

No where did I suggest this. What part of reference are you not understanding?

#+begin_quote
  "I survived" or "I almost died" is not a connection with death.
#+end_quote

Death shaped his early childhood. He lost his parents, he earned fame, he became a pawn in a war, etc. Without the attempt on his life, everything in his life would be different. Having a connection to death does not mean he's tethered to Death or the afterlife. It simply means that death is apart of what makes Harry, Harry. Then later in his story, yes, his connection can be taken a bit more literally.

  And that is the point exactly, that their spirit animals are gifted/drawn from their elemental background; pets/companions that are only something more because they're owned by an Avatar.
#+end_quote

Again, I never said anything to dispute this. We clearly agree on this. Water = Polarbear Dog because that's where it lives and that's where she's from. I also never added any mystic properties to anything. I think you are completely missing the point of my original comment. I thought it was a cool idea, because it /referenced/ a mythical creature. That does not mean they are the same being or that they are even related in any way.

  Which is the long way round of saying that if Harry is to have a spirit animal, it should be a common (by worldbuilding standards) animal that's owned by more people than just the Avatar.

What common riding animals are there in the Harry Potter series? Thestrals and hippogriffs are the only ones I can recall being ridden on. So, if we go by muggle standards, we get the answer of: a horse. Assuming that the OP wants to have a magical or unusual flair to that, my suggestion of a Spider Horse still stands.

Unless the setting takes place in the Avatar's world, in which case any suggestion works as long as the OP can explain it well enough.
