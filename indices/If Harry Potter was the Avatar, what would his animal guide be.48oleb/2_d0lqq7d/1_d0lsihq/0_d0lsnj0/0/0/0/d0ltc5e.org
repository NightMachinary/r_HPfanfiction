  Just because he has not physically seen death does not mean he doesn't have a connection. Being the first to survive the Killing Curse is something I would give more clout to.

My point being that a human so aligned with death that freaking /Sleipnir/ would be their spirit animal would have had no trouble interacting with creatures such as Thestrals.

Again, "I survived" or "I almost died" /is not a connection with death/. Any more than "I nearly drowned" connects you with/gives you power over water or "I was in a house fire" connects you with fire.

  Animal guides don't have to be aligned with an element

"Animal guides don't have to be aligned with an element, the ones we've seen just happen to be"

And that is the point exactly, that their spirit animals are gifted/drawn from their elemental background; pets/companions that are only something more because they're owned by an Avatar. Aang has an Air Bison because all the air nomads had one. Roku had a dragon because the fire nobility owned/rode dragons. Korra has a polar bear dog because polar bear dogs are a pet/work animal in the Water Tribes. They're not mystic, and making them mystical (well, more mystical than the Avatar world already is) and/or unique creatures is sort of missing the point imo.

Which is the long way round of saying that if Harry is to have a spirit animal, it should be a common (by worldbuilding standards) animal that's owned by more people than just the Avatar.
