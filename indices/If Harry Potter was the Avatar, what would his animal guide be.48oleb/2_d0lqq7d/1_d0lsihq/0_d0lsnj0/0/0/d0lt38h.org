Just because he has not physically seen death does not mean he doesn't have a connection. Being the first to survive the Killing Curse is something I would give more clout to.

Animal guides don't have to be aligned with an element, though three out of the four avatars shown with a companion (Aang, Kora, and Roku) all have a creature related to the elemental country they hailed from. There could even be an argument made for Wan's as well.

This is all silly though, because the Spider Horse does not need to be similar to Harry in such a way for them to bond. Horses in some cultures have been attached to both the elements earth and air, and there are plenty of magical variations of horses that could link them to whichever OP desires. Again, I simply liked the reference it made and could even be used as foreshadowing if you want to take it that far or you could not take it anywhere at all.
