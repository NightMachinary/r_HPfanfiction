Harry should have died as a baby. He only survives the killing curse because of his mother's sacrifice, causing the near death of Voldemort. I think this is plenty enough reason to say that he has a connection with death.

Edit to add: I was also not connecting anything to nature with my suggestion. I said a Spider Horse references a myth, not embodies it.
