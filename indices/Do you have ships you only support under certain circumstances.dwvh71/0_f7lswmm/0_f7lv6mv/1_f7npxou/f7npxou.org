The "6 years" bit is a bit much - not only was Draco a minor for most of that time, being a bully/racist in secondary school is bad, but not something that ought to ruin you for life. Particularly with the way he was raised, really.

That really means his actions in the earlier books aren't a huge deal in the postwar aspect, imo. It's only the last 2ish books that have the actual real problems. And we don't really know how he acted after the war - he could have collaborated in a purge of death eaters, spilled the beans on everything he knew, claimed he was being forced into it, etc.

As for redemption afterwards, it really wouldn't be hard to pull off. The writer just needs to focus on the right aspects and how to frame things - if you've read the stormlight archives, Dalinar is a great example of how what a character did in the past doesn't have to inform the reader's opinion
