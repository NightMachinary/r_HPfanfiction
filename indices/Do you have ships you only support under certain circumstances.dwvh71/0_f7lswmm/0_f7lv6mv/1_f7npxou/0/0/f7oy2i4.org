I believe that in canon, the battle of Hogwarts takes place when Harry/Malfoy are still underage (close to turning 18). We don't treat minors the same way as we do adults, particularly if they've been indoctrinated.

Like I said, Dracos early years are irrelevant. You can make the argument about the last 1-3 books, sure, but starting year 1 is ridiculous imo. You don't use someone's jerkishness as a 12 year old to justify life in prison/execution. Stick to the later aspects if you want to make Draco iredeemable, though I don't see the appeal of holding to that view in fanfiction
