Don't know why you were downvoted when you're speaking the truth. Draco was a villain and I don't understand why so many people overlook his actions. The same goes for Bellatrix really. I can understand if some authors are attracted to the actors which played them, but their characters were despicable. Pairing them in any sort of consensual scenario with the good guys is a no-no for me. There are some nice fics with time travel and a young Bella, though.
