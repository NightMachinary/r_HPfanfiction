Draco was a more comic relief villain in the early books - the rich bully that exists for Harry to outdo and humiliate. He's not likeable, but he's not a monster - and it's very easy to see he's just been raised that way.

In later books, he does some despicable things. But the writing makes his hesitation and apparent coercion very easy to see, making the reader more sympathetic to Draco. And, at least for me, books 5-7 inform my view of characters and canon much less than 1-4 emotionally
