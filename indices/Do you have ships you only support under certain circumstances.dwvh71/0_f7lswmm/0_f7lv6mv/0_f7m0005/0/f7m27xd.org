But Harry and Hermione would still remember her killing Sirius, even if she hasn't technically done it yet. Same for her torturing Hermione. On an intellectual basis, you might be able to separate past Bellatrix from that, but not in your heart.

Actually, that's the issue with Dramione and Drarry as well.
