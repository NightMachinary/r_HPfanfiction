  and Draco's actions postwar must be convincing enough for me

I don't think that there is much for him to do where he could redeem himself after the war. Unless you make up a new villain where he leads the resistance, I don't see many avenues where he could do enough to make up for 6 years of blatant racism, sadism (eg Hagrid and Buckbeak) and outright war crimes. Well, unless you believe in punitive justice and consider him spending a few decades behind bars (or a few years in canon Azkaban) sufficient to pay for his mistakes.

The two big issues with Draco redemptions are that you either redeem him early enough so that he can have an impact on the war (which would not be in line with his character until way too late) or you redeem him in a fashion which would make him almost unrecognisable compared to canon. The one way I can see Dramione happen would be the second option, where you have him think differently after the first book and have a gradual change of heart over the next few books. But the result would be nothing like his canon self. And that would not please his fans.

That's the issue with Bellatrix in fanfics as well. I know that I am somewhat infamous for advocating the possibility of shipping her with Harry or Hermione, but I can only see it happen in ONE specific way which most of the Bellatrix/Bellamione fans do not want to see. Namely, Bellatrix defecting before the DoM showdown (or preventing it in some other way) as that would be the only way to avoid the complications of Sirius' death and her torturing Hermione. Because that is one big oof I don't think time travel can fix.

But the Bellamione crowd is really into that dynamic, and the only fic I can think of which manages the flood under the bridge is "Passageways", because it has Harry travel into the 70s at the start of his 5th year.
