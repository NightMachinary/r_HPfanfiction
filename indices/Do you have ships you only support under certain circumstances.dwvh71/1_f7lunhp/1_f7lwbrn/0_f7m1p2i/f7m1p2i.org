The good guys didn't raise the Hood - she was raised by a spell a head of the DoM had cast in the 19th century, after he heard a prophecy he didn't quite get. And yes, the Hood alone wouldn't have ben a match for the Bismarck. So, the good guys worked hard on understanding how to raise such ships - while the Bismarck raised the Kriegsmarine.

The Iowa-class ships would have been useless against the Bismarck here - they never sank so couldn't have been raised as shipgirls, and they would have had a very hard time hitting a man-sized target moving at 30 knots with their main guns - the good guys had the RN test that against the Hood.
