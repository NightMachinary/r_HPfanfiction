I ship Sirius and Hermione IF she goes back in time to the Marauders era.

I ship Malfoy and Hermione IF he significantly redeems himself or IF she's kinda evil (a la The Green Girl).

But honestly I'll read most ships if they're not too shippy or too crazy OOC. (and sometimes even then if the premise sucks me in...)
