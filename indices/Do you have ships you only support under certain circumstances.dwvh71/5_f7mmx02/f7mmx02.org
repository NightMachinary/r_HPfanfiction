There's a large assortment of DE ships that I don't care for no matter what, because I don't care for the Death Eater at all in question. The rest are conditional -- Severus (I prefer to avoid 1978-1981 becase at this point he's firmly a Death Eater with nothing redeeming about him), Draco (if removed from Lucius' influence OR several years post-war) and Bellatrix (during the period she's still at school and presumably not yet firmly a mad Voldemort supporter).

Snily is my personal favorite ship, but I prefer to avoid the 1978-1981 and post-Halloween fics -- I've probably read them all anyway due to how few longer fics with the ship actually exist, but with the exception of Puzzle, I wouldn't have missed anything if I had skipped them -- the fact that he was a fully fledged Death Eater for most of the recent period makes me uncomfortable with the setting, especially since he gave the Prophecy. However, I don't mind post-war (and post-school!) SSHG, or the occasional SSOC outside the 1978-1981 period. In fact, I avoid SS-centric fics within the 1978-1981 period alltogether, ship or not (apart from AUs where he never joined the Death Eaters), because I detest reading about the inevitable angst that would arise for this period, nor do I care for reading fics from a true DE's point of view.

I don't read Drarry because I don't read slash, but in the rare case where I decide to read Dramione, I much prefer post-war years later when he has presumably redeemed himself offscreen. Still, it's not a ship I like particurly much, but unlike basically every other DE ship, not one I avoid unconditionally. I don't read any other Draco ship.

There's the occasional Harry/Bellatrix fic I see recommended, the only fics of this ship that I don't outright ignore are those where she's still in school and presumably sane. I did like Delenda Est, for example.
