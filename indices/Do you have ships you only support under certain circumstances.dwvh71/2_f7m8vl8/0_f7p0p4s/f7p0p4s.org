Aside from the fact that he is a poster child for the phrases "fair weather friend" and "inferiority complex", he and that He and Hermione had several arguments bad enough that i just can't see this ending up in either one of the nastiest divorces i can imagine, someone ending up dead or in prison or them sleeping in seperate bedrooms and exchanging maybe 45 words a day with eachother for the next however many years..

(And Hermione, for good measure, is annoyingly selfassured that she knows best, damn the opinions of anyone else, and is visious when pissed off..)
