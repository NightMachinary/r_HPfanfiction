there was a ton of wank when Cassandra Claire was revealed to have plagiarized passages in her Drarry fanfiction from a published novel. There are some folks who refuse to buy her published work now because they don't want to support plagiarism (even though she didn't financially profit from the plagiarism because... IT WAS FAN FICTION). Also because she was apparently(?) a huge jerk about it. Look it up on fandom wank on livejournal if you want details, it was before my time.

The LOTR convention fraudster who moved to the HP fandom (I think they wrote Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness) also gets hate for defrauding people.

Edit: I reread the OP and realized this was about getting flames for writing, not genuinely controversial authors- sorry! And yes, OP, it's very common.
