I had some of those once. It seemed like their main issue was with the sort of vampires in my story. Maybe they didn't sparkle enough or some shit...

I'm not sure what those cringey bastards wanted as English was certainly not their forte, but I deleted most of them and moved on. I've been on 4chan for too long to feel personally attacked by stuff like that.
