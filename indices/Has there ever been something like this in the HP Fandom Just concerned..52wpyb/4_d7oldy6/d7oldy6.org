Well, back in the early-to-mid-2000s, someone going by the name of "msscribe" engineered dozens of sockpuppet accounts, and all that to get within the "inner circle" of the fandom, the "BNFs" (Big Name Fans) who were all revolving around Cassandra Claire (an equally questionable person).

Read about msscribe and Cassandra Clare [[http://web.archive.org/web/20130203000224/http://www.journalfen.net/users/charlottelennox/784.html][here]] and [[http://www.webcitation.org/6jcCAA6Fo][here]]. They're long reads, but worth it.
