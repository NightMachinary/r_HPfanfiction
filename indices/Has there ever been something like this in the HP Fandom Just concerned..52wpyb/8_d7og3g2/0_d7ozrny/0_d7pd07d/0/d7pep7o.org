Lmao, I got loads of hate for writing a Harry/OC... except that it wasn't Harry/OC. It was pretty explicitly Harry/Ginny. I made a point in the writing several times to make it clear that neither Harry nor the OC were attracted to each other. But I guess some people just didn't like Harry being friendly to a girl that wasn't Ginny or Hermione, so felt happy to call me a bitch in PMs.
