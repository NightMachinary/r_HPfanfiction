And there are some ships that just get a lot of screaming hate. Like you'll see a bunch of reviews that say "Dramione is absolutely disgusting so why would you write this, you should die"

And it's like, why are you here? Stay in your lane. Like another author I follow keeps getting hateful messages for writing Harry/Pansy fic. It's cruel. Just stop, people- focus on what you like and ignore things you hate.
