I know a couple of authors who had stories get popular and got a ton of hate. Particularly a dramione story that got popular had people coming out of the woodwork to be absolutely disgusting. And so that author prefers not to write dramione (even though they wrote it very well) because you just get too much attention and the negative can be overwhelming.
