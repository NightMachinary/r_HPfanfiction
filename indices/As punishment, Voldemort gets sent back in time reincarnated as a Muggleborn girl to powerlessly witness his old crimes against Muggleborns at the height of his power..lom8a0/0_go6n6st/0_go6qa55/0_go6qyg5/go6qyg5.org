Well, at some point she'd have to want Harry to survive and defeat Voldemort if she wants Ron, so hmm around 4th year I guess she'd actually want Harry to succeed?

Actually, what you've just proposed might work for a totally different story prompt.

One fic where Voldemort as Hermione wants to destroy Harry until she falls for Ron and realizes Harry has to defeat Voldemort to make that happen and one fic where Hermione is just trying to hinder and defeat Harry at every turn but is woefully unsuccessful.
