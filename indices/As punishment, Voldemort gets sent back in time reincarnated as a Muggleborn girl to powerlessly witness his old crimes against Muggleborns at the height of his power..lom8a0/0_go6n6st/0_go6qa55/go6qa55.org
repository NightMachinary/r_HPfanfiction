Just imagine if all Hermione's plans were in fact thwarted plots to kill Harry which get misinterpreted as good intentions. She deliberately set Snape on fire when he was trying to counterjinx Harry's broom and kept convincing Harry to practice Occlumency in his fifth year just so that the same mistake of Harry going to the DoM and ruining everything is not repeated.
