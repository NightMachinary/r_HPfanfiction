I have issues with that fic, but less about Hermione and more about it trying to skirt the boundary of serious and playful.

Otherwise, it does quite a few interesting things.

You aren't the only one. I'm neutral towards canon Hermione, but fanon Hermione just bothers me. There's literally no middle ground.
