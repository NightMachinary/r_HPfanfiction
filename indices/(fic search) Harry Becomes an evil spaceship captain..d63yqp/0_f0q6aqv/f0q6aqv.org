A full version is available on the 'Webnovel' app. Beware though, it's a shitty platform prone to crashing and is literally owned by a ludicrously capitalist chinease company who keep all translated stories on a pay wall beyond the first half. I know what your thinking 'but if they translate them, isn't it OK to charge for it?' except the translates make a pittance, and most of the translations were stolen from fan translation site like wuxia World.

I guess what I'm saying is, delete the app after your done with it, it's trash.
