Depends on what exactly you mean by making it work for him: if you mean let him have an emotionally healthy childhood pre-Hogwarts, that's mostly not gonna happen (even if he's able to get care and attention from other adults, he's still going home to a pair of willfully negligent abusers whom he /knows/ to be capable of providing far better care than they are), but if you mean that he gets through a shitty childhood relatively unscathed, then I think canon actually does a pretty good job with that. He's definitely unrealistically well adjusted, but his distrust and disdain of and for authority figures and general self-reliance (the only adult he asks for help without trying to manipulate them for the first two books is Hagrid, and the /one time/ he goes to McGonagall, he describes it as "throwing caution to the wind") are both very much indicative of an emotionally neglectful upbringing.
