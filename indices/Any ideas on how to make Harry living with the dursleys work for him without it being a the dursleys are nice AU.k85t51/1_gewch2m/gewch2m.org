It's not hard to take away the Durselys' worst abuse (the cupboard particularly), while still keeping them emotionally distant and making Dudley clearly the favorite child. Obviously that's not a great situation for Harry, but not to the point where someone would want to call CPS (or whatever the British version is) on them.

Or, if you're asking for what Harry could choose to do after starting Hogwarts in order to get a better living situation, them the best option is probably to just never be seen. Either stay in his room or out of the house all day, keep all magic paraphernalia inside his room, and never let anyone magical come visit.

Or he could try talking to the Durselys about how backwards and awful the magical world is, and how he appreciates the normal world much more. As long as he doesn't go too far and convince them that he wants to be pulled out of Hogwarts, they might be able to bond over how terrible Malfoy, Fudge, etc. are.
