I don't think there is really a good way to make abusers stop being abusive without writing it out of them. Whatever Harry would have tried, they wouldn't have liked him for it. In the books he tried to be as silent and obedient as possible and they still belittled and found fault with him- because those faults don't exist, even if he was acting as perfectly as possible, they would still see him as faulty.

I've read fics where Harry gets odd jobs because they keep him out of the house, which suits the Dursleys. Usually Dudley bullies the money out of him though, and he has less time for chores. I wouldn't call that a good way of him avoiding their wrath.
