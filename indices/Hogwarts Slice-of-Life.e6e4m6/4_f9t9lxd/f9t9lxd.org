It's not exactly what you want, and holy baloney is the timeline screwed in order for all the pop-culture references to make sense but...

Early [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10051784/1/Uchiha-of-Ravenclaw][Uchiha of Ravenclaw]] and whenever Harry is not around in this fic is very Slice of Life.

Femslashy though... and suffers from the stations of canon on the Harry Potter side of things. There's also the Naruto side during summer breaks that breaks away from the Slice of Life way of things into an action adventure about a teenage mercenary, which is a more fancy way of saying Naruto Ninja in English. It's also a crossover.
