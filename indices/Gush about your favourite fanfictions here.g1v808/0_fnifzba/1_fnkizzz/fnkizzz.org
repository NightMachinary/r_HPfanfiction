Saw the title of this post and was like "heck yes, can't wait to gush about floreatcastellum."

Totally unsurprised this is the top comment. She's such a fantastic writer. I've been in such fanfic slump after reading all her stuff, because nothing else can quite compare.

She's also active on reddit! [[/u/FloreatCastellum][u/FloreatCastellum]]
