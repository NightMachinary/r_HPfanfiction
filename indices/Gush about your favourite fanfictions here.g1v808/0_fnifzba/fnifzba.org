FloreatCastellum's novels get recommended a lot (and they should).

But her oneshots on AO3 and her Tumblr don't get as many shout-outs and are lovely. She writes a wonderful Harry through so many different parts of his life. She does such a great job weaving the sadness of his childhood with the trauma of his school years with his adult years as part of a big, loving, - but a little broken - family. You totally get the strength of the his "power the dark lord knows not". So many authors struggle with balancing his resilience and strength with vulnerability. She does it so well. She gives him a very believable happily ever after without ignoring what he's been through.
