Absolutely agree, she is a great writer! If you like the Hinny pairing, gryffindormischief has some great one shots and multi chaps. For me, fave stories would be frombluetored's It's TeaTime series, recc'd often on the Hinny discord group. And Annerb's brilliant Changeling and Armistice series. Shout out to jenorama and thedistantdusk for their stories too. So many more but these are my go to stories I read over and over
