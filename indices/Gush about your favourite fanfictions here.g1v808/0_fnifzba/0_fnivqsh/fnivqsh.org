Thank you for reccing this writer, and linking her tumblr vignettes as well as her works on AO3! I read several of the ficlets and I enjoyed them. You're correct that the Harry she writes is completely IC, which I think is difficult to achieve. I am looking forward to going down the floreatcastellum rabbit hole later this evening!! I love the fact that Harry's early childhood is explored; it's not easy to write very young children properly, is it? I can't wait to delve into this fanfic with a cup of hot cocoa, in my reading nest!
