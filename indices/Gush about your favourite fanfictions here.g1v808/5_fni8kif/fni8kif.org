linkffn(13266686) - Not Dumbledore

Generally, I stay away from both one-shots and post-Voldemort fics. I like longer fics, 150k+ kinda long, but this is one of the best I've read. The characterization, the war-veteran Harry and Ron's maturity... Absolutely fantastic.

linkffn(12511998) - Wind Shear

The best time-travel to Marauder's Era, jaded, powerful Harry fic I've read. The banter, duels, serious conversations are very well done. And it's the only one I know which 'redeems' Bellatrix while keeping her in character. She keeps her insanity and love for fight, and takes time to get out of her disdain for muggles.

linkffn(13108396) - For Lack of a Bezoar

One of the best Dark-but-not-evil Harry stories. Hits right where it hurts. If you read nothing else from this list, read this. It packs a whole lot of feels in less than 40k words. Gold.
