I will never stop recommending linkffn(ignite by slide). I actually prefer next-gen because I can't deal with much OOC (depsite all of JKRs flaws). The second book of the trilogy literally made me weak--I don't remember the last time I had such a visceral reaction to a book, fanfic or otherwise. Beautifully fleshed out, imperfect characters, a detailed plot, and humor to boot.

AND...there's a quarantine! how festive!

Also if anyone has any novel-length Scorose recs, I'm all ears
