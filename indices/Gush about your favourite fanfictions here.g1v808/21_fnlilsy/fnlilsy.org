Oh I get to gush about my favs! I love, love, love Against the moon. When I read it, it feels like I'm in the story with the characters.Another thing is that the author definitely knows what she's writing about. There are a few very powerful passages I found relatable.Stoplightdelight does know how a person in Remus's position might feel. She also has included some erm traditionally feminine women. Her Charlotte White is my absolute favourite. I even stopped reading the Silkworm because that fanfic was far more interesting than Rowlling's novel lol. I don't need Rowling to write a prequel, I only want stoplight to finish her fic. I also love Fernwithy's shifts and Shades. I've read quite a few stories about Remus's mission with the werewolves, and none of them was as interesting as Shades. I simply didn't care what happened to Remus or anyone else in those fics. But fern's characters really made me care about them. I was hoping them to succeed and was angry when a bad guy targeted them. And no one else showed Remus's teaching talent better than Fern. I even liked tonks in that story which has never happened before. It was a romance based on friendship, not just superficial attraction. I also loved Darsynia's Remus Hermione story the longest distance. I loved it because for the first time in the history of fics I read, someone told that Remus needs to have someone in his corner. That was no focus on showing a mistreated lady who is desperately in love. And Remus and Herione sort have their roles reversed, with Remus being the one who provides support. I have never seen this done but have always wanted to read something like that.
