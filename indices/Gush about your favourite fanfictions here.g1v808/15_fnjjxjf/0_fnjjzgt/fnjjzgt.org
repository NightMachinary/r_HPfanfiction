  When Harry received his 1st ever letter, he never expected for Aunt Petunia to tell him (with pinched lips) that he would get Dudley's 2nd bedroom, or inform him about other “freaks”, or reveal that his parents hadn't actually died in a car crash, or to bring him to a dingy-looking pub and ask the owner to ‘open the back for her nephew' while looking ill and refusing to enter ‘Diagon Alley' herself, instead thrusting two £50 notes in his hands, telling him 'their' bank would be able to change it for 'freak money', or for her to bring him to King's Cross on September 1st before snapping that, no, she didn't remember how to get onto the ‘ridiculous platform' so he best wait for other ‘freaks' to come show him.But Harry especially never expected the magical castle, with plans of her own (yes, Hogwarts is apparently a 'she') for those who came within her walls.Or the one where, after being introduced to the magic by a more perceptive Petunia (pointing out to Vernon that they would come if Harry wasn't sent to Hogwarts, so might as well get it over with before 'they' thought on actually coming to Privet Drive), Harry transported 20 years back in time for his 1st year at Hogwarts.
