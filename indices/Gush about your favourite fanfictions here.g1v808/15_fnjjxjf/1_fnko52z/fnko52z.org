I am all into this premise. Thanks!

Ok. Finished what's done. Looks like the author is actively working on it, as there's updates from only a short time back. Author also goes through and makes edits to previously uploaded stuff, which I respect. If a later time you think something could be better worded, by all means do so.

- has a minor trope-y thing, but it's minor. Hopefully you can look past that annoyance, because it's well researched and written overall.

- author did a lot of background work, and mentions their source material, or their thinking behind why something was written as it was.

- author does sometimes borrow text from the books, but it's so seamless that you hardly notice it, and you can see why they did so.

- interesting use of the time travel thing. Not at all how I expected originally. I generally dislike time travel stories in general, but this one isn't your typical use of the trope, so I'm not mad at it.

- author is pretty even handed with the characters; not all of X is going to be good or bad. People are complex and have multiple parts of their selves. This, I believe, is their strongest part.

- my one gripe is that there is a /lot/ of internal monologue. I'm not exaggerating here. Sometimes it carries on for ages. For me, who prefers a dialogue driven story, it was irritating enough that I found myself skipping a lot of it. Generally, the reason I love a good editor is that they'll call these issues out, and push you to get that 3 paragraph musing down to a few words that do the same job.

Honestly, I can generally infer what the character is thinking by their actions. I don't like long rumination in someone's brain. If you like that sort of thing though, you should be fine.
