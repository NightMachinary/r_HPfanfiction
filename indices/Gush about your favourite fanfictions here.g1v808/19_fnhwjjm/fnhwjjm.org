So I recently listened to the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Eneasz Brodski brought the work to life in a way that most audiobooks fail to do, mainly with having the characters voiced by various people.

Now the story itself has a lot of the regular tropes but done exceedingly well. Harry is smart and powerful. Except he's annoying as fuck during parts and does stupid things because as smart and powerful as he is, he is still 11.

Manipulative dumbledore, complex asshole snape, competent Voldemort.

While there are many pitfalls in the story and not much payoff until the end I don't think I can read another story about manipulative dumbledore or powerful Harry as I don't think they will compare.
