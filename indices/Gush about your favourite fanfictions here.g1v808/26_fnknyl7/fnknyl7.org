My favourite is 'Hold my hand' by /the_drarry_life/ on Wattpad. Its about a potions experiment that causes Harry and Draco to be connected by the hands for 10 weeks unless they consunmate the bond. Its amazing, I've read it at least 6 times and you can't even be bored reading it because the commentators are FRICKING hilarious.
