Okey so this one fic I read has Harry being reborn as Reghar Targaryen's younger brother. Here Harry and him are goals+ BROTP™ ✔️ and the fic is hilarious. Also Sirius Black is reborn as a younger stark brother.

Harry, now known as Jaherys along with Sirius and Tyrion form the best and most awesome squad.

Harry : (not in this order) Fixes the magic that went wrong in Old Valeria. Campaigns to abolish slavery. Creates a new kingdom that's a sister house. BRINGS BACK THE DRAGONS AND RIDES BELERION. 10/10

((The author kind of wrote themselves into a tiny corner because of the paring (Harry and Kal drogo) because that's meh. ))BUT the fic was awesome and hilarious in every other way especially the BROTP b/w Harry and his brother.

I've forgotten the fics name if anyone remembers please post it below.
