[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin]] (976k. in progress). Beautifully written with Slytherin!Harry and his twin brother. Read it. I think that this is my all time fav HP fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629?view_full_work=true][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] (184k. Complete). Harry is good at potions. Loads of mentor!snape. There are some really funny bits, not very angst-y. It's not as popular as it deserves to be so pls go read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10487644/1/Courage-and-Cunning][Courage and Cunning]] (523k. Abandoned?). Where Harry Potter is actually Salazar Slytherin (he's not evil!) and Salazar is protecting the Potters cuz Dumbledore is an idiot. Go read it!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13225966/1/Defence-Professor-Wohl][Defense Professor Wohl]] (54k. Complete). Grindelwald becomes a professor. The late-middle bit is a little sad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] (187k. Complete). Super cool fic. With bamf!Harry and oblivious!Harry. He travels the world under the name Mr. Black and accidentally becomes the most dangerous man on the planet. He eventually lives up to it! It's really funny so go read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22405891?view_full_work=true][The immortal and the revenant]] (Merlin crossover. 149k. Will be complete in 2 days). Awesome fic. Merlin (from the TV show) helps the Order of the Phoenix. It's probably better if you've watched Merlin b4 reading this. It's a cool TV show. I had a crush on Morgana. Merlin and Arthur were super gay but Arthur got with Gwen so that was annoying. But Gwen is great so it's okay-ish. But the show is great, go watch it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/473335?view_full_work=true][Twist of Fate]] (Drarry. 302k. Complete). One of the best Draco/Harry fics I have ever read. It's beautifully written and has amazing characterization. They have a completely secret relationship- except for Cedric, he knows(then he dies)- and then later in the book Draco has to obliviate Harry and after that point I spent so much time crying. Anyway, read this pls.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417?view_full_work=true][Survival is a talent]] (Drarry. 338k+. In progress) Super cute soulmate fic. Harry and Draco find out they're soulmates and become friends. They eventually tell their respective friends and they all become a big secret-ish friend group. Go read it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010?view_full_work=true][All the young dudes]] (527k. Complete) Marauder-era. About the marauders as they go through Hogwarts. It fits canon really well. It's an amazing fic!! I read it for the first time as it was being posted and I'm reading it again and I still love it! :)

That's all I can think of at the moment. Go read all these fics! And maybe watch Merlin as well.
