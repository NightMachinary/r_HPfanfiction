The Arithmancer and it's sequels is my favourite, by far. I like that it doesn't do the fanfiction weirdness that permeates this community, and that it just reads as a story instead of either a powerwank, a mugglewank, a contrived "romance", or anything of the sort. It's just a story that tells a story and doesn't drag on and on and on with meaningless garbage nobody wants to read, or create insanely uncomfortable situations to read.
