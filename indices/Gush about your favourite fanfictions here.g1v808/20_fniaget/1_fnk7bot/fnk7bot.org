I really liked The Accidental Animagus and I wanted to like The Arithmancer but I just found the beginning too slow and lost interest. I don't understand why Hermione is so obsessed with making a map of the school and all her attempts to do it have just bored me. Does the story pick up after she finds the House Elves (where I stopped)?
