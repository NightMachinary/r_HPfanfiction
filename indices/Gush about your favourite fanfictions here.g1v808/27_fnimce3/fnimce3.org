[[http://www.hpmor.com][Methods of Rationality]] is a classic. There are flaws, but people who dislike the story for whatever reason often blow them out of proportion and act like they make it an unreadable mess. In reality, there are a few parts that might make you cringe, a lot more that are pretty hilarious, and some crowning moments of awesome.

Now, I also want to talk about [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Carnivorous_Muffin/profile][The Carnivorous Muffin]] who makes works of absurdist art. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is where it all starts, and it is well worth the read. Muffin's works generally feature a female Harry who isn't just the Master of Death, but is Death itself masquerading in a mortal shell. I highly recommend this as well as Muffin's crossover fics with Pokémon (which has a surprisingly insightful view of the role Pokémon play), Star Wars, (with an enemy on Death's level), Lord of the Rings (exploring the character growth of both Lily and the One Ring), and Naruto (beware the clones).
