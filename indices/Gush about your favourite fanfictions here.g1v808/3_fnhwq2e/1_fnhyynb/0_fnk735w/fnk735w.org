DSo much to love, but for me, its the idea of the Parlour girls that I love, and Tobias and Smita. Ginny is awesome in this fic and the sequels and, looking ahead, it will be a great reasoning for the name Albus Severus. Annerb's Gone Is Any Trace of You is one of my fave memory loss trope stories too.
