Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) happens to be one of my favorites. It is Harry/Hermione and has a bittersweet yet hopeful ending. Beautiful story.

There is also linkffn(Vox Corporis) which is an AU post-GoF story where Harry spends the summer with the Grangers and Harry and Hermione learn to be animagi by themselves.
