[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins]] by Jeconais.

Its my favourite Harry Potter Fanfic, and I've been reading them for almost 2 decades.

Harry Potter is raised by the Addams family, and its dark, funny, clever, and extremely well written.

I love how they write Snape, Harry and Wednesday are creepy and amazing, and the whole thing is really well done.

I've re-read it a bunch of times over the last couple of years.

Read it, you won't regret it.
