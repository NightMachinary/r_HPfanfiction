The Best Revenge, On the Way to Greatness and The Accidental Animagus are some of my favourites.

The Best Revenge does mentor Snape so well. He's still sarcastic, but he learns to look past Harry being James' son and see him as his own person. I also love how Harry has many friend circles.

On the Way to Greatness has spoiled me for Slytherin Harry. I dislike fics that'll have him magically become Draco's BFF or have Snape suddenly like him just because he's in Slytherin. I think the relationships and characterization are very believable.

The Accidental Animagus has Harry use his Animagus ability in various scenarios in a way that actually drives forward the story. There are some very clever ideas that make certain plot elements possible and I like the OCs and magical systems that White Squirrel invents.

I also enjoy Petrification Proliferation by the same writer. For Want of a Nail fics have always intrigued me and this one does the whole idea of adults being actually responsible and dutiful (I know, shocking right?) in the HP world so well.
