I'll probably get some downvotes/whaargarbl for this, but it's still one of my all-time favorites: linkffn(Harry Crow)

On the minus side, it does rely a bit on Dumbledore-bashing and maybe a tiny bit of Ron-bashing (though Ron is mostly a non-entity in the fic), has an oh-so-awesome Harry, and basically has Harry and Hermione start falling in love at eleven.

On the plus side, it does an amazing job of making the characters feel like people rather than the ambulatory plot devices JKR wrote, giving more depth and growth to more characters in one novel-length fic than Rowling managed in seven novels. Characters act in a way that fits for them instead of whatever happens to be needed to drive the desired plot. Both the heroes and the villains get a substantial competence upgrade, with Voldemort feeling more threatening despite ending up in a much worse situation than canon. Victories feel earned rather than contrived, coming about thanks to training, preparation, and smart decisions rather than obscure wandlore and other deus-ex-machina or to being marginally less incompetent than the bad guys. It also drove emotional investment really well, to the point where it actually managed to get my heart pounding on a couple of occasions due to the tension - not a lot of written works manage that.
