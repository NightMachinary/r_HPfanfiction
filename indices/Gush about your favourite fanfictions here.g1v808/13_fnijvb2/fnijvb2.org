[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929?view_adult=true][Debt of Time]] is one of the best fanfiction ever written and I stand by my words. I understand that the pairings and the lenght are big reasons why people don't read it, but let me tell you something, once i started reading it i just couldnt stop. it's crazy how insanely well written and captivating it is, i must have cried at least 4 times (that's a difficult thing to achieve tbh), it hurt in the best "worst" way possible. Also the fact that i read this fic in a moment of my life that was so so bad, that it was a much needed scape, then i read it one more time in chronological order and it still hit just as hard. I will always have a special place in my heart for this story. And in my opinion it's the one story everyone should read.

There's also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]] it's a story i had so much fun reading, really can't recommend it enough... Simply one of the best Hermione centric fics out there.
