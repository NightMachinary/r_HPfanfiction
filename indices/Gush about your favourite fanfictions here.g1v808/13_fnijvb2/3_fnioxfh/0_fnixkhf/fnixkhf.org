I understand. But that's how time travel works in HP universe, kind of a loop, but if you change the past it changes the future. The author did an amazing job working JKR's version of time travel. There's a bunch of moments that we get frustrated that she doesnt change things too, but the basic law is that if she changes something in the past, the future as she knows will change too and she doesn't want that because that could end badly.
