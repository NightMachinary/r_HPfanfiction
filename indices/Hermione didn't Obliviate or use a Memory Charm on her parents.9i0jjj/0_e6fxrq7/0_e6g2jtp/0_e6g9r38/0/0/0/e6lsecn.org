Oh, i totally agree with you. Yes, they have many flaws of the adapted stuff. But those who are adapted correctly and "show more", than there is in the Books, you can consider them as extensions....or you dont consider it. Its your Choice.

Still, despite what the HP wikia might tell, i see the replacement and erasing Charm as one and the same memory Charm. Because it sound like a later extension of Rowling to explain things. Here i have to say: if she has "forgot" to mention so many things, then reewrite the Books again and insert them there. Otherwise she can make something out of thin air.
