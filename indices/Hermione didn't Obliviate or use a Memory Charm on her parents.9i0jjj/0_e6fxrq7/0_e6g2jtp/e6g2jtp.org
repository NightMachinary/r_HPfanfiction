didnt know, there are 2 types of memory charms. Since Hermione, Lockheart and this Ministry Guy at the Quidditch Cup used "Obliviate", i really think, its the same spell, BUT its full usage isnt reached, when simply manipulate a Memory. After all, erase a Memory is easier than replace/maniplulate it.
