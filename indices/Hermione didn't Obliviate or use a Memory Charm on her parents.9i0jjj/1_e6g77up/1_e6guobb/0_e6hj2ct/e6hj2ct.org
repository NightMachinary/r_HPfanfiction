I dislike it. Less horrifying violation of consent.

For me this is one of the most important moments in Hermione's character development - it shows how thoroughly she has adopted wizarding cultural norms. It goes well with her statement in GoF that technology is a "replacement for magic". Like other wizards, Hermione has come to view magic as natural and its absence as a disability, with Muggles unable to properly take care of themselves or make their own decisions.
