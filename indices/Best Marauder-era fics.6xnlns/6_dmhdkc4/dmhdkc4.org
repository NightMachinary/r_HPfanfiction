[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want To Make A Memory?]] - Canon relationships. Long and complete. Covers all 7 years at Hogwarts and beyond.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486/chapters/2235718][the lost generation]] - Canon compliant Remus/Sirius and James/Lily, but focuses on platonic relationships. Incomplete, but still updating. Haven't caught up with this one/read it in a while, but I think it covers all 7 years at Hogwarts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1657883/chapters/3517166][Strays]] - AU, with Remus/Sirius. Complete. Covers the time after Hogwarts, with the premise that Remus did not attend Hogwarts and meets Sirius + friends in the Order.
