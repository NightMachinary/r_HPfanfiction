It's basically an OP Harry fic where he outsmarts/overpowers everyone. If you're not a fan of that, then no. If you're in it for the romance, no. If you don't like the beginning chapters, then no. It was started by 2 people and one of them left early on and, IMO, it showed. It won't get any better than beginning.
