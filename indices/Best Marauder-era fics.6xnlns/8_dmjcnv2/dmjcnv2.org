linkffn(9757451) Three Turns is a Hermione and Harry time travel to Mauraders Area, but it's complete with a plot. I also feel that it gets the feel of the Mauraders and makes them the stupid, funny teenagers they were and not the super brooding, amazing at magic type you see a lot. It's really lighthearted with a hint of seriousness when it comes to Voldemort.
