My personal favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] - V. Long, 6-7th Year, Excellent characterisation, - Unfortunately WiP (or abandoned).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2429621/1/I-ll-Take-it-Shaken-Not-Stirred][I'll Take it Shaken Not Stirred]] - Long, 7th Year, Excellent characterisation (Same Auther as TLAT), - Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10939132/1/An-Unexpected-Attraction][An Unexpected Attraction]] - V. Long, 7th Year & Beyond, Multi Character POV, kinda full of Drama, but I like it - WIP, with regular updates.
