I can't see Ron going out of his way to befriend Hermione in that scenario - in canon they're "fire-forged friends", who only become friends because of shared experience of danger.

However, the dynamic for Ron within Slytherin could lead to him (covertly) standing up more for his family's muggle-friendly attitudes because he'd be confronted much more frequently with the anti-muggle hostility of the other Slytherins.
