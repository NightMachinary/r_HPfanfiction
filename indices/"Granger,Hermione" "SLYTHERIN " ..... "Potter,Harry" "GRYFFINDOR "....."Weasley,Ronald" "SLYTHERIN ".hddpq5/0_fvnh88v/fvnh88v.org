Yes, the canon Slytherins in Harry and Hermione's year are not going to take very well to having a muggleborn in the house.

But if we take just a second to think there might be Slytherins who fall into the Slughorn mould, or even the early years Tom Riddle mould, then I could see Hermione's talent being recognised early on by older students who would no doubt want to have that particular resource available to them in the future, so would offer a measure of protection.

And Hermione would do quite well with the attention of older Slytherins, and would use all the cunning that canon shows us she has to make a success of it.

There is already precedent for this - Snape is implied to have been taken under the wing of Malfoy and some other older students, despite not being a pureblood, because his talent (particularly with hexes and jinxes) was recognised.

She would not become friends with Harry though - even if she identified him as a valuable asset because of the BWL fiasco, I don't think Harry would have the necessary forcefulness to overcome the house rivalry until much later (the first non-Gryffindor friend he has outside of classmates and Quidditch opponents is in his fifth year).
