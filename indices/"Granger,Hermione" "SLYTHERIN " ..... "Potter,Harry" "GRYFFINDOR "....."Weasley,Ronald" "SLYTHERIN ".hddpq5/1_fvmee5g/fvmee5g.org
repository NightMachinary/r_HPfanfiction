Long story short,

- Hermione gives Ron the structure, the planning, and the tutelage that he needs to achieve his ambition to surpass his brothers.
- Ron helps Hermione stay sane and keeps her from becoming any more fem!Moody or Dark Lady Granger than she has to.
- Together, they take the wizarding world by storm. It is quite possible that Ron becomes the youngest Minister for Magic in history, and Hermione is what happens to anyone who stands in their way.
