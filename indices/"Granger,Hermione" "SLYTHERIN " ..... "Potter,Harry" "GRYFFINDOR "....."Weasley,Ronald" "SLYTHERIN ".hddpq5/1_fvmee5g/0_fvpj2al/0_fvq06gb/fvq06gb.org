Well, that, or the Mirror of Erised works as intended, trapping Quirrelmort and enabling Dumbledore to contain Voldemort's shadow, delaying his return indefinitely.

Or, Voldemort escapes, but he has no idea that Harry's sacrificial protection can hurt him, so he gets a nasty surprise next time he goes after him, knocking him out for /another/ 3 years.

He may even come back just as Hermione and Ron are executing their plan to take over the country, and wouldn't that be fun?

Or, heck, something else happens, and it's Hermione and/or Ron there with Quirrlemort, but either of them would love to use the Philosopher's Stone used (damn Slytherins!), so they aren't any better at getting it out than Quirrelmort was. But, the prior year in Slytherin has left them [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared][crazy-prepared]] and they actually manage to surprise him and take him out.
