This is conflating their characters with the information that we have about their characters. They have well-defined underlying personalities, values, goals, strengths, and weaknesses, almost all acquired prior to meeting Harry. Now, due to Harry being the sole point-of-view character, /we/ are forced to learn about them only through their interactions with him or in his presence, but that's our problem.

To say that they are empty cutouts without Harry to revolve around is like saying that you didn't exist until I read your post.
