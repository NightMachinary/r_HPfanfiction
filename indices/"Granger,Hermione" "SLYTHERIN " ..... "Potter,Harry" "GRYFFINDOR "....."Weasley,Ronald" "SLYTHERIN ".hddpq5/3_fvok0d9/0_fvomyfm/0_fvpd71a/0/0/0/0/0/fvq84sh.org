  As far as you're concerned, I didn't.

That's not true. At some point in the first two years of my life, I learned object permanence, and since then, I have been able to conceive of other people and things existing outside of my perception. This includes the conception that you existed even before I became aware of your existence.

  These are literary characters, not message board posters. They have no independent existence outside of the narrative.

By that reasoning, nor does Harry Potter---keeping in mind that the narrative is entirely in 3rd-person---nor does Hogwarts or any element of the Potterverse setting. If you reject the idea of story elements existing outside of the canon narrative, then what are you even doing in a fan fiction subreddit?
