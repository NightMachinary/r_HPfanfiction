  Harry is... fine. Malfoy gets told off by Snape for picking on a fellow Slytherin, and with that calmed down it's just a hostile living environment. Harry's used to that. It does likely mean he never really opens up and makes friends, and ends up a quiet one. The first time Ron turns on him is the last, as without the pressure of his house behind making up he won't trust again easily.

The OP premise is that Harry is still in Gryffindor. Only Ron and Hermione are Slytherins.
