Ron ends up in detention for the entire first year because having a head of house who's actually paying attention means he can't get away with acting like he does without consequence... and because he's the new scapegoat when they can't prove his brothers did something to the Slytherins.

He comes back second year after a long talk with Percy and starts taking things seriously, picking his fights and paying attention to what he's doing.

Harry is... fine. Malfoy gets told off by Snape for picking on a fellow Slytherin, and with that calmed down it's just a hostile living environment. Harry's used to that. It does likely mean he never really opens up and makes friends, and ends up a quiet one. The first time Ron turns on him is the last, as without the pressure of his house behind making up he won't trust again easily.

He still befriends Hermione, the other outcast in the year, and together they become abjectly terrifying. Two smart kids, one with the level of protective paranoia that abuse can give and the other brilliant and isolated all her life.

Snape, being Snape, asks some sarcastic questions about why Harry's staying at Hogwarts over the winter holidays, and finds out where he's been living. That makes him angry enough to look at Harry's memory, which in turn infuriates him entirely. Between that and seeing too much of himself and Lily in Harry and Hermione, he becomes tolerable over time, and does his duty as head of house to work in their best interests.

He'll never be nice. He doesn't have it in him. But he won't let them be targets for harassment within the house.
