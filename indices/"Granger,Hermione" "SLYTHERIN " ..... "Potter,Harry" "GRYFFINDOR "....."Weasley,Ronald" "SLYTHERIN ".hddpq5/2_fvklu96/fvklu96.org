Hermione dies during Halloween of first year because no one in slytherin wants to help a "mudblood". She becomes one of the castles ghosts, and when Harrys friends turn on him during second year, He becomes friends with her.

Ron continues to be Harrys friend in the first and maybe second year but peer pressure causes them to drift apart much like Severus Snape and Lily Evans. Ron could still be a good guy, but would need to pretend to be buying into pureblood dogma in order to survive amongst junior death eaters.
