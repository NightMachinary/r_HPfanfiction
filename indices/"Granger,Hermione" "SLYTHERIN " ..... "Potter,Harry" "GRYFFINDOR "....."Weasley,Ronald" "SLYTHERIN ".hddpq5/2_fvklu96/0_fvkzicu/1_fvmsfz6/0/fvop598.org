Thanks for replying despite my snark.

Where we disagree is that I don't think Hermione will be spending hours crying in the toilets again and again. It's just not what she normally does when dealing with disdain of others and social isolation: she either busies herself with work (PoA) or responds with aggression (HBP). If anything, she'd be spending all her time in the library.

The Troll incident was a very specific confluence of social circumstances [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hddpq5/grangerhermione_slytherin_potterharry_gryffindor/fvmdwhq/][for reasons I describe in another post on this thread]]. Under the prompt's premise, if she does end up spending a day crying in the toilets, it would happen much, much earlier than Halloween 1991, and then she'd move on.

Now, I can see her [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/post-15356279][hanging out with everybody's favourite hydrokinetic Muggleborn ghost, who is waiting for her to die so that she could have a little sister]], but that would change things as well.

To see why I suspected that you had something against Hermione, consider the big picture: this prompt is /about/ Ron and Hermione in a new setting. But, rather than consider the interplay between them or anything like that, you killed Hermione to turn her into an entity that pretty much by definition can't have character development, and her only role in the story from that point on is to assuage Harry's loneliness---even though this prompt isn't even about Harry.
