I have nothing against Hermione. She is actually my favorite character in the series.

If Hermione would be Slytherin, she would be bullied 24/7 and would be the punchbag of the house. As a result, she would spend more time crying in bathrooms than in cannon.

Chances of the troll encountering her was already astronomicaly small in the cannon yet it did anyway. Almost as if the troll was searching for little crying children to eat.

Ron would fare a bit better simply beacuse he is a pureblood( a poor one, but still a pureblood.) He would be bullied too, just not as much as Hermione. Unlike with Hermione, they would give him a chance to join them if he accepted their way of thinking. Ron might actually bully Hermione more severely than in cannon in the hopes of acceptance by his housemates. Peer pressure is a strong and evil thing.
