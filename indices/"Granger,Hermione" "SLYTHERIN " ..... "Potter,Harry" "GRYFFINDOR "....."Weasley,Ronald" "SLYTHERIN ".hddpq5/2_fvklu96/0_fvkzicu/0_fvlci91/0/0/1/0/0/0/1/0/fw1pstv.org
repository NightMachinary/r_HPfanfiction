1. She might have gone to a bathroom in the dungeons, but I'm pretty sure they only had Potions on Friday, and Potions is the only class held in the dungeons. She could be crying in that bathroom, but Halloween 1991 was on a Thursday, and so she'd have to start crying sometime after 3:00 PM. The feast is around seven, and since Hermione, being Hermione probably went to the library straight after the classes finished, the next time she'd be in direct contact with the Slytherins is while walking to the feast, which is on the first floor in the Great Hall. The closest bathroom to the Great Hall is the Troll bathroom.
2. The troll went into the bathroom originally because it heard Hermione, so if Hermione was in a bathroom in the dungeons (where the troll was originally released), it could have heard her there and gone in to kill her. The two places where Hermione could have gotten killed were the dungeons and the second-floor bathroom.
