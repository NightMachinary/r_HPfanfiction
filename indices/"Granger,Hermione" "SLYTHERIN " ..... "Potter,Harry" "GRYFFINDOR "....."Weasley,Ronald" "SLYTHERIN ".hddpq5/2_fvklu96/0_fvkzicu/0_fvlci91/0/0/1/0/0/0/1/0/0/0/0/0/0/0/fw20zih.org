Oh, no, I didn't mean that she wouldn't withhold information, I'm saying she wouldn't rationalise Mudblood insult as something wrong with her. I think she'd have a mean streak, but that doesn't mean she won't cry. I think she'd go cry for a while, tell herself that crying isn't going to do shit, and then plot against her bullies. She might do something mean to someone, but she's also logical.

Withholding information might be more difficult. It's in Hermione's nature to please adults, and she does that by acting like a know-it-all. Personally, I don't think she'd be a great Slytherin, but if she were, she'd have to learn to be one.
