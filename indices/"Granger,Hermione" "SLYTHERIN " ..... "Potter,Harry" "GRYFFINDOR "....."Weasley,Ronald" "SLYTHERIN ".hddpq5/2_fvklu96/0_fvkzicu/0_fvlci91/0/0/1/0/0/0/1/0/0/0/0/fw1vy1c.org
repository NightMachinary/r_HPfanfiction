Did she not go straight from class to the bathroom to cry? That was my impression but it has been a while since I read the books, if so point 3 becomes irrelevant as she would have missed classes anyway and thus is probably in a different toilet due to a different class. Also she may not have been crying. This happened a short while into the book and she has presumably been bullied more due to being a mudblood previously and either changed how she acts or become more tough-skinned and therefore is probably with everyone else and not crying.
