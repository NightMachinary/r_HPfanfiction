1. The troll was roaming around the corridors before Harry and Ron locked it up, and since we don't know much about trolls, aside from the fact that they're clumsy and dumb, we have no idea if the troll could climb stairs. You can make the argument that because it's so huge and clumsy, it would have been difficult, but there's no conclusive evidence- we have to make do with the albeit, unreliable information that Quirrel gives us.
2. The point I was making was that she didn't have *potions*, which is the only class in the dungeons that we know of, since, as you pointed out, they share it with the Gryffindor's. She could have had a different class on a different floor, but the troll wasn't there during class time. Besides, she is WAY more likely to get walked in on in the middle of a busy corridor when students are exiting a classroom and using the bathroom.
3. In order for the events to play out like canon, Hermione would have to be in a bathroom (we disagree on which bathroom and whether the troll would have got to her, but I haven't heard you object to her being in a bathroom) around 6-7:00 PM. Also, I really don't think Hermione is the kind of student who goes all the way downstairs and risks being late to her class that is definitely /not/ there, just because she wants to cry.
4. If we go with the information Quirrel gave us, and what Harry and Ron observed, the Troll travelled between the dungeons and the second floor. This means that any bathroom between these two floors could also have been targeted.
5. We know that after class, students usually spend time in their common rooms, so traffic in the Great Hall would probably peak around dinner time.
6. Hermione is still Hermione. Right after class, she's still going to do her homework, and she probably won't talk to her Slytherin peers during that time. Like I said before, the time she's really exposed to them is when walking to class or the Great Hall. The walk from the dungeons to the Great Hall and all of the bathrooms there are within the Troll's hit zone.
