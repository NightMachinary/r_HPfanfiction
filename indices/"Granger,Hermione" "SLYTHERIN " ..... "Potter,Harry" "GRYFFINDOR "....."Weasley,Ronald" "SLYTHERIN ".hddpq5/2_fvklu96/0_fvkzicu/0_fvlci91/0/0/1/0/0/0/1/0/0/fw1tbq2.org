We have no confirmation the troll was actually released in the dungeon, (just Quirrel who obviously wanted people away from the third floor and saying that there is a troll on the seventh floor is weird, also, if it was in the dungeon it walked up several flights of stairs?) Also, she may have had a completely different class that day (slytherins only have potions with Gryffindor that we know of) so she might have used a bathroom on a different floor anyway. Also, when I said she might use a toilet in the dungeon I meant that she might purposefully go there (regardless of class) in order to be in a less used restroom because as u said the troll bathroom is nearest to the great hall which implies heavy traffic, and therefore, lots of people to hear u awkwardly crying and tease you/ ask if ur alright in that weird way that people do when they don't know you.
