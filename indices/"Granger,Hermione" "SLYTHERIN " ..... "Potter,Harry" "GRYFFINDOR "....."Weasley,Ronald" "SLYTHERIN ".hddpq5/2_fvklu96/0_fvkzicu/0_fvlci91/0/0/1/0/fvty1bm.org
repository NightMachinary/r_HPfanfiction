But isn't the whole point of crying in bathrooms that you are in a private place. I remember it being that Ron and Harry only found out about Hermione because Lavender and Parvati told them, and I don't think anyone else (besides the troll) disturbed her. I don't think any of the Slytherins would go all the way to the bathroom to tease Hermione when the Feast was still going on. I mean, everyone was there. Also, I'm not sure there are any more private places in Hogwarts that she, as a first year knew about. She lives in a dorm with Blood Purists, she doesn't know her way around the castle, the only other places left are classrooms. Idk though.
