I don't know. When I think about it, I see no reason for it. I understand where you're coming from but a) it's only October, so she doesn't know her way around that well; b) Moaning Myrtle's bathroom is on the second floor, so there's a pretty high likelihood of someone hearing Hermione in there on their way to the Feast, plus, Myrtle would annoy Hermione, so it's not all that private; c) as I mentioned before, she would probably be more likely to be teased in her dorm, she lives with Pansy Parkinson and the girls share the bathroom. There are no bathrooms other than the ones in dorms in Gryffindor tower so that rules out bathrooms in the Common Room if we're keeping the layout more or less the same and I don't think we've ever heard of one in the dungeons; d) I don't think we have any evidence that older years would mercilessly tease someone five years younger than them in tears, just because they're a Slytherin. The Marauders bullied Snape, and that was awful, but I can't recall anyone from Harry's year bullying Slytherins, certainly not first years. In fact, Draco, who was a Slytherin, was the bully.
