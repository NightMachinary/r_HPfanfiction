I mean with the whole rivalry between Slytherin and the other houses, would she maybe pic a less used bathroom (like Myrtles) or one in the dungeons/dorm room. As you said, Harry found out because of Lavender and Parvati meaning that at least two Gryffindors heard her crying. Would they have teased her? if not would a passing upper-year have teased the slimy Slytherin?
