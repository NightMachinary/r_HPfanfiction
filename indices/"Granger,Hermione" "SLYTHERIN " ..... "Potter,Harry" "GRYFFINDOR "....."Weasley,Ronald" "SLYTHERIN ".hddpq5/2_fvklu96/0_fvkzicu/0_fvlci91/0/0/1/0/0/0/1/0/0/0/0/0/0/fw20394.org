Hermione has a mean streak, I feel that in Slytherin if she bottled her emotions it would come out as her doing something mean to someone. Also, she wouldn't change who she is but if she gets teased for being a know it all I can see her withholding information rather than sharing it out of spite- to not get Slytherin points or to not benefit the others in her class. Also, Hermione had a mean streak and broke rules as a Griffindor, surrounded by positive influences, I can see her turning out different from negative influences instead.
