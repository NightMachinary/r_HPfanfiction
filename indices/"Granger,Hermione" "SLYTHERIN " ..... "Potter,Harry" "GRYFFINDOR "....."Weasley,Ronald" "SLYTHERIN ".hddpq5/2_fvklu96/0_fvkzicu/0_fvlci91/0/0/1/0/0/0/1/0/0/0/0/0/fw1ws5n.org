She runs away crying, and we find out later that she is in the bathroom crying, but we don't know if she went straight to that bathroom. I agree that she probably made a pitstop to wash her face and then let herself cry later, so not to miss classes.

And yes, Hermione is more used to it by now, but this doesn't mean she has developed a thicker skin. In fact, she may have internalised it and figured that there was something wrong with being a Mudblood, or just sunk into a state of sadness. Personally, though these are possibilities, I don't think that'd happen. Hermione has a very strong idea of who she is, and she's not going to change that, and she's also a very stubborn person, and I don't think she would hold on to sadness like that. The other possibility, which I think is very likely, is that she's been bottling up her emotions (because the bullying in Slytherin is relentless and she can't cry all the time), and someone says something very cutting, which causes her to break.
