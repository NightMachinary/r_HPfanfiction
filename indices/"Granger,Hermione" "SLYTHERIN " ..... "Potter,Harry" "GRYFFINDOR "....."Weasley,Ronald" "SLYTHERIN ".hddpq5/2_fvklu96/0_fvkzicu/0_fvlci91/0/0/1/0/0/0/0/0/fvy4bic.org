This would actually be such a great way to explore Myrtle. I can just imagine Myrtle being super excited when the Basilisk shows up. Course she would have to be told, but I can imagine her conspiring to get Hermione killed. A really sad, but in my opinion, great ending would be to have Hermione figure this out right before she is killed, not be ready to move on, become a ghost and spend the rest of eternity with Myrtle. I love Evil!Myrtle
