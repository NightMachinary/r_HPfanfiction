At the same time, the reason she ended up in the bathroom was because she was paired up with Ron, who made her cry. What are the odds she'd end up paired with him again in the exact same situation? Not to mention, she only knew how Ron felt after he talked about it (loudly) with Harry... which might not necessarily happen.

Though I agree she'd probably be bullied and/or ostracized by her housemates, at the beginning of her school life, at the very least. But I don't know if she would end up in the exact same situation.
