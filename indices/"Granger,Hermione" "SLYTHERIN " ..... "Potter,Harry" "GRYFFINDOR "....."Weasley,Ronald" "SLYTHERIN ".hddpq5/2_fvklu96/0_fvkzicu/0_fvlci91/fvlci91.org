I doubt they have anything against Hermione, but she's not gonna be treated well in Slytherin, definitely worse then in canon so crying in the bathroom alone will be more common not less. The troll ending up in the bathroom makes no sense in the first place. In it's dumb brain it has to decide to go out of it's way into an offshoot room instead of continuing down the hallway. My headcanon was always that the troll heard her crying and followed that into the bathroom. Troll still released, Hermione still crying, troll passes by hears her and kills her without someone's going to save her.
