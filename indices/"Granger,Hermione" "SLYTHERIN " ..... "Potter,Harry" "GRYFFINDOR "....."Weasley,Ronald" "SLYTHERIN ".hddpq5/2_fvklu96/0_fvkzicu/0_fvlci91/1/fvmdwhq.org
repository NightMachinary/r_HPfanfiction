Would it be more common, though?

This is digging a bit deeper into early-canon Hermione's psychology, but the thing with Ron happened because Ron /wasn't/ bullying her---and didn't even mean for her to overhear him. What broke her then was that she had been harbouring a misconception that they were friends---and if you don't believe that she harboured that misconception, ask yourself why else she would act as if refusing to talk with them was some kind of a punishment---and Ron's comment disabused her of that notion very suddenly. She realised then that she had, in fact, been antagonising Harry and Ron all along, and she didn't know exactly what was it that she had done. (After all, helping them with classwork and telling them when they are about to break rules and get into trouble is what friends do for friends, right?)

A hypothetical Hermione in Slytherin forming such a misconception would require far more subtlety from first-year Slytherins than they are capable of. Their bullying would almost certainly be overt, direct, and immediate. How she'd respond to that is open to interpretation. However, I would think that after some disappointment early on, she would make peace with having no friends, and focus on making it so that she no longer has enemies, either...

That said, I did once outline a Slytherin!Hermione fic in which her treatment in Slytherin resulted in her becoming a scrappy Dark witch, an anti-blood-purist, anti-Voldemort fanatic, and a murderer and a terrorist. I ultimately decided not to write it for a variety of reasons, but it did have a Troll Incident that I wrote into prose. I won't repost it here, but [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/post-15356279][here is the snipped on Spacebattles, that also provides some additional context]]. It involves Myrtle, who completely misunderstands the situation, and thus accidentally saves Hermione (or, rather, causes her to save herself) as a result.
