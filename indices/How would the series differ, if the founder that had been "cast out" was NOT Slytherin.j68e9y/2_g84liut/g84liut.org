I think it would change a bit what the bad guys are like

so like voldemort takes the slytherin positive qualities and twists them into something negative.

So him being a different house would twist those qualities into something negative.

Griffindor Voldemort I see as similar to slytherin voldemort but more confrontational in combat. His death eaters may continue to fight after he dissappears maybe some factions are still openly active when Harry goes to school.

Ravenclaws Voldemort more driven by knowledge than power I can see maybe the deathly hallows coming up earlier as a topic. Much more conversations about the nature of magic. Maybe unspeakables become a bigger deal

Huffepuff tho has me a bit stumped. Its kinda hard to twist acceptance hardwork and being fair.
