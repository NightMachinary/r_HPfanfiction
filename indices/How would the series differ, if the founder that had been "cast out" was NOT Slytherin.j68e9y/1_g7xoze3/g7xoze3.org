Well considering that Voldemort is still Slytherins' heir no matter which Founder was banished, he would either base his power base on some other Slytherin ideology or target the most prejudiced - and thus vulnerable in the way that their end goal is easy to predict - hause and forgone the adventage that is his bloodline.

Personally I think Tom Riddle would still end up as Slytherin, he was very attached to his ancestors' legacy, and wouldn't want to discard adventage being parselmouth gives him there. More so if most purebloods go to Slytherin, most money is available there to push through various politics and get power and lidership position in government. Maybe they would not be as overzealous, radical and easily manipulated as anti-muggleborn fanatics but good taste matters. Tom would get to power more traditional way, not via terrorism.

The muggle-prejudiced politic party would need to have some *serious* political adventage for Tom to decide he wants to put his future on path to become their leader.

It's more probable they would be his political opponents, or at least a problem he has to solve after becoming Minister for Magic.
