Sorry if it wasn't clear I did not mean he went to Slytherin bc of some legacy he mysteriously knew about but that he would go to Slytherin. Period. And after learning of legacy it would reaffirm his delusions(?) of grandeur so ofc he was very attached to the idea that his birth makes him extra special.

It's correlation not causation lol
