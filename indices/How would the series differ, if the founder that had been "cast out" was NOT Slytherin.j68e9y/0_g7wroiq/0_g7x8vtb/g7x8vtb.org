Isn't hufflepuff the house of hard work and loyalty ? Riddle is more of a power hungry nerd that value the loyalty (the right) people give him and that will take any short cuts (like work cleverly not hard).

He probably wasn't sorted into Slytherin for his hatred of muggles. More for his qualities and faults that were similar to the house spirit. He just ended up hating muggles and adopting the pure blood agenda when he grew learning about it (though, yeah, he already was a hateful child blabla).

So, yeah. Between his character and his family being the last blood relations to Slytherin, I don't see hatred of muggles being enough to make that much of a change.

(Though, Voldemort coming from a random house/not the hated one would be more of a surprise and less clich√©!

And if Hufflepuff was the one hating muggles, Zacharias could become something of a low level enemy too!)
