Percy was actually a Junior /Assistant/. This is kind of what makes me think Fudge might not have been so young as a Junior /Minister/ --- the fact that "Minister" is higher than "Assistant" by far leads me to think Fudge had already a bit of a career behind him at that point. Certainly, he could still have been in his twenties, but I find it unlikely that Junior Minister was his first job with the Ministry.
