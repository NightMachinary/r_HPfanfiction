Update: Another user contacted me with other stories that they archived and will share, including Pawn to Queen, so that will also be available - though whether from me or the user who PM'd me is yet to be determined.

Edit: I didn't realize the site I uploaded the fics to requires an account before you can download, so I made a shareable Google Drive folder and can share the link with anyone who wants it. There are other files there besides ePub that I haven't gotten around to reformatting yet.
