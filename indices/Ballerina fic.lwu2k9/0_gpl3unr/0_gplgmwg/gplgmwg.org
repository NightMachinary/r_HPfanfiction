I think this one is The Best Revenge (and/or its sequel, The Best Revenge: Time of the Basilisk), by the late Arsinoe de Blassenville. Wonderful stories. Sally-Anne Perks (who is barely mentioned in canon?) is a Muggleborn who comes to Hogwarts despite desperately wanting to continue her ballet training. She's not a primary focus of the story, but she allows exploration in the story of the interesting possibility of there being valuable and desirable pursuits other than magic, and ones that some children might actually love more.
