Not to my knowledge, but it would be interesting to see another character step up his game and arise from his canon assigned role of a dumbed down plot device.

Harry biting the dust in an alternate dimension is quite common, for example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052), Voldemort killed +all three Potters+ Harry and Sirius on that night. He looked unstoppable until “the Fucker” turned up and totally derailed his campaign.
