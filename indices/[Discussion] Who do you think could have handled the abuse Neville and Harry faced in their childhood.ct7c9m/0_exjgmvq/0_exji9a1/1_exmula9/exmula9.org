I mean no it would shape your behavior. Even Harry and Neville turned out the way they did as a result of what happened to them. Sure their entire chatacter isnt dependent on being abused but it still shaped them like all experience would. How exactly? It would be pretty hard to say all the ways theyd be different in fact impossible. If you look at anyone moment that you are sure influenced you greatly you could never figure in exactly how many ways it influenced you. And thats just all the ones you can perceive not all the ones you dont consider.
