I mean... part of that is JKR's whole playing-abuse-for-comedy thing. The Dursleys & Neville's grandmother/great-uncle are mostly played for laughs in the actual text, despite behavior that looks pretty abusive upon any examination. The books don't show the consequences of abuse realistically with Harry and Neville not because they're meant to be remarkably resilient, but because it doesn't show /abuse/ realistically, period (which is maybe understable given that they're books for children, but if she's uncomfortable writing about abuse realistically, I don't think she should have written about abuse at all).

Anyways, I still think it's kind of weird and inappropriate to entertain the question of whether or not different characters "could have handled" abusive childhoods. It sort of implies that anyone who "couldn't handle" being abused is in some way weaker than those who show less outward signs, or that there was something they should have done to avoid being abused. I don't think you intended to do this, but it definitely plays that way to me, at least.
