*Shrug* I can't please everyone. I suppose it could be that way, but I can't bring myself to care too much about sounding politically correct. It was a situation, and it was handled. I can't really say it better. I'm not attacking abuse victims, but some people are more strong-willed or resilient than others.

Take a canon character with a loving family and place them at the Dursley's house instead of Harry. What do you see occurring rather than Harry's passive aggressive attitude? Do you think Hermione would have still turned out brilliant if raised by someone who was as demeaning as Neville's family?

Rowling definitely shouldn't have played it for laughs though. She does something similar with Hermione attacking Ron in book 6 and plays Hermione off as the hurt one.
