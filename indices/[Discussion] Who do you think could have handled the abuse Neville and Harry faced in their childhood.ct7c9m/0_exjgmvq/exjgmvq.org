I don't really understand what this question is driving at. Abuse isn't something you can or can't "handle", even as an adult and especially as a child. If you mean to ask what characters could have escaped abuse or something like that, that's also a bit of an inappropriate question when talking about children being abused by the people they're dependent on. No matter how formidable they seem as an adult, I don't think there's a person out there who was invulnerable to abuse as a child.

If I'm missing the point of this completely, please let me know.
