Witch Queen is a great story that begins with time travel and diverges without abandoning Hogwarts.

One of the main contributions of time travel in this one, besides just passing back useful information, is to broaden the protagonist's vision of what the future could be, with the right changes.

One of my favorite fics; highly recommended.
