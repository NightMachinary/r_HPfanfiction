I mean this is certainly an area that's not explored enough, but it won't be a complete 360 from their canon selves. Hermione already has a nasty mean streak and she has shown that she doesn't mind breaking the rules if she thinks it's for a better cause. Attacking Ron, Skeeter bullshit, probably scarring Edgecombe for life, forcing something on house elves even though they didn't want it among other things shows that Hermione herself is a bit of 'dark'.

Ron doesn't really minding killing off Death Eaters if it's in his (and his family's/freinds') self-interest. He probably killed a couple in the battle of the Seven Potters anyway. He had no problems killing off those two Death Eaters after the wedding and I don't think he'll lose much sleep if he failed to save Draco from that fiendfyre. And personally, I agree with him. I sure as hell am not going to risk my life, my girl's life and my best mate's life for a racist bigot. Specially one that tried to kill me.

And they are both attracted to each other despite these 'dark' traits. I mean Hermione did physically attack Ron and he doesn't really mind these tendencies. And Hermione is aware of Ron's dark moments.

I would love to read a fic about that takes it one step further and it won't be much far from canon. And any Ron/Hermione material is good material as far as I am concerned.
