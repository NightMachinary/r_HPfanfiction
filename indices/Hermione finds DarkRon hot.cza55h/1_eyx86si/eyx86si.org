Well then she must've been hella turned on when Ron suggested they kill the Death Eaters instead of wiping their memories when they got attacked in that cafe after Bill and Fleur's wedding.

Ron has a few Dark moments in the books. We saw a flicker of it when he expressed interest in the elder wand wheres Hermione and Harry thought the cloak and the stone were the best Hallows. Come to think of it everyone in the trio has their own handful of questionably dark moments (notably Harry using Crucio on Bellatrix and Hermione kidnapping Skeeter).
