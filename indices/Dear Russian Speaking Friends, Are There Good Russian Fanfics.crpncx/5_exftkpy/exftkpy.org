hm, i think i remember Tempus Colligendi ([[http://fanfics.me/fic45779]]) being decent-ish (some peggy sue story? dont rly remember)

[[http://fanfics.me/fic37780]] wasnt bad, but it wasnt all that good (tells about some slytherin ooc going in the same year as potter, dont remember much)

[[http://fanfics.me/fic792]] was pretty good (i cant describe what the fuck goes on in here in a sentence, shits fucking crazy lmao)

[[https://ficbook.net/readfic/6463881]] was kinda decent (crossover with dresden, snape picks up a blackened denarius iirc)

havent read any rus fanfics in a while now, but these i can remember off the top of my mind
