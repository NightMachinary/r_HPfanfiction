I haven't lurked in that part of Internet for a decade, but the fandom is big, or at least it used to be. I remember really loving [[http://snapetales.com/all.php?fic_id=569][Burglars' trip]]. It's about Snape and Lucius Malfoy friendship and shenanigans, written after OotP and very AU, especially when it comes to Snape's backstory. Starts with them being 11 and goes all the way to canon events. Gen, action/adventure, a lot of humour and decent writing with good grammar.
