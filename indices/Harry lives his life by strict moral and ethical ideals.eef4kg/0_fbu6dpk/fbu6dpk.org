There was one where he was a D&D Paladin. I can't recall the name (something like Harry Potter and the Burning Heart, maybe?) but it was decent enough and he had to remain semi-bound to his ideals to maintain the Paladin-ness.

On an 'evil' standpoint, there was also one where he kept quoting Machiavelli in which he was very strictly adhering to his Lawful Evil-esque moral-ethical code. Can't remember that one's name either, though.
