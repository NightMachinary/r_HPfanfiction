*Not exactly based on the prompt. Make of it what you will - Might add more on later, but I have class now so this is what I've got.*

​

“Don't rough house too much now!” Daphne calls to their children before they're too far out of hearing distance. The two youngest acknowledge her, one with an ‘okay', the other with a ‘yeah, mom' as acknowledgement, but the other three completely ignore her; all of them are too caught up in the excitement of staying overnight to visit their cousins.

Daphne lets out a puff of breath in amused exasperation, before turning back to her sister and pulling her into a hug. “It's so good to see you.”

Harry lets the sisters have their moment and turns his eyes to Draco, standing a short distance to the right of Astoria, only to see him looking back in turn. “Hey, Draco. How's it going?” Harry says, holding out a hand.

Draco's eyes drop to it for a moment before giving it a single shake. “Good.”

Harry shrugs off the curt response, well use to it in the seventeen years after the end of the war.

“You catch the game?” He asks, referencing the Cannons vs Wasps game from three days ago. Draco shakes his head.

“No, we had an anonymous tip come in right before I'd been about to leave work. The proceeding events ended up keeping me until well after nine.” His eyes narrow into something of a grimace. “But I've heard enough to know neither of our teams we're in great shape.”

Harry's curiosity peaks about the ‘proceeding events' but he figures it must be something still under investigation, thus binding Draco to not be allowed to speak about it.

“Yeah, it was downright painful to watch.” He pauses for a moment as he catches the girls looking at them.

“We'll be in the front room if you need us for something.” Daphne says, Astoria nodding in agreement to Draco.

“When are we planning dinner for?”

“Around five thirty.” Harry looks at the clock at that, noting that they had about six hours of free time until then.

“Alright hun, love you.” He says, giving her a short kiss before she leaves. 

With the ladies gone, he turns back to Draco. "They just don't have the superstar players to compete with teams like the Kestrels, or United. Even the Bats have Henderson, who's shaping into an incredible seeker." 

"Hmm." Draco hums in reply, turning back in the direction of the lounge. Harry stares at the back of his head. "Have anything to drink?"

Draco pauses, then reaches up to scratch at his trimmed beard. After a moment he lets out a sigh. "Follow me."

When they enter the lounge Draco goes towards the liquor cabinet. Harry stalls at the door, looking around and taking in the room. He'd always been hesitant to use the room. So much dark history; Voldemort must have spent an extensive amount of time in here when they'd switched to using Malfoy Manor as headquarters. Planning, discussing, strategizing. And all along with Malfoy Sr. 

Harry's eyes once again focused onto Draco, and he took a step into the room, moving to sit down in one of the arm chairs. "Isn't it a little early to be /drinking/?" 

"I suppose so." Draco responds, reaching past the cheaper bottles of whiskey, bourbon, and gin. He pulls out an aged scotch, and with it two glasses. He sets them down on the table between the arm chairs and pops the seal on the bottle. Harry frowns at this.

"I hate to waste a whole bottle like that. I'm not drinking the whole thing this early you know." 

Draco eyes him, before pouring into the two glasses and setting the bottle down. He sits in his own chair after this, leaning back, picking up the glass, and after swirling it three times, takes a sip.

Harry watches him carefully, picking up his own glass and taking a sip.

"You know, sometimes it's hard to believe this is how things turned out." Draco starts. "The end of the war seems so distant, yet so close at the same time. Like it just ended yesterday, or never happened at all. Do you ever get that feeling?" 

Harry looks around the room once more, a tense knot settling in his gut. "More and more often as time goes on. When the war ended it was euphoric. Easy to indulge, and easy to forget. Being young does that." 

Draco nods at this, raising his glass towards him. "I can't say the same."

Harry understands. Draco, although he'd turned over vital information near the end of the war, and had been let off of any charges, he'd been one of the lucky ones. Eventually, everyone he'd been friends with had been hunted down, put in Azkaban, or executed. Not to mention the fate of his parents. Harry sips again, before saying exactly what he's thinking.

"I guess that's the difference between being on the winning or losing side in a war."

 Draco's face shifts into something of a grimace and a glare at the same time.

"Indeed."

"You know I don't mean it personally Draco."

"Hmm. Regardless, it seems Britain has been entirely too happy to move past that point in history, ignoring both the winners and the losers."

"A little /too happy/, am I right?" 

"Yes. A country that forgets it's past is doomed to repeat it."

*EDIT: This is the break between the first part and second part of the writing. One more part to follow.*

"I've heard the saying, and I know what you mean. When Connor brought back some summer review texts for history I couldn't believe how quickly they glossed over the two wars." Harry's hand tightens on the glass. "I've tried to drill it into my kid's heads, but...."

"It isn't something you can put in words. I know." Draco gave a small smile - the first he'd seen from the other man in a while, so he returned it. They clinked their glasses together and downed the rest of the drink in them. Draco poured another glass for each of them.

"I'm only having this one more. Seriously." Harry said. Seeing Draco nod in agreement he continued. "But. You know, it's not like it's something I want to terrify them with. The chances of another guy like Voldemort coming around are pretty small, right?"

"I'm sure the same thing was said about Grindelwald." Draco left it at that, staring down into the amber liquid in his glass.

They sat like that for a few moments, sitting in silence.

"Two giants going out like that left a huge political vacuum." Harry began.

"No." 

"Neither of us was capable of taking over that kind of position back when the war had ended but...."

"No."

"I mean, you're already involved in a government position...." Harry trailed off. "Who am I kidding. I don't want to have to deal with that. I just want to live to an old age and spend time with my family."

"Same here."

They both sighed at the same time.

Harry looks at Draco, sipping the scotch. "Are we going to have this conversation in some form or another every year until we die?"

Draco shrugs in response. " At the very least until we're actually forced to do something. Or we're too old to care."

"Mmm." Harry hums in agreement, leaning back in the chair. He relaxes, letting out a breath. "By the way, what's Snape been up to? I haven't talked to him in at least a few months."

In an instant heat sears through the room, some of the books on the far wall combusting into flame that quickly licks up to spread to anything it touches. 

In a single thought Harry has an air bubble around both Draco and his heads. The instant after he can feel the oxygen disappear from the room. Draco uses his wand to conjure a wall of water, but before he can push it onto the devouring flame Harry has vanished it. He pulls Draco towards the door, and together they both rush into the hallway. 

"It's fiendfyre Draco, the water would be like oil to it." Draco nods, and although he's keeping it together well enough, Harry knows he's shaken due to the fact he hadn't realized that himself. Sweeping away in the direction that he knew the kids to be he calls over his shoulder. "I'll get the kids, go find the girls."
