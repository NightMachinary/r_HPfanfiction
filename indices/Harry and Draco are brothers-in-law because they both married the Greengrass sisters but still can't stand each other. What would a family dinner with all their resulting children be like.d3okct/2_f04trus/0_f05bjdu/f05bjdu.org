I'd love to see this turn into some kind of Revolutionary!Harry story where Draco follows along because his wife insists that he gets along with his brother-in-law.

“Draco, I didn't think you'd come.”

“Yeah, well, Astoria's had me on the couch for a week. She doesn't even like House Elves, she just thinks we're not bonding enough.”

“Bonding?”

“Just shut up and put on your mask.”
