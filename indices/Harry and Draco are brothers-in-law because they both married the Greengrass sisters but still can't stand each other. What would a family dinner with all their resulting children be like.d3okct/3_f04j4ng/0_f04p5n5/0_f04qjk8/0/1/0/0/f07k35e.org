This thread was made

I wrote the top comment about Harry and Draco not getting along

Someone wrote a Harry/Draco infidelity prompt to which I responded with a Harry/Astoria counter where they cuckold Draco, who is infertile (but doesn't know it) instead of cheating on poor Astoria

Someone replied that they have seen that plot on Ao3, to which I replied that I was inspired by that fic I got from a thread here where Harry cuckolds the entire pureblood world by cursing them infertile and selling his own sperm as fertility potion.

Then you got this comment thread where someone complained about the comment section being "most Hellstrike-esque comment section I've ever seen" and another comment which called me cancer (mods deleted that one).
