Harry casually dropping Katie Bell, cursed items, Rosmerta, the Unforgivables, Ron and poison into the conversation all the time just to make Malfoy uncomfortable. And mention how much he hates corruption (the only reason I can see Malfoy avoid life in prison).

Also, trying to get out of there as fast as possible and begging Daphne to schedule meetings with Astoria where Draco is not involved.
