I have a real love-hate relationship with Draco/Harry. Yes, I read this pairing for when I'm down. (It is my guilty pleasure pairing.) But I'm not super happy with the pairing that I'd defend Drarry. There are some serious problems with some fics out there, like this one, which is pretty popular , has fans..

Anyway mpreg trope I know tends to squick guys out. That wasn't even the main problem with the fic.

I feel like JKR sort of slightly redeemed Draco Malfoy (I didn't want her to, really) .
