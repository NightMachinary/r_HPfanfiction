  His Pottermore page doesn't say that he was guilty of war crimes

His attack on Katie and Rosmerta violated the ban of using poison as a weapon and treachery beyond the legitimate ruses of war (Art 23a, b Hague IV), they were civilians and he was disguising himself as civilian while conducting acts of war (Art 23 f Hague IV). The last one usually got you a oneway ticket to the nearest wall or gallow. Nevermind that he used the Unforgivables on civilians or facilitating an attack on a school.

  He's not in prison, is he?

Which is the reason I dislike him so much. I can get behind redemptions if the person was punished for their crimes first. But not without punishment. And Malfoy weaselled his way out of his righteous punishment.
