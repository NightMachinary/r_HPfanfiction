I do agree. I think this talk came about because of all the romanticization we do when it comes to his Fanon characterization. It is just mind boggling that neither he nor his Father suffers (as much as we know from Pottermore). Moreover, he's made part of the good guys in Cursed Child (which I refuse to accept as Canon). I think all the brickbats are stemming from this fact as well as his huge popularity in fanfics.
