Makes him a good guy in Cursed Child. He's not in prison, is he? His Pottermore page doesn't say that he was guilty of war crimes. Not to mention, JKR tries 'hey he's still a coward, but I'm going to not make him evil' with scenes in DH. I do not support her redemption of the character. Idk if she did it because of how popular Draco was, at that point.
