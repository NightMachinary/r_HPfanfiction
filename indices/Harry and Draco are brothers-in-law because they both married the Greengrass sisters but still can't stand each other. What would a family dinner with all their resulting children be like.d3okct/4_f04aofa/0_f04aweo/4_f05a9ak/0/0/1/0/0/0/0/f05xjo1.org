This may be an unpopular opinion and I have no affection for Draco as a character but him being a victim of circumstance is semi valid. Brainwashing exists. It does happen. Most of his atrocities were committed whilst he was still a 'child' (by UK law atleast). That doesn't excuse his crimes but makes them alot more understandable.
