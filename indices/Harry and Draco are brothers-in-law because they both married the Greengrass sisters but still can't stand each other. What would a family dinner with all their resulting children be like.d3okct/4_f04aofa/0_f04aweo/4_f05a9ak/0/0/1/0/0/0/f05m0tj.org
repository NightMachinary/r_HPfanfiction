Exactly, when I said JKR did the 'light' redemption. i meant he got away with it all. I think redemption might have been a wrong term here, (the very slight change JKR did to his character arc in Canon.) I fully expected him to be incarcerated along with Lucius. But JKR made him out to be some sort of victim of circumstance which is why you have all sorts of fan/ship wars these days on whether or not he's a good guy. JKR shouldn't have introduced this element of doubt and instead made him out to be at least, suffering some time in prison, for crimes in his past.
