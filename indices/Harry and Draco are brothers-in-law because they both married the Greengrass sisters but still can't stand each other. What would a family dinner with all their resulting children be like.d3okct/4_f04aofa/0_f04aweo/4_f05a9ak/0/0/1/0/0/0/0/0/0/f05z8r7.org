There was a thread a while back about why Ron doesn't get much love in fanfic and why Draco does and the explanation was the actors. Some people also highlighted that Ron was alot more popular before the last few movies where many people's headcanon was that Ron becomes a sexy adult. Out of the cast Rupert Grint being the least popular and Tom Felton being very popular is probably a huge reason for all the love. Additionally book!Draco is alot easier to dislike than movie!Draco. Similar to Snape.
