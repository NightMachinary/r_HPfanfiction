#+begin_quote
  There's one with Draco being super abusive
#+end_quote

I can see that happening

#+begin_quote
  semi-dark fic with him emotionally manipulating
#+end_quote

Go on

#+begin_quote
  Harry
#+end_quote

Wait, what?

#+begin_quote
  into giving him babies
#+end_quote

Ok, a contrived reason for Harry/Astoria, but go on...

#+begin_quote
  coz Astoria is infertile
#+end_quote

Hold up. How is that supposed to - ahh - oh. Nvm -.-

On a similar note, any mpreg birth would either go through the penis (joy^{^{/s}} ), out of the ass (ass-born is actually an insult here in Germany), include egg-laying and therefore technically be interspecies or not really be mpreg.

#+begin_quote
  there was nothing redeeming about Draco
#+end_quote

So just like in canon then.

#+begin_quote
  Harry keeps going back (...) in spite of the abusive relationship and ends with Harry getting together
#+end_quote

So the usual trash tier fanfic. Especially since magic would equalise almost any power imbalance which leads to domestic abuse.

#+begin_quote
  I sort of stopped reading Drarry for days after this
#+end_quote

I usually stop when I get to the character tags and Malfoy is included.
