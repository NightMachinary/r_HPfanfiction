There's one with Draco being super abusive, semi-dark fic with him emotionally manipulating Harry into giving him babies coz Astoria is infertile. I genuinely didn't like this fic, there was nothing redeeming about Draco. Harry keeps going back to Draco in spite of the abusive relationship and ends with Harry getting together with Draco!! (Like what.. ) I sort of stopped reading Drarry for days after this.
