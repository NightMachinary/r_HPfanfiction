Reasons I can see Harry/Narcissa happen:

- Bond over what has happened in the Forbidden Forest

- "We really shouldn't be doing this." "That only makes it hotter." (only works for flings)

Reasons when I don't see it happen:

- Pretty much what every fanfic author uses

- Pureblood culture/marriage contracs/right of conquest

- Male Veela
