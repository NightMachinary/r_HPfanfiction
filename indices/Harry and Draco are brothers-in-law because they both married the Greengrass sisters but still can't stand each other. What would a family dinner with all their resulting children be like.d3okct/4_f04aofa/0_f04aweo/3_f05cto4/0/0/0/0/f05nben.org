I mean with canon, you can't really justify it at all. She thinks of Harry as dirt and apparently loves her husband.

But as an entertaining fic? I can see your reasoning for how it occurs, but there's just too huge a gap in age and mindset and setting it up ruins the characters. If you change too much, she just because older fanon Daphne Greengrass. I'm not going to right out say it can't be done, but I will say it probably won't be done well.

I think it belongs solely to the realm of crack! pairings like above.
