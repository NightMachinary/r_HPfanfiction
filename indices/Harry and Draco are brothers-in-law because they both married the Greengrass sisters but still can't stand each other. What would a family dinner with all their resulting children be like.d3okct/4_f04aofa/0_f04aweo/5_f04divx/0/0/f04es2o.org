Haven't read it but I'm sure there are a few of em out there. Seems like something the eldest Malfoy would do to his son to acquire an heir. Especially, if you follow the Drarry and/or gay Draco plotline. I'd imagine even as a full grown adult, Draco wouldn't be in control of his life if his father was still breathing down his back.
