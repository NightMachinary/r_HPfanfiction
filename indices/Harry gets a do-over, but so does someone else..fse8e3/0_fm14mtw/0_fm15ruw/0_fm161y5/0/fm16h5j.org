I agree. I haven't really been able to find a lot of fanfictions with a decent Colin character. All of the ones I've read either have him as an exaggerated version of his canon "fanboy" persona or don't include him at all other than a passing mention. Which is a shame, especially considering the way he died during the final battle shows he could have had great character development even in canon.
