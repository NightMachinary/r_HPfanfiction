I encourage you to read some, and come back, and then we'll discuss it. See if it still seems bizarre. I'm so use to it now, I can't imagine them not being together...

He's so dark, and Hermione loves knowledge, but she has such a sense of right and wrong. Lord Voldemort teaches her to let down some of her inhibitions (eventually, and often under duress) and see that power and knowledge aren't evil. Lord Voldemort, when really studying Hermione, I couldn't imagine him not being intrigued---she's a brilliant witch, powerful and clever. Imagine, that had Hermione grown up with Tom Riddle from first year Hogwarts that his opinion on blood status could have been different, because they would have been constantly competing. There are actually a few fics, where Hermione goes back in time to Tom's last year and they become involved for similar reasons.

Just curious, have you ever read Snape and Hermione? I like them together too....
