Hmm. I can't imagine Voldemort's partner NOT being submissive. How would you imagine Hermione? I prefer as in character as possible, even when making the leap to a pairing with Voldemort. I think with Ron she'll take dominant role, but that's just because Ron is a twat and his mother is dominant, so of course he'd want that in a wife.

Your story, is it a drama or comedy?
