I can't tell if this is your way of telling me voldemort/hermione is in no feesible way a realistic possibility as a couple (I use the word "realistic" tentatively, as we are discussing a fictional story within the context of fanfiction) or if you just wanted a place to talk about your Harry/lily story and this seemed like your safest bet.
