I always wanted to write a Harry and Lily ship. It would be one about how Harry is sent back in time and loses his memory. He competes with his dad for the love of Lily, eventually teaming up with an oddly muggle-loving Lucius and very sexual Amelia Bones. Somehow Ron is there and everyone pisses all over him again, like all other fics. I'll call it, "Gotta love dat Lily"! Oh and in the last chapter, Voldemort will be defeated.

Hey, I'm already writing a fic about Harry being burned alive, might as well write a Lily/Harry story.
