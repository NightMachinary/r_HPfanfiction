The idea of Luna and Voldemort together is fascinating. I'm going to start reading it tonight. Now. After this comment. Hmmm. I wonder what angle the author will come from with this...

Thanks! I'll definitely read Tied for Last too, once I've sated my curiosity. Oh, and if you haven't read my above mentioned favs (and don't mind a little sex and violence) you should try those out. I ship Hermione and Voldemort pretty hard.
