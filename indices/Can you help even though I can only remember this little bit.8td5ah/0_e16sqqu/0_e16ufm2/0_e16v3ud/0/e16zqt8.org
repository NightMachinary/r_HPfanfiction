I hadn't considered that they were canon rehashes because the question is mostly "what would happen if sirius was inserted at age 8?" and so Year 1 would have still had the stone, year 2 Malfoy would still have tried to get rid of the diary. But there's major divergence with a bunch of stuff that would be spoilers. In my mind, the first 2 books are slowly slowly turning from Canon. A butterfly flaps its wings and it causes a hurricane... But it doesn't happen overnight.

I guess it does have the stations of year 1 and 2, but there's so much before year 1 and non harry storyline that I guess I didn't notice. But like, year 3 doesn't have the prisoner of Azkaban because sirius is already out. Shit is a lot more intense going into year 4 than canon. If moody gets polyjuiced and the graveyard scene happens and Cedric dies, you can all have I told you so rights.
