I'm pretty sure I just read this one! I think you might be looking for Innocent by MarauderLover7. It involves Sirius escaping Azkaban earlier than in canon and raising Harry after taking him from the Dursleys and has Draco being groomed to become a Gryffindor while his brother (Hydrus, I think?) is still being raised to be a Slytherin.
