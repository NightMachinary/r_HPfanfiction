  Overpopulation? And if to combat overpopulation they stop having children it would lead to social stagnation.

Why do you assume that "social stagnation", whatever that is, would necessarily bad? And of course magical immortality wouldn't be the immortality of senescence, but of youth; nobody's goal is to remain alive whilst being increasingly, but never completely, moribund.

On the plus side, long-term consequences would suddenly matter. If the dead Koch brother had had to live through the coming resource wars, would he have ruined the earth still?

  Other countries? The fact everyone regardless of who they are is immortal? If people aren't made immortal at birth who is given the power to chose who receives immortality?
#+end_quote

Is everyone immortal or just some? But if course everyone who wants it gets immortality.

  These are just off the top of my head there's probably a lot more.

None that are prohibitive, and then the question becomes if our resistance to immortality is more than a coping mechanism for its erstwhile impossibility.
