  "You are not fooling me, Harry," said the old wizard; his face looked ancient now, and lined by more than years. "I know why you are truly asking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do not have to, your hesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for yourself!"

  "Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for /everyone!/â€¯"
