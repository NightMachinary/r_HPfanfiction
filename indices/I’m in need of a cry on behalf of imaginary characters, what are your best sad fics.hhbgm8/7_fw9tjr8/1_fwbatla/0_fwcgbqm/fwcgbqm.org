It actually made me look up the painting referenced for them standing guard. And I love that Percy was the first Seeker he played against but he's sworn everybody to secrecy. But most of all I love that Harry uses ALL of the tribute forms he could think of, instead of just choosing one.

There are a few sequels, too. Check the author page.
