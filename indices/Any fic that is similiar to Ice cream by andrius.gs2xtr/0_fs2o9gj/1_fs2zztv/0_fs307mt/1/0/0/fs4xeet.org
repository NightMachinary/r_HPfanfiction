I have been pretty deeply rooted in anything gaming for the last 30 years, anime is a bit newer for me but I have seen the most standout series since a friend got me hooked by making me watch "Elfenlied" like 15 years ago. Was pretty fuckin disturbing, but as I said, it got me hooked. And I have read my fair share of HP crossovers with various animes, many of which I didn't know before.

Sounds like I might enjoy those stories, will definitely give them a try. Thanks for answering!
