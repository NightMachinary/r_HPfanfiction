I read your story a while ago, and only re-read the prologue. If your story goes in a different direction later, then keep that in mind. Generally, I would argue /against/ tags like that, because they tend to mark stories which are terrible and cliche filled. Have you ever read a story tagged "Dumbledore!Bashing" which was a excellently written character study? But some readers do like them, and I'll admit I have read stories just because of their tags in the past. So while I've tried to write this without tags, you might still want to add them later. I would still recommend you attempt to get across the storyline without it first.

Next, do you want to stand out (and risk loosing readers), or do you want to play it safe (and risk being lost)? While you have a great little story, it isn't an original idea at all. If you want to stand out, a more abstract summary is in order. If you play it safe, doing what everyone else has is fine.

Play it safe:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's life has always felt a bit like a game, with evil relatives and cupboard bedroom. So when he wakes to hovering blue boxes and game mechanics, it isn't really that much of a surprise. Now, he just has to be smart about this. Logical. Take this as the gift it is... and find every loophole possible. After all, what's a game without a little cheating?

Something a little more out there:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's always liked blue. Blue is the sky he can't see in his cupboard. Blue is the ocean he has only read about. Blue is the alert he has leveled up. Blue is freedom. Blue is life.

Both, without a single tag, get across that your story is a gamer story, with Harry as the MC. The first hints he might be smarter (or at least more cunning) then canon Harry. The second is a little more mysterious, but may not fit with your more humorous plots.

My attempt at humor:

  Harry wonders if anything is ever real, or if it is all just an illusion from too much time spent in all too perfect suburbia. He may only be 8 years old, but even he can see it's all rendered a bit too sharply. 'Ping! WIS+2'. Awesome! Totally worth the existential crisis.
