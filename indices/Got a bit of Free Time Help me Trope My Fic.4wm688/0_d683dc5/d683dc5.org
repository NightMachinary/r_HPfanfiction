This is a great fic and self-promotion is not considered a bad thing on this subreddit as long as you listen to the feedback and don't post the same post multiple times.

Honestly (I think I speak for the majority on this) we really like to help others out and so you don't need to seem like so guilty in this.

Also your fic is great and I am really enjoying it. The whole house elf thing is one of the most original ideas I have seen in some time.

Here's my attempt at a summary for you (no offense but your summary is really bad, like absolutely atrocious but mine might be just as bad): With the powers of the Gamer, Harry sets out to right the wrongs of the Wizarding World with tons of sarcasm while trying to stay alive in a world where many wish him dead and uncovering arcane magics forgotten by most. RavenclawHarry! SuperHarry!
