linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20; inspected by no 13; Harry's little army of psychos; Fantastic elves and where to find them; Harry The Hufflepuff)

Natural 20 is a D&D crossover with Harry Potter. It's got plenty of funny moments, but also some serious ones so I'm not sure it's purely crack.

Inspected by no 13 takes strong advantage of the bureaucracy of the British ministry of magic to bypass every problem.

Army of psychos is a oneshot but it's a pretty funny take on how to defeat Voldemort.

Fantastic elves and its sequal are both pretty cracky. Harry leaves the Dursleys and lives as an elf. But the fic is better than I made it sound I promise.

Harry The Hufflepuff is interested in the finer things in life like sleeping. Also has a few more parts by the same author so don't miss those.

And that's all I can think of right now
