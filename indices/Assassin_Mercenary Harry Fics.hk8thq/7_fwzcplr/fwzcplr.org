linkffn(A Shadowed Soul by devilblondie). Good, but not quite to my taste.

linkffn(Death's Servant by MikeMc). I haven't read this one yet, so I can't say anything other than Harry is trained as an assassin from age 8.

I don't remember if it has anything specifically "assassin" in it, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marcello School by Kjkit) has Harry accidentally apparating to a hidden school of magical combat.

linkffn(Harry Potter Mercenary by DobbyElfLord) is what it says on the tin. Not trained, really, but very mercenary.
