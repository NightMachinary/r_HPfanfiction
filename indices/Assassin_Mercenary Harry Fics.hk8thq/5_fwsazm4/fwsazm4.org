I'm working on one (unpublished, at this point, because I'm not sure about the reception it'll get, and want to get a little more done) where the Potters originated from Discworld, and on almost dying, Death takes Harry back with him, to school in the Assassin's Guild.

This is going to end up being a Harry who is torn between that moment when he strikes, and trades misery and suffering for clarity, one who can see the bright, clear path to all his goals, and one torn by the guilt and horror over the blood on his hands, what he's become, and how he got there.
