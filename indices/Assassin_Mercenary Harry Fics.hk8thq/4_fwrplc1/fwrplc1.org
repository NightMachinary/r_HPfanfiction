There's a couple of drabbles/shorts in Rorschach's Blot's collection called Odd Ideas. In one Harry becomes a goblin mercenary basically the goblins accept contracts on deatheaters and they pay harry to do the job. In another Harry ends up in another dimension and becomes a warrior wizard/mercenary. Dumbledore pulls Harry back to this dimension so he can battle Voldemort.
