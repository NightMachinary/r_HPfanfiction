frombluetored's Its TeaTime series has some great OC's that i have come to love; they are the Potter kids friends at Hogwarts and in the 3rd story in the series, Harry's kids are married with kids of their own. Also Annerb's The Changeling series has some great OC's too, and a shout out to jenorama's Potterverse, particularly Ginny's gay best friend, Ben. All great, well written stories, loving these OC's are a bonus!
