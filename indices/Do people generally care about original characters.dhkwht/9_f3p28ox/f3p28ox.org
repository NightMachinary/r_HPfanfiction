I don't mind OCs as long as they play a proper role and have good characterisation, as long as they are interesting. In one of my fics I even have 3 OCs who are a constant presence and play a major part in my MC's life. I am not saying I am a professional when it comes to the characterisation of OCs, but so far there was no complaint, some even outright stated they like the relationship my MC has with them. So, I assume that generally scepticism towards OCs exists but for the most part, if they are interesting enough and are more than the writer's fantasy fulfilment, people won't mind reading about them.
