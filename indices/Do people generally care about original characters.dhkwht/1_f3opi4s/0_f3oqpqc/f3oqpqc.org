That's an interesting point you made. I planned this character to be the other child of Voldemort, who unlike Delphini is trying their best to resist their evil heritage. Since the character's parents are extremely powerful it would be easy to make that mistake you mentioned, so I would have to make sure to write the character with enough flaws that they seem realistic.
