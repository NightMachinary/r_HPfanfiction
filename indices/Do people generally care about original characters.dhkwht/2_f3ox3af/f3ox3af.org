I'll say original characters have a higher bar for people to like it. You'll get tons of fans of even a low-effort Harry In Name Only, but with OCs, people will likely either be mean or not read it if the story is bad. That said, if the story is at least decent, the response should be fine, and I've read plenty of excellent stories with good OCs, including what I'd consider the absolute best fanfics. (Harry Potter and the Natural 20, Grow Young With Me, and others)
