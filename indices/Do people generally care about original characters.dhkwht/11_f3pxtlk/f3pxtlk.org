Not really. After all, most mildly divergent stories employ named characters from HP that are functionally OCs with how little is actually known.

Whats really a problem is when people create /pointless/ OCs, which is just a function of a larger problem endemic to fanfiction as a whole. They often serve very obvious purposes that could be filled more easily by existing characters, or are so 1-dimensional you couldn't draw a point small enough with a pencil.

Basically, OCs are only a problem if the writing/story is lower-quality, in which case I wouldn't be reading anyway. Case-in-point, the Alexandra Quick series is more or less entirely OCs and is still entertaining because its fairly well written and different.
