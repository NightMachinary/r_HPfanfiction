Very helpful points. Thanks a lot for taking the time to write this, and I'd be open to more suggestions of course. It does seem that many people hate CC and I kind of do too because of how it leaves so many questions unanswered as to how the wizarding world has been since Voldemort was defeated. I've given it some thought and think that maybe if the OC wasn't another child of Voldemort, but one of the many children of still loyal death eaters who have been raised to be evil (sort of like home-grown and raised terrorists). That way there could be like a cabal of children raised to be weapons against the Ministry, and one would break away and try to be good.
