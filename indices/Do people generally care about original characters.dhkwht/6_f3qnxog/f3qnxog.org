The problem with OCs is that they are hard to write. It is not easy to imagine a character out of nothing while also making it fit with the rest of the pre-established world. So, many people fail at that task, creating OCs that don't feel like actual humans, they feel forced and inserted into a story for the sake of it.

I saw in a comment of yours that you want to create a different child of Voldemort, one that "unlike Delphini is trying their best to resist their evil heritage". Now, I don't care much for the Cursed Child (and to be honest, I prefer to pretend it doesn't exist) but if you intend for your fic to take place during CC, I'll have to warn you that, like me, a lot of people don't like the Cursed Child and will stay away off any fanfiction with it.

Also, keep in mind that Delphini is nothing but the product of her upbringing. It doesn't matter that she is the daughter of Tom Riddle, she only did what she though was best for herself. You need to think hard about how exactly you are going to have an opposite to her. I would give a few suggestions but I don't want to dictate your story, it is your vision.

(Though try to not overdo it with the weaknesses. If you want a powerful character, aim for weaknesses that relate more to phycological effects, eg: large ego, arogance, overdependence on self, emotionally unstable. Have those mental weaknesses aswell as lack of training hold him/her back on the fighting end. Don't give the OC random battle weaknesses [without the mental ones at least], IMO that's a cheap way of balancing power)

I would like you to keep in mind, that a realistic character is never pure evil, is never evil from birth and will always think that they are doing the right thing. No one truly thinks of themselves as the bad guy.
