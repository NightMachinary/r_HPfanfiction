Some people do, some people don't - really, the extra jump you need to make for an OC is to have a reason for having them (in most peoples mind).

For instance, if you wrote out Harry and instead had an OC named John who was the Boy-Who-Lived, functionally there's no reason to have that OC - he just fills the role of Harry, and people would wonder why you don't just have it be Harry.

For other wizards, most people find it easier (and more accepted) to wrap their OC in the cloak of one of the myriad of basically faceless background characters. For instance, if you're writing a story with an OC Good Slytherin love interest for Harry, it's much easier to just slide in Daphne Greengrass or Tracey Davis into that role, most of the time. It's the exact same effect in essentially being an OC - just with a veneer of canon over the top of it.

I would imagine an OC works best if you pick a time period we don't know as much about. For instance, setting it during the main series makes it harder to justify an OC over changing an existing character - but if you do it before/after, there are fewer ones you can snag and so you're more free to slide in an OC more seemlessly.

With that in mind, what's the OC you've got in mind, and what's the high level idea?
