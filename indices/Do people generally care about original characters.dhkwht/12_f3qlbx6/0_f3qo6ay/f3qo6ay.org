Well I wouldn't say it's a high level idea, but after reading Cursed Child I was just wondering you know there are probably a lot more children raised just like Delphi who would have been fanatical about Voldemort. Children of escaped, surviving or hiding death eaters for one, and I just thought you know, we'll what if amongst all these terribly fanatical children there was one who tried to be good? I don't know, I just thought it would've been nice to see someone who was raised to be bad and has a base lineage try so hard to be good and possibly fail.
