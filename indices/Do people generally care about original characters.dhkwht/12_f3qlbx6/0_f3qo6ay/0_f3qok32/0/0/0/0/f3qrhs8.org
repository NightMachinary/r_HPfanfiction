Well, you /could/ do a split POV then - half from the perspective of Albus or Scorpius (which will frankly be essentially OCs) and half from the perspective of your OC.

Oh, and for the comedic aspect - for some reason, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/aw0csj/draco_thinks_the_trio_are_his_best_friends/][this]] was what came to mind for it. Not at all sure why it popped into my mind in the first place, but it is that type of dynamic/disconnect that could be a fun one.
