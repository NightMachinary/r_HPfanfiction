There was a lot of drabbles, but I found the one shot you meant. That's really was a prefect explanation as to why Ron sat with Harry. I really enjoy that insight into Ron's mind at that point.

The only slight nick pick I had was the fact Ron first met Harry at the 9 and 3/4 entrance so he would've notice Harry's attire at that point. I think the one shot could still go in the exact same direction but also include that Ron was more comfortable sitting with Harry base on Ron's thought process.

Overall, a wonderful read through.
