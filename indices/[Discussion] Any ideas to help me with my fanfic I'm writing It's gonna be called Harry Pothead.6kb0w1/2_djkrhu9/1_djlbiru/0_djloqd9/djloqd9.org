I can't think of any rune-centred fics right now, other than Basiliskbor, linkffn(10709411). However that one still doesn't focus 100% runes. But uses runes and rituals as a centre. It's interesting. Has a great concept, but can get a bit tropey. Also, I think the chapters have now been beta'ed so it may be better than when I was reading through it.

By the way, it is still ongoing. But has a good deal of close to 50 chapters out.
