Don't try so hard to be funny. Stoner "humour" is pretty crap, and unless you want the fic to wear the crackfic moniker (and deserve it, to be honest), cut the dumb pot puns. They're boring, and overdone, and irritating. Also, coping with life by self-medicating with pot is kind of a dark place to take things. The need to escape from reality into a haze of drugs is a particularly nasty strain of toxic masculinity, and not really all that funny. It ends up sounding kind of desperate and depressing.

If you're going for funny, steer clear of the self-medicating, the dumb stoner puns, and the other stuff that makes it irritating. If the dude discovers that Wizarding Britain doesn't really frown on pot use, and that teachers use the stuff to relax, and Harry manages to get his hands on the Herbology department's stash once in a while, fair enough. If he and his best friends occasionally sneak off to the edge of the Forbidden Forest and indulge in a bit of pot smoking, sure no problem. If the trio manage to convince Dobby to make them edibles, and have to somehow hide the results of them, great.

There's a million different places you could take this that doesn't end up cringe-worthy, cracky, or depressing.
