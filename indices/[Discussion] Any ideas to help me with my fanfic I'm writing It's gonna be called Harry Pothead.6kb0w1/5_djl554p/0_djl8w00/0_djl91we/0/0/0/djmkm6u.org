That would work. I think I could do that.\\
Harry carefully tip-toed through the halls, making his way to the garage. Occasionally, the floorboards would creak, making him freeze on the spot, wait a minute, then slowly continue. He was only a couple steps away from the garage door now. Reaching out, he turned the doorknob, not too fast, but not that slow. After what felt like an eternity, Harry had the door ajar just enough to slip through. Taking out his weak flashlight, Harry pressed a button, and the light came on.\\
Only two minutes later, Harry found /it/, the air-tight, green metal box. It was about a 2 foot big cube, with a flip open lid that required a key to unlock. Luckily, Harry had unlocked the box before he went to bed, when Uncle Vernon was in the bathroom. He only had a minute, so he could take anything.\\
Harry grinned as he used his empty hand to slowly open the box, the dank smell emanating from the container.\\
Weed.\\
There was a large mason jar in one corner, nearly full with weed. From what Harry had learned, he could tell it was high quality. There were two multi-chambered bongs, recently cleaned, right next to the mason jar. Next to those were 4 grinders of different sizes, with a water-pipe resting on top. Scattered around the rest of the box were several pipes of different sizes, an herbal-vape, a pack of RAW rolling paper, RAW pre-shaped cones (making it easier to make a joint), and *lots* of lighters.\\
There was still a lot of room, but Harry was certain all the other contents were scattered about, in a car, in Uncle Vernon's bedroom, etc, etc.\\
Harry filled half of a small plastic bag with weed, grabbed a few rolling papers, a lighter (which he made sure was pretty full). But then he realized a grinder would be noticed if missing, even with the Dursley's somewhat shit memories. Harry sighed as he took the weed out of the bag, and spend a couple minutes grinding it all. Then he smiled as he realized how much kief was in the grinders. He took as much as he could, making sure to leave enough to avoid suspicion.\\
So here he was, in his bedroom, a towel stopping the smoke from going under a door, his window open, and lavender-scented spray. /Damn/, Harry though with a grin, /this is gonna be a fantastic summer/.

HOLY SHIT! All of that was on the spot by the way. Thanks for the idea.
