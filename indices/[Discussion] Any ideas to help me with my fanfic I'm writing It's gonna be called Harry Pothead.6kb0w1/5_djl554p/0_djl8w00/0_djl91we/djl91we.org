If you ease up a skosh on how heavy-handed the Dursleys are (i know it's out of character, but you get where I'm going), then Harry smoking a little pot to relax from his stress doesn't come off as quite so depressing. You know what I'm saying? Like, if they're the level of extra they are in the books (locking him in his room, the under the cupboard shit, etc), and he's starting to take drugs to cope with it, the whole thing sounds depressing. If they're just assholes in a general sense, and he's a bit stressed out, but not developmentally damaged in any way, it's more like, "Oh he's like a typical high school kid whose life kind of lowkey sucks, and he just wants something to relax with". Get where I'm goin'?
