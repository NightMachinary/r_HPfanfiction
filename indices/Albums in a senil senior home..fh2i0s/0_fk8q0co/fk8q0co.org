I can't remember the name of the fic, but I think it's a Robst fic or a Rune Stone Path fic. The Flamels approach them anonymously (and one of them guesses it based on their similar names - winning them a trip to San Diego Comicon) and offer to take care of Dumbledore when he oversteps. They bind his magic and put him in a care home that he repeatedly tries to escape after receiving charmed newspapers telling of Harry's exploits.

I think it's probably Rune Stone Path, because I remember one of the articles being about Harry's 'necromantic habits', which is a minor plot point in Rune Stone Path.
