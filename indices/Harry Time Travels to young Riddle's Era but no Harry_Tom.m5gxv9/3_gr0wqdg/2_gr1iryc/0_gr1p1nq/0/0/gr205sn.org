Again, I think you're thinking of a different fic. Maybe the fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349][Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat]] which is somewhat similar in the time travel genre but is a Tom/Harry fic? I just double checked the author notes again and this statement is the closest thing to implying a ship, with the answer implying unlikely:

"As of right now, Harry and Tom probably won't be in a romantic relationship, which is why I left it was just a "&" rather than a "/", though that could be liable to change depending on how the story develops. Rest assured, I will change the tags if that does happen, and give you guys an heads up."
