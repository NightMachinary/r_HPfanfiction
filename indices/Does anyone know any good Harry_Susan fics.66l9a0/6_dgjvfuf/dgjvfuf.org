[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569/chapters/12150143][Seven Names]] was an enjoyable fic that I read recently. It features Harry/Susan (and fits your other requirements) and both are major characters in the fic, but it's not the main focus.

  And there are quite a few people who want to talk to her.
