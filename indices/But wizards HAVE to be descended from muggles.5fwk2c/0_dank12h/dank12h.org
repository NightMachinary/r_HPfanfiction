Of course there is logic behind the argument. Since there is nothing written to indicate otherwise, the first wizard could be anything and therefore any lore as to where and when magic was first seen in humans is valid and logical (or illogical as we are talking about magic).

Maybe they did start out as muggleborns. Maybe some divine power bestowed it upon his chosen people. Maybe muggles are the one who came from those who have lost magic. Maybe wizards are really just the descendants of the last surviving Marsians after their planet got robbed of water and air.

It really doesn't matter. Arguing about it is futile as there is nothing but guesswork about it. Being mad about it goes even a level higher and is, truly, the only utterly stupid thing here.
