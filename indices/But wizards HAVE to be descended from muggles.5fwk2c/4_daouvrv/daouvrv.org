There is no logic in saying either way as its fucking fiction! Why people get so upset about somebody else's headcanon or their fic's universe's history just boggles my mind. It doesn't have to make sense! Despite [[/u/taure]] 's best efforts, this is [[/r/hpfanfiction]] not /r/hpExtremelyPedanticMagicalHistoryClass Y'all need to get over yourselves and learn to stop worrying and love the +cruciatus+ fics.
