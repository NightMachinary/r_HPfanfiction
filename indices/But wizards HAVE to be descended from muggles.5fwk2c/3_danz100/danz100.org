Personally I see muggles and wizards as two evolutionary branches or something that are capable of breeding with each other; heck, for all we know it might be that it's the introduction of the muggle blood to the wizarding bodies sometime in the past so distant that nobody remembers it is what caused the squibs to become a thing.

That said, we really do not know one way or another, and I don't mind any version anyone chooses to see as what happened in their stories.
