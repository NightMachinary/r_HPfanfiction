I actually usually end up writing Hagrid out of things because I'm scared of getting the dialogue wrong. I've looked up in the past if someone made a collection of quotes from him and studied them to get the "formula" or how JKR did it. Like what rules did she follow for how he spoke that we could follow and get it right.

If anyone has the ability, skill, desire to do that I think they'd be doing the fandom a tremendous service.
