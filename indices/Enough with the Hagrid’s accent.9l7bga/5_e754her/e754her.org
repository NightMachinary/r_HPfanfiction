I might be wrong but doesn't the accent intensify in the books when Hagrid is agitated or sad or drunk (in general when he is influenced somehow)?

I always pictured him to be mumbling a lot into his beard, losing a few letters in the process. I didn't really think he would have an accent because back when I read the books I didn't know about different English accents.
