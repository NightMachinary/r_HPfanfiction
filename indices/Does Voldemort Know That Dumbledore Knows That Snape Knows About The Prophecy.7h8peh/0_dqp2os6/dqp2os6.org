Dumbledore saw Snape when he overheard the prophecy. Even Trelawney saw Snape and while i imagine Dumbledore didn't immediately realize that Snape had actually overheard anything significant, but once he knew that Snape was a death eater and Voldemort knew about the prohpecy it would have been pretty obvious.
