Well since Voldemort took the prophecy seriously he probably used legilimency or a pensieve with Snape to see the memory, which would reveal Snape getting caught, because Voldemort would no doubt demand to see the reason why Snape couldn't bring him the full prophecy.

Voldemort would certainly suspect that Dumbledore knew about it all.
