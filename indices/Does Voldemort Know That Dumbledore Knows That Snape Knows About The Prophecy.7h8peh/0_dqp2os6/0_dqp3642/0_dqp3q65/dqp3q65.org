Dumbledore does not have to trust Snape . What Voldemort knows is that Snape somehow managed to get Dumbledore to recruit him and even someone who is not fully trusted could ferret out valuable information. Snape could probably use the fact that Dumbledore supposedly does not trust him to give less information to Voldemort.

Voldemort knows that Snape is a double agent he just assumes that Snapes ultimate loyalty is to him.
