Oh my gosh that would be amazing! I was starting to lose hope that I would ever be able to get some of these stories again so if I have to wait a little bit that is totally fine.

What might be the best way to get the files from you? Are all of the hpfandom files like in one big folder u can just zip and send to my email. Or should I sent up a place you can upload too? Anything! I'm just so happy that you might have copies, most of my stories are old so there is a good chance you have them!
