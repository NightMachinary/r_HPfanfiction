haha the problem is they're both very big files. I can send you the copies of the individual fics I have currently (PM me your email), but the entire archives will have to wait a bit. Sending them via email won't work because the zip file itself will be a couple of gigabytes (I think most emails limit attachments to 25 megabytes at most). I'll have to figure out a good way to share the files.
