I'm pretty sure I have most of HPFandom and TheHexFiles. There are thousands that I systematically saved in 2014 and 2015 for both sites, so while I don't have the newest uploads for those sites, there likely weren't many new fics. I have HPFandom ready to go, but TheHexFiles are on a computer I won't have access to for a while.
