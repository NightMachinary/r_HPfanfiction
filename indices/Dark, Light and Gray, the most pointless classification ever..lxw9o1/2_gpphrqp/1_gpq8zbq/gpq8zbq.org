They often don't use those labels, in many fics they instead call themselves purebloods and say the light are blood traitors. This makes them seem like "honorable defenders of tradition" while the blood traitors label makes them look like... Well, traitors.

But you're right, if they did use the dark label there would have to be a good reason for it or else it's just making them look bad. Maybe that the word dark has a better connotation in the wizarding world than in ours. I'll often see the defence in dark!Harry fics where dark magic "isn't actually evil it's the user who makes it evil" (despite dark magic literally being designed to create suffering and death and tear apart souls, but fanfic is able to change canon so... Fair enough). Or as a rebellious way of embracing the hatred that had bogged them down for centuries. Irl some disadvantaged groups will embrace the slurs that had defined them as a way of reclaiming power (e.g. the n word).

Sorry for the rant lol its just that I /just/ learned about stuff like this in my sociology class so it's fresh on my mind.
