Yeah, I actually thought about mentioning this, and as I responded to another commenter, it makes sense if it is addressed in the fic. I.e. in one fic Harry considered "Dark Arts" to mean dark as in "hidden, obscure, kept in the dark, secret." But most fics I've read don't address this.

And yeah in a lot of fics the "Dark" side doesn't self-identify as such, but in some they do without any explanation of why they accept this label from the "Light" side, which messes with my suspension of disbelief.

In fact an easy explanation would be the one I gave as an example: the "Dark" side wants to keep magic hidden from even muggleborns (perhaps) while the Light side wants to either bring the muggleborns into the light, or bring the knowledge of magic into the light for muggleborns (and therefore their families) to see. I've never seen this done though.
