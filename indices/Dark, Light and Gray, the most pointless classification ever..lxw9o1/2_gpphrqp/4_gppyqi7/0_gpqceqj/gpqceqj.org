I don't assume that, but in the context of these stories that is how "Dark" "Grey" and "Light" are portrayed (generally, there are exceptions). If we as readers are shown Light characters speaking about their side and equating it with Good, and the Dark factions as Bad/Evil, and then show the Dark characters also using those terms without giving their perspective on why Dark does not mean Evil, it seriously challenges my suspension of disbelief.
