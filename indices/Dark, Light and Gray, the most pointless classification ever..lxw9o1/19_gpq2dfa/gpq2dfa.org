Agreed, I always disliked when the factions openly called themselves by those names.

It always made more sense for me they would use more "political" terms, like Traditionalists, Progressives, and the Moderates, which is basically a /very/ basic definition of political leanings IRL.

It would also make sense for these factions to be divided further and only unite when needed or properly articulated.

Even post-scarcity societies would have different views on certain aspects of their culture.

It would make sense for people to use the other terms as simplifications, though it's much more probable most people would see it as only having two options, placing those that were "on the fence" with those they had more of a leaning with.

On Pottermore JKR has said the Wizengamot is Legislative too, IIRC, it also can make well-written political fics more interesting.
