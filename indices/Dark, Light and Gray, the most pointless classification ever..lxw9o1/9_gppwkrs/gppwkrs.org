Overall I agree that Light, Dark, Grey works best on an individual level, I have seen it done decently.

In fics where L/D/G is an individual classification, I've seen it be used as an indicator as to what members of the family normally is (typically for these fics Light = Control, Dark = Power, grey either doesn't exist or is for inconsistent families).

Another thing I saw once was using Dark as traditional, Light as progressive, and Grey as centrists.
