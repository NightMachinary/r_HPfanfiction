Complaining that a fantasy series behaves in a way that is unrealistic compared to the real world just seems pointless to me.

Is the naming system a bit silly? Sure. However it's just a three party system. It's not absurd.

Families sticking together for political solidarity in fantasy is nothing new. Look at Game of Thrones. That series is filled with family based factions that work with other families to make larger factions.
