I think so, too. I can definitely see some Star Wars influence. I feel like it may also be seeping over from things like DnD and the character allignment charts, though, I kind of wish those were used more for tagging purposes instead of the dark, light, grey tags. Sometimes I DO want to read about a Harry Potter who casts unforgiveable curses and decides blood purity is the way to go (so I can then search Dark!Harry), but when the character in the story then proceeds to announce that he is dark to everyone within ear shot, that is when this stuff gets old fast. IDK, now I am just ranting :)
