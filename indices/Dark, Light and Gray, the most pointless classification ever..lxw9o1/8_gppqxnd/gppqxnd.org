I suspect this is just one of these things that happen naturally, like people see the "Dark Arts" so the opposite must also be true, I also think it's influence from Star Wars, which is another huge fanfic fandom and I'm sure there's a lot of x-over with them, just like the neglecful parents in WBWL stories somehow happens in Naruto fics. It's a just a trope that overlays fandoms.
