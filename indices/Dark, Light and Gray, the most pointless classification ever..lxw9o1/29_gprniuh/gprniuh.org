I don't dislike the trope. There are plenty of interesting things you can do with it if you're creative (if they are that way, think about why they are, and what consequences would arise from them being so). But I do admit there are easier ways to do interesting things with other ideas. And there are so many other ideas to play around with.

Like, we know bugger all about the Wizengamot. It's literally just a group of old people sitting in a room who turned up to Harry's trial that one time (slight hyperbole). You can make up most anything and it'll fit with them - are they meritocrats? Are they judges? Is this a military junta of ex-aurors and magical badasses? Are they all hereditary nobles? Did they pull a wand out of a stone to become +Kings/Queens of England+Members of the Wizengamot? Do they meet regularly, or only when something happens? Do they regulate or pass laws, or do they only mediate things?

Plenty of potential to play with. :)
