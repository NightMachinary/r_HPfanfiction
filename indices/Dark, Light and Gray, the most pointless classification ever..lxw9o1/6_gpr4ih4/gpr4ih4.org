Just on one aspect of your question: I don't believe the Wizarding World represents a post-scarcity society. If it was, the Weasleys wouldn't need second-hand clothes and books, Mundungus Fletcher wouldn't need to steal, and in fact the whole idea of a currency would go out of the window.

There are some items that magic cannot create: we know that food can't be created from nothing, for instance, and it follows that certain potion ingredients can't be conjured either. Furthermore, several items require expertise to create - wands and the like. A post-scarcity society is one such as the Culture in Iain M Banks' novels, where none of these constraints apply.
