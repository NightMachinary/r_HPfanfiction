I know how you feel. In a fic concept that's been on my backburner for years now and might never get written because I'm reluctant on getting into this fandom, one idea I had was flat-out rejecting these ideological divisions by pointing out how */nobody/* other than the ideologists actually wants this status quo. The huge majority of magical Britain's people are sick and tired of with-us-or-against-us warlord wannabes popping up to force them to pick a side in an arbitrary division */every goddamn century/*, they are sick and tired of seeing gullible youth getting their minds poisoned with propaganda to make them go get themselves killed for heroic causes */every goddamn generation/*, they are sick and tired of their family and friends getting caught in the crossfire as collateral damage no matter which side started it this time.

They just want to */LIVE THEIR FREAKING LIVES IN PEACE./* To such an extent that there would be at least one incident of a Death Eater attack unexpectedly ending in the DEs getting swarmed and violently beaten to death by an angry mob of locals for whom the terror attack attempt was the final spark that set off the powder keg, with every single DE retaliatory massacre aimed at intimidating the people on the street back into quiet sheep compliance only throwing more fuel on the fire. The war is won not by a handful of champions, but by the little people on the street stepping up and saying "/this is over because/ */WE/* /say it's over/".

It doesn't matter how powerful you are. If nobody is following you, you're only a leader of yourself.
