I'd rather say dark, light, and neutral for different political views. But then there's Dark, Light, and Grey for "magic classification." Like a genetic way your magic swings or whatever. Like you're better at that type of magic over others. And Dark magic is just a different type of magic. Like how some people are better at Charms while others are better at Transfiguration. Some people are better at Dark magic, some Light, and then there's Grey magic which is strictly neither light nor dark but also both.

For my own headcanon (which I don't always use), when you join the Wizengamot (like when your parents step down) and you're inducted, you get to choose whether or not you're conservative, neutral, or liberal (is that the right word?). And you can change this at any time.
