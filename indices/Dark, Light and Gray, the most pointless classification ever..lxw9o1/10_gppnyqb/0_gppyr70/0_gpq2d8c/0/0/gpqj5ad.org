In the case of people like Ahsoka (and Jolee Bindo and others), Grey here just means "not part of the Order/disagreement with dogma." They still only use the "Light" side of the Force. Fundamentally they're Jedi at a metaphysical level.

The Nightsisters are their own issue depending on continuity but I'd say they lean Dark.

Fallen Jedi have to be taken on a case by case basis, and Dooku just hadn't been doing it for long enough or was perhaps a bit resistant. A fundamental metaphysical fact within Star Wars is that the Dark Side of the Force /will/ corrupt you no matter what (which is why the Sith Code is a gigantic lie), neutral force nexii like pre-Force-War Tython notwithstanding as an exception. It's just a matter of time. It's like an addictive drug, really.
