You could argue for the case of grey jedi, such as Tano. Other groups such as the Nightsisters could be argued as a shade of grey, or at the very least only slightly dark. Fallen Jedi might not count as fully dark, and Count Dooku was never a fully fledged sith with his lack of sith corruption, just a fallen Jedi with a sith name and some dark side abilities.
