A perfect real world example of Dark not necessarily meaning evil, would be Donald Trump and the Republicans. If you view Donald Trump as Voldemort and the Republicans as Dark. You have a number of Republicans that worship the ground Trump walks on and believe totally in what he says. On the other hand, you have Republicans that totally disagree with Trump and view him as a cancer on the country. (NOTE - This is not intended as a political statement one way or the other, it is just used as an example only).
