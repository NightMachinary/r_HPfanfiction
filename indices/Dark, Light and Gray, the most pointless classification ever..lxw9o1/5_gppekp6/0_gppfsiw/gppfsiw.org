While I could accept that there is a partisan divide in the Wizarding World, I can't accept such a clear distinction. Dark in fanon usually means practising Dark Magic, casting Unforgivables and generally being racist as fuck. Nobody wants to be called that, ever. I can see that being the case in 1600s but not when a half-blood is the Chief Warlock and muggleborns are accepted everywhere. It's just bad politics and totally stupid.

Again, talking about fanon here.

As for canon, even Lucius Malfoy tried to present himself as a moderate, compassionate wizard. His interaction with Arthur Weasley points to that. He insinuated, taunted, but as a Voldemort's chief supporter never dared to be obvious about his political views. The whole Dark, Light and Gray thing is just poor writing on behalf of fanfiction authors. In my opinion at least.

It has nothing to do with real world politics, or at least is a simplistic reduction of such.
