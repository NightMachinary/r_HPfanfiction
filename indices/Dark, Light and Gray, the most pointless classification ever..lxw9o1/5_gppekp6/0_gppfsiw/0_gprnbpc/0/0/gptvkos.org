Arthur's office is basically a broom cupboard, and his job is considered a joke or unimportant. (Before his promotion.) Lucius Malfoy, on the other hand, has Fudge in his pocket -- he bribes him --, and is otherwise a notable figure in the wizarding world (before his Azkaban stint), as he gets to comment on issues in the Daily Prophet and is recognised on sight and by name.

Furthermore, Muggleborns exist in the Wizarding World, indeed, and that's pretty much it. There was one Muggleborn Minister of Magic since ever, and he was subsequently poisoned by Abraxas Malfoy in the '60s. (Of course nothing was ever proven.) And the one Muggleborn Department Head, a highly skilled wizard able to do probably any job, got the joke department of Goblin Liaison. The general view of Muggleborns, in turn, appears to be Slughorn's 'Oh no, I'm not prejudiced. I recognise talent. I'm just surprised a Muggleborn is this talented.' I suppose that's one step up from 'I can't be racist, my gardener is black.'

But yes, your point was with Fanon. I'm just trying to figure out if our different views of Canon might be a reason why I'm not sure I understand your point?

If it's just about the /names/ Dark/Light/Grey, others have pointed out you might as well call them Progressives, Conservatives and Neutrals, and a lot of stories do, sometimes they even do both. If it's about the bipartition as such, though, I don't see this as illogical. Such a thing is quite common, dating all the way back to the Roman Republic, since it's exactly what happens if you have a highly polarising issue /and/ make that issue a central issue in politics (with the Romans, it was land (re-)distribution for veterans, and lead to civil war). This would be true for both the issues "Muggleborns" and "Dark Magic".

And as for political platforms, if your point is /no one would campaign or rally around 'let's be more excluding'/, I refer to real life as well as what I wrote above, plus adding that Voldemort succesfully perfomed a coup and installed a Minister that managed to go literal Nazi for an entire year without any hassle, until Harry decided it was time for a counter-revolution. Without him, Thicknesse would still be Minister.

What I would say, however, is that the splits might be off. If you had those two blocks plus centre, the Conservatives/Dark faction would probably on the lower end of 1/3. We know 20% are Muggleborns, and Purebloods and Halfbloods 40% each. If there /was/ a fair representation, I'd expect the Conservatives at perhaps 20%. Depending on how radical the Progressive agenda was, and how much Dumbledore could leverage his celebrity status, they, in turn, might exceed 20%, perhaps up to 40%? But that would leave the remaining, Neutral 40% with a quite conservative tilt -- not quite going on "kill all blood-traitors!"-rants, but enough to consider the merits of Draco's "I really don't think they should let the other sort in..." as a serious option (even if it were in the end rejected).

Or that's my best guess, for a generic Wizengamot setup, anyway.
