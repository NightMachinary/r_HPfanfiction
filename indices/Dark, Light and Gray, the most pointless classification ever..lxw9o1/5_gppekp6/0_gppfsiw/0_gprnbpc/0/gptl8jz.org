While you raise some good points about canon, I think you miss the point. Half-bloods and muggleborns are everywhere in canon JKR made (as of 1991-1996). Lucius is a racist asshole but he is the outlier, not as you said Arthur Weasley. Arthut is a renowned Ministry of Magic employee who makes laws. We know from DH that there are many employees of the MoM that are either muggleborn or married to one. Lucius Malfoy in canon is no-one. He is only part of the Board of Governors ( and friends with Fudge, that's all. He is in no position of power.

My main issue was with fanon and the reduction of the divides in Wizarding society to meaningless labels. Dark, Light and Gray are an immensely stupid reduction by lazy fanfiction authors, that was my main point. Even if I didn't raise all of my points in the original post, I tried to expand it in the comments.
