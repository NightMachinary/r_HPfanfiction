... I'm not sure this makes sense. Or I'm misunderstanding your argument. You are presenting a definition for "Dark" using your external standard, apply that to in-story reasoning, assume some secondary motivations and expected behaviour, and then wonder why it creates contradictions?

It's only the most immediate problem that /if/ the world in the story were as you describe it, muggleborns /wouldn't/ be accepted everywhere. More fundamental would be asking where the assumption that no one wants to be called "racist" comes from, why they /would/ be called racist, and how that would influence their behaviour anyway. In /Canon/, Malfoy is commonly known to be discriminating against Muggleborns. Arthur literally tells him that: "We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard." And Malfoy:

#+begin_quote
  “Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. “The company you keep, Weasley... and I thought your family could sink no lower---”
#+end_quote

That's as subtle as a ton of bricks. And the reason he's not afraid to go there, by the way, is that /in Canon/, the outlier view is Arthur. All relevant people are biased against Muggleborns, which is what Dumbledore tells Fudge in GoF:

#+begin_quote
  You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so called purity of blood!
#+end_quote

And he's just one example. The point being, even in Canon I don't think your argument works. The wizarding world isn't a nice place, and this is basis from which the stories you talk about extrapolate: Instead of showing the side of (e.g.) Dumbledore, they take /that world/, and show the side of Malfoy.

Honestly, the biggest problem I have with those stories, e.g. Sarcasm & Slytherin, is that the "Light" side is incompetent, and their behaviour unmotivated. They ban certain magic because ... because, fight for their opinions ... because and nothing makes sense and you wonder why half the world (the light half) is so dumb.

And that most FF writers can't write politics is of course true, but I don't think that in particular is the reason for the Dark/Light thing you are talking about.
