But for some reason, we never see much of it coming from Malfoy. Lucius says to look favorable to Harry, but as he is introduced while mistreating the Weasleys, it seems obvious that he is a villain.

Draco is even worse, as he insults Ron within the first five seconds of seeing him and then insults Hermione for being a muggle born while wishing them all to die. Of course, he was a spoiled 11-year-old brat who didn't realize the potential to manipulate people, but still.
