I dislike this trope when it isn't explained... or isn't explained well.

It's generally the same as being a conservative or liberal, right, left, or center.

However, when you throw magic into the mix, it isn't just about being conservative or liberal, it is about the types of magic that are performed.

The invention of the wand was the start of modernizing wizardry. A lot of fics will touch on the idea that witchcraft and wizardry are two different things, not gender separations. Witchcraft was magics that did not use a wand and wizardry was ones that did. Historically, there were more women who practiced witchcraft, and more men practicing wizardry.

Though before the invention of the wand, there was no separation, and everything was performed without a wand. In more modern times, the older methods of performing magic began to be looked upon as archaic. Since early magic involved blood, bone, and sacrifices, many types of magic without a wand began being looked at as dark. So traditionalists and conservatives began being associated with Dark, while progressives declared themselves Light.

Many rituals would be based on the seasons and the positions of the stars. That is most likely the reason why Astronomy is taught at Hogwarts as a core class, despite it being next to useless as none of the supporting magics are no longer taught as they are probably considered by the current political atmosphere to be 'Dark.' I would imagine that the only reason why Potions is still taught is because of the usefulness of the products for day to day life or they wouldn't be harvesting dead animals to be mixed and ingested, inhaled, or used as topical creams on their bodies.

Labeling someone as Dark is just a way of silencing their views, however after continuous use it got labeled as a political faction because those that were labeled as such to try to be silenced banded together to form a voting bloc to counter those trying to do the silencing
