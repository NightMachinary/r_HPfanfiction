  Teenagers rebel against their parent and more often than not are politically opposed
#+end_quote

In the modern world. In the past children were dependent on their parents to receive an inheritance or provide access to jobs, either in the family business or via patron-client relationships or pay for apprenticeships. So rebelling was a lot more costly.

  I just hate how in fics there are actual blocks of families that do politics.
#+end_quote

There were definitely historical Whig and Tory dynasties in England before the twentieth century.

A lot of fics derive politics from business interests e.g. The Greengrass family's business relies on contact with Muggles so they oppose Voldemort. If the family business is going to be your livelihood then it would make sense to align yourself with the politics which protect it, which would also be your parent's politics.
