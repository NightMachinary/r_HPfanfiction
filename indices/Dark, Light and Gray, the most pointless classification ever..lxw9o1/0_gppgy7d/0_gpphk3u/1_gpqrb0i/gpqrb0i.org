See, that's the rub with the DLG (Dark, Light, and Gray) system: Its definition varies depending on (the quality of the) writer.

In bad fics, the "Dark" faction is exactly as [[/u/muleGwent][u/muleGwent]] says; they're glorified thugs, either Death Eaters or Umbridge clones, and they're super bad apples, mustache-twirlers with zero redeeming qualities.

In decent fics, the Dark faction is a unified, slavishly loyal bloc bound by either a desire for dark magic legalization, magical Conservatism, purebloodedness, and/or muggle/xenophobia. Not all members are bad, as certain members (typically named ones), can be "redeemed" in these fics from their Dark ways, but the philosophies they hold lack redeeming qualities.

In great fics, the Dark faction is not a bloc but a group of (usually) likeminded individuals, each with their own characterizations and goals. They are never saints, sure, but they are rational, self-interested, and even "good" if evaluated under their own morality system. They might, for example, only be Dark for monetary reasons (purebloods have money), due to fear (of Voldemort), or simply because they see no need to fix what isn't (to them) broken. Heck, they might even be idealists crusading against what how the Muggleborns seek to destabilize magical culture, acting to make sure their children have a safe and happy world to grow up in.\\
The ubiquitous /Prince of Slytherin/ fic is basically the only one to go this far, however...
