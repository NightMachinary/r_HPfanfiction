In some of the fics I read, those classifications aren't about some sort of good and evil, or stance on muggles. They rather separate the wizarding worlds based on types of magic. In one fic dark families are oriented with dark magic, which was synonymous with rituals and more traditional magics, while the light side focused more on spell casting. In another fanfic people born to dark families, or had a dark core generally had more powerful magics, but they were much less fine tuned.
