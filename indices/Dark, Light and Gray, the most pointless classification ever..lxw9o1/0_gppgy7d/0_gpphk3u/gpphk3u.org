Oh, I have no issue with that. I just not like it so clear defined and clear cut. Dark wizards are real bad. They are the term for criminals. How could that be a political party? You want to kill muggleborns? Welcome to the club, mate!

I just find the distinction between Dark, Light and Gray (as exemplified in numerous fics) to be superfluous and silly.
