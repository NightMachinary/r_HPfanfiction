I think that moderm democrats who somehow unanimously support a leader a man who says, " if you're having trouble...[voting for]...me, you ain't black." aren't all too concerned with reducing racist stereotypes in our country. Malcolm X has a great quote that applies to all individuals [[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8869214-the-white-liberal-is-the-worst-enemy-to-america-and][here]] and it would behoove us not to pick sides, but to pick policies that benefit our people as a whole as well as ourselves, individually, independently from an administration and a party that can dismiss genocide as merely being a difference in cultural norms that foreign dictators are beholden to.
