You just have to give it the right label, make sure your entire political platform is based on a single issue, or series of single issues, and sow disinformation as people flock to your platform in order keep their morals pure.

People largely don't have the capacity to think in terms that affect wide breadths of the political/social/economic spectrum; so best to just choose my "guy" or "gal" based on whether they stand with my views on X issue. It's simple. Not easy, but simple.

It's also why some political movements are so easily co-opted by their enemies. The more complex the idea, and so the solution to whatever problem, the easier it is to boil it all down to talking points and paint the movement as farcical. Complexity is nuance the masses can't speak about, but inherently understand.

Edit: People /know/ there is inherently a problem with income inequality, for example, but the solutions to such a problem are complicated and nuanced, so they get boiled down to nonsense in the political realm and nothing actually gets done to solve it, especially when you have weak leadership on either side of the spectrum.
