I think that's the thing -- there isn't really any sort of purely political divide, based on "normal" issues like whether to collect a tax to fix cobble-holes in Diagon Alley, or provide assistance to people who need help with food & housing. Instead all that exists is a moral divide, dark=evil/illegal/unforgivable, and light=inclusive/goody-goody/anti-"dark." Can we call them the anitda? I like it.

I'm not even that into politics, but I would love to read a story that included a society that had realistic political differences and was divided on more than just whether they think that muggleborns don't deserve standing in society or whether blood magic should always be illegal.

It's such a good point about kids often having differing political opinions than our parents, that I never thought about before in relation to the wizarding world. I suppose the wizarding world is thought of as so archaic that kids just don't do that for fear of getting disowned or shunned in society or whatever, but when one of the HP kids goes against their parents it's as if it's practically unheard of and a HUGE scandal, which is just not realistic.
