  Teenagers rebel against their parent and more often than not are politically opposed.

To add to this, the concept of "teenager" is a modern one. It's a marketing term for companies to build malls and hangout spots to feed money from adults to their not-quite-adult children to spend stupidly.

I think the term "teenager" didn't even appear in the English language until the early 20th century. So after the industrial revolution.

In the old world, in the world of farming and hunting and gathering, you're either a child or an adult, based on your capabilities. "You've succeeded on your first hunt" sort of thing. Some of these traditions have carried over to the modern world in forms of celebration of birthdays, but really, in the old world, it was your first X milestone that marked adulthood and you were expected to learn what it meant to be a responsible member of your tribe from thereon out.
