  Do you have a suggestion for an alternative name which can define a group that are essentially a secret brotherhood. Not dedicated to evil, but who differ politically, socially, and even their connection to magic?

Traditionalists? It should be a name that on the surface sounds good, but can still have a connection to the human attributes we pretend don't exist, like racism etc.
