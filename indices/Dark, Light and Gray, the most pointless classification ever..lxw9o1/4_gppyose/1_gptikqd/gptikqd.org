I wanted someone to mention Raining Ink fic, since it's one of my favourites.

Her definition of Dark wizards flies against canon, but it's the best one we had so far. It has it flaws. Since the irrational hatred of all things Dark in that fic is kind of strange, by the Light wizards I mean... But it was so well written I'm willing to forget the author for that.

However, even in that fic, the author was smart enough to understand that it should be a super secret club. It's actually one of the most important plot points, that nobody knows who is a Dark wizard. It's anathema, it's a literal death sentence. Nobody calls themselves Dark in society. Ever.

Which is kind of a strange way to reinforcing my point, but not really. Since Raining Inks version of Dark wizards was not synonymous with the overwhelming fanon version of pureblood supremacists who want to murder muggleborns, muggles and every other magical race. JKR really went ham on the Nazi similarities (even if her understanding was flawed as hell).

The only way I can see political parties work in a world where Fudge was Minister of Magic and Dumbledore a Chief Warlock is for some people to want more integration for muggleborns (conservatives) and those who want them to be left alone and find their own path (progressives). I don't really have a name for either party so far, or even agree they should exist, but they probably would. Canon really doesn't make much sense in these matters, especially with the cartoonish portrayal under Voldemort's regime, which was ostensibly status quo, but brutalised people left and right.

To summarise. I don't think anyone would want to be classified as Dark, but if they were truly of that leaning they would try to hide under a veil of propriety and goodness.
