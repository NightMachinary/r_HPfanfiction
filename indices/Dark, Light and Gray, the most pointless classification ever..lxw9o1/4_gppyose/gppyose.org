I agree wholeheartedly with an exception. If you've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723942/1/Out-of-the-Night][/Out of the Night/ by Raining Ink]] then you can see how Dark wizard carries a wholly different signifier. Not canon, but something which I prefer and which I use in my head. I still dislike considerably the term Light wizards (or Gray), and the types of Dark Wizards as you describe them.

But I have a question.

Do you have a suggestion for an alternative name which can define a group that are essentially a secret brotherhood. Not dedicated to evil, but who differ politically, socially, and even their connection to magic?

I believe Victoria Potter touches on this with Deep Magic. But every name I come up with sounds stupid. Dark Brotherhood, repurpose Knight of Walpurgas etc. and if I simply use Dark Wizard (in the Out of the Night sense) then naturally this can bring unwanted baggage.
