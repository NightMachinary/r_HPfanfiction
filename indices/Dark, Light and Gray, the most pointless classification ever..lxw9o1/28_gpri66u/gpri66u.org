  Why should a family be Dark or Light or Gray?
#+end_quote

I mean, if you're arguing FF, why /shouldn't/ they? Obviously because you dislike it, which is fair enough, but if you're already changing everything when writing FF, you surely can come up any kind of reason to make such a classification necessary. So maybe this is a literal thing, and Light and Dark families use fundamentally different kinds of magic. And maybe magic warps their minds such that they wouldn't even consider anything else.

You get what I mean? Without Canon as the baseline, there's all sorts of stuff you can make up to make it logically consistent within the story, and that's all you need to do. So it's hard to argue about this.

On a more tangential note, I disagree that offspring is "more often than not are politically opposed". Historically, this just doesn't work out. Societies with strict, hierarchical social classes can be quite stable (think e.g. Regency England), and this is the same as saying people become what they were born to be. So if you are writing that kind of society (which vaguely appears to be what those FF attempt), then Sirius will be the exception, and children following in their parents' footsteps the norm.

And as far a families doing politics in blocks, this has been a thing already in Ancient Roman times.
