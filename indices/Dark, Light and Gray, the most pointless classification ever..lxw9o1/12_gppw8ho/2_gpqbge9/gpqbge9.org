It's exactly that. They wouldn't call themselves "dark" but doesn't mean they're not racist/elitist/traditionalist. Like the political party Jobbik in Hungary, they describe themselves as "a principled, conservative and radically patriotic Christian party" but they're basically neo-nazis.

Also, Harry and Co. are fighting a war so a lot of the talk about dark and light families is part of the covert intelligence gathering and sharing. So the reader is exposed to a lot of "they're dark" and "they're grey, can we trust them?" but I don't think this is too overt when put in perspective.

That said, anyone introducing themselves as dark is ridiculous. But elitist kids wanting to seem better than others saying more than they should makes total sense.
