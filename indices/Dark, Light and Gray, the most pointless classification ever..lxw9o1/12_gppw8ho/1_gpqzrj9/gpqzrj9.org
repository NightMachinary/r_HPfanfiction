I somewhat disagree, I feel that the "Dark" group would be more full blown Reactionary, not just merely Conservative. The "Gray" group would be mostly Conservative, with a splinter group falling under the Centrist label; and the "Light" ones running the spectrum from Centrist to Progressivist, but still with most of them being in the Liberal camp.
