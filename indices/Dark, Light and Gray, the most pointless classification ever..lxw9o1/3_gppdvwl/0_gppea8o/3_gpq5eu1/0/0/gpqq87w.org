I mean, this is explicitly about the fanon terms of dark/light/grey, so [[/u/69frum][u/69frum]] has a great point here. Also, to further clarify - "traditionalist" sounds really nice, just like "family values" and "protecting southern heritage", perfect for making sure the "nice" people never have to be crude and say the quiet part out loud, and for people to be able to genuinely believe they are good people while supporting awful policies. It's a lot harder to trick yourself into thinking that you are in the moral right if your stance is "we think these people are subhuman" than it is if your stance is "we need to protect our traditional values, which are under attack", even if both come down to the same solution in action.
