  It's a lot harder to trick yourself into thinking that you are in the moral right if your stance is "we think these people are subhuman"

Is it, though? We could probably debate real life examples, but as far as the HP Canon world goes, they pretty explicitly consider Muggles worth less than wizards (which, to be fair, if you reduce worth to "magic", they are -- but of course the entire theme of the books is choices, not abilities ...) and are happy with that.
