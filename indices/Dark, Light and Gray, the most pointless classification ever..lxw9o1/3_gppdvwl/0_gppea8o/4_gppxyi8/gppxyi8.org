Just because someone is considered Dark, does not mean that they would necessarily be a Voldemort supporter, just as not all Lights would be Dumbledore supporters. I don't recall if it was Canon or Fanon, but the Greengrass family were considered a Dark neutral family. (EDIT - As per comments below, I now know this was fanon).
