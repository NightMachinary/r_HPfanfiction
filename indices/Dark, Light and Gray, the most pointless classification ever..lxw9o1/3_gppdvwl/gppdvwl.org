Yeah, like I don't introduce myself to people like, hey, just so you know, I am DARK!nock/out/ so prepare for some shit. The real world is a lot more nuanced and I really appreciate stories where these kind of descriptions aren't important or used at all. Let your writing speak for itself and let your characters walk those fine lines.

That said. I think these descriptors have a place more to warn the reader what they are getting into. Like if someone wrote a story where the entire Weasley clan was “dark” aka Team Voldemort? Ok. Maybe make a point to mention that it is how they will be portrayed. But yeah, other than that, the whole dark, light, grey thing is tedious.
