I think you hit the nail on the head. Nothing can be perfectly divided between three parties. Having only dark, light, and grey with all stances divided perfectly among them is unrealistic. In the real world there would be different sets of groups based on blood purity, wealth division, educational matters, progress, religous matters, secrecy policy, tactics, muggle treatment, etc. etc. the list goes on and on!

In many fanfics everyone in the dark camp believes in blood purity, a strict class system, a biased and dark arts educational system, no progress or change in anything (whether that be spells, science, culture, etc.), paganism, coming to power via terrorism, and (depending on the fic) either total secrecy or an end to secrecy as wizards take over the world and crush the muggles.

In real life, those in the dark camp would have varying stances on all these issues. Some might want to have complete blood purity, others would only want purebloods to be the ruling class. Some might believe war is the way to power while others would want to go through the government. Some might cling to tradition while others accept and even encourage innovation.

In real life, people who might agree with one thing may not agree with another. Social issues have never been clean and easy. But I know this nuance is often simplified to make writing easier, so it's okay.
