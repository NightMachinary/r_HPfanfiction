My problem with the whole thing is mostly that it's portrayed as actually functional. Like, no. That sort of government system will create feudalism. Without representation, the vast majority of people will be oppressed peasants while the people on the gamot will be rich lords.

And it's not like in these fics the authority of the families is limited in any way. Nah, you can just create a law, drag some guy in and then sentence him to death for breaking that law you just invented. Boy, that sort of power never has a good ending.

People like to romanticize elitism and nobility as this thing to aspire to without realizing that it /fucking sucked/ if you weren't a noble or even if you weren't raised as one. All those stories about harry suddenly gaining respect and authority? Nah. The gamot would turn on him, strip him of his titles and wealth and then he'd be made the slave of someone. Because that's how these systems work.

You can either have parties and factions or you can have ancestral seats and pureblood nobility. To write some false, idealized version of a feudal system is pretty disingenuous.
