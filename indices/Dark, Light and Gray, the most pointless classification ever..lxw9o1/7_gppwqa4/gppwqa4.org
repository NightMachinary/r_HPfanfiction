I don't necessarily hate it. Yeah, it may seem like the "dark side" are automatically calling themselves the bad guys and Voldemort supporters, but if it's well done, it can be a make for a pretty interesting fics. For example, I don't think it'd be stupid if the political system of the wizarding world was structured like this:

The dark, light and gray aren't clear cut, it's not like a family has some kind of label declaring them light, dark or gray, or that a group of families would proudly call themselves "Dark Side" like some political party. Rather, dark, light or gray would be determined through... their usual behaviour. People know what they are like, and they are therefore considered a part of a faction. But it's nothing official and in many cases not clear. For example, a family could be borderline dark. They support legalising more dark magic, but are pro-Muggle. Etc etc.

Fact is, in canon we are presented very little of the political system of the wizarding world and of magic for that matter. The books are written from the perspective of a teenage wizard who didn't even grow up in the wizarding world, so he's learning about it alongside us, the readers. It's up to the fic authors to change or expand on things. In the books, if someone is dark wizard, they are evil... that's it. But what if there was more to dark magic than simply kicking puppies and throwing around crucios like candy? We haven't seen that many different kinds of dark arts, after all. It's all about the unforgivables, horcruxes, a few other spells, and that's it. And then dark creatures, of course. But there has to be more to the dark arts than that. Perhaps it could be used for other stuff, too. And if so, there might be "gray" families that want to legalise all magic and judge people based on their actions, rather than the alignment of their spells.

Tl;dr dark, light and gray can be cool if done well.
