To be very quick:

First person is a very intimate form of writing. I prefer how drastic and personal the story can become when temporarily using first person in dramatic settings.

Second person. I've never read it, so I have no opinion.

Third person Limited: Similarly intimate but not to such an extreme as first person. This makes it really easy to relate to the character you only have the knowledge that they do. This is the style I prefer.

Third person omniscient: A bit below limited. This form has plenty of potential for dramatic irony which is really effective for me used properly. If you have a broad cast that you want people to relate to, then this is what I would recommend.
