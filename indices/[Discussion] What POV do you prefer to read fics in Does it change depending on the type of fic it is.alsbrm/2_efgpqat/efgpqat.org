/Bungle in the Jungle/ uses a second person PoV, and I couldn't say if it's done well or not, but I found it engaging and surprisingly not jarring, so there's that.

I'll read any PoV, with a slight preference for 3rd person limited, but present tense stories are a struggle unless they're really short one-shots.
