I almost exclusively read 3rd person (any 3rd person), and in past tense.

I've only read a handful of 1st Person fics (and books, for that matter) and I have never read a present tense fic.

I know of "Bungle in the Jungle", which is a 2nd person POV, but just because of that I wasn't even able to finish the first chapter. I find that POV to be without a doubt the worst you can choose to write a fic. The absolute worst. 1st person is palateable if the author is someone I like listening to. I'm pretty firmly set in the belief that 1st person is /always/ a self-insert to some degree, depending on the authors "acting" capabilities, and the authors capabilities to self-reflect. That means that almost all fanfictions written in 1st person are straight up impossible to read for me.
