I remember a couple of fics I wrote years ago that used Third Person Multiple, but generally I tended to stick to a single point of view for an entire chapter. On the handful of occasions I switched POV within the chapter, I tried to make it clear by identifying the character whose POV I was switching to by name as soon as possible, because I do agree it can be confusing.
