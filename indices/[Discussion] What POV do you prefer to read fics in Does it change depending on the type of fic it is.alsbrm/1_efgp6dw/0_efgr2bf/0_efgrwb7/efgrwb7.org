Yes, usually I have line breaks at the very least, but prefer to stick to one chapter per person. But for this one it was kind of a fluid, silly fic anyway so I was sort of doing the camera thing - Rowling did it a few times in her earlier books where the reader "camera" ended up following Ron and Hermione instead of Harry. It was fun to write but yes I wouldn't write it again.
