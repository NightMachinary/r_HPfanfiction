I dislike 1st person generally. I set myself a challenge to write in 1st person to practice and ended up writing a diary type fix based on Adrian Mole because anything more serious just felt too... I don't know, cliche? Try hard? Even more so with 2nd person. I just spend the whole time thinking "oh shut up". I'm sure it's done well somewhere but I haven't personally seen it yet.

I like 3rd person, and stick to one POV most of the time, although I did write something where the POV did shift within the story. I'm not sure I would do the same thing again because people got confused but it felt natural at the time.
