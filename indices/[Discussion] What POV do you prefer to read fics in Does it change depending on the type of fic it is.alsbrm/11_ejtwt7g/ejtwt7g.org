I'm late to the game on this one, but I'll put my hat in there: I have no problems with 1st person, 3rd person limited or omniscient. I haven't read any fanfics in 2nd person; I only know of 1, which I haven't read: Bungle in the Jungle. Third person multiple is fine as long as the author makes it very clear whose perspective I'm reading.

As far as tense, I really really don't like present tense unless the fic is really short. For some reason I only associate the present tense with depressing works or dream sequences (which I find rather odd, because my life presently is neither a dream nor depressing). There have been quite a few otherwise decent stories that I abandoned reading simply because of the combination of length and use of the present tense. I don't think I've read any story that employs the future tense in narration.
