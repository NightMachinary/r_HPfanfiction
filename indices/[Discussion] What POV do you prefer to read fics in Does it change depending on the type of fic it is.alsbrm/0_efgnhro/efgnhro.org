Second person is extrodinarily hard to do well, because the main character cannot make a choice the reader would not have without breaking immersion.

First person is harder to do well than third, because the POV character needs to be someone you'd want to listen to telling the whole story, which is easy to screw up.

Third person limited (like the books) because it give the authors all the benefits of first person (limited information) without the added challenge of keeping the character charming enough to not annoy the reader.

Third-person multiple (A Song of Ice and Fire also uses this, BTW) has become the go-to because it's easy to use, more forgiving if one character is boring/annoying, and still lets you keep secrets form the reader.
