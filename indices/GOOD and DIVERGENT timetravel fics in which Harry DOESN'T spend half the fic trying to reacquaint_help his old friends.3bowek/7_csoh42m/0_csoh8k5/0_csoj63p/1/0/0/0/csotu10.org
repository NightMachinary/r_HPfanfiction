I enjoyed the overall fic as well. To be honest, I find that a young Bellatrix as portrayed in this one and Harry are one of the most interesting couples to read about. Also, the whole story felt very promising.

But them going into the future kind of marked the point where the fic went downhill, slowly but steady. Unfortunatly.
