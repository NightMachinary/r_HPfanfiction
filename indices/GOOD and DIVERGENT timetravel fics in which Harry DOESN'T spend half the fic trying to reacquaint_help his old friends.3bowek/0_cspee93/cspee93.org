There's a fem!Harry one that gets recc'd quite a bit wherein he time-travels, gets HP-lucked into becoming female shortly before her 11th birthday, and then has Voldemort killed all before September first. Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool or something like that? Not sure of the name, but it's on ffn somewhere/somehow.
