There was a massive one where Harry and Draco end up back in time (or dimension, my memory is a bit fuzzy) after Voldemort practically destroyed the world, standard far-off-future fanfic fare. Harry gets adopted by the Flamels and Draco reveals he's a traveller as well.

I'll try and see if I can find it.
