I admit to being one of those that /does/ want to read about why the Marauder's map doesn't work in other dimensions, since it helps me develop limitations to the thing's wider implementation (Map of the Ministry? of Diagon Alley? :D), but I agree that the pace of the piece is very slow.

And yes, for the vast majority of readers, two-thirds can easily be cut without losing value.
