I think its this one you mean. Have to say that I find the pace of the story to be extremely frustrating.

Seriously, the author of that thing seems to think that people are actually interested in reading about Harry figuring out why the Marauders Map doesn't work in the other dimension. Some of the chapters are really long, but could be easily be cut to two third or even half of their length without loosing valuable information for the reader.

Ist like the author doesn't want to move along.
