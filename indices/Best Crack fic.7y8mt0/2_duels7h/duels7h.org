Humorous fics aren't the same thing as crackfics. Sitting on the fence are linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) and linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild).

Firmly in the crack category, there's linkffn(The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton). Also see the apparently-abandoned but fun linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake). linkffn(Honestly, Harry!) is also pretty funny.

May I also drop a link to my own "humor-but-not-crack" story, linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)? (Note: the first two chapters are setting things up and aren't as humorous as the rest, so please bear with it for that long...)
