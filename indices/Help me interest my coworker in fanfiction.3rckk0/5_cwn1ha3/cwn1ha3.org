I highly recommend [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]]! It has characters from all eras, including the Marauders, because it's set in an afterlife. Timewise, it's at the very end of the war. It's an ensemble adventure/character drama about the annual races and its prize of 24 hours on earth. It's my favorite HP fic.
