It's like the exact inverse of Really Dead Montage and it's perfect.

This story is the main reason why I hate post-war fluff. People died, were physically and emotionally maimed, had their families and lives torn apart. Nobody is going to be normal for a long while. Yet you never see participants in the war (willing or otherwise) with severe injuries unless it's specifically part of the plot. Authors often forget that wars leave scars, and not just the kind where [male] is depressed and [female] changes their lives.

Heck, JKR did that in HP. There was the obvious name-flinching and Moody's injuries, but beyond that, there weren't people walking around with curse scars or missing limbs like you would expect from a decade long war. Are we just supposed to assume that every single victim but three (Moody, and the Longbottoms) died? Or that their issues could be healed but not Hermione's scars or Moody's limbs?

You get all that in this story though. it's beautiful.
