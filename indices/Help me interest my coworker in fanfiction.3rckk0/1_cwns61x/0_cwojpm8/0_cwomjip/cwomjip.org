Without the benefit of actual photographs, /Cauterize/ somehow manages to evoke things like Alexander Gardner's photographs of Civil War battlefields ("if he has not brought bodies and laid them in our dooryards and along the streets, he has done something very like it") and Ernst Friedrich's 1924 collection /Krieg dem Kriege///War Against War/ (which in its closing pages presents images of veterans that literally no longer had faces). That's an impressive accomplishment for 1,500 words, I think.

Just from a world-building perspective, I love how the story situates the Wizarding world in a time and place before the over-saturation of media, before the serialization and mass-marketing of gore, such that a single exhibition of photographs can provoke a profound cultural and critical response from the public.

The worst.
