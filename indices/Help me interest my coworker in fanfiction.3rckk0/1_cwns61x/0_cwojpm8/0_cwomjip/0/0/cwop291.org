At the same time, I think the device of the photograph exhibition is key to the punch of the story. It creates this uncomfortable negotiation (transgression?) between public and private spheres, as the subjects commodify their wounds in order to shape their own narratives. They seem to recognize that art has power, but also requires sacrifice . . . and even then, they're at best only somewhat successful. They still get the critic's complaint about the composition of George's photographs, the public's furor over the inclusion of Draco . . . and yet they clamor for more. They're fascinated by these images, but will never truly understand because /they weren't there./
