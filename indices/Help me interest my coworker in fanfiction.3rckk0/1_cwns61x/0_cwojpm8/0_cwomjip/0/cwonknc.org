I agree wholeheartedly on the world building aspect, but part of what connects us as readers to the imagery is our exposure to the gore. We know what those scars would look like on a person and it's horrifying. Then she goes one step further and describes magical aspects to them. To think that these are fictional characters who by most accounts had a fairy tale ending, but in this reality actually bare the scars of the soldiers they were forced to become. It's unsettling because if not even your fictional heroes are sacred, then who is.

And man, the phrasing is just like knives to the heart. I'm usually pretty much alright until the end of George:

Always gets the waterworks going.
