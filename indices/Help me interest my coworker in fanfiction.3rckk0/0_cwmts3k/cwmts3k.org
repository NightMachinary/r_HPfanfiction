I imagine most newcomers to fanfic will like stories that feel like as much like canon as possible.

In the old days these would be the "fanfic writer attempts to write the next year" fics like Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion by Melindaleo, but these will probably hold less interest to newcomers now because they're essentially AUs.

If I wanted to get someone interested in fanfic I'd probably link them something like Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian. It has an adult tone, is canon compliant, and is well written.

If I knew a bit more about the person in question I might recommend something more specific, but for an unknown adult who likes HP but isn't obsessed with it, I'd stick to something general.
