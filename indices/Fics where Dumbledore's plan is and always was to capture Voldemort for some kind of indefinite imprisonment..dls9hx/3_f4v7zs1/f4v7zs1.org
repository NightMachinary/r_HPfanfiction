I don't think I've ever seen it done this way as a master plan. I've seen it several times as a last-minute endgame move, and I toyed with it in Animagus at War, but no one seems to think of just imprisoning Voldemort, even though they did it successfully with Grindelwald, possibly because Voldemort could escape as a spirit when his body dies.
