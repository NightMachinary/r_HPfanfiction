The difficult part is in pinning down a wizard like Voldemort - you'd need to have laid out some sort of trap for him.

In canon, Dumbledore really doesn't do much to actually attack Voldemort. From a high level perspective, that's likely because /Harry/ is the hero, so we can't have Dumbledore beat the big evil villain. So instead we get Dumbledore's convoluted plan running through Harry, and focuses on more deflecting Voldemort's strikes it seems.

But luring Voldemort into a trap - perhaps through using Harry - could be far more impactful. In the department of mysteries fight, they're pretty evenly matched - add in a few other powerful wizards like Snape, Flitwick, and McGonagall, and Voldemort would be forced into retreat. Cut off said retreat...

Well, it wouldn't be /easy/, but they should be able to beat him - and once beaten, a series of mind wipes, petrifications, etc, to keep his body intact but mind gone... That'd get around his immortality in a de facto way, giving more time to track down all the horcruxes, if that were even needed any longer.
