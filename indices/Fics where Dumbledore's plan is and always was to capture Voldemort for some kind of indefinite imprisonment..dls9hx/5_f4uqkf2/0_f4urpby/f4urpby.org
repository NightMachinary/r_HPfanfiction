In the department of mysteries Dumbledore doesn't seem to have much trouble running off Voldemort while protecting Harry and preventing Harry from jumping into the fight

McGonagall, Flitwick, and Slughorn were able to stand up to him together.

Lock Voldemort in a room with Dumbledore and the 5 next best good wizards and he should go down hard, particularly if Dumbledore had been rigorously training them for 10 years.

Even if Dumbledore couldn't 1v1 him, it's not like that's the only option. Voldemort spent the entire previous war running from Dumbledore and he still almost won. A human being can't 1v1 a bear, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways of dealing with bears.

This is all irrelevant anyway, because I wasn't arguing about how canon should have gone, I was talking about fanfiction. I was making a request for a fanfic. I doubt that you want to argue that it's impossible to write a fanfic where Dumbledore imprisons Voldemort.
