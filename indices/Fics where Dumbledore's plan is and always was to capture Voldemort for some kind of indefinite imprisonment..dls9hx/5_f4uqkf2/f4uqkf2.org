This presupposes that Dumbledore COULD capture and hold LV. There's no evidence that he is capable of this post resurrection... Or really even that he's capable of capturing Voldemort pre-Halloween1981. I mean it's a common enough trope in fanfic that Dumbledore was just sitting around worthlessly twirling his cock or that he actually believed in the prophecy or other such nonsense that completely misunderstands canon.

If he could have apprehended or killed Voldemort... He would have.

I mean such a thing could be somewhat interesting to read but it does hamstring the villain. Its an understated theme of canon that Dumbledore is simply too old or unskilled to stop Lord Voldemort. He needed to defeat himself through his lack of understanding of the subtle magic of love and sacrifice. If he understood them he would never have made the same mistake twice... But it would be easy to argue that if he understood them, he wouldn't be Lord Voldemort in the first place.
