It's quite possible that the Sorcerer's Stone was a trap meant to do just that while he was vulnerable in spirit form, and Harry and co were never supposed to get involved but did anyways. After that, Voldemort dropped off the map until book 4, and Dumbledore didn't get the chance to confront him again until book 5- when he had already returned to full strength.
