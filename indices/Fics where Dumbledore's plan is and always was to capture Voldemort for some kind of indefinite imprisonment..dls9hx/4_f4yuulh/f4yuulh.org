The House of Potter Rebuilt - DisobedienceWriter

It is complete and an interesting take on Harry. Dumbledore is killed by Quirell and starts ti really piss Harry off when he comes back as a ghost. It becomes Harry's inspiration for a rune project to repel a ghost. One thing leads to another and the device is improved to eventually trap Voldemort and Dumbledore in stone forever.

Its a cool story that involves the Flamels quite a bit as well as Sirius and most importantly it doesn't have Harry getting sucked into stupid shit he doesn't need to.
