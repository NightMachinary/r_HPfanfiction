Yes, such a Dumbledore is long overdue:

- Capture Voldemort in some kind of very carefully laid out trap.
- Use anything, literally ANYTHING, to extract everything Voldemort knows.
- Obliviate Voldemort back to his infancy or a drooling vegetable. Even if Voldemort escapes as a wraith, he will wander the mortal plane as a harmless and confused spirit until the end of times!
- Dose Voldemort with Draught of Living Death.
- Lock him behind wards even stronger than Nurmengard.
- Based on information obtained from the interrogation, hunt down every Horcrux, every Death Eater, and every secret supply stash.

Before some of you complain that is this too harsh, too cruel, and blah blah blah, this approach is infinitely better than knowingly grooming and sacrificing an innocent child!
