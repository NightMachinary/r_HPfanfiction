Honestly depends on how long Dumbledore waits to make his move after Halloween â€˜81. In the pensieve memory of the lestrange/crouch trial, the wizengamoot was out for blood. Sirius comments in goblet of fire that he wasn't the only one thrown in Azkaban without a trial. If Dumbledore/the ministry used the momentum from the attack on the Longbottoms to clean house, I can't see anyone stopping them - to the point where even speaking out against their methods might get you tossed into Azkaban on suspicion of being a death eater/sympathizer.
