My version of a proactive Dumbledore:

Three years after Voldemort's defeat in Halloween 1981, Dumbledore decided that the Ministry couldn't be trusted to carry out justice against Death Eaters and dismantle Voldemort's sadistic genocidal terrorist network.

As the first step, he riled up Augusta Longbottom and together they confiscated the Lestrange vault, as the Longbottoms found ample sympathy among the public and in the Wizengamot. In addition to gold, Dumbledore also obtained the Cup, and could start the Horcrux Hunt 10 years earlier.

Next, Dumbledore managed to search the Malfoy Manor before Lucius got the dope, since Lucius Malfoy didn't have the time to corrupt nearly as many in the Ministry as in canon. Lucius was found guilty of possessing many dark artifacts, including the forbidden Death Eater regalia, and received 20 years in Azkaban. Most of Malfoy fortune ended in Dumbledore's and Minister Bagnold's coffers. Dumbledore further obtained the Diary.

Now that two Death Eaters turned out to have extremely valuable artifacts from Voldemort, maybe it made sense to investigate and confiscate more? The Ministry could use more gold, Minister Bagnold could use more gold, the Weasleys could certainly use more gold, and Remus could definitely use more gold to hire some werewolves, and send the pack after Greyback? *Converting vital enemy war materials to your own is after all a fundamental war objective.*

So, which rich Death Eaters next? The Blacks of course! They had to pay for the hideous betrayal of the Potters. Yes, this Sirius Black had to be thoroughly interrogated, with a combination of Veritaserum, Legilimency, and some secret DoM mean. What?! He was innocent? Well, then the Ministry should officially grant him the head of the house, and Sirius Black would in turn let us search the Black residence and ‘donate' some gold for the Greater Good. What?! His brother Regulus also defected and gave up his life to get one of Voldemort's artifacts? How many of those things did Voldemort make? Time to knock up on Horace Slughorn.

“Ah dear Horace, we already got three. He talked to you about this, didn't he? So how many more? You don't remember? Maybe we shall take you for a visit to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure they can help you remember. Good, I'm glad you found your courage, Horace. You will be greatly honored once this is all over.”

“Yes Millicent, I've obtained irrefutable proof that he cheated the death by using Horcruxes. The Head Unspeakable can verify that. Yes, he could have made three more. So far, two of the objects are Hogwarts founder artifacts, one his personal item, so you can see a pattern here. All of them were obtained by searching Death Eater estates and vaults. Therefore We should first fully investigate every imprisoned Death Eater, to find more leads to his Horcruxes, to identify potential falsely imprisoned ones like Sirius Black, to uncover more potential crimes, to better understand Voldemort's organization, to allow arrests of more escaped Death Eaters, and to seize more of their assets to pay their victims. No, I'm opposed to Dementor's Kiss. Those convicted of murder should be sentenced through the Veil. Even if Voldemort regains his body one day, he will find his supporters and their gold gone.”

“The Wizengamot thereby has sentenced Gaius Avery, Amycus Carrow, Alecto Carrow, Walden MacNair, Adolphus Travers, Markus Selwyn, and Corban Yaxley to death through the Veil for mass murders, mass tortures, multiple counts of rapes, conspiracy to overthrow the Ministry, reckless endangerment of the Statute of Secrecy, and high treason. The Wizengamot has further judged, given the heinous nature of their atrocities and crimes, that ALL their assets, including gold, properties, businesses, among others, shall be seized and their victims shall be compensated.”
