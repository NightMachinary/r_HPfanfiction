Not quite what you're looking for, it's a time traveling Harry, not Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Ring and Diadem (and this fic has the diadem powering the DADA curse, a detail I always liked), but has no idea where the diary, locket and cup are in the 70s. Or even if the cup and locket have been made for that matter. Harry creates a crystal that can capture and hold a disembodied spirit. >! Voldemort's spirit eventually gets trapped and housed in the locket cave for all time, guarded by Voldemort's own wards.!<
