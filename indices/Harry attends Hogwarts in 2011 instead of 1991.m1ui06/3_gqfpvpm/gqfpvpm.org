Well, if /everything/ is the same but the number of year is +20, absolutely nothing would change except the years marked in the cake in Nick's deathday party, the publishing years of Riddle's diary and Snape's mother's Potions book and the years in the Potters' tombstone. However, if you only change all human actions in the wizarding world and of those Muggles interacting with it, many things would change.

Almost all weather conditions described in the Harry Potter books would have been different. There wouldn't have been a storm during the first Quidditch match of PoA and therefore the match would have ended earlier. That means the Dementors wouldn't have affected Harry again. As a consequence, Harry wouldn't have asked Lupin to teach him the Patronus Charm. Therefore, during the end-of-year adventure Harry wouldn't have known how to repel the Dementors and he, Sirius and Hermione would have been Kissed. End of story.
