There would be no muggleborns attending the school, as all of them were too busy watching tik-tok videos to bother reading the invitation letters. Every child would refuse Hogwarts upon learning their smart phones didn't work there.

With this nonviolent purge of anyone but purebloods, inbreeding reaches catastrophic levels, and wizards become so mentally disfunctional they can no longer read spellbooks to learn magic. Wizarding Britain coasts by on lingering enchantments, and goblins easily fleece all the gold and wealth.

Finally, decades and decades later, the enchantments cast by previous generations wear off and Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, and the Ministry are exposed to the muggle world. The uproar is veey shortlived, though, as neoliberal governments never bothered to take serious action on climate change.

Magic's existence is a page 4 story, a footnote among rising sea levels, unbearable heatwaves, and mass migration. Before long, most of humanity, and with it life on earth, winks out, victims of their own shortsightedness and unwillingness to sacrifice now for survival later.
