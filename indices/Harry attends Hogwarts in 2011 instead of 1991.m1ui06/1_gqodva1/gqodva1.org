Frankly, I'm disappointed by the prevalence of gratuitous, not to mention fallacious, nitpicking and youth-hating (dubious claims of "humor" notw/standing) in the responses. I think this is a really cool and relatively-unexplored-in-the-Harry-Potter-fanfiction-fandom idea. Pushing a bunch of story-relevant generations two decades back gets around the very strong " 'locking in' to canon" tendency Next Generation fics generally have. Particularly w/r/t the muggle-raised students, there's a lot of rich opportunity the cultural impact of real-life developments. Voldemort growing up in the postwar period and 2010s muggle-raised Hogwarts students' growing discontent w/ a lack of accommodation for increasingly considered-vital electronic forms of communication^{\}1]) are both interesting ideas to dig into.

Not to mention, while canon's themes are meaningful and relevant whether the main story takes place in the 1990s or the 2010s, there's a case to be made that the progression of canon's sociopolitical developments lines up more w/ the 2010s than the 1990s. Plus, there's a nice side benefit that this prompt lightly encourages writers to focus more on the nonmagical-interfacing side of magical society in contrast to the fandom's unhealthy fixation on fanon pureblood aristocracy and oligarchy.

^{\}1]) While, afaict f/ what I've read, I get that mobile phone usage in UK school are a lot more heavily restricted than I'm used to, I imagine that non-magical parents' concerns about their magical children having to navigate a very different society and culture pretty much unattended will heavily shift the debate in the favor of accommodating access to the internet and social media, at least outside of the classroom.
