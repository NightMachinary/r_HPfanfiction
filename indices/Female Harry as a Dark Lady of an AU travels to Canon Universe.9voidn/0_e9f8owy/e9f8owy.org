Umm, well, Lily from linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) does tend to end up in such situations in some particular spin-off, though I can't remember which one, though I'm sure Canon Harry meets her and starts to question reality in linkffn(The Wonderful World of Fanfiction), which is NOT a fic I'd recommend unless you read a lot of The Carnivorous Muffin and actually enjoy what makes it unique (if you do read a lot of Muffin, you'll know what I mean)
