  When a magical backlash causes a rift in space and time, an unsuspecting girl is pulled back and forth, leaving her with knowledge of the future and a destiny that is too big to ignore. Unwilling to sit back and watch, she will do anything in her power to stop the Dark Lord's rise. But Fate itself will fight her every step of the way. AUFem!Harry. Summer before 3rd year and beyond.

  Harriet Potter knows that there's something different about her, and it's not just her freakish left eye or that her best friend is a young adder by the name of 'Mr. Snake'.After meeting a strange man with a penchant for glaring at people, she finally learns her true identity- a witch, and accepts her place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But life at Hogwarts is more complex than book-learning, and she is inevitably drawn into centuries-old conflicts as a key player. The most important question: where do her loyalties lie?

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)
