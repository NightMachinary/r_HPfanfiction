Anyone have anything good that hasn't been recommended to death? I just spent yesterday scouring AO3 and there's so much crap out there. I just finished reading linkao3(All According to Plan), which will probably be inwardtransience's only completed HP work. Tsume Yuki is ever popular with her fem!Harry stuff, only wish it wasn't all so similar. I like her works, just can't stomach reading them after slogging through so much bad romance.

Also, there's a special place in hell for whoever decided to merge the "female Harry Potter - character" tag with "Harry Potter" instead of "female Harry Potter", making searching for fics tagged that way unsearchable. Like Mary Potter for instance. Also a special place in hell for those who can't tag properly; just because James and Lily are married doesn't mean that it's relevant enough to be in a story, likewise even if McGonagall is a professor doesn't mean she has to be tagged.

But to make this slightly more relevant, linkao3(On Dead Wings by Tsume Yuki; Gryffindor's Girl by BexSilverthorne; Time Travel? Really! by animeotaku20; Hart's Legacy by yayanaptime; Holly Potter and the Witching World by D_M_Nealey; The Fire that Swallowed the World by RowlettLesbian; Parselbrat by Ziel). I haven't finished reading all of these, but at least they aren't atrocious so far, and some are quite good.
