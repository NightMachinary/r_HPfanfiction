Ah, I just forgot the Yuleball Panic series by Philosophise or something along those lines. I haven't finished it, but it was pretty good. Only reason I'm hesitating to continue reading it is because right now I hardly want to see hide nor hair of Hermione, since AO3 is full of thinly veiled self-insert as Hermione trash that makes her the next Merlin, and I can't stand her for now. There's a reason why "BAMF Hermione" is a tag I'm excluding.
