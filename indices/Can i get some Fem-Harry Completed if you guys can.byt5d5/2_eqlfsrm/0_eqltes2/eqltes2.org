I've always loved this one... the funny thing is, I seem to like it for different reasons to everyone else.

People always talk about the stuff set in the past with Merlin. But I've always felt that the Merlin arc was a bit "generic fantasy"... I think it would have been done better if the author had tried to take a more grounded approach to the myth, fleshing out post-Roman Britain in a historically accurate (but fantastical) way. As it is, it feels a bit like a low budget BBC production. I also felt like the magic was a bit generic compared to the richness of canonical magic.

What I love about this fic is the stuff set in the modern day, or close to the modern day. I just love exploring Jasmine the character - in one scene, showing so much poise and elegance, in the next playfulness. A truly feminine fem!Harry, but showing all the /strength/ of femininity rather the direction of weakness that many angsty fics take. The best chapter in the story is, I think, the one where Dumbledore goes looking for her.
