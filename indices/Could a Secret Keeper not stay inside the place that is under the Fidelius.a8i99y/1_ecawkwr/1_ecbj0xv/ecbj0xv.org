Sounds like you are reading too much fanfiction ;). You have the benefit of knowing how it went down in the end. But for characters in question, they had no reason to doubt Peter's loyalty. Besides, there is a good reason why Peter was chosen as secret keeper:

1. Dumbledore was the leader of the Order of Phoenix. He can't take care of security details of every lower-tier member when more important tasks are at hand. He can't play escort every time someone needs to meet the Potters.
2. Yes, the prophecy makes Potters and Longbottoms much more important. But again, from perspective of OoP and Dumbledore, it could very well have been a fluke. The Fidelius charm was the "just in case".
3. Dumbledore would have been the obvious safekeeper. In fact, as Voldemort you'd expect him to be everyone's safekeeper. A single point of failure. You want resistance to go on without him, not to perish with him.
4. Peter was a childhood friend. A friend who has proved his loyalty and skill. He was in fact as good as anyone else save for Dumbledore.
5. Everyone in the Order must have expected Voldemort to go after the Longbottoms instead as they were pure-blood. Potters' security could be a bit lax given this.

> Rowling isn't the most logical writer and there are plot holes in the books big enough to fly a dragon through.

That's like saying "Why didn't the eagle take the ring and drop in Mt. Doom?" or "Frodo should have expected Gollum's betrayal".

That's how stories are written. Characters make mistake (just like in real life) to drive the story forward.
