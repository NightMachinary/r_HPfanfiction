There are two ways to go about this: this is an entirely possible thing, and all of the characters are morons for not doing it, completely ruining any possible tension or empathy for James and Lily, and possibly giving damning evidence that Dumbledore is incomptent.

Or, the Keeper cannot stay /permanently/ within the protection of the secret (as Dumbledore was the Keeper for Grimmauld Place, you can obviously visit and it not break the charm)

But most importantly, Rowling isn't the most logical writer and there are plot holes in the books big enough to fly a dragon through.
