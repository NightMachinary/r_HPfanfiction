IF you wanna be consistent with canon? Maybe.

Personally it doesn't make sense. Keeper living inside the fidelius, mutual fidelius or oathbound keeper completely negate the fidelity concept. Where's the faith? If you make a situation where you KNOW that the secret can't be revealed because the keeper is staying in the same house/another house under a fidelius/can't spill the secret without dropping dead of a magical aneurysm, there's no element trust involved.
