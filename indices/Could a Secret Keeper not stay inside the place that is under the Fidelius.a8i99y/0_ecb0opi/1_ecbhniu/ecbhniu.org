Who would you give the Grimmauld Place secret to instead? Dumbledore's the one who's most trustworthy (with the war effort), and most in contact with anyone who might need to get in. Sirius is a bit isolated to make contact with people, and people not already in the order might not trust who they think is a betraying mass murderer.
