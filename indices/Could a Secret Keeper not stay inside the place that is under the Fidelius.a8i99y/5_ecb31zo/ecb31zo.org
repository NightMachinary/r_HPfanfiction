I think it is possible. My way of going about it is that the person who owns the land cannot become the Secret Keeper but rather the Secret giver. This would make sense as Sirius is not the Secret Keeper of Grimmauld Place and James and Lily are not their own secret keepers in Godric's Hollow. Arthur becomes the Secret Keeper of their Great Aunt Muriel's house. The only thing that stumps me is Bill being the Secret Keeper of Shell Cottage. We could say that Bill wasn't actually owning the place at the time and it could have been leased or something, but I don't know if it could be true.

So the Secret Keeper can stay in the place forever, but they most likely won't, because it isn't their home.
