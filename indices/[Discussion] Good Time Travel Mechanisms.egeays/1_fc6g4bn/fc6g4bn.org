Xenophilius Lovegood gets collected into the Unspeakables instead of going to Azkaban.

Now, this is where you go ape-shit with the lore. Crumple-Horned Snorkacks don't exist. Cyclical-Horned Sorkacks do. Once the horn grows enough for the tip to reach the base (circle), the cycle is formed and they get control over their time powers. That's why nobody finds them, they jump to another moment in time to escape danger. Well, except for a young Xeno. He found one. And was stabbed by an adolescent Snorkack. This made him experience every point of *his* time of *every* timeline if he wasn't focusing enough. This can explain why he was such a.... unique individual.

​

Anywho, because of all of this, he was immune to time magic. The Unspeakables used him to clean up the time room since he wouldn't be stuck in a time loop, get thrown back/forward in time, or go even more insane.

​

In steps Harry, head Auror. He has some weird thought from back in the war and decides to go down to ask "Hey, how easy would it have been to locate and/or remove Horcruxes? Can you even get the Dark Mark under the Imperius? Did the blood wards over Privet Drive really work?" This is where he gets his world crushed.

Xeno saw this coming, and showed himself to Harry and dragged him into the time room. Xeno tells him an address to go to send him a letter when he wakes up, throws sands of time in his face and then launched him into the Death Eater baby in the time loop.

​

Harry wakes up at age 6, and freaks out. Have him be babysit at Mrs. Figg's place the following weekend and he escapes her by using her Floo to Xeno/Luna's place.

This way you get:

- A weird Yoda mentor who doesn't make sense half the time, but drops truth bombs whenever needed.
- Magical creature that does time.
- Access to the Weasleys if you want that.
- Access to Luna if it's going to be a Harry/Luna pairing.
- A way to save Pandora Lovegood. (This could be his real Mentor) Make her an Unspeakable. And BOOM! You have and in with the DoM.
