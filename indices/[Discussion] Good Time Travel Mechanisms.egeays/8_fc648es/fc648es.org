Well there were a few stories where Harry Hermione and Luna were hiding from Voldie's regime that controlled Britain when Santa contacts them in the name of Lilith the Faerie Queen who is loosing power as all of her Faerie children die since Voldie hunts them down for experimentation. She channeled all her power through Santa's Time Magic which he usually uses to reach all the children in the world in one night and instead sends all three back in time. It was a challenge from Paladeus - Champions of Lilith.

Then there is the ever common Don't Fear The Reaper challenge where Harry has died several times and is on his last chance thus getting sent back with his full memories to an earlier point in his life by his Reaper. There are two versions of this. The difference between them is he has one of two soul mates "some Granger girl" or Daphne Greengrass.
