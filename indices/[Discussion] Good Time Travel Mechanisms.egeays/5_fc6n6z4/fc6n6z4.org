I recommend making it an external force of some variety that is either A. Indifferent to the plot, B. Has its own motivations beyond that of any other characters (possibly to be used in a subplot), C. Is entirely accidental and viewed by harry as something of a miracle granting second chances (best used with post war time travel), or D. One use Time travel ala ritual, best used in an apocalyptic post war senario where sacrificing the current timeline and everything in it to go back and stop it from ever happening is preferable. With this version the time travel would have to follow what amounts to dimension travel rules, where it is possible to erase timelines and remake them without consequences or paradoxes.
