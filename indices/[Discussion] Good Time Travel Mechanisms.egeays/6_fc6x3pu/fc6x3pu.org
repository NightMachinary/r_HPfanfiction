There's a TV Show called Goodnight Sweetheart in which the main character just walks down a certain street to time travel back to the 1940s. In the show, he can go back and forth as he wishes, but you could have it be a temporary or fluctuating phenomenon or even moving. Have it occur when the phylogiston rotates widdershins around the macguffin of inconvenience or whatever - just enough justification to make it not an easy thing, but that it can occur if or when you need him to return to his original time.
