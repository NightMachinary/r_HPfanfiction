What kind of world is your Harry coming from? What is his background?

Good end, auror Harry can break up a criminal magic act and have side effects, depressed, bad end Harry usually tries to cause the dues ex machina. Or bad end voldemort decides 'neither can die while the other lives' means banishing Harry to another dimension (even if that causes the good guys to win there) gets him his immortality.

Both from and to are needed to say what would work.
