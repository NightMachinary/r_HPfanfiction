I like those types of stories and for my setup to work I wanted it to be even more different and unique. Harry is very young, hasn't even received his letter yet, so he has no knowledge of the wizarding world, and Voldemort isn't really back yet. So I was trying to figure out a somewhat believable way of sending him back through an accident, without having a 3rd party aka rando light/dark wizard sending him back for some purpose, that way I can avoid the paradox.
