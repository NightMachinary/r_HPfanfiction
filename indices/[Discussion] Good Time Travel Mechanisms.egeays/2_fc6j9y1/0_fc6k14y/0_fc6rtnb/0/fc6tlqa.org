I'm thinking about making him slightly older maybe 8 or 9, but I want him to go even further back to London in 1940 during the first London air blitz which is also during Tom Riddle's 3rd year at Hogwarts. I just wanted the time travel to be a mechanism to get Harry into this scenario, of him being put into Wool's Orphanage during the time Tom was also there. I think I got a pretty good mechanism for the time travel without being too handwavy, I want it to be more AU than Crack Fic I think but I'll see how it comes out.
