There's a ton of stuff possible:

- veil of death
- some DoM contraption
- potion
- creature
- specific curse
- runic spell
- sacrificial magic
- it just happens at his death
- he is the chosen one
- unfulfilled prophecy
- second chance given by some god
- sold his soul to some demon
- united the three hallows
- corrupted magic
- backlash from two powerful spells
- destruction of time turners
- some mishap with the sands of time (in time turners)

These are just some that I've seen before or just thought up. If you give us some more details about the constraints and settings, we might be able to help you more.
