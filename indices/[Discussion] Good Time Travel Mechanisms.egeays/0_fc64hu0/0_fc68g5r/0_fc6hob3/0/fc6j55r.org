That's an interesting idea, this is what I had planned for it: It's September 7th 1988 or 89(not important), The Dursleys are taking Dudley to a friend's birthday party in London. Figg was unavailable to babysit so they had to take Harry with them. They leave him on a bench or something and tell him he's to not move a muscle. Harry sees something odd moving down the street. He sees two people and a giant machine floating in between them. They're Unspeakables, Harry doesn't know it but he overhears them, He starts to follow them down an alley. He hears the first one complain about not being able to shrink the device or apparate with it, and the other responds this was the only safe method of transportation to the DOM. They talk about how they found it in a Dark Wizard's home and have no idea what it does. Harry is trying to be quiet as he follows them, but they overhear him and are startled. The two Unspeakables are arguing how the other should have put up the Muggle repelling charm when the device falls and begins to react strangely. The first Unspeakable leaves presumably to get help when the second talks to himself about getting fired and leaves as well. Harry entranced by the device gets closer when it explodes. Then as his consciousness is fading he hears an air siren, screams, and explosions. (Just a short summary first chapter would definitely be more fleshed out and longer but it's a good start I think. In the next chapter we find out he was sent 48/9 years into the past and arrives in London during an air raid. People find him and bring him to a hospital and the last thing he remembers is an explosion.)
