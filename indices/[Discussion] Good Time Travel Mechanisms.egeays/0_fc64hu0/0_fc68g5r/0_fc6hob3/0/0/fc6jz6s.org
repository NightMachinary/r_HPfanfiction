sure could work... to me the Unspeakables are the elite/crazy ones; so i would suggest the device reacts to Harry's scar/horcrux... and this is what startles the Unspeakables; this also allows you to not have Harry follow strange strangers but just sit there and simply notice this happening too late to react (Notice-Me-Not charm or whatever)
