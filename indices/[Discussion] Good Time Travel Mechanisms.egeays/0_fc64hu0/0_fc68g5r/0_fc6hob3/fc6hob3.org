If I were to try to go down this route I would consider using the prophesy orb as a catalyst in a reaction caused by some accident in the DOM...

this way you can avoid having the newTimeline-DOM be aware of Harry to whatever degree you want. You also avoid having to finagle the /DOM-contraption/ to Harry or vice versa... (especially if you want Harry to be ignorant of the whole thing)

--------------

This still ends up in you having to contrive a reason for the Orb to be affected, you could go with diving meddling or whatever if it's too hard figuring out a reasonably acceptable reason
