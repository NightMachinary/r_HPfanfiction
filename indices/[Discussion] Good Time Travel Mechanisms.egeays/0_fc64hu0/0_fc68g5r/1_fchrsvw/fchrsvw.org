No need to come up with an original DOM contraption. Theres already a perfect place to start it. End of 5th year at the DOM. The time Turner case gets hit by a stray spell and destroys them all.

I know you said you don't want a rando wizard to hit him with a time Turner. But that's cannon and pretty well set up to justify any amount of timey wimey sandy madness.

I once considered trying to write one where Neville gets hit by it. He gets thrown into the 4th dimension as an incorporeal consciousness that can glide through space and time effortlessly. But is only able to interact with the world by briefly taking over random people and making them talk.

Not really sure about the central conflict. If there is one. Mostly just like the idea of Neville becoming the source of prophesies.
