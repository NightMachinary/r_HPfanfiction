I really like the DOM contraption, and I think it fits really well!! The scenario I want to set up is that through time travel Harry is sent back to Tom's time and eventually ends up in Wool's Orphanage with an older Tom who is already a couple of years in Hogwarts. I want him to still be the Horcrux, but to have no knowledge of the magical world. So ideally he gets sent back as a child a year or two before his letter through some freak accident or something. I think it can be really doable with the DOM Contraption. Yes! I can imagine it coming together quite nicely, and it's somewhat logical and not too handwavy.
