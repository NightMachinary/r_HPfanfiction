Within reason, as long as it needs to be.

The average length of my chapters is around 4.5k, and I put a minimum limit of 2k - because usually my scenes are around 1.2-1.5k, and depending on the content longer scenes can stand alone as a chapter. I have a limit of ~10k, because beyond that it gets too tiresome to read between breaks of other activities that readers do.
