I tend to avoid fics with less than than 2k words by chapter. On the other hand 10k is readable but already a bit long and more than that, some passages will probably be a pain to read.

4-6k words seem nice for me, pretty much what Rowling used. But of course it has to be adapted to the story (I prefer to have a 3k words chapter rather than a 5k one but 2k of over detailed description wrote juste to reach the count. Same with chapter that stop at what feel like the middle of a scene without any reason but the word count.
