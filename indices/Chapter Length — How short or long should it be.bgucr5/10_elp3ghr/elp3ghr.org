Mine are usually 2.5 - 3.5 k. Sometimes I feel like people are impatient as even in my shorter story which currently is 7 chapters (anticipating around 18) I got complains that it drags and others that say not enough. I feel like in that amount of space I get what I need to get out and usually just break it up. Sometimes when the chapters are too long and I want to reread it takes a while to find the one I want.
