2.5k+ seems about right for me. I wrote fics with 1k-1.5k chapters and they didn't get much attention compared to my current one with 3.5k average chapters. I've heard people think short chapters are indicative of poor writing.

Any less than 2k, and you probably just have a scene and should pair it with another scene or two to beef it up a bit. If you have several scenes and less than 2k words, something is probably wonky with the pacing.

I try to keep my scenes in a chapter thematically similar and just write until I've found a good stopping place.

That said, average is average. It's alright to have shorter chapters, but just know if you have too many people will judge you based on that.
