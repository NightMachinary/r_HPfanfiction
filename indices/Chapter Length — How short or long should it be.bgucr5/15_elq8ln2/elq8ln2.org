My chapters tend to be multiple scenes, usually with a POV change for each scene, but length can vary. I would say they're rarely shorter than 3K, unless there's a real reason for it. (I had an oddball serial killer story in the NCIS fandom that had one or two short ones sprinkled in precisely because of the jarring impact.) I think my longest have been in the 11K to 15K range.

As a reader, I don't tend to notice chapter length if a fic is good, although short chapters on FF.net drive me batty because there's not the option to read straight through the way you can on AO3. (Especially true when reading on the subway with limited connectivity.)
