Uhm, if nothing happens to fix Hermione I understand your concerns, but from the way you sum it up it looks like Hermione was, well, /going insane/, possibly because of some curse of the Hallows. But even if it's /not/ a curse, if she's going /insane/, what she needs is a therapist at Saint Mungo's and to be kept away from sharp objects. Not to be executed like a criminal who knew what they were doing.
