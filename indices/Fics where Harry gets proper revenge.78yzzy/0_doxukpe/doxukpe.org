This has Harry get revenge on Lily and James for neglecting him and his sister. linkffn(9057950)

And also, Holy fuck, you just reminded me of a different fic that pissed me right the hell off. MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD. Can't recall the name of the fic but seriously this triggered me so hard. It's a fic where Hermione studies the Hallows for the ministry because Dumbledore put a spell on the Beedle the Bard book.

Alright, so Hermione is studying the Hallows or some shit, and keeps trying to make Harry give her the Stone or something, and he keeps saying know cause he knows she's turning insane.

Long story short, Hermione Imperio's Ginny to get the stone, then kills Ginny and sacrifices Harry's unborn child to make her own Deathly Hallows. Harry comes to stop her, Ron gets killed trying to help Harry, and Harry practically one shots Hermione since he holds the real Hallows.

And you know what happens? Does Hermione get killed for going crazy and killing Ginny, Ron, and Harry's unborn child? Nah man, Harry sacrifices himself to bring Ron back to life, and Hermione goes back to eating breakfast with the Weasleys the next day.

I just...fuckin /why/.
