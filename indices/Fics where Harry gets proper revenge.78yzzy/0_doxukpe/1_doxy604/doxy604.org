I've read that story too. Yeah, that was annoying, but look at it this way. Hermione was supposedly spelled to do so, compulsion charmed or something, and now, she has to live with the guilt for the rest of her life. Still, I think Ron should have just fucked off and let Hermione go on alone. /That/ would have stung.
