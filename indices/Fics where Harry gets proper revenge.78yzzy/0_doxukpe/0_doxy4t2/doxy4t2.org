I know that one since I recommended a couple times recently. It's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913). I had voiced the same complaint and the author explained that this fic was written as part of a challenge on SIYE. He almost got kicked off the site for killing off Harry and Ginny in that story.
