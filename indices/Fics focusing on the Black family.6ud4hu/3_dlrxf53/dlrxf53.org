Well, this is not really like those fics, because it's actually good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. Just finished the first year.
