If the King's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langoliers][Langoliers]] hasn't existed I would've thought that this story is just too good for a fanfiction. I cannot help but think of it as a cross-fic of Harry Potter and S. King's writing style---the feeling of desperation, the style of writing, the portrayal of characters' motives all reminded me of stories written by him. And it isn't too stretched out either --- the writer only tells what he wanted to tell and ends the story before it would start dropping in quality.

The story succeeds to deliver what it aimed to, and the only drawback about it, I think, is that it isn't very well known in the community.
