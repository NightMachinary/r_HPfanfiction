Not much I can say about Elizium. A refreshingly original idea executed brilliantly. The writing, like in all of Voice of the Nephilim's fics, is an absolute joy to read in itself and the characters are appropriately abhorrent/interesting.

Easily one of my favourite fics. It's great to see this fic getting some recognition. Hope to see the sequel someday.
