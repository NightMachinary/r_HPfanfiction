I wish I hadn't read [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames]] comment before I read the story. While I was reading it, I couldn't help but think of King's particular style.

Regardless, I think it was a very well written fic. Engaging, great pacing, good characters. Did well with leaving the breadcrumbs to the revelation. All really good stuff.
