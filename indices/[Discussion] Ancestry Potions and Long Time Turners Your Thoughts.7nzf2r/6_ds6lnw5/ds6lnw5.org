Ancestry Potions: that someone takes to discover the names of everyone they are descended from makes no sense. Even if a potion could separate the individuals, how would it find out their names?

Blood tests that simply provide a yes/no response to the question “Are these two people closely related.” Makes a lot more sense.

I personally have no problem with Gringotts storing a drop of blood from each generation of a family in order to validate next-of-kin claims.

Time-turners: the only one we see allows someone to travel back in time and interact with their surroundings, but it will turn out that all actions taken will have already happened the first time through.

Also, there appears to have been a limit on the ability to travel, Hermione missed a class, and her reaction was “Oh no! I forgot!” rather than “Well, guess I'm doing today again.”

So I'd argue that you can only use a time turner to do something you already did with the outcome that already happened, and only for a few hours at most.
