Ancestry potions are extremely rarely well-done. IMO, ancestry potions can work if you have more than one sample, for example, if you have blood from two or more people, it could show how are these two are related but if you have only one sample, then it is immersion breaking for me, especially if it tells you the ancestry over 50 generations.

.

For time travel, why not but the well done one I've ever read would have been the one at the end of linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King) but even that one is more of a mess than anything, with plots within plots within plots.
