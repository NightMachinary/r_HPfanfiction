  ancestry potions that show one's true family
#+end_quote

Is supportable by canon. We know that magic can be used to gain information (time-turners, revealing charms, ...) and we also know that the information is there (mundane in the DNA, for example), and I suppose that's no problem for magic to 'understand' a human concept like ancestry, especially since it is magically significant (metamorphmagi and parseltongue are inheritable, for example).

So yeah, it's probably possible to find out your ancestry using magic, and doesn't contradict canon in general.

I personally however have never seen them used in a good way, only ever to show how awesome Harry is.

  and time turners that send users years into the past
#+end_quote

Usually only used for some peggy-sue moments, but usually [[https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/][executed very badly]], even by good authors. I'd also like to argue that canon doesn't really support it, especially if you end up changing things, but ... yeah.

I do prefer other peggy-sue mechanics to time-turners. My idea how they could be good: Only allow use for information-gathering, that would be awesome.
