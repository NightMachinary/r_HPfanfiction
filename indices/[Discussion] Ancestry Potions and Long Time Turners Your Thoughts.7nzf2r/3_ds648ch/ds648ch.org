I call bullshit on the potions, for them to work they would need to be some kind of temporal magic, hardly used for something that mundane.. No, ancestry should be done by simply having recorded the magical equivalent to DNA through out generations (like for the black's family tree). This could be done by the goblins having a registry of those who used their vaults or something, the greedy little monsters would find a use to anything I'm sure.
