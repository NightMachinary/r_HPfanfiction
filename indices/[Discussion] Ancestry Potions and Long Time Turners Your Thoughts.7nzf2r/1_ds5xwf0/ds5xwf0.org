As far as long distance time travel is concerned, 90% of the time I skim the prologue chapter which explains how said character was launch many years into the past, and if it doesn't catch my interest I just skip however many chapters are necessary to get the character into the past.

I don't care, in any way, how the author decides to send their character back unless it's done extremely well. So if you want a 2 paragraph explanation of: "Oh Harry just uses a time turner and spins it a million times," more power to you. I probably wouldn't have read it anyway.
