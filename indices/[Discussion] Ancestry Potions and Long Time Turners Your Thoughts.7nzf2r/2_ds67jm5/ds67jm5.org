I dislike Ancestry Potions as a /plot device/, but they fit well into the lore. I don't want to see Harry taking one, but it makes sense that they'd /exist/.

Long-time Time-Turners --- they're canon now, and I never felt they contradicted the way Time-Turners worked. But again it's all in how one uses it.
