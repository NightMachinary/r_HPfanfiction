I think ancestry potions are perfectly viable as something that could exist in the potterverse, but they're usually just used to reveal that our character is actually related to merlin, all the Hogwarts founders and just about every pureblood family out there.

In terms of long distance time-turners, it's more or less the opposite, I find them less canonically viable, but more acceptable in stories. I don't mind time travel stories so if it's there as a plot-device that's fine with me.
