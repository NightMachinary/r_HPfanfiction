Nah, they have their flaws (I myself don't like anybody of the "Golden Trio"...then again, I dislike most other HP-Canon-Characters, too...I am more in it for the magical world than the characters!), but at least they seem to try to overcome them (doesn't quite work most of the time as 6th year Hermione isn't much better socially and Harry still is a "rush in no planing and rely on luck saving people who don't deserve it" kind of person who'd rather play quidditch than learn some more magic that might make the difference if he meets Tom Riddle again!), while Ron is as bad in the last book as before IMHO :(

ps: I admit that I am biased against him, I just don't like the character!
