[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater][tvtropes has a good explanation]], but bashing in general is usually done because the author is too lazy to make realistic characters and instead relies upon a handful of characters being unspeakably evil (and usually stupid) to drive the plot and ensure that Harry ends up with his ONETRUELOVE.

I don't like bashing, as you can probably guess.
