Slughorn was a social climber that used people. He was also pretty weaselly, like when Harry caught him stealing from the greenhouses and when he took Aragog's venom.

I don't think we're ever given his house, but Scrimgeour was a hardass that tried to bully information out of a teenage boy. He wasn't necessarily bad, but he was an asshole.
