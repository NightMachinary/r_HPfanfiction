You have to remember, assholes to the main characters, who were prejudiced against slytherins and very much unsympathetic towards their entire outlook on life, and who thought their culture was basically shit and they were shit for supporting it, does not mean assholes to everyone.

Be that right or wrong, it doesn't give the very best unbiased perspective.

Or maybe that's totally not canon and just a result of me reading too much fanfic in which slytherins are portrayed more sympathetically.
