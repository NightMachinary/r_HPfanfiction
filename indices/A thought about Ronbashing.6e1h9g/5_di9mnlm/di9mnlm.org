  when Ron found out Harry was a Parselmouth he was entirely supportive

He was Harry's best friend by that point. Of course he'd back him up. Ron's a bro. Even if he does mess up sometimes, friendship always wins out.

But the Ron of /Philosopher's Stone/ didn't have that solid friendship with him on their first day at Hogwarts. He might have very well disliked Harry for being sorted in Slytherin. Even if he didn't go that far, the tensions between their two houses probably wouldn't have let them be close friends. And seeing Harry go into Voldemort's house would have given him pause. /Had to be a reason for it, right?/ he might think.
