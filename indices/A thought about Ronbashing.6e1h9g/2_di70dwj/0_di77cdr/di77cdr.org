Yeah, the whole jealousy thing is an absolute turn off to Ron's character in the entire series, didn't feel like we had much of a thorough closure there either in canon. Not well enough in my opinion anyways.

edit: but I guess that's also kind of fine. everything doesn't have to be solved. you grow old with a whole lotta imperfections and still manage... only thing us fans can do is try to further explore it through fanfiction hah
