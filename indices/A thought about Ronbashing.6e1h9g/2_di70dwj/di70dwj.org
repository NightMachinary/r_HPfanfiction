Being a Parselmouth isn't inherently Slytherin, though, is it? Just because Salazar and Voldemort spoke it.

When it comes to Harry dating, a lot of people forget that moment in OoTP, when Cho approached Harry, to talk to him, and possibly set up a date, Ron interfered and spoke of Quidditch, immediately bashing on her because she likes Quidditch team he doesn't... basically, messing the whole thing up. Ron was, in canon, basically jealous that someone else was trying to get close to Harry.

And yeah, as another reader said, Ron hates Slytherins anyway. He did insult them from the very beginning.
