The ONE TIME? How about fucking leaving on the Horcrux Hunt because he was fucking hungry and wanted home to mama? (Yeah yeah, horcrux influencing him bla bla bla (even if this is true, Hermione and Harry can take the things influence much better than he can, it shows he has a weak personality IMHO!) - sorry, but others might be sick of Ron-Bashing, but I am sick of people defending him because IMHO he's a worthless idiot who only has one skill: Playing chess and we don't even know how good he actually is at that - him beating his siblings and classmates is telling us he's not bad, but it doesn't tell us how he'd compare to a chess-master!)

Also: Ron bashes and slams Slytherin whenever he can in canon (ok: Most of the time it involves Malfoy or Snape of course!), we have not seen him accept that Slytherin doesn't mean evil/deatheater (makes him quite the hypocrite, he harbored a Gryffindor deatheater after all - not that he knew it at that time!), it's one of the first things he does when meeting Harry (after wanting to see his scar and being a jealous asshole because Harry can buy stuff from the sales-lady on the train (which Harry graciously shares with him, too!) and bashing his mum for forgetting that he doesn't like packed lunch!)

It's quite natural that Mr. Motor-Mouth-without-any-Filter-what-so-ever, would start blurting out bullshit as soon as he learns that Harry is dating a Slytherin (or friends with anybody from that house!)

I am not saying that he wouldn't come around in time, as that is quite possible (he did return in Goblet of Fire, too it just took him seeing his friend almost dying to say that he's sorry (note: IMHO Harry should have told him to piss off at that point...you don't need fair-weather friends after all, you are better of having very few good friends than many bad ones after all!)), but I am saying that Ron is a git - I mean Hermione might not have been the most socially astute person ever (and she never will be, because she simply doesn't care enough - she cares more about books and knowledge!), but Ron was especially harsh on her (not only in year one - the "she's a nightmare" comment! - but whenever they had fights...without Harry as the stabilizing element/buffer between them they'd have torn each other to pieces!)
