  How about fucking leaving on the Horcrux Hunt because he was fucking hungry and wanted home to mama? (Yeah yeah, horcrux influencing him bla bla bla (even if this is true, Hermione and Harry can take the things influence much better than he can, it shows he has a weak personality IMHO!)
#+end_quote

You know he didn't /have/ to stay, right? Or even come back. He was a pureblood and could have lived life on easy mode at Hogwarts if he was so inclined. Harry and Hermione on the other hand were the two most wanted. And you can't bring up this argument without mentioning that Harry was the one who told him to leave.

  sorry, but others might be sick of Ron-Bashing, but I am sick of people defending him because IMHO he's a worthless idiot who only has one skill: Playing chess and we don't even know how good he actually is at that - him beating his siblings and classmates is telling us he's not bad, but it doesn't tell us how he'd compare to a chess-master!)

Ron has a lot of skills, and if you were capable of reading into a character, you'd know that. That's like saying Hermione's only talent is reading.

#+begin_quote
  Also: Ron bashes and slams Slytherin whenever he can in canon (ok: Most of the time it involves Malfoy or Snape of course!), we have not seen him accept that Slytherin doesn't mean evil/deatheater (makes him quite the hypocrite, he harbored a Gryffindor deatheater after all - not that he knew it at that time!)
#+end_quote

You literally just countered your own argument twice.

#+begin_quote
  it's one of the first things he does when meeting Harry (after wanting to see his scar and being a jealous asshole because Harry can buy stuff from the sales-lady on the train (which Harry graciously shares with him, too!) and bashing his mum for forgetting that he doesn't like packed lunch!)
#+end_quote

Ron was resigned to eating his shit sandwich, but Harry offered him some of his sweets in exchange for a homemade sandwich. Ron wasn't acting like a jealous asshole, so you may want to take those rose-tinted shades off for a moment.

#+begin_quote
  It's quite natural that Mr. Motor-Mouth-without-any-Filter-what-so-ever, would start blurting out bullshit as soon as he learns that Harry is dating a Slytherin (or friends with anybody from that house!)
#+end_quote

Harry was never friends with, nor dated, a Slytherin.

#+begin_quote
  (he did return in Goblet of Fire, too it just took him seeing his friend almost dying to say that he's sorry (note: IMHO Harry should have told him to piss off at that point...you don't need fair-weather friends after all, you are better of having very few good friends than many bad ones after all!))
#+end_quote

Harry didn't really give him a reason to believe him, then turned to physically assaulting Ron with a button when Ron ignored him. Ron's never asked Harry to die for him, yet Harry has several times. Harry's the overemotional, little bitch that's constantly getting his feelings hurt like the emo shithead that he is. And Ron has to deal with it for seven years.

#+begin_quote
  I mean Hermione might not have been the most socially astute person ever (and she never will be, because she simply doesn't care enough - she cares more about books and knowledge!), but Ron was especially harsh on her (not only in year one - the "she's a nightmare" comment! - but whenever they had fights...without Harry as the stabilizing element/buffer between them they'd have torn each other to pieces!)
#+end_quote

Hermione was just as bad as, if not worse than, him. And she constantly brought it on herself. Besides, Harry only stepped in on their small arguments. When they really blew up, Harry stayed out of it.
