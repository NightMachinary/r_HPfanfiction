Could he? He was an enemy of Draco Malfoy, Snape didn't like him and neither did most of Slytherin house, so I guess he wouldn't have had "easy mode" (sure, he might not have been tortured etc. but it still wouldn't have been great IMHO)

What? Ron wasn't great at school, he seldom worked on his own and often copied Hermione's essays!

Yes, Hermione was bad (I am not defending her, hell I don't like canon-Hermione either! I think somebody who probably grew up in higher society (Britain is after all still pretty much a classist society and doctors and other university grads aren't exactly of low status!) should have had more social graces (and some incline to doll herself up, maybe not in the extrem if it's not something you care for, but at least a little!), fact is however that Hermione didn't and she didn't care what most others thought of her (unless she overheard them and then she goes to cry in the bathroom, despite the fact that it's her fault - note: Yes, she is a teenager, still she should have noticed that all those verbal attacks etc. are her fault because it's her behaviour that caused them!)

Yeah, Ron was acting like an ass on the train (especially when Malfoy showed up, but the sweets thing, too - he kind of lets Harry know that he doesn't like "charity" (despite it being only a few sweets!), that's IMHO why Harry trades for one of Ron's sandwiches (so that he can claim it's not charity!))

In canon he wasn't dating them or being friends with them, but I bet he was not an asshole to them just because of their house (there were Slytherins who were not Malfoy toadies after all!)

You don't have to fucking give a FRIEND (your supposed BEST FRIEND even!) a reason to believe you...hell, if anything you should have to give them reasons to doubt you to start them doing so, which Harry clearly didn't do (hell, after all of their adventures before and Harry saving his dumb little sister who should have known better than to write in that damned diary Ron should have never doubted Harry at all IMHO or at least he should have stopped doing so after Harry tells him in no uncertain terms that he didn't enter his name!)

Yeah, he buffered them best he could, but when they were really going at it there wasn't much he could do ;) (and taking sides if your friends fight is bad form, so he was right to stay out of the large spats!)
