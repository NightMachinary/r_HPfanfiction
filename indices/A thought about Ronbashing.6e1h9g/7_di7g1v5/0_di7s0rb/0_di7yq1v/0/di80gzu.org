Draco wasn't at Hogwarts. But Ron wouldn't have had to worry about starving or dying, and he could make sure his family was safe. Instead he leaves, gets caught, then can't find Harry and Hermione before they leave, and spends the next month or two looking for them, rather than check up on his family.

Ron got Exceeds Expectations in Potions, Transfigurations, Charms, Care of Magical Creatures, Herbology, DADA (same grade as Hermione), and got an additional OWL in Astronomy, even with the distraction of Umbridge attacking Hagrid. He and Harry both failed Divination and History of Magic. And the kicker is Ron doesn't study, yet is essentially a B+ student. He's not stupid by any measure. Lazy, but not stupid.

Ron snickered when Malfoy said his name (which we don't even know if the two things were related), then Malfoy dove straight in, insulting his family and throwing their poverty in his face. And you're right, that's why Harry didn't offer to buy Ron a new wand or dress robes. Ron doesn't like being looked down on.

Ron tries to avoid Slytherins, and the only ones he really interacts with are Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He was even passive to the Slytherin underclassmen, like in HBP when that "little girl" (Crabbe under polyjuice) drops her scales.

It doesn't matter if they believe you or not, because Ron was still ready to support him. Harry was the one just the day prior talking about putting his name in the goblet, then lo and behold, Harry's name pops out of the goblet. And what's Harry's rebuttal? "Believe me or go fuck yourself!" Besides, Harry's very attention-seeking, so it's not hard to believe he would do something like that, but Ron didn't understand how dangerous the tournament was, elsewise he probably would have believed Harry. That and if Harry had tried to explain it to him.

Arguing is Ron and Hermione's way. If they've got a problem with one another, they let it be known, so as not to be a problem anymore. It's actually extremely healthy, but most fans don't see that as most people aren't raised as liberally and are taught to grin and bear it.
