What you are forgetting is that most writers /want/ conflict there.

If you remember your youth, have you never made a decision that someone disagreed with, yet seems completely right to you, and the other /idiot/ just is being unreasonable?

That is the feeling the authors project onto Harry. They want him to feel that way. Why is X being so stupid? Why don't they support me? Are they on my side?

Now, go over the list of canon characters even remotely close to Harry and tell me who is the most likely to completely disagree with Harry over a "stupid thing" like this? The only character that you really can write that way is Ron, or with a lot of effort Hermione.

So, as an author you'd either need to remove that feeling from Harry and thus make him less relatable (at least for yourself) /and/ take out conflict (which makes the story fun) or you bend Ron a little bit.

That is why Ron gets used like this: It's not that he necessarily is that way, but if some canon character was to "betray" Harry like it, it would most likely be Ron.
