First, sorry for the long answer, I got carried away when writing this.

--------------

I've never claimed such authors or stories to be good, I just tried to lay out their reasoning for writing Ron in such a way, which I still think I captured.

And while you and I may view this as petty and inconsequential conflict, others may not. When I was younger my world revolved around me, my thoughts and emotions. And emotions like this certainly dominated my thinking for times.

Such a story can be great for a teenager who just tries to find someone to identify himself with, and give strength to pull through an emotionally yet 'simple' situation. When I started reading fanfiction back in November, I was going through a pretty bad time, the start-up I had worked on for two years and invested so much time in pretty much had failed. I had known for a while, but it was then when I had to accept it. Harry Crow was (for the first 100k words) a fun story to read back then, a kick-ass Harry that goes through canon, demolishing anyone. Now I see how ridiculous and simple this story is, but back then it was /fun/.

One other 'use' of stories like this is for the author to reflect on his growth later, trying to understand and see what he thought when he was younger. One more example:\\
I recently re-discovered some notes (and with that thoughts) that I had about a book. It's "Siddartha" by Herman Hesse, and a very short summary of my thoughts was that there - as suggested by the protagonist - is a distinct difference between "child humans" (which is basically everyone) and other, more intelligent and superior humans that ignore the materialistic world and live a better life.

In the book the protagonist is at one point getting close to become such a child human, and basically I took away that I'd have to be careful to not become this. I was superior, after all! Of course I totally disagree with that sentiment now, but it was a shocking discovery. I even remember how I had to justify my girlfriend and love that I felt to comply with this mindset, which seems so stupid today.\\
I learned a lot about how I changed since then, just from some stupid notes I found again - a whole story written by me would be interesting now, but I never did that.

Your stories are different: In my understanding you usually use them for example to explore morality and consequences of concepts hinted at in canon, other fanfiction and the world itself. This is a great use and, and certainly makes for a worthwhile story and contribution. However, exploring the mind of teenagers is fine, too.

One doesn't have to like it, but there is demand for it: Twilight was a success, and certainly not because of the moral introspection or great plot, but mostly the character-driven conflict, that is often very stupid.
