  That's not conflict, that's simply Ron bashing.

I mentioned why I liked to read Harry Crow, which has little conflict - and if there is any Harry wins immediately and convincing.

The author has no plans for Ron to be redeemed, because he is /wrong/, and forgiving is something that is less satisfying than simply destroying the other person, and that is what these stories are in the end: Wish-Fulfillment.

Again, I'm not saying that stories that include mindless bashing without any redemption are /good/, I'm just saying they are not outright worthless.

Trying to understand why someone would write something or why it is okay for me to enjoy it, even if it's not good by literary standards has been liberating. I don't need to judge the author or myself for enjoying something. That's all I'm trying to explain here, and I don't even think you really disagree with me.
