I'll admit that for that kind of stories, teenage drama might be appropriate.

But usually, such stories - unlike canon - don't feature Ron overcoming his biases, personal growth, or even the usual conflict solutions common to teenage drama. There's no Ron and Harry reconciling, overcoming the petty drama and focusing on defeating the Death Eaters together. Instead it's usually used to break up their friendship, or nip it in the bud, and replace Ron with "a better friend", either Neville, or an OC (with a canon name).

Like that, the whole conflict usually is reduced to Ron being an asshole (the scale varies from wanna-be bully to Death Eater) and getting his "just desserts", or Ron serving as "proof" that the Gryffindors are actually bigots, and the Slytherins just misunderstood noble souls.

That's not conflict, that's simply Ron bashing.
