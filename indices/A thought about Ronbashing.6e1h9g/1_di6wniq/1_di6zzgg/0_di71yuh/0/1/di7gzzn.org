But canon Ron was at least a wannabe bully. I stopped liking Ron in PoA when he started a lot of drama about a rat he thought useless. To me that destroyed any sympathy I had for this character. When I read GoF and Ron was an arse about the whole tournament mess I was really happy to see him gone only for Harry to take him back. Then Ron was a giant arse towards Hermione again and Harry did sit back and watch. That's the second thing I hate about Harry in GoF.

If the person who stood by me when no one else did, who spent dozens of hours helping me stay alive, and the guy who recently was a git and thought that I was a liar for getting entered into a bloodsport were fighting and the recent git was giving my loyal friend shit in my name I'd never speak to the person again (funnily enough something similar happened to me IRL). And certainly I wouldn't sit there with a bag of popcorn while my friend is reduced to tears.

I never liked the wifebeater Ron or Death Eater Ron stories. That is just an overused plot device. But bully Ron? Insensitive git Ron? Fairweather friend Ron? That's how I see Ron based upon canon alone. If a story shows Ron that way I don't see that as bashing, I see that as canon accurate depiction of Ron. I could even see Ron pulling a Snape and call Hermione mudblood in a heated argument (like when he leaves in Deathly Hallows). Because Ron is at least latently bigoted. He didn't see the issue with using magic to get a driving licence. He altered the mind of a muggle without sparing this a second thought. That shows that Ron is not a good person and probably a criminal offence as well.

It's these small things that make me hate Ron. And if I ever publish a story I've written Ron will be shown exactly based on these things. I won't make him a wannabe Death Eater or a wifebeater. But he certainly won't be Harry's friend for long.
