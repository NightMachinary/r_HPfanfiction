I think that you are falling into the trap of putting yourself in Harry's place. Yes, there are many people, who put in Harry's place, may feel like Ron is an ass and doesn't deserve to be a friend to Harry. But on the other hand, we also don't understand exactly what Harry's thought processes were. Yes, Ron started a lot of drama about his rat. On the other hand, Hermione wasn't exactly all that apologetic. She was more along the lines of cats will be cats, you should have kept him locked up, etc. She had good points, but at the same time there was not a huge amount of sympathy for Ron's pet being killed. Try putting yourself in Ron's place. His pet was killed by a hostile and unfriendly cat, and then the owner is making excuses.

Similarly for the tournament, I could see Ron feeling betrayed. Here he is, wanting to enter the tournament, and his friend tells him that he isn't going to enter. Then he finds out that not only does his friend enter and is picked, but the judges don't kick him out of the tournament, in clear violation of the rules. To an insecure guy, who really really wanted to be in that tournament, I could certainly see his reaction as plausible. And did anyone even tell him that it was a magically binding contract in the first place?

The trick to reading fiction, and even functioning in life, is to not get overly tied to a certain point of view. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes can lend you insight, and even give you sympathy for their actions.
