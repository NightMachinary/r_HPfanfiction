Magically-binding is a fanon idea, I think. Pretty sure that in canon it's just that Barty Crouch Sr. says Harry has to compete, there's no mention of contracts or bindings.

That said, I agree with you, and also think that people overthink and overreact to a lot of Ron's mistakes.

Hogwarts is effectively secondary/high school, right? Well, people argue and have falling outs and stuff like that - one time, where me and my friends were playing tag or something when I was about 13, we'd recently introduced a new guy to our group, and we were getting on like a house on fire. One of my other best friends deliberately went out of his way to hurt this kid in some weird fit of jealousy, but we made it clear what he did was absolutely not okay, and refused to speak to him afterwards until he apologised to the new guy, which took about a day or two and then we were right as rain. They're both my best friends today, nearly a decade later.

Ron /can/ be an arsehole, absolutely. But his actions in GoF are hardly unforgivable - notice that he thinks Harry lied, but doesn't wear the 'Potter Stinks' badges or join in any of the other shit the students do in the lead up to the first task. His resentment is quieter and more centred around his personal hurt at what he believes to be Harry's betrayal.

Authors making Harry super judgemental and melodramatic about the whole Ron thing really bother me. So he's not perfect, big whoop. No reason to cut all contact with him, blah blah. Communication and forgiveness in the face of adversity like that help build a stronger friendship - believe me, I've been there - and the fact is is that everyone you know is a human being with flaws and issues and the potential to make serious mistakes. Holding Ron up as a friend first and human second does him a disservice, I think, and authors get so caught up in his apparent prejudices or flightiness that they bury anything good about him at the same time, a lot of which is just as if not /more/ visible to the reader than his negative traits.
