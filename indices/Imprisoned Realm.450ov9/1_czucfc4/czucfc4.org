  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry and a war hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.
