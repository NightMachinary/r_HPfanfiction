Not from the top of my head, and I'm actually mostly agreeing with you. I dislike "magical cores" and stuff, it just doesn't make sense.

I just wanted to point out a counter-example.

And the bullets argument is ridiculous - in PS some eleven-year olds lift the club of a huge mountain-troll. They do it fast. If you make a back-of-the envelope calculation you'll find this is enough energy to stop a high-powered rifle bullet. And you don't need to stop the bullet, just deflect. And if you watch the end of fantastic beasts (I take it as canon) than bullets suddenly seem ridiculusly small and easy.

No, wizards would own a war against muggles if they wanted to fight united. Apparate into the weapon-stash and vanish ammunition. Or simply put a simple muggle-repelling charm.

Bombs? Use legilimency from under an invisibility cloak to find out when they are dropped. Or just imperious the general to make the bombs drop over populated London instead of Diagon Alley. They won't dare doing it again.

Besides, considering Newt's case: Probably the entire magical population of Britan could camp in a single house. Apparate straight in / out, so no unusual traffic.

How would you ever find that?

Nah, with canon magic Wizards would kick Muggel-Ass.

Muggels couldn't even keep a prisoner. If they saw any magical person, it would be kill or let them escape.
