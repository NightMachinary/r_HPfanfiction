You have some good points there, but I think that what would happen is escalation. Both sides underestimate each other, so we get some wizards teleporting in, kill some soldiers, teleport out. Soldiers annoyed, so they bomb diagon alley, whose wards likely don't protect against bombs. They kill a bunch of wizards, and the wards are fixed. This is getting out of hand so wizards go to imperious to upper levels of the military. This is one of the choke points, where wizards may just flat out win. But, if they figure it out, Muggles can counter with compartmentalization, absolute secrecy, and heavy paranoia. Muggles can't cast the imperious curse, so a wizard must manually spread the curse. If a muggle general holes up in an unknown bunker and sends his orders via internet connection, there should be no way to find him. Of course, Muggles start trying to counter wizards with roundabout techniques, such as thermal cameras attached to automated turrets in complexes and the like. Plainclothes special agents, stationed at likely attack points. Imprisoning wizards wouldn't work the first few times, but keeping them constantly drugged, reduces their ability to concentrate and thus to do magic. Meanwhile, the wizards are getting better, learning more guerilla warfare tactics adapted to urban fighters, taking tips from the IRA and the Taliban. Wizards are the perfect guerilla fighters with their host of abilities, but they don't have any great tacticians to really make full use of teleporting invisible assassin's. Both sides continually adapt and kill each other off and it becomes a long protracted war where everyone loses.
