Sure, the Wizards would lose a lot in the beginning, but in the end I don't see them anything but victorious.

- Any public figure of moral can be assassinated or turned.
- Veritasium is totally overpowered against Muggles. Imagine one or two mid-to-high ranking generals being asked "What could we do that would hurt your cause the most", or "Which point of your infrastructure could we take out that would the most", or "What do you think is the best action to take for us to win" - If you are creative with the questions, even an uniformed wizard will know how to hurt really fast. Ignorance of Muggle capabilities doesn't matter when the Muggles know it.
- "but they don't have any great tacticians to really make full use of teleporting invisible assassin's" - I think the longer the war went on, the more they could learn this. Also, again: Veritasium. If you capture a great strategist, can you force him to make strategies for you using Veritasium and great questions?
- Diagon Alley is probably warded against bombs. They /were/ popular in WW2, and London was a target during the Blitz. If the wizards didn't come up with a way to protect themselves after a few years, I don't know anymore.
- Also, Diagon Alley is in the center of a highly populated area. You don't bomb that shit before evacuating it. And that would tip even the most obvious Wizards off.
- Also, the MoM is literally underground, below London. And so is Gringotts. How do you attack that without risking the city horribly collapsing?
- Wizards already know guerilla warfare tactics - that's what the Death Eaters used.

Hagrid says in the beginning of PS that it's the MoM's main job to keep Magic a secret, but from the looks their setup could also be pretty effective against a muggle-attack of an enemy country or even their own muggle government.

Edit: By the way, it's fun discussing with you :)
