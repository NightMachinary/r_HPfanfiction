True. I prefer to think that it is the boggart causing exhaustion, since Dementors are known for sapping strength and happiness and what not. Having spells being powered by understanding makes more sense to me, given all the canon things. Besides, I would rather have consistency with no power limitations, than inconsistent power limitations which don't make sense.

Case in point, the fanon argument for why Muggles should be able to win wars against wizards is that bullets have so much energy that they shatter shields and wards. But when wizards routinely vanish and conjure pounds of matter, physics consistency would require that they could shield against massive antimatter explosions. Having everything as a matter of comprehension keeps consistency and easily allows plot holes to be glossed over.

I get that I just rehashed part of my argument, so sorry. It is interesting though. You wouldn't know of any other parts in the books where it implies this?
