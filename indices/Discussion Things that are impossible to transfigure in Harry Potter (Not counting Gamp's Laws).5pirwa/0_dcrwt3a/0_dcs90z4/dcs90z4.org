There actually are hints in canon that magic is taxing:

#+begin_quote
  There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking.
#+end_quote

PoA, Harry learning the patronus. Harry has done nothing but standing and shouting "Expecto Patronum" a few times.

However, it's not quite clear if this is because the boggart-dementor is taxing ), or the patronus-charm is.

I agree with most of the rest of your post though.
