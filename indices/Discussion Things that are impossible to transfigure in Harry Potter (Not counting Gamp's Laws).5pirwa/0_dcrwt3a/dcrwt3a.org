Frankly, this idea of things which cannot be transfigured is fairly ridiculous. It makes no sense that some things are special, except in the case that it needs Transfiguration. Nerfing things is a huge part of the canon, simply because the canon is so ill-defined. There is absolutely nothing in canon which suggests that transfigurations are not permanent for example, contrary to the writing of several fanon authors, most notably LessWrong. Similarly, the canon has nothing indicating that magic is taxing on one's energy, it is simply extrapolated because otherwise everyone would be ridiculously overpowered.

Let's look at the canon things of what cannot be transfigured, and then try to apply actual reason to them.

Food is the most obvious one, and is a weak explain again for hardship in the extended camping arc of book seven. The law states that food cannot be conjured, and we can safely extrapolate that it cannot be transfigured. However, canonically, it can be summoned, duplicated or enlarged, which is one of those little plot holes that Rowling had. Just get some bread and keep duplicating it. Now this massive loophole indicates that there is nothing magical about food which makes it so you literally cannot conjure or transfigure it. Rather, it seems like Gamp's Exceptions in general are all rather subjective, and instead act as guidelines to things you shouldn't transfigure. Taking food, and duplicating or enlarging it preserves the same base chemical structure, so you don't have to understand the structure to make it. However, if you were to conjure it without knowing what you are doing, you would likely have something which feels like bread, looks like bread, smells and tastes like bread, but does not chemically react like bread. Thus, wizards(who it is debatable whether they even know what an atom is) would create it, eat it, and subsequently die. Thus, our rule against food.

Money is a pretty obvious one, or else inflation would be terrifying. But we have a problem. Canonically, money can be duplicated as seen with the Geminio Curses on the Lestrange Vault. So we would have inflation anyway. Or would we. If we establish that magic leaves traces, then everything makes sense, from Dumbledore finding wierd chains in caves, to how Transfiguration can be permanent yet reversible. If I were to transfigure my quill into a pen, then using the canonically version, it would not change back. So then if I try to transfigure it back, would it not be a different quill? For that matter, we have the same problem with human transfiguration. What makes better sense is that magic leaves traces, and a sort of diagram of what was done to do it. But Untransfiguration(this is a thing [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Untransfiguration]] ) basically finds those traces and preforms the transfiguration in Arithmantic reverse. So why the tangent. Because goblins. If you go about transfiguring gold all willy nilly then the goblins will come after you for counterfeiting, and we can assume that captial punishment is standerd for any such thing. And anything you have transfigured has your magical fingerprint on it along with proof that it was fabricated. But wait, what about the Sorcerer's(Philosopher's) Stone. The pretty red Rock which makes people rich. Well, since alchemy is apperantly lucrative, we have to assume that it does not produce any magical signature, which makes it the perfect tool to flood the economy. I could get into that but I won't for brevity.

Life/Death- Can't be done. Either you can't make true life, or you can't make true death. Let's address both. Life makes sense. For you to transfigure true life, you would have to first be able to transfigure an anatomically correct body, down to the molecules. Difficult, but by no means impossible. Then you have to somehow spark it to start living, also difficult. Then you have to shove a soul in it. Since we don't have canon information, I have to improvise. Creating souls is a bit like creating strong AI. You can make something appear to think. You can even make it do useful things, but the real souls are so damn complex that it just feels like a pale imitation. As for death, I will confess to being biased. I love necromancy fics, both reading and writing them. I am the manager for one of, if not the only Necromancy community on FFN. Thus, my own head canon is that necromancy is totally possible, just not with pure transfiguration/conjuration. After all, you can't transfigure a soul back into it's body. So my opinion is just that while possible, it is difficult, inadvisable, and blatantly illegal.

Sadly, other transfiguration laws are mostly conjecture. However, I will point out a very interesting facet. Conjuration turns nothing into something, and Vanishment turns something into nothing. Arithmantically inverted concepts, like a black hole and a white hole. However, there are no rules about Vanishment, only that it gets more difficult with complexity, such as the different between a snail and a rat, one invertebrate, the other a vertabrate. We have seen it used on potions, materials, and living things. However, if they are indeed Arithmantic opposites, then you should be able to conjure anything which can be vanished, whether it be potions, living creatures, or whatever.

I mentioned before that magic does not tax one's energy. What I believe happens, is that spells are learned based on one's understanding and comprehension of the spell. Obviously holding the understanding of a shield in the mind is mentally taxing, and getting hit with a stunner might distract from the shield, allowing it to be broken. But I truly believe that this is a thing, and it ties in with my above points. Magic can do anything you imagine, but you must be able to imagine it, be able to comeprehend it. Thus, one cannot conjure potions, since the complex interplay of wierd chemicals and magic has not been studied enough to do so.
