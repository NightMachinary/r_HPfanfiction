If you can Transfigure a wizard - robes and all - during a duel, then it seems plausible that the wand would have been Transfigured as well.

I'm not sure if the wand specifically being a target would change this, though it's my headfanon that magical artifacts of exceptional craftsmanship are generally imbued with protective enchantments to prevent that sort of thing.

With all being said and done, though, isn't that the point of the Exceptions to Gamp's Laws? Only one was ever confirmed in canon, so taking all that seems implausible, I'm inclined to say:

- 1) Conjuring nutritive matter

- 2) Transfiguring death (life can be Conjured, but death is irreversible. Possibly extended to hereditary imperfections such as poor eyesight, stature, etc. which, like immortality, fall under the purview of Alchemy's goals)

- 3) Conjuring *authentic* precious metals/gems (their worth seemingly isn't compromised in the Wizarding World, possibly due to inherent magical properties. Again, an Alchemical pursuit)

- 4) Anything exceeding a certain surface area (which appears to be an adult-sized dragon... more or less)

- 5) (i) Magic itself (you probably can't Conjure a magical artifact in one go; apothecaries and wandmakers still require magical ingredients from creatures/plants; goblins, house-elves, centaurs etc. still make unique contributions to magical society)

  (ii) Probably the effects of Dark Magic (injuries, scar tissue, amputations, damage caused by exposure to basilisk venom, Fiendfyre, unicorn blood, etc.)

Aside from what's impossible, I just assume that a lot of the rest is just insanely complicated. Transfiguring clothing/furniture/architecture, etc. is probably highly specialised, and I think that might be linked to human ingenuity (maybe that's one of the Exceptions instead?).

EDIT: Made some additions for a more inclusive list. Human Transfiguration (as opposed to Self-Transfiguration) might be likewise tricky, though accomplished wizards such as Barty Crouch Jr. and Percy Weasley (both top N.E.W.T students) display a knack for it. For many of the upper-tier wizards, it just seems like more of a stylistic choice. I honestly can't see Bellatrix doing it. For all we know, she might have fizzled an attempt from Sirius during their duel.
