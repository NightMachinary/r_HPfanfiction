Your head canon is what I was thinking, powerful magical artefacts such as the Mirror of Erised, or the Philosipher's stone seem like it would be impossible to transfigure, along with more magically resistant things, like dragons, basilisks, trolls, etc., while items like wands, I can't decide if it should be possible to transfigure them into something else specifically, or if Ollivander, Gregorovitch, and other great wand makers somehow make it impossible for such a thing to happen.
