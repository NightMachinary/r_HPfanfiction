I detect a flaw in 2 and 5 in your version of Gamp's exception, which is that they don't relate to transfiguration in the first place. Death and magic are not physical things and transfiguration is about the manipulation of physical things. You don't need an exception to say that transfiguration cannot create magic, it flows from the definition of the discipline. It seems likely to me that all 5 exceptions are clear physical classes of objects, like "food" was.

Furthermore, I don't think your #4 is a good contender as it is not defined by its quality but rather quantity. It's not so much a limitation of the magic as it is of the wizard. When Hermione says "I doubt even McGonagall..." with respect to transfiguring a dragon, she's implying that McGonagall has a better chance of it than someone else i.e. that the size capable of being transfigured varies with the wizard. That's not really a hard limit/exception kind of rule.

Also we've seen Voldemort conjure silver so it can't exclude all precious metals.

The five I would go for are:

1. Food

2. Gold

3. Gems

4. Money

5. Sentient creatures
