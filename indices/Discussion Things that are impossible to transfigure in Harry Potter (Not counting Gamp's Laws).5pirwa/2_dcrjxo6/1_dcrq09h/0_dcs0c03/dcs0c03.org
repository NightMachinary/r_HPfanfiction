Fair points. I've personally written death and magic off before because of the dubious physicality of both, but I think a case can still be argued for each one.

Death as a physical process still holds weight in HP magic since the extraction of the soul isn't enough to kill something outright.

In regards to magic, I should have specified that I had magical creatures and the like in mind. I suppose that could fit in the category of not Conjuring sentient creatures, but would that stop a skilled wizard from magicking physically identical phoenix-tail feathers? I generally view magic and matter as entirely separate, but at what point do you separate the magic from certain ngredients? Would transformed plants work just as well in a potion, for example?
