  Why does nobody else do this?

Either they didn't think of it or there's some kind of requirement like not being weaker than the target. Probably the former one, but I can see people assuming the latter.

  And what about transfiguring radioactive items?
#+end_quote

I presume it's doable, but only if you know what you are doing and would most likely harm you to a degree too. Not to mention that to do this with any sort of efficiency in combat you'd probably have to practice a bit with it, which is not the most user-friendly way to get stronger, so to say.

Well, unless wizards are somehow more resistant or even immune to radiation, which would make it less hazardous to do this but also less of a useful thing.

That said, transfiguring the moisture in the air into some acid or a chemical substance with a debilitating effect seems like a decent alternative, especially since that stuff is less likely to backfire and making your enemies breathe acid seems poison-esque enough (they won't have time for healing such stuff during a battle, and afterwards it might be too late). Transfuguring a layer of earth beneath them into something like sodium and then drenching it water might work too, even if it happens to be more disorienting than damaging.

The question is, can you actually transfigure into something if you've never even seen it? Because that seems like something that could very well be a thing, and that could limit one's options a fair bit.
