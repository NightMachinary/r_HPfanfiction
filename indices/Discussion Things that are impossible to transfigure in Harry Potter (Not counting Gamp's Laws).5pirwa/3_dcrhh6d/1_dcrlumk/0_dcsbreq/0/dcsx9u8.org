Maybe. I wouldn't know, but it does sound like a fairly reasonable guess, and at the same time it is something at least some wizards wouldn't really think about, especially if you transfigured air into some gas that can't be seen either which might or might not actually be a noticeable action (other than the general “this person is doing /something/” thing).

Honestly, I think it might or might not be related to the fact that using transfiguration on the fly, in combat, requires a lot of creativity and focus both in comparison to just choosing a random debilitating charm or curse or hex or jinx and doing those; as such, while using it for defence might not be too hard (just make /something/ move and make it intercept the attack), using it for offence just might be above your average witch or wizard. This might be why it's easy to defend against it, too, as attacks via transfiguration that aren't creative quite likely are guaranteed to be easy to neutralise.
