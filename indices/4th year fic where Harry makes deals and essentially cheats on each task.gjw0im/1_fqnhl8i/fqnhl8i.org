There's another fanfic in which Harry basically dithers around every task, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Dragon-Chronicles-1-Muggle-Raised-Champion][/Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle Raised Champion/ by Stargon1]], the premise being that Harry never got to go to Hogwarts because the Dursleys denied him the opportunity, and being his legal guardians, they were allowed to. He ends up being forced into the Triwizard Tournament anyway.

To be clear; This isn't the fic you're looking for, but since another user already pointed you in the right direction, I figured you might like this one as one in a similar vein.
