Yeah, but alchemy, potions, ritual magics, enchanted doo-dads and other disciplines/tools could be available, which would make solving potential situations possible when using them.

I do kind of like the image of having the average muggleborn learning more about Defence Against the Dark Arts and Care of Magical Creatures by constantly being forced to MacGyver him/herself out of trouble than in the classroom-and then being so bored with actual classwork the muggleborn spend their time basically tinkering at new & interesting magical tools while their more magically embedded classmates struggle with figuring out why, exactly, they need to know about how to counter threat x without a wand when they either have one or are surrounded by people who have them...
