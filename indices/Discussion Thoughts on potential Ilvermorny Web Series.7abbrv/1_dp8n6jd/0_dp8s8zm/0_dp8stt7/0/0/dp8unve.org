I also imagine that the purebloods would have a very different outlook on life compared to their European counterparts.

For one thing, they will have come into contact with magics from the former Incan and Mayan Empires, African shamanism, native American shamanism as well as localised variances of standard magical disciplines from Germany (Hessian War Magic anybody?), Poland, Austria-Hungary, Ireland, England (well yeah), contemporary South America, Italy, Russia, China (gold rush-era migration wave no less!), Vietnam, Korea and Canada (who would have harbored French survival magics from the 17-18th century, Inuit variations of native american magical traditions and, of course, a variety of localised British Magical Disciplines that may have persisted outside of Hogwarts).

And that's if the magical migration patterns broadly reflect no-maj ones. While there is no guarantee for that, American history's basically one giant sand-pit when it comes to migration that you could justify close to any kind of strange magical spell, potion, ritual using it.

Always having a good answer to 'why would someone even try to do that?' is possible when /that/ is quirky magics and /why/ is quirky history.

The same goes for purebloods. They would be far less, um, eccentric than their British counterparts seem to be, given that they occupy a continent that has experienced practically every magic known to man in a span of about 300 years.

They would also have to know how to navigate the thoroughly confusing no-maj world without magic too since their government is a mix of good ole USA politics and the StaatsSicherheitsDienst-and seemingly handles Statute of Secrecy problems by executing those that fall afoul of it (like, seriously, that was where Fantastic Beasts basically went full grimdark without any warning whatsoever-which was great, but holy hell people).

Best way to avoid that mess? No-maj world=no wand. Problem? Considering how hard it is to just live in there, can you imagine how insanely confusing it must be to a newcomer? The average magical would have to seriously work at understanding even the bare basics of it if they want a chance at immersing themselves into that world without, say, ending up in an insane asylum somewhere.

So purebloods have more motivation to actually study and understand the no-maj side than their British cousins since, hey, acting like a British Pureblood would most likely see them killed by their own government and thus avoiding that mess would be a priority for them.

That's another avenue that you can take.
