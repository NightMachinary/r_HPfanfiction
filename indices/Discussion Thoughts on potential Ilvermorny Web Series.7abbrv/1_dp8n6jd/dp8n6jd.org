It sounds like a good idea. The question is, though, whether it would actually be set in Ilvermorny all the time or if there will be sequences played out outside the school's walls.

One thing I find frustrating in the main HP series is just how mundane the summer sequences were outside of that one dementor attack. England has a very rich history and folklore surrounding strange happenings, mythical creatures etc that would have made for interesting encounters over the summer but were never touched upon.

Having magical encounters for the students during their summer break in the form of creatures, curses or ghosts loose in the muggle world would definitely make for some very interesting material. The need to act to keep friends and family safe from harm with the restriction of having to keep magic on the very down-low would make for dynamic, dramatic and creative situations as the kids dive into the books to find out how to curtail threats without needlessly jeopardising the statute of secrecy.

Think Supernatural without the divinity stuff and more 'fun' times for the people involved.
