I am writing one that fits your Elsewhere classification! :) I will put it on my Quotev for you! It is about the ten year time between 1981, the prologue, and 1991, the real start of Philosopher's Stone, and how the world and my main characters learned to cope and move on from things. They are completely original and random magic families I made. [[https://www.quotev.com/story/10287918/Harry-Potter-Recusancy]]
