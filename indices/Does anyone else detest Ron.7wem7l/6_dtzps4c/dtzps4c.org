Yes, but mostly because of books three and four. He got better later on, but because of the shit he pulled, especially in GoF, Harry and Hermione should have ended the friendship at that point. He is not a bad person and definitely doesn't deserve deserve some weird love potion Death Eater plots, he is simply not someone who would be a good friend for either Harry or Hermione. There's a certain line, which puts a permanent end to a friendship, and in my opinion he crossed that one by 1st of November 1994 for Harry and at the Yule Ball with Hermione (the accusations against her spying for Krum).
