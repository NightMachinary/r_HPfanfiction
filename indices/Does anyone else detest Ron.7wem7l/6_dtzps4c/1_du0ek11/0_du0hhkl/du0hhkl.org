Well, the thing is, much like with Scabbers, Hermione was right in the end. I mean, not that Draco didn't deserve Sectumsempra, but that was a rather dangerous spell in the book. Hindsight was 20/20, but without her confusion about Ron, Lavender and Cormac, she would not have been that dickish towards Harry, who frankly was just a target for her pent-up aggression. Yes, she is jealous and not really nice about the entire mess, but she did not make accusations which went against the quintessential character traits of her friends like Ron when he thought Harry entered himself or that Hermione was going to betray Harry for a guy on their first date.
