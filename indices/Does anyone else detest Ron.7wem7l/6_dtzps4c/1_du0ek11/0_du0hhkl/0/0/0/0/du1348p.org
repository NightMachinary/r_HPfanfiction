If you break the rules for years and it results in harm to you or your possessions, I'm not going to feel bad about it, even if it was my pet who ate your illegal one. You put your pet into harms way, you have to live with the consequences. Any owl could have snacked a rat, and if you blame a friend for your mistakes, that makes you a dick, not the friend.
