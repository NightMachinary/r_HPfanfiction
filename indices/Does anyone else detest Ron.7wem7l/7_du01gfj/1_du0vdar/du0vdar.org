Several things here. Ron is hardly useless and isn't lazy when he feels it's something worth putting effort into. He took in active role in the DA, fought in the DoM, fought in the Astronomy tower, and was instrumental in helping Harry first year, second year, fifth year, sixth year (though in smaller doses, due to most of it being exposition), and in the hunt for the horcruxes.

Harry wouldn't have fit in in Slytherin, especially since they were the children of the servants of the man that wanted him dead. Harry already didn't want to be in Slytherin because of Malfoy and Hagrid. And if Harry were to go to Slytherin, he'd have never befriended Hermione and she'd have ended up a splattered mess on the bathroom walls.
