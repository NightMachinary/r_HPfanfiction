Author who wrote "Mercenary" as elsewhere recommended (and I second) also wrote "The Sniper" linkffn(3918135) which is in a similar vein and I remember as better than "Mercenary". It also has a sequel linkffn(6808016) which I remember as not so good but I could be wrong.

"Mercenary" also has a very good sequel linkffn(6568694)

EDIT: I find your username churlish and wicked lol. Caves can have that 1, Dubs got 3 extra.
