I was under the impression Wand Loyalty applied only to the Elder Wand. Regular wands choose their masters, and stick with them. Even if Harry were to defeat idk Ron in a duel, Ron's wand wouldn't suddenly work best for Harry. The Elder Wand, however, was created by an angry Death who wanted Antioch to die. So, the Elder Wand had no built in loyalty, making it a highly coveted wand that could work for anyone (as long as they kill/disarm/beat) the previous owner.
