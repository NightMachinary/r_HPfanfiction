My head-canon is that "loyalty" or something like it is a characteristic of wands, relating to, say, the wood or the core. We know that elder wands in general, not just /the/ Elder Wand, have a really bad reputation, so my thought is that they are really fickle, with their ownership passing on extremely easily. To make up for that, they're also really powerful, and the most powerful of them all is also the most fickle.
