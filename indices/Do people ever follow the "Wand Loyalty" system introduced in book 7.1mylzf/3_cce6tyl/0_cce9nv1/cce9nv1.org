They're both part of the same concept that was introduced in Book 7. It's a combination of the two points you said- everyone has their own wand. If you're beat someone in a duel, you can use their wand as well as if it was your own. If you just steal someone's wand, then the wand doesn't "recognize" you as its master, and it won't work to its full potential.

That's why Voldemort was stomping around Europe for the first half of book 7- he was trying to figure out why the Elder Wand wasn't working well for him.
