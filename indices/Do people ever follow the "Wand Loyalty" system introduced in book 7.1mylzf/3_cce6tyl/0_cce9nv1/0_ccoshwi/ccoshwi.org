This concept also explains Neville's poor performance at magic in the first five books. He is using his father's wand, which has not given him its allegiance. After it breaks during the fight at the ministry, he is given his own wand, and (though Harry spends little time with him in class) he is quite a bit better at magic from then on. You could argue that his low self-esteem in the first five books keeps him from being good at spell-work, but I'd like to think his new wand is also better for him because of the wand's loyalty to him.
