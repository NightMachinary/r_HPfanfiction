It's definitely not the best fic around, and it's got a bit of that "America is so great! Boo Magical Britain" that some people don't like, but I think it is balanced out pretty well by the Pine Barrens. [[/spoiler][Jersey Devil man, don't mess with that shit]]. And it has a magical animagus and custom wands [[/spoiler][though they are made from feathers from Harry's magical animagus, so that actually kinda makes sense in my brain]]. That all being said, I fucking love this fic. Not sure why, don't particularly care why.
