The "Go, America" vibe is a bit much, and could easily be edited out, or at least toned down a touch. But that said, I love this story.

Rowling's magic is very much made up on the spot, but this author has tried to give some structure, and reasoning behind the how and why of certain magic. Its not taking it apart and making it science, but its very much making it seem more grounded to me.

I like to reread this story on occasion. It gives Harry access to some rare magic, which he uses to great effect. It may go a bit towards the overpowered side of things, but its nice to read a Harry that can get things done. And it does so without just saying "And harry just decided that wands are stupid, its all about will power and visualization. Harry then just waved his hand while focusing greatly, and voldemorts suddenly dead body appeared, and his ghost cried out cursing the Potter name as it faded into the afterlife."
