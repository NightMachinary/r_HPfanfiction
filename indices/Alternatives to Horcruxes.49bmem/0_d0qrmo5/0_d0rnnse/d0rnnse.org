I don't know if I've read that one, but I've always had it as head!canon that that is how the dark mark behaved. It was proof that Voldemort hadn't died the first time, because it would have completely dissapeared the Dark Mark from his servants, if it didn't kill them by completely siphoning all the life/magic from their bearers to try and keep Voldemort alive. Then again, that is proved to not be canon by the continued survival of Draco Malfoy in the epilogue, but I don't like that either, and so just ignore it too.
