This is a wonderful article. The author's suggestions for recommendations on websites such as ff.net and AO3 are very interesting, as there is (to my knowledge) no existing recommendation engine for fanfiction. However, some of the mathematical notation used may not make this read as accessible as one would think. Nonetheless, I encourage anyone who has once thought about automated fanfiction recommendation to skim over this article. Thank you very much for posting this!
