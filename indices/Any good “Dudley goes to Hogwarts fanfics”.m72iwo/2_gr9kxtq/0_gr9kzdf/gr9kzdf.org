  Ever since Petunia and Vernon Dursley found their nephew suffering from hypothermia on their doorstep, they have been raising young Harry Potter as their own to spite the idiots who left a baby out overnight in late autumn. As such, Harry Potter has grown up loved and supported, changing not only his own life, but the lives of those around him. None of Harry's magical accidents or Petunia and Vernon's previous experience in the magical world could have prepared them for the arrival of a relative that Harry never knew he had - or the discovery that the wizard who left Harry to die has been quietly stealing Harry's inheritance behind the scenes and squandering Harry's chances at a good life.Fortunately for Harry, his family is more than happy to support him, and his newly-arrived second uncle is hell-bent on correcting everything that one Mr Albus Dumbledore has done to screw Harry over.
