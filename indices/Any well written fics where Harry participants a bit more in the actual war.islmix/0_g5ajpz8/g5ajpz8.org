I'm blanking on the name of the fanfic, but I do recall one in which Harry adopts a more adult persona (including aging potion/glamors) to be a key factor to the war effort. The biggest thing I remember is the growing friendship of Dumbledore and Harry's persona, which causes Harry to start seeing Albus more like a grandfather.

If no-one has linked it by the time I get back from doing laundry, I'll go look for it, cause I'm tempted to re-read it after I get to the current last chapter of "Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay." (Which, in case you're worried about reading it for some reason of other, it's actually hilarious. Below is by far one of my favorite bits of it, it's about why Astronomy is a core subject.)

  Professor Sinistra looked around. "Mr. Potter, you're curious, and I think that's admirable. So I believe I'll now tell you why I believe it is that my class is core studies, and not an elective like Muggle Studies or Divination."

  Harry sat down, doing his best to look trustworthy and admirable.

  "Professor Dumbledore likes astronomy, and we have an Astronomy Tower."

  After a long pause, Harry blinked. "That's... it?"

  "That, as you say, is it," Professor Sinistra told him. "I suspect it is the same reason why we have a Divination class, or why there are clubs for both chamber music and tenpin bowling."
