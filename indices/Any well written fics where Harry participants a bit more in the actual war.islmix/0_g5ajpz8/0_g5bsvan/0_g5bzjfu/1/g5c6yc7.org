Okay, I feel like a major fool now, cause not only is this story on my favorites on FFN, I literally recommended it today for a different reason (Harry having Voldemort's memories) and didn't realize they were the same.

The story I wanted to recommend is Harry Potter: Dark Memories by Blueowl linkffn(3655940)

I only figured this out because of two reasons. 1. I made a "What's that fic" thread, and 2, I stumbled upon the author's FFN page completely by accident since I had their "Mysterious Thing, Time" fanfic open and in their bio they had the key thing I remembered from the fic in it. Wow...
