Alright, time to weigh in on my take here. Warning, opinionated and satirical commentary ahead:

- Most readers were in their pre-teens when Harry Potter came out. Makes sense, similar to the Star Trek and Star Wars fandoms in a lot of ways following their first iterations.
- 7 out of 10 are males. Ironically, writers according to [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] are far more skewed towards female. Read into that as much as you like.
- Seriously, more than 1 in 20 people post other, and its the next highest behind Christian. Now I kinda want to know how many Nordic worshipers, devil worshipers, and Jedi there are here (its a religion, seriously).
- 7 out of 10 are single. The irony of this is thats almost the exact number currently (70.8 vs 69.9%) of heterosexual individuals currently in the poll. Doesn't necessarily mean anything, but boy does that look damning.
- Nearly half are students. Shocking I know.
- Nearly half of responders read hp fanfiction everyday or once a week. Well, that seems appropriate since they took enough time to do this survey when they should probably be doing something useful (look at me, the pot calling the kettle Sirius).
- The number of people who read only HP fanfiction is almost exactly equal to the number of people who read Harry-centric fics only. I sense a pattern here.
- Harry/female pairing: Ginny makes a comeback. Probably sucking up all the people who are oversaturated with Hermione fics (saw that about 5-6 years ago the other direction). Daphne and Luna definitely higher up, which is kind of amazing all things considered. Also, I just realized that I have never seen a fic with a legitimately good romance with Cho Chang, which is sort of shocking actually. There are more Harry/Pansy, Harry/Lily, and Harry/Andromeda fics than what was Harry's first crush in canon.
- Harry/male pairing: somehow people like Voldemort and Draco paired up with Harry more than anyone else. Let me rephrase that; people prefer Harry with a known terrorist who murdered his parents and a racist bigot with the worst example of a redemption arc I can remember. I kinda want to know what people include as "other" in this category now too.
- Wow, Luna Lovegood is 3rd beating out Albus Dumbledore and Sirius Black. Did someone start a campaign or something recently with the slogan "MAKE LUNA GREAT AGAIN," and I just missed the memo? Either way, sounds good to me.
- Peter Pettigrew is roughly as hated as Severus Snape. Sort of get that, they both had a role in killing Harry's parents. Its just weird that one had a major redemptive arc in the story (whether you believe it "redeemed" him or not), while the other appears to have been this character that Rowling invented to bring back Voldemort and then couldn't think of anything to do with afterward except kill him off in DH.
- People dislike the last book and the first two books more. This is the HP equivalent of the 2nd movie is always the best in the trilogy from where I stand. Think of it like the original Star Wars trilogy and suddenly you see the series in a whole new light.
- The God-parallel character (Dumbledore) is ironically the most divisive character in the series (more than the devil-parallel character!).
- House-elves are complicated as hell.
- How many people here actually played the video games? Not a joke, seriously I am sort of curious.
- 1 in 4 readers care more about an ending to a fic than the story itself. Honestly, the majority of fics I can think of actually have average to terrible endings, so that seems somewhat...limiting.
- Most of the responses to tropes are a reflection to what is common in the fandom. You get tired of some trope the more you read it, regardless of commonality. Totally understand that.
- People really want more unique magical culture stories and occult/esoteric world-building.
- People want redeemed Draco but not redeemed Snape (or mentor Snape, but one sort of rolls into another I think). Personally I blame the movies for this.
- People hate Muggle-wank stories.
- People like in canon characterizations best. My take is thats because /most/ fics do not depict in canon characterizations.
- People hate Hermione bashing more than Ron or Dumbledore bashing. Apparently there is selective bashing preferences, and a /very/ open interpretation of canonical characterizations.
- Summer training montage = not a lot of fans of Rocky here.
- When comes to magical power, I think people are starting to get to the core of the issue.
