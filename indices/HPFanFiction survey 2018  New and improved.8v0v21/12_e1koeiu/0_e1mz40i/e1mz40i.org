I'm not sure its that per say so much as the tide of Hermione fics has left the fandom oversaturated and now seeking and less of a desire. H/G, followed by H/D and H/L, are by far the most likely to soak up the losses in popularity by their nature.

Harry/Ginny fics were much the same 6-7 years ago in the fandom, near the end of the movies and the first few years after the books came out (what a mess of post-war fics that churned out/is still churning out).
