The most surprising result for me is that you all favor stories with a magically genius Harry Potter. Ugh. Why? Not making Harry into some kind of super-wizard is one of the more clever things JKR did in her books. Making his eventual victory dependent on his strength of character and will instead of his magical prowess seems strictly superior to many fanfics who just make him the next Dumbledore/Voldemort and have him shoot laser beams from his eyes.
