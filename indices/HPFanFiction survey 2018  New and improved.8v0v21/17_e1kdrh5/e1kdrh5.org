Great survey, thanks so much for putting it together!

I wish the slash/fem slash question answers were more detailed though rather than just yes/no. I don't really like slash, but I will read it if I find the plot/storyline interesting enough. I never know if I should put yes or no for that question though since even though I don't care for it I guess I still do read it occasionally.

For favorite pairing question, could you just list the most popular pairings and then have an other answer with a fill in option? There are a lot of characters, but there is not that many popular pairings (I think). Or you could even break down the other options like Harry/other, Hermione/Other, etc.
