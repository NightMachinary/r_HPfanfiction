I find it kind of funny and sad that so many people like Daphne as a relationship partner in comparison to other canon character but I guess it easy to understand. There's something about the essence of a good guy like Harry meddling with the forbidden fruit that is a "bad" girl in Slytherin that makes it simply enjoyable to read.
