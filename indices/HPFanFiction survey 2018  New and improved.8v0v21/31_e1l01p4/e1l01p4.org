Great survey! If I may make a suggestion, while including a rundown of HP specific tropes is great, and can always be expanded upon (ex. Nonmagical AUs, Founder's Heirs being a thing, etc.) , I think it would be great to add more general/wide spread tropes

Opinions on crack fics, For Want of A Nail, dimensional travel, Self Inserts, time travel (perhaps specify with Time Turner vs with other means), Peggy Sue, preference for oneshots vs preference for novels, etc
