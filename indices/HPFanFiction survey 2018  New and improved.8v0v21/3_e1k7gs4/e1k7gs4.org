Now that we have a little over 250 responses I'm going to take a look at what surprises me. Please don't read this unless you took the survey; I don't want to skew the results!

I'm not going to comment on the demographics, just the preferences part of it.

It seems that a good part of [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] at least reads no-HP fanfiction at least one a month (currently sitting at 54.6%). I'm very glad of this. While most other fandoms don't have as well-developed fanfiction community as Harry Potter does, there is still a lot of good fanfics out there that aren't HP!

Slash fic readers are a minority (37.7%), but 53.1% reads femslash fics. Lots of things could explain that discrepancy, so I won't hazard a guess as to why there's a 15.4% difference in those numbers.

Harry/Ginny seems to be the most popular pairing, which Harry/Hermione trailing by 7%. What surprised me was Daphne having 13.8% of the vote, over Luna (who had 12.1%). Fleur at 10.4% didn't surprise me, neither did Tonks with 5.4%. Personally I'm hoping for more Harry/Katie fics because I love that pairing.

I think for slash pairings, the reason Other has 34.4% of the vote is probably mostly people who don't like slash fics that wanted to answer the question.

For 'Favorite Harry Potter character', I am not surprised by the responses, except that both Dumbledore and Sirius were above Snape, and that Draco only has 1.2% of the votes! Also, Ron only has 3.1% of the votes so far. Poor Ron.

Not surprising that Umbridge is the most hated HP character by a /wide/ margin. She has 51.2% of the vote! Snape, Pettigrew, Draco Malfoy, and Fudge round out the top five. Ron has 3.8% of the vote. I like Ron, so I don't like those people that voted for him here.

For canon, it looks like we all pretty much agree the original 7 books are canon, but no other option has more than 50% of the vote. Pottermore has 41.2%, Fantastic Beasts movies have 40%, and the side books have 36.6%. Only 8.5% of voters view Cursed Child as canon.

53.5% of voters say that the majority of the fics they read are guilty pleasures. I can see that, though I try to avoid 'guilty pleasure' fics. Only 28.1% of voters actively avoid incomplete stories, and 65% of voters believe there is no such thing as an inherently bad story idea.

Now for the ratings section! Again, only doing the surprising ones.

Funnily enough, 81.1% of voters rated 'the existence of a politically powerful magical nobility' as a 3 or higher, while only 58.8% rated 'Harry inheriting significant political power' as 3 or higher. It looks like fanfic readers like the magical nobility, but don't necessarily want Harry to be a part of it by right of birth. They also didn't want Harry to be ultra rich, with only 22.7% giving it a 4 or higher and 45% giving it a 2 or lower.

Voters tend to dislike soul bonds and marriage contracts (42.1% and 45% rated them 3 or higher, respectively), which surprises me given the plethora of fics that have one or both of those tropes.

Most people love a magically talented Harry, which is to be expected, but I was surprised that 75.8% of people gave a 3 or higher to magical genius Harry! Personally, I gave that a 1 because OP!MagicalHarry is boring as fuck to read outside of crack stories in my opinion. Apparently I'm in the minority, though!

Redemption of Draco Malfoy skewed very slightly towards the positive, but not as much as I expected. Only 41.2% gave it a 4 or higher while 27.3% gave it a 2 or lower. What was more surprising is that Severus Snape as a mentor was so disliked, with 48.5% of people giving it a 2 or lower.

It seems most people prefer in-canon characterizations and a canonical magic system. I find this a bit surprising, mainly because Harry and Hermione (and sometimes Snape and Draco) are very frequently made more powerful/morally right/perfect in fanfiction while Ron and Dumbledore (and sometimes Sirius) find themselves made more foolish/hated/morally inferior in fanfiction. People did claim they disliked Dumbledore bashing (41.5% gave it a 3 or higher) and Ron bashing (41.9% gave it a 3 or higher), though that's not consistent with a lot of highly-recommended fics on this sub. Predictably, full 50% of voters gave Hermione bashing a rating of 1, and only 28% gave it a 3 or higher.

Speaking of Hermione, 58.5% of voters gave a 3 or higher to the idea of Hermione being a magical genius. Remember, Harry got 75.8% to the same question. Ugh. However, the splits trend slightly towards the negative for Hermione-centric fics, with only 33.1% giving it a 4 or higher while 38% gave it a 2 or lower). People like OP!Hermione but not necessarily as the main character.

Fem!Harry is slightly unpopular (47.7% gave it a 2 or lower), but Dark!Harry is very popular, with only 21.9% giving it a 2 or lower and 50% giving it a 4 or higher. Surprisingly, Evil!Harry is unpopular, with 55% of voters giving it a 2 or lower!

People tend to prefer explicit sex scenes in their fiction, with 80.5% giving it a 3 or higher. Personally, I prefer sexual elements to explicit sex scenes, but I gave it a 3 because it's fine. It is hard to write a good sex scene, I will admit freely.

Almost no one wanted America to be a magical utopia, with 77.3% of voters giving it a 2 or lower. I agree, voters.
