My feeling on the matter is that most decent or good fem!Harry stories are good /in spite/ of being fem!Harry more than as a direct consequence of it. I have two fem!Harry stories on my Favorite list right now, and I really like both, but I don't think it would make much of a narrative difference if Harry were just male.

In my (limited) experience, a lot of fem!Harry are simply the result of female authors who don't think they can pull off writing a male main protagonist, and so preemptively make Harry female so they won't have cause to slip up.
