I think OP!MagicalHarry can definitely be boring in many cases because the author allows Harry to slide through all the problems/confrontations of cannon without any problem and it functions as wish fulfillment more than anything else.

But I still prefer a powerful Harry as long as there is /struggle/. There has to be some balancing of the scales. Maybe Harry, Dumbledore, Bela and Voldemort are all magically powerful. Or maybe it's a crossover fic and Harry is being balanced against protagonists from other stories. (Dropping a PowerfulHarry into another story's world is actually one of my favorite tropes). The best PowerfulHarry stories I've read are typically heavy AU.
