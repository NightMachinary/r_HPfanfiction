My take on all of this? The preferences are generally a /response/ to the majority of fics in the fandom, either what is currently popular or in the overwhelming majority.

Some examples: marriage contracts and soul bonds are in a sizeable portion of fics in the fandom. This is partly because its an easy way to make a relationship happen and partly because without it the writer would need to have a better understanding of actual relationships work (read teenagers). And people who write fics /because/ they want a pairing to occur, and are not really interested in the quality of the writing so much as wish fulfillment. Ditto for fem!Harry, most are written without any consideration of the implications and thus the story is...well...mediocre.
