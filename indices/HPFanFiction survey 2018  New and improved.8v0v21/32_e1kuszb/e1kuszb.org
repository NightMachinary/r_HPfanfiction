Thank you for including a third gender option! One request - please don't use "other". Non-binary is an umbrella term and is far more inclusive, and those of us who are NB can find it extremely alienating to just be "other". (It makes me personally feel as if I'm somehow less than human, just because the gender i was assigned at birth doesn't match my actual gender.) I really do appreciate your including a third option - far too few do - and it makes me feel much more welcome in the community. This suggestion is just an easy way to make my community feel even more welcome.

(And seriously thanks for not including "transgender" as an option, as that's absolutely the worst of all ideas.)

I think i had another couple suggestions too, but i forget them right this second. I'm gonna look at the results so maybe that'll remind me ^_^
