Ah, i remember a few of them (and please feel free to disregard - i really love learning about people and doing surveys so i tend to have a lot of ideas).

Firstly, an option to select "no heterosexual pairing" for Harry, and similar for the slash pairings. My personal headcanon is of a bisexual Harry but Drarry is my OTP, so i prefer not Harry pairing if they're not together at all. It takes me a lot to accept any other pairing. Plus there are those who prefer gen fics, and it seems like their experience isn't really accounted for at the moment.

It'd be interesting to see where people read their fic - I mainly inhabit the Captain America/Stucky fandom, so i mostly read on AO3 (honestly, i find FFN impossible to use these days). I'd be interested to see whether that's a common experience.

I'd also looooove to see how the LGBTI+ community is represented in the sub. This is of course super niche, but some questions that delve into the aromantic and asexual spectrum as well as the non-binary and trans community would really interest me personally. (As i said, this is super niche, so i don't expect it, haha. I just enjoy knowing all the finicky little details.)

Oh, actually, on gender options again. I am not personally intersex, but my friend who is tells me that they prefer the option to identify their gender as such, though they're generally cool with choosing the non-binary option. According to them, not all of the intersex community does that, but a fair portion does. So that's another suggestion for you.

Once again, this is all my own desires and not at all demands! Well, the gender stuff would make the NB and intersex community feel much more welcome, so i really strongly encourage you to consider those changes, but everything else is me wanting to tease as much info as possible for my own interests. I really appreciate your doing this, regardless, and I'm looking forward to reading the analyses people do. ^_^
