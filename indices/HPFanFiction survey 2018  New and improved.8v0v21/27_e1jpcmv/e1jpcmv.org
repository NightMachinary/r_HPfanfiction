I highly question the survey's definition of "Slash". In a fanfiction context, I define slash as a story /about/ a male protagonist being gay, and particularly if they weren't in the canon. As written, "a story where the protagonist is male and gay", then a story whose main character is Dumbledore would count as "slash" even if it's about him as an old man with zero romance.
