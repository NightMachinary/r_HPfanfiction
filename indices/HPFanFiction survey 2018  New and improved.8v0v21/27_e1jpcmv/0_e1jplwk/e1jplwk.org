If there truly was zero romance then Dumbledore's sexuality would be something known to the author but not the reader. So it wouldn't be a slash fic because there would be no way to know whether the protagonist was gay or otherwise from the fic.

If the fic does include story elements relating to Dumbledore's sexuality, such that the reader knows that he is gay, then even if there's no sex/romance then yes, I'd say it's a slash fic.
