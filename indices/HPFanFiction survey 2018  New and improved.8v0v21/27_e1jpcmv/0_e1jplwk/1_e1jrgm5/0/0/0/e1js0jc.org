Like I say, rumour, so no official source. But bloggers are talking about it.

Re: pairing vs orientation, I think the more fundamental point here is that you are coming from the position that canon-compliance is default. But I think most fanfiction does /not/ keep original characterisation in tact, nor does it intend to. People like doing their own things with the characters... I'm not sure that readers assume in general that fanfic will be canon-compliant.
