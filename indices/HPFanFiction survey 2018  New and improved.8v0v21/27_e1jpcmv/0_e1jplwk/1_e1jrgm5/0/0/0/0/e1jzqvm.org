  I think the more fundamental point here is that you are coming from the position that canon-compliance is default. But I think most fanfiction does not keep original characterisation in tact, nor does it intend to. People like doing their own things with the characters... I'm not sure that readers assume in general that fanfic will be canon-compliant.

But you kinda /have/ to assume that a fic's world is like canon, except where the authors explicitly tells you it isn't. When a fanfiction story mentions "Hogwarts" without expounding on what Hogwarts is, I'm always going to go out on a limb and assume it's meant to be a magical castle serving as Britian's school of magic. Unless you've stated otherwise earlier, I'm not going to picture a random story's Draco Malfoy as black-haired, brown-skinned, and with a big round nose, nor suppose that "Hagrid, the groundskeeper" is a highly literate old witch with pink hair. Etc.

And any self-respecting author should /know/ that that's what the reader is going to think at first. If they want to make changes, they need to state so, either by calling it all an AU from the start (as /HPMOR/ did, for instance), or by pointing out every change they made in the narration through exposition of some sort.
