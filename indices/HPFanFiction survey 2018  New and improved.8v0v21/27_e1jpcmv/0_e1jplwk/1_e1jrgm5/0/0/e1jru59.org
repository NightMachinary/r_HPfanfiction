  For now! Rumour is that WB has made him straight for Fantastic Beasts 2.

Wherefrom? All I've seen is that /FB2/ apparently doesn't /refer/ to his being gay, but, I mean, neither did the original novels. That doesn't "make him straight". Is there anything more definite looming by?

I consider pairings and orientation rather different things. One's sexual orientation is a core element of their character in /general/; who they might fall in love with is a happenstance in their life. The same straight character could imaginably get together with an infinite number of other straight or bi characters of the opposite sex, depending on circumstances; but no amount of circumstances would make that same person, with their original characterization truly intact, get with a person of the same gender as them.
