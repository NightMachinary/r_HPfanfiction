As long as you do realize that that definition goes against what's commonly referred to as slash.

Even a very minor scene where sexuality is addressed for any reason whatsoever in a non romance story can establish that the protagonist is gay, straight, whatever. (For example, say it's a story with Harry as the protagonist, he discovers old letters from Dumbledore and Grindelwald that establish a prior relationship, and he thinks to himself that knowing Dumbledore was gay when Harry was a teenager really would have helped him figure things out sooner.) Main character being gay doesn't automatically make the story slash.
