  As long as you do realize that that definition goes against what's commonly referred to as slash.

In certain circles, perhaps. In any case, I see no merit in debating the "correct definition of slash", of which there are many and no standard of correctness. It's like those "British vs American English" debates.

The precise purpose in stipulating a definition in the survey was to avoid all ambiguity derived from the fact that everyone understands the term differently. That particular definition was chosen because, from past threads on the topic in this sub, it seems that the main objection to slash fics by people who do not read them is that they do not identify with a gay protagonist (rather than not wishing to read a fic in which gay people feature as secondary characters).
