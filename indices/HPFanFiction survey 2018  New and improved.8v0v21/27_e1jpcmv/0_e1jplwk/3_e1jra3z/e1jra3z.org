Gotta agree with Achille-Talon. Just including sexuality of a gay male protagonist does not automatically classify the story as slash. I think that slash has come to mean a particular subset of fics with gay male protagonists where they are, among others, meek, whiny, generally snowflakey, very much a delicate, emotionally unstable wallflower and probably prone to crying too.
