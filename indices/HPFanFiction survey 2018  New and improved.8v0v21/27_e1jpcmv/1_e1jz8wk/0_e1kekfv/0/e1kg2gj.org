Because what's the point of mentioning sexuality without going anywhere with it, especially for characters who are canonically heterosexual?

I find exactly two male characters interesting for who they are (Harry and Ted Tonks) and Gellert Grindelwald for what he represents (at least before Fantastic Beasts). Therefore there are no gay pairings in this fandom which could interest me.
