Can I ask why? If it's not something that affects the story why would it matter?

I mean there are a lot of aspects to a character that could not affect the story but which taints your opinion of the MC and make it difficult to read, like, say, a soldier who is implied to have killed an innocent bystander due to neglect. Sure, it has no impact on the story you're actually reading, but your respect for the character you're trying to relate to diminishes.

I just don't personally see how being gay would get that kind of response, so long as it's not something that occurs in the story. Obviously if you're reading a gay POV and they start going off about how sexy that bear is, well, that'd definitely affect a straight reader in a negative way.
