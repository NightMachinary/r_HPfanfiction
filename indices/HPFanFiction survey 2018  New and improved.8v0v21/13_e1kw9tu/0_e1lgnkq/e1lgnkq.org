A lot of it depends on where you are.

Here, Harry/Draco is fairly niche. But in a wider community of Harry Potter fanfics and fanfic authors, it's far from that. God knows, there's 26k of Harry/Draco on AO3. FF.net is harder to estimate just because the pairing brackets are reasonably recent and there are a myriad of ways people have tagged Harry/Draco so it's hard to get even a rough estimate.
