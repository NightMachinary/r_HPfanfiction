Taking this survey made me realize how niche my own fanfic reading interests are. I've ONLY read Harry/Draco pairings and I've been reading for over TEN YEARS. I've refused to read anything else because other pairings don't interest me in the slightest and I've never read a fanfic that didn't revolve around a relationship. I know there are fabulous fanfics out there, but I wouldn't even know where to begin or if I'm going to stick to my Drarry smut for life. Sigh.
