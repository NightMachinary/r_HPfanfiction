It was a very tough question to answer honestly. you can argue that harry is only alive because of Dumbledore, but we'll also never know if somebody else might have done a better job because Dumbledore hoarded all of the pertinent information. I personally think it's very likely that Harry could have had a far better life and still have survived if it weren't for Dumbledore's decision. On the other hand, Dumbledore essentially hoarding all the relevant information when it came to the second wizarding war did ensure that afterwards the whole ordeal was actually finished and done with, and a new and better future for the wizarding world became possible. At least, that seems to be the case as written in canon.
