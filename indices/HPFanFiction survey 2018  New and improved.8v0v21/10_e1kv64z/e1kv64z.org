  There is no such thing as an inherently bad story idea. It all depends on the execution.

I think this prompt should be rephrased for the next survey. Can you turn it into a less absolute and more "in general"/"most story ideas" type of question? Because I think I'd want to respond positively to the spirit of the question, but I can't, because I can come up with story ideas where I'm pretty confident that even Tolkien would have trouble writing something worthwhile about it.
