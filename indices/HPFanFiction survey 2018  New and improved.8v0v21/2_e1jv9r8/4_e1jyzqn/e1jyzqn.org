There aren't that many contradictions and since I was never a Weasley fan (most are boring, Molly deserves a special place in hell for claiming that she cared about Harry and yet never doing anything about his abusive home life of which she knew by the second book), I didn't mind Hermione getting "their best parts". Hell, I liked Ginny in OOTP before her character took a giant leap backwards in book 6.

My biggest issue with the movies was the age of the Potters and Narcissa Malfoy when they made appearances and that they tried too hard to redeem Malfoy and Snape (although the epilogue did the same shit).
