That's far too deep for me, I get annoyed at the mere mention of a prank because they usually cross the line to assault and not just harmless fun. I mean, I don't mind throwing half of Slytherin into Aragog's nest because they are Death Eaters, but dying their hair pink and vanishing their genitals won't achieve anything (even eunuchs can fight) .
