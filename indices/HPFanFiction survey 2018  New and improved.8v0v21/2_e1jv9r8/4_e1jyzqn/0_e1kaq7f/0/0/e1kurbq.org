They are handled incredibly poorly in fanfic. I've managed to catch a huge allergy against any kind of twin-speak, because it's so annoying and over-done. "Well dear brother of mine..." "... don't you think we should" "... help a son of a Marauder?" "You're absolutely right Forge!" "Wait I'm Forge, you're Gred!" SHUTUPSHUTUPSHUTUP
