All of them are boring, with the exception of OOTP Ginny. Bill is a glorified grave robber, Charlie may as well be "name only", Percy is a boring bureaucrat, the twins are way too overrated in fanfic and I just became tired of them (and also rather irresponsible if you look at their product testing) and I don't give a single fuck about Ron. I find him totally unrelatable (seriously, I can better relate to 11-year-old Hermione and I am a 21-year-old guy) and consider it bad writing that Harry just puts up with his shit past book 3, but I have no particular desire to see him bashed, turned into the villain or similar stupid shit. I just don't care about him or any potential arc of him.

Arthur is the definition of incompetent (or stupid, since he seems to have forgotten about this thing called "books") and Molly's false promises about Harry's home life are simply unforgivable.

At least Ginny had the potential for some interesting development and arcs, at least until Rowling reduced her to mindless love interest without further action and poor build-up.
