The word unilateral is in there because, from the recent thread we had on house-elves, we can see that there is a significant body of people who believe that it is wizards' moral responsibility to free house-elves regardless of what the house-elves think about the issue. It is not morally relevant for these people that the house-elves do not wish to be freed - there is a simple moral rule "slavery must not be tolerated" without any kind of compromise permitted. It is that body of people the question was designed to measure.
