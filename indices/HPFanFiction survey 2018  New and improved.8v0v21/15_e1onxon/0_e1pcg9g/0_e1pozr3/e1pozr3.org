I'd be interested in hearing from people who disagree with the statement. Is their opposition nuanced? Are they concerned about the psychological and social impact that emancipation will have on house-elves (e.g. Winky) or do they just not have a moral problem with sentient beings that are historically (and possibly magically/biologically?) bound to servitude.

But with the question as it stands, using the word "unilaterally" asks us to agree with active resistance and that's why the question is leading (especially after you've already specified "clear and unambiguous"). I actually don't think that you can get the answer you're after with a single question and would be happy to offer other phrasings if you want.
