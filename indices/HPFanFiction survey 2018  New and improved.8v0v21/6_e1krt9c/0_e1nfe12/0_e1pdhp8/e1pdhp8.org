  Partly a result of the numbers mentioned earlier (Male-dominated). Plus, Harry is a rather unique character in fiction in that he is written so generally by Rowling that changing him is not particularly difficult to do. Whereas Hermione has a quite well-established personality and talents. Not to mention this goes to what I said above, people like what is less common too, and Hermione is often depicted as a magical genius of sorts, when compared to Harry.

I think the key is that the question specified "genius" as Dumbledore/Voldemort level.

While it's true that intelligence and study are key to being a powerful wizard within the HP universe, the top tier wizards like Dumbledore all have a "secret ingredient" element which elevates them to that level. It's hard to define but nonetheless I think most readers know it when they see it - a kind of combination of instinct, character, force of will... the ability to turn everything up to 11 when the situation calls for it.

What prevents Harry from being a great wizard is the study/academic elements, but he seems to have that "secret ingredient" which can't be taught. He makes intuitive leaps with regards to fundamental magic (such as wandlore) and has immense force of will.

Hermione, on the other hand, has the study/intelligence side of things, but lacks that element of true "magicalness" about her. It's a similar situation to Percy Weasley: academically high performing, but lacking something vital which means they understand magic in a dry, mechanical manner rather than living and breathing magic.

For me it's easier to imagine Harry being more studious than it is to imagine Hermione as fundamentally more magical in her ways of thinking and viewing the world. The fact that Hermione is logical and thinks objectively is a key part of her character; the fact that Harry doesn't read enthusiastically about magic isn't a core part of his.
