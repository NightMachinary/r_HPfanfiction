Yeah I agree that the prevalence of Genius!Harry over Genius!Hermione is mostly to do with the in-canon characterizations as well as Harry being the de facto main character. It's more fun to write someone as being a genius if they are also the main protagonist in your story. Plus we have famous examples in fiction of snarky young genii that get by more on their somewhat otherworldly competence than any sort of studying and research, such as Sherlock Holmes, Artemis Fowl, Ender Wiggin, Tony Stark, etc. It's also not very interesting to write about someone studying, which is an intrinsic part of Hermione's character.

While I am sure there is some bias due to the gender of the respondents, I think its effect on the data is relatively small in this case compared to the reasons [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] and I stated.
