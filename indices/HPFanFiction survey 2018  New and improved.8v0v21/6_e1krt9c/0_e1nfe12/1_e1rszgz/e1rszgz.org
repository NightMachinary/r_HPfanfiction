  Personally I prefer that over Harry/Daphne (its certainly more believable), but there are far fewer fics with H/L in them (I can name maybe twenty if pressed that are good or better).

So, as I also prefer Harry/Luna over the other pairings, what are those 20 fics? I only recently started reading HP fanfiction, and havenÂ´t found that many yet that i truly enjoyed reading with Harry/Luna. Do you have a link to a post where those are listed? I am only 6 months back in reddit threads.
