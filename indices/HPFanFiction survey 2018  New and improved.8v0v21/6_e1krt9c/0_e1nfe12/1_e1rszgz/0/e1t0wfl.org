Hi there. Okay thats gonna get way broad, so I sill try to give you the best of the best. But do not take my opinions as sacrosanct:

- linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): a short but sweet post-war fic, the backstory is told in snippets about Harry and Luna got together. An epilogue was actually published six months ago. My favorite fic by TheEndless7.
- linkffn(Protection from Nargles; Harry and Luna Against The High Inquisitor): the first is a fic so fluffy and sweet I thought I got cavities just reading it. But its possibly the best one out there, even if its sequel remains incomplete.
- linkao3(Tomorrowland): a post-war fic where Harry and Luna get together.
- linkffn(The Firebirds Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy) is part of the Firebird Trilogy, but Harry doesn't get together with Luna until the second book. Luna is the most important girl for Harry in here.
- linkffn(Unspeakable Beauty): Harry is an auror, Luna is an unspeakable, commence romance (also incomplete)
- linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has Harry (spoiler) end up with Luna, who is a more important character here than in canon (they meet her during 1st year).
- linkffn(Conlaodh's Song) is the sequel to By the Divining Light, and is an AU with a talented Harry.
- linkffn(RuneMaster) is a fic that I will /tentatively/ recommend, mainly because its actually complete H/L fic.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ice Cream Delights) is another tentative recommendation
- linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild) is a decent H/L fic, but its mostly crack too so thats not a focus.

I hope that will help you for now. I recommend Protection from Nargles and The Quidditch World Cup first, since they are generally speaking better than most fics out there (romance wise at least).
