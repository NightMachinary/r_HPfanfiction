Thank you for that write up! Protection from Nargles and The Quidditch World Cup are already open in in my browser, they are just waiting for me to read them. I have tried reading the Firebird Trilogy, but something with those fics doesnÂ´t sit well with me. But the other ones are new to me, so thanks for the recommendations!

Cheers!
