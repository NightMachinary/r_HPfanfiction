  60% male, far higher than the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotter][/r/HarryPotter]]
#+end_quote

Not that surprising, since reddit is normally male dominated on average. Pottermore doesn't have a direct forum, so a lot of people go there or tumblr.

#+begin_quote
  14.3% want Harry/Daphne, higher than Harry/Luna
#+end_quote

I am actually a bit shocked that Harry/Luna even cracked 10%. Personally I prefer that over Harry/Daphne (its certainly more believable), but there are far fewer fics with H/L in them (I can name maybe twenty if pressed that are good or better). I suppose its not that hard to understand though: Luna is a pretty well established character in canon (personality, appearance, speech style, etc.) while Daphne/Tracey/Lisa/Su are open for the authors to portray them however they need/want for their storyline.

Reminds me of that Napolean quote actually: 'Quantity has a quality all on its own.'

#+begin_quote
  40.6% consider Pottermore as canon, only 30.6% consider Movies canon
#+end_quote

One comes more or less from Rowling, the other was given far more liberty to write how they want. Personally, I would have less of a problem with the movies if it weren't for all the wand-locking tug-of-war BS in the last couple movies (but thats just me).

#+begin_quote
  More like politically powerful nobility, but more dislike Harry inheriting political power
#+end_quote

I suspect this is a reaction. Many stories create magical nobility with the specific purpose of making Harry a part of it. Goes along with Rich!Harry too; its a wish-fulfillment thing as far as I can tell. But a lot of people like Harry as the underdog/orphan (hence why all the super abusive Dursleys), and making him suddenly part of the elite cheapens this.

To speculate though, I think the opinions to many of the tropes are also /responses/ to their prevalence among fanfics (look no further than the soul-bond trope numbers for this). As a general rule, people tend to like newer ideas, even if they are not always or necessarily better.

#+begin_quote
  55% like magic-genius Harry, and only 29.2% like magic-genius Hermione
#+end_quote

Partly a result of the numbers mentioned earlier (Male-dominated). Plus, Harry is a rather unique character in fiction in that he is written so generally by Rowling that changing him is not particularly difficult to do. Whereas Hermione has a quite well-established personality and talents. Not to mention this goes to what I said above, people like what is less common too, and Hermione is often depicted as a magical genius of sorts, when compared to Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Almost 50% like dark Harry, but 53.6% dislike evil Harry. I find this very interesting!
#+end_quote

People don't like feeling like they're wish-fulfillment character is evil. Really, this is an important factor.

A LOT of people like stories where Harry sticks it to the bad guys or flirts with the taboo (see also Slytherin!Harry, Harry/Daphne, and Voldemort-mentored Harry), but don't want to see that maybe those kinds of actions are in fact the exact sort would lead to someone becoming what most would consider "evil."

Honestly thought, where is the line between crazy and evil though? In most fics they are pretty synonymous, but that is not really how real life is.

  52.3% hate and 20.8% dislike Hermione bashing, vs 3.4% love and 5.5% like.
#+end_quote

This sub has a general dislike of bashing, so thats not terribly shocking. Personally, I hate bashing in general because it feels more like 1) lazy writing to give some sort of emotional catharsis and 2) is often preferred/written by people with some sort of axe to grind (whether with HP or not).
