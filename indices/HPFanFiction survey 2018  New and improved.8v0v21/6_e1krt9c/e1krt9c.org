- 88% want or don't mind pairings
- 14.3% want Harry/Daphne, higher than Harry/Luna
- 40.6% consider Pottermore as canon, only 30.6% consider Movies canon
- More like politically powerful nobility, but more dislike Harry inheriting political power
- 55% like magic-genius Harry, and only 29.2% like magic-genius Hermione
- Almost 50% like dark Harry, but 53.6% dislike evil Harry. I find this very interesting!
