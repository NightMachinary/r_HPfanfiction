I don't think it's so b&w. I imagine the question is kind of about your hierarchy of canon sources.

For me, obviously the OG books are the highest canon. Then side books and FB movies (because the movies are stories written by Rowling as the chronicle of the Grindelwald era--instead of books, not as adaptations). CC I take as canonical in the general story points. Albus had a difficult relationship with dad, went time-travelling, stuff happened. Not in the specific details, like Head Auror HP being worse at dueling than as a teenager or being scared of pigeons.
