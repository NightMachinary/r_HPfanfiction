  as i never saw this as an issue in the original books as gender roles appeared balance in the books and i haven't seen much fanfiction that suggests otherwise

A huge amount of fanfiction depicts a highly patriarchal wizard society, with many of them featuring a feudal style society in which women are essentially bought and sold in arranged marriages by their fathers. Literally tens of thousands of fics - not sure how you've managed to miss them!
