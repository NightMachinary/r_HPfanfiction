Very nice survey!

The only things that are missing I believe are:

-Was Grindelwald right?

-Was Voldemort right?

-Do you like it when a fic expand the worldbuilding, even at the expense of canon?

-Would you read a slash fic with HP in the slash pairing?

-Would you read a fem!slash fic with fem!Harry in the fem!slash pairing?

-Do you prefer HP as Het, Bi, Gay or Ace?

-A question on romantic orientation (similar to the sexual orientation one).

.

But I am nitpicking, and despite appearances, I quite like this survey, especially the tropes section, thank you for making it!
