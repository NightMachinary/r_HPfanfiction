So I'm not completely sure from your summary if what you're saying is that Ginny dies in the Chamber with Tom Riddle, but either way, it sounds like you should at least be aware of linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow), as it seems to start from a similar decision point.

Also this sounds like it could be a great read, so I'd love it if you'd PM me when you publish the first chapter.
