One thing many overlook is that canon Hermione is the driven one of the trio. She is proactive, not reactive. She wants to do stuff, wants to help people, wants to change the world for the better. Be it solving a mystery or trying to save a hippogryff, abolish slavery or found an underground study club, it's usually Hermione pushing for it - and others into it. Harry and Ron tend to be far more reactive until they have no choice but to go and kick ass. Hermione also has never seen a rule that she wouldn't break the moment it gets in her way. Of the trio, she's the one with the strongest "the ends justify the means" leanings. Strength-wise, she's the brains.
