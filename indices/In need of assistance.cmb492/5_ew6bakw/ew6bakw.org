About the Legilimens!Ron, while it is an interesting concept, it's rather unlike that Ron would be good at Legilimency. Like [[/u/ForwardDiscussion][u/ForwardDiscussion]] said, Ron is good at physical side of things. (Also he is good at tactics- chess) Legilimency requires subtlety and control of mind. Ron is the least subtle person out of the trio- and the trio isn't subtle at all..
