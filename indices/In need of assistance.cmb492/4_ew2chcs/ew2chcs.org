I agree with [[https://www.reddit.com/user/FitzDizzyspells/][FitzDizzyspells]] . The best way to nail the characterization right is to reread the original books. I would add to actually make a list of sentences they each say to have their real speech. They each have certain manners or level of language and nailing it is quite difficult and not often seen in fanfiction.

Being able to get right the "voice" of the characters as in the original books would be a great way toward perfect characterization, I think.
