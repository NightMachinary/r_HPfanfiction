I highly recommend unlike a sister by mad harmony

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister]]

Warning its unfinished, but by far the best harmony romance fic out there. Well worth the read.

Post war, with a beileveable relationship,

dont worry about being picky, even though I primarily read exclusively harmony, I drop a lot of fics because most harmony fics are just really bad wish fulfillment fics.
