  when voldemort is paired with harry or hermione... well yeah you have a point in this one actually, usually hary or hermione becomes evil in these ones instead of voldemort becoming good.

Ehhh I wouldn't say that. I've read a significant portion of the fics tagged with Voldemort on Ao3 and FFN, and in my experience it's more of an even split between the three major tropes: the love interest turning evil, Voldemort being 'redeemed' by the love interest, or an AU where Voldemort turns out to have been a 'good' person all along.
