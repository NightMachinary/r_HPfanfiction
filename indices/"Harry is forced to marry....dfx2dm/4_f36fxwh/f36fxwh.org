the biggest problem with posts like this is how the op sounds like they never read any of the types of stories they are trying to criticize.

when draco is paired with harry or hermione, he has a redemption arc or he was never bigoted to begin with and was forced into the death eater stuff by his father.

when snape is paired with harry or hermione, he magically stops being a schoolyard bully and starts acting his age.

when voldemort is paired with harry or hermione... well yeah you have a point in this one actually, *usually* hary or hermione becomes evil in these ones instead of voldemort becoming good.
