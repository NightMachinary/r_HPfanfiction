This. I dislike forced marriage trope greatly, but it's obvious the OP never reads fics with it or fics with these pairings in general and just uses it as an excuse to bash the ships they dislike.

Moral outrage and pearl-clutching about ships is silly, and doubly so when the person has no idea what they are talking about.
