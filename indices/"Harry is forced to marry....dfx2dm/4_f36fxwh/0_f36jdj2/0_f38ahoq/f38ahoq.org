I've read 2 SSHP fics, plus one by accident (it was subtle enough that I only realized it in the last chapter). The former 2 genderbended Harry, all 3 fics involved time travel (2 to Marauder-era, one to First War). None of the fics have Harry go dark.

(The accidental one had me assume a platonic relationship until a sudden non-platonic kiss in the last chapter that threw me off completely, leading me to try to figure out if it was hinted anywhere before then, and only finding one reference to it that was easy to miss).
