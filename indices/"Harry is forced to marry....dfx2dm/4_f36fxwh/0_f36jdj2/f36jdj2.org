Eh, Harry goes dark in a lot of Harry x Draco/Snape as well. There's rarely a true redemption arc for either and more often than not the good guys are bashed with a dash of justification for mudblood/blood traitor.

Simply put, Draco and Snape don't really get better everyone else is just written a lot worse.
