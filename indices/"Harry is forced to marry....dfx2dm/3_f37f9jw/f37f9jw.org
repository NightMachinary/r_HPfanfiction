I remember a very interesting one. It was by lightofdaye, yeah the smut writer, about Harry having to marry Tonks after OotP, in order for Sirius' inheritance to go to him, the main issue was Kreacher and Grimmauld Place. It was quite funny, as you can imagine. Not in tone, no. But 20+ woman marrying a 15-year old has its own set of humour, like that Harry felt he was terrible at sex, Tonks doing it just as a request from Dumbledore, both of them living at No. 4 Privet Drive etc. etc.

Shame he deleted it and never finished the fic. But it was something different. There was no love at first sight, no marital bliss (on the contrary), and the whole mess was treated with the disdain and revulsion it deserved.
