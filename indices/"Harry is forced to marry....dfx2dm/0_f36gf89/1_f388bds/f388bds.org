There is an old SSHG community called WIKTT (When I KIssed The Teacher). I don't know where it is (Tumblr? Somewhere else?) but either way, they came up with the MLC, or Marriage Law Challenge. A Marriage Law is instituted and muggleborns have to marry purebloods (this was before HBP and Snape's status as a halfblood was established). Lucius, in typical Ministry bribery fashion, "bids" on Hermione and Snape has to be the one saving her from Lucius. Eventually, fics started relaxing the rules of the challenge into Lucius not needing to be involved, to HG marrying anyone "improper", to anyone marrying anyone. And now we have the Marriage Law trope.
