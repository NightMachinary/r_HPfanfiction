There was this one story I can't remember the name of that took the soul bond trope and turned it into a horrible curse by letting it be more realistic. Like how horrible it is for teenagers to know someone else hears your embarrassing thought all the time or that your friend of the opposite gender knows what your body feels like/looks like even tho you are not even remotely interested in that person. Quite interesting horror scenario yet sadly unfinished if I remember correct.
