  Forced marriages are a really weird trope I really only see in HP fanfics
#+end_quote

In other fandoms, they don't use marriage contracts as the plot device to hook characters by taking away their agency, but that doesn't mean that forced relationships don't exist. The most common plot devices are alien sex pollen, a/b/o mating, or soul bonding.

Same old story, same minimal-effort premise, just a different surface aesthetic.
