Yeah, right?! If they get together "naturally" because Harry/Hermione learns about Voldemort's true objectives/Dumbledore's deception/how Draco is abused by his parents/forced to be a Death Eater/didn't know better or because the "bigoted character" changed after the war/because tragedy struck/..., so basically if the author puts any effort into making it at least somewhat relatable, then, well, cats like mice, I don't. But the marriage law/soul bond/veela tropes /tend/ to be just a low effort tool to make them a couple. Not always, but often.
