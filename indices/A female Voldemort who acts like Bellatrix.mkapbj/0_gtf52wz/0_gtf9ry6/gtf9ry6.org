Well, I was going to put it in the description but my phone battery ended, what I wanted to say is a female voldemort who is cruel, insane and violent, who tortures and kills and smiles and laughs while doing this.

My problem with female Voldemort fanfics is that they took away all the `` voldemort '' part of her, usually to pair her with Harry. So I think it would be better if I wrote `` Female voldemort but she is actually a real villain ´´.
