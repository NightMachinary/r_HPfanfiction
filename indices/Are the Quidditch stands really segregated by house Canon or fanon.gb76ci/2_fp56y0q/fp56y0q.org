From Prisoner of Azkaban:

  Three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like "GO GRYFFINDOR!" and "LIONS FOR THE CUP' Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green;

So students do seem to congregate together in the crowd.

Incidentally this quote is also the one time in the books that we're given an actual figure for the number of students at Hogwarts (800, assuming that the houses are of equal size). How to reconcile that number with the apparent number of teachers is tricky, however.

Coincidentally, if you assume that almost all British wizards attend Hogwarts, that gives you a birth rate of around 115/year. And if you then assume an average wizarding life expectancy of 150 years, that would give you a British wizarding population of 17,250, which does feel about right for the character of the community.

In Victoria Potter I reduce the size of Hogwarts to around 500 students, but also say that approximately half of all invitees reject the invitation to attend, which gives you an annual birth rate of around 140. That produces a wizarding population of 21,000. On top of that you have the other beings within Ministry jurisdiction Ministry such as goblins, centaurs, ghosts, trolls, merpeople, vampires, hags, etc. which gives you a ballpark figure of, say, 30,000 beings within wizarding Britain.
