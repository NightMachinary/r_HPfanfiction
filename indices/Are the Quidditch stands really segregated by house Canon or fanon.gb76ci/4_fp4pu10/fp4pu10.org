My hypothesis is that different sections of the stadium are merely decorated in different House colors/motifs. Students might tend to gravitate towards their own House colors, but if that part of the stadium is full, you might end up sitting in the Ravenclaw section instead of the Gryffindor section. No one is going to ask you to move because you're in the wrong section, and it's not assigned seating.
