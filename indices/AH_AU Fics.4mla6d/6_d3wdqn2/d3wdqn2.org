One I enjoyed but can't locate was a streets/elite dancing school mix. It was odd and there were stuff that I would have tweaked but it had moments where it really worked. Basic premise was that Harry kind of lived with Vernon but also roamed the streets with a bit of a gang with his friends. He applies and gets accepted into this elite dancing school. I think it was leaning towards a Harry/Draco thing, but there was some mobster Tom Riddle stuff going on too.
