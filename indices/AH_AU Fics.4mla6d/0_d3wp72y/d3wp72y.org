[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822][Check "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]. No Magic, but James Bond technology. Hogwarts is a school for spies and commandos. It's very good, and it portrays the growing crush and love Hermione has on and for Ron nicely from early on. It also avoids a number of plotholes, and doesn't strictly follow the stations of canon.
