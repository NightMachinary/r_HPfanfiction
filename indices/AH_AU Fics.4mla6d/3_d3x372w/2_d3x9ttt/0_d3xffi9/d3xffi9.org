Ahh I'm so glad you like it! Once I started I seriously could not stop until they met. There were so many times I was just grinning like a crazy person while reading this. I will definitely be doing a re-read at some point! If you like Remus/Sirius I've read a few good ones and I have them rec'd on my Ao3 bookmarks with my comments. I just finished casting moonshadows and loved it but there are seriously so many good ones. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks]]
