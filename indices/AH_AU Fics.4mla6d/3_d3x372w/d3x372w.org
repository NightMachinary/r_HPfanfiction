If you're cool with slash and like YA fiction, Text Talk by MerlyWhirls is great.

This is a GREAT non-magic modern MWPP AU where Remus isn't at hogwarts. He is homeschooled and has a chronic illness (it starts a little "a fault in our stars" like). Sirius and Remus text back and forth and slowly start a friendship and then a relationship.

I LOVED this fic. It gave me butterflies about 1000 times and I was just rooting for Sirius and Remus so much I couldn't put this down.

Also, this is unrated by the author, but it's firmly T. Linkao3(1651109)
