I'm going to have to disagree there; magic is a pillar, if not the one and only pillar, holding up the HPverse. Without magic, we lose all context of the conflict that occurs in the series, and how it affects the major players in the series.

Without magic, they're still human, yes, but unexceptional, mundane humans with nothing to separate themselves from others. And of course they'll still interact, but, again, context is lost: Draco can't insult Hermione for being a muggleborn if everyone is a muggle. And they'll still probably have prejudices, like a Malfoy's typical classist sneering at Ron, but the major reason for why a pureblood discriminates--magical inclination and heredity, or not--is lost because there is /no such thing/ as magic in this world. In fact, I'd argue it's much more important than the characters simply not carrying a wand. Without magic, all of the villains in the series have no platform to stand on: Tom Riddle is now a mortal man who hasn't the means to outrun death in any way, and has to accept he'll die because he can't make a horcrux; The Malfoys are now just poncey effete arseholes, rather than fanatics of a madman; Bellatrix no longer has rhyme or reason as to why she kills... et cetera.

These villains lose all sense and purpose without magic; you'd have to completely reinvent their motivations and prejudices for their actions to make any sense. I think this is why these fics are terrible, because writers are quick to nix magic, without really understanding the narrative ramifications of removing it from the series.
