Well, I guess you haven't read *[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]* yet. This fic has done a great job transplanting HP characters to a non-magical setting.

For example, Riddle's ideology changed from blood purity to aristocratic elitism and totalitarianism. Malfoys were rich and bigoted aristocrats who looked down on anyone sympathetic to commoners.

Riddle's horcruxes became memory capsules, which were produced by even more horrific procedures than in canon (each memory capsule required killing dozen of victims and extracting their brain parts and spinal cord fluids). Riddle also manufactured many clones, hidden in his underground bases.

So, it always comes down to writer's ability. Yes, it's very very difficult to write a good HP fic with no magic, but it can be done.
