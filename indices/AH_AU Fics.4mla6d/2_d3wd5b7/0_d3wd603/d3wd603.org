  When Crown Prince James Potter goes in disguise amongst his people to uncover why his flourishing kingdom is under economic crisis, he doesn't know what he'll discover. He certainly doesn't expect corruption amongst the Lords, nor an underground Revolution. He definitely doesn't expect to be bested, and fall for the clever blind bandit, Regulus Black.

Flailing, he's certain it's all going to come crashing down until he realises his co-workers are more than just co-workers. They're family. But how will they react when they learn the truth?

  In order to keep his job, James Potter must produce the final episode of Ghost Hunters without error. The only problem, their assignment is Grimmauld Place, and it's absolutely not haunted. But James is determined to do a good job, and he and Remus enjoy the bonus-- the ridiculously good looking Black Brothers.
