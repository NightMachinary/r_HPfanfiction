AH/AU is not something I've come across within the HP fandom - in fact its usually the reverse with characters being reinvented as Vampires, Werewolves, Fae . etc.

Just the other day in [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] someone posted a fascinating breakdown of how FSOG developed from the AH/AU community within the Twilight fandom (and why it made people so angry) but also gave a fascinating commentary on how the AH/AU trope developed there. I'm sorry I don't remember what thread it was in.
