  For almost a decade in fact, evar since we started seeing forum posts about how awful Ginny is after the release of HBP and now, in a time where we have tons upon tons of fanfiction profiles dedicated to people desperately trying to justify their ship with every possible small line blown into supposed evidence.

You forgot about how emotionally abusive Ron is. Reading Harmonian's opinions of him one would think that his only purpose in life was to make Hermione as miserable as possible. Of course, in the typical Harmony fanfic he becomes physically abusive in addition to emotionally abusive, and he suddenly becomes as intelligent as a brain dead chimpanzee.

The less said about Love Potions and how Molly Weasley tried to set up Harry's life right from the train platform the better.

Harmonians spend more time trying to discredit canon ships in their fics than trying to build up Harry and Hermione's relationship. I find it quite ironic that for a relationship that they claim should have been canon, they are constitutionally incapable of writing a story where the characterizations of the Weasley family are not butchered to some extent or the other.

I will also put in that only those who wanted H/Hr to be canon saw 'evidence' of it in the books. Any unbiased observer could have seen that the series was going to be R/Hr as early as book 4, and the whole Yule Ball chapter had those 'anvil-sized hints' that Harmonians in general are blind to.

Fact is, Robst and that Driftwood guy (the guy who wrote 'MAJOR Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore bashing', with soul bonds and the blatant author-insert Goddess of love to boot) are by far the most popular Harmony authors on fanfiction.net. That should tell you everything you need to know about the mindset of the Harmonian community at large.
