Is it that weird to think that magic can give someone a full sex change that allows for procreation? I wouldn't be surprised if medicine could do it in a few decades, so why not with magic?

Or are you saying the pregnant character remains male? That seems more problematic. The only story I"ve read that was labeled with mpreg had Harry turned into a woman for a few years though. I can believe magic doing that.
