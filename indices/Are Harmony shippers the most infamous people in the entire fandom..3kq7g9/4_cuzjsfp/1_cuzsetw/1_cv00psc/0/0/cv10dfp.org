  The doctors involved in the first of those trials have explicitly said the technique should work with trans women too

No they didn't. Because it won't. There's nowhere for the uterus to go. You can't just jam something like that in. Then there's no blood supply, but that's actually fairly easy to get around. You're fucked when it comes to the nervous system. The connections don't exist and we can't recreate them. Not to mention that no mental relay system exists and the uterus wouldn't be able to communicate with the rest of the body.

  Karyotype matters very little for sex past the initial hormone surge based on it.

So unbelievably false. Our DNA codes for every facet of our being. Including the hormones needed to regulate menstration and every aspect of pregnancy.
