There have been succesful pregnancies for women with a transplanted uterus and women without ovaries (with hormone therapy). The doctors involved in the first of those trials have explicitly said the technique should work with trans women too (which I doubted before that statement because of questions of blood supply).

And then there are experiments that make sex cells from stem cells, and others that make stem cells from skin cells. All this combined with the experiments in organ growing from stem cells make it very likely to be possible in the near future. Whether it will be allowed by (often conservative) doctors anytime soon is a bigger question.

Karyotype matters very little for sex past the initial hormone surge based on it. That the DNA doesn't code for it is nonsense, [[http://skepchick.org/2011/12/bilaterally-gynandromorphic-chickens-and-why-im-not-scientifically-male/][we are not chickens]] where DNA translates 1:1 to physical sex. Our sexual differentiation is determined by hormones. This is why Hormone Replacement Therapy has such a big effect for transsexuals.
