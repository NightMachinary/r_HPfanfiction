I think the problem with the whole futanari thing is people use it exclusively as an excuse for kinky sex, and not bother to explore the issues involved emotionally, physically, and logistically. I'd totally read something that treated the possible emotional and physical distance required by something like that seriously.

And yes, yes I can fault the MPreg Draco/Harry fans for their poor understanding of biology. Just like I fault other fics for the same thing. Like any female character who comes back from summer break with breasts that have grown three cup sizes, or Harry who picks up a foot or so of height and doesn't clumsily run into things and trip all the time while he adjusts to longer legs and arms. (not to mention growing pains would be debilitating, but /magic!/)

I suppose really my problem is using /'Magic!'/ as a handwave to pass off not giving a shit about how things interact with other things or how the physical world works.
