  pstibbons comes to mind as a particularly egregious example

You know, I thought /How much of a moron could this guy possibly be?/, googled the name and found his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/919491/pstibbons][fanfiction.net page]].

I genuinely have no words for this.

  *While (JKR) claimed to have left anvil-sized hints of RHr, they pale in comparison to the warehouse-sized HHr hints - like Hermione's P(atronus being an )OTTER*.

He has converted me with his irrefutable evidence! I am now a Harmony shipper for life!

Other than that, he seems the steroetypical Harmony shipper -- Ron shows "prejudice, lack of loyalty, and general insensitivity", Dumbledore is evil, Molly is overbearing, Love Potions, /blah, blah, blah/.

He also hates Harry, curiously enough. He seems to have changed from a H/Hr extremist to a Granger-verse Nazi over time, which probably had something to do with his ban from Portkey:

  Harry is a confused, uncurious, and emotionally crippled child with fast reflexes and a lot of luck. He thinks the world revolves around him. He has been carefully groomed by Dumbledore to believe that the rules don't apply to him. He shows few signs of Slytherin cunning or ambition. He is reckless and needs a lot more life lessons to realize the need for planning. He is held back by his friendship with MoRon. He is very much Dumbledore's man - in the sense of being an obedient and well moulded chess piece.

It is too bad he no longer posts fics, I could have entertained myself trolling him.
