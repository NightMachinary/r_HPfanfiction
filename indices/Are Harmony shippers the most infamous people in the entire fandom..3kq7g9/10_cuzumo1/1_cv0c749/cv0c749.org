First of all, that's not what JKR said. She said that she could have written a story where Harry and Hermione made sense, but she chose not to. She could have written Hermione to be more in tune with Harry emotionally, she could have written Harry to be less annoyed by Hermione's nagging. But she chose not to do so. She chose to write the characters in a way that made Hermione and Harry a bad match.

If you build a green house, you can look at it and say "You know, I could have built a blue house." But that doesn't make the house blue.

And the harmony sentiment has been a thing in the fandom for a very long time.

The bottom line is that Hermione deserves better than Harry. Hermione deserves to be with someone who sees her tendency for nagging to be an expression of love rather than seeing it as annoyance. Hermione deserves someone who won't ignore or lie to her to avoid talking about his feelings. Hermione deserves someone who will argue back. Hermione deserves someone who will tell her when she's crossed a line instead of bottling it up and then exploding at her. Hermione deserves someone that's going to worry about her almost as much as she worries about them.

Hermione deserves someone that loves her /because/ she's an argumentative know-it-all who nags too much and wears her heart on her sleeve, not someone who loves her /in spite of/ those things.
