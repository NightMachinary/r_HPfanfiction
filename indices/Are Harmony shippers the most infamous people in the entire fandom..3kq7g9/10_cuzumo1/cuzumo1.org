Infamous? H/Hr is rather a common pairing for the fandom. Some weird people have a hate campaign going, as if their lives depended on making sure that particular pairing is never written.

Pathetic, really. And ironic when they blame H/Hr shippers for the same fanatism they display in their hatred.

So, infamous? Only among a few vocal posters who seem to think they determine what can and should be written.

And of course, the hatred got really going after JKR mentioned that Harry and Hermione might have worked out better than Ron and Hermione. That little tidbit usually never gets mentioned, of course, when canon is brought up as an argument against the ship.
