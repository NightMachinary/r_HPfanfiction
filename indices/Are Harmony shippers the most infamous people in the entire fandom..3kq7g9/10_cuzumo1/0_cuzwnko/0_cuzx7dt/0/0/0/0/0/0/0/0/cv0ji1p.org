Really? You think not liking something is the same as posting how much something sucks, and everyone who likes it sucks as well?

I dislike a number of fanfiction couples and plots, but I am not about to claim that makes the stories using those bad, or the people who like it stupid or infamous.

I am fine with people not liking H/Hr. I am fed up with people shitposting about it.
