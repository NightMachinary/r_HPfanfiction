If you think that's an intense reaction, then you've not seen much yet.

I am just rather sick of the immature hatred for stories that do not conform to some people's taste. It's as if some people really cannot stomach the thought that somewhere else, someone is reading or writing a Harmony or Snarry or Drarry or Dramione story. It reminds me so much of people who have issues with what consenting adults do in the privacy of their bedrooms - bigotry, plain and simple.
