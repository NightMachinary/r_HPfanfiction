But the Harmonians ARE infamous, and have been for a very long time, and for very good reason.

If they didn't bash on characters so much, and be so delusional as to thinking it should have happened (I bet there is a higher proportion of shippers thinking that then in other ships), and be so militant about it, then maybe the fandom would be more tolerant of H/Hr shipping.

Alas, Harmonians will never change, by the looks of it.
