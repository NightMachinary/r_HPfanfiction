To answer this post, why would you go into the Harry Potter books with the typical Hollywood mindset that the lead male character and the lead female character should get together? Or that the love interest should one of the central characters in the series?

  I just never thought she was developed away from her fan girl phase. Rather than seeing her change, we are told that she changed.

And this is the typical anti-Ginny argument vocal non-canon shippers typically employ. If you had been unbiased when you read the books, you would have noticed that the 'fan-girl' phase had been actively downplayed since book 2. In book 4, there are infact two scenes involving Ginny where she isn't completely over her crush, but she does talk to Harry the way you expect a friend to. One was about naming Pigwidgeon right after Harry arrived at the Burrow and another was before the Yule Ball where she was comforting Ron over Fleur's rejection.

Also, there is a clear build-up to Harry/Ginny relationship from the start, and Ginny's character arc is based on it. It does not, in fact, come out of nowhere. Let's see:

Ginny starts off someone who is in awe of the Boy Who Lived, having heard stories about him right from birth. Her crush is shown to be shallow, and as such Harry could never like her. He is, infact, distinctly uncomfortable with the singing Valentine she sends him in her first year.

In GoF And OOTP (mostly the latter) she becomes Harry's friend. Now that she's dating other people and come out of her shell (there are a couple of scenes in GoF that show her getting over her crush, as outlined above), Harry finds her fun to be around. She is given a couple of important moments in the book -- one was breaking Harry out of his depression after he thought he was possessed, and the other was helping him talk to Sirius after he saw Snape's memory -- the scene in the library involving Chocolate. Later she fights in the DoM, proving to be a strong person in her own right. Meanwhile, Harry dates and breaks up with Cho, who is pretty, plays Quidditch and cries all the time, and that's all Harry knows about her.

In HBP, Harry spends a lot of time with her in the Burrow and comes to really like her. Unfortunately, she's unavailable at the moment. Stuff happens, Ginny wins at Quidditch and Harry gleefully breaks up her relationship with Dean with a little help from Felix felicis, and they get together in the end.

I fail to see how anyone can say there was /no/ buildup, because that statement is blatantly false. True, it was hardly at the centre of the story, but then romance was never the point of the Harry Potter series, and as such would always have been a side-story. Harry Potter was a trio-centric story right from the start, and Ginny had no place as a major character on their level, so she appears a lot less. And I will also point out that while the relationship had quite a bit of depth, the build-up to it in HBP was still the way a teenage romance should have been built up. Both Harry and Ginny act like teenagers, there are no sappy declarations of love, or status as soul-mates or whatever.

Ultimately, Harry/Ginny wasn't jarring to you because there was no build-up to it in canon. It was jarring to you because you /refused/ to see and chose to ignore any build-up to it. You were probably hoping for H/Hr and trying to scrawl though the books trying to find 'evidence' of it and ignoring any indications to the contrary.

I have said my piece. Agree or disagree as you wish, but do so logically.
