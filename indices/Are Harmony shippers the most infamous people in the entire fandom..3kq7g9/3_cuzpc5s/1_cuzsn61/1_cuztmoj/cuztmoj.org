You're really reaching, and expecting everyone to do it with you. This involves quite a bit of pretty deep reading of just a few scraps of lines/paragraphs in a seven book series, and you're implying everyone should be able to see it. Maybe it's clear build up to a person who is really invested in the books and their interpretation of canon, but the build-up is sparse, at best, and Harry's attraction to Ginny does genuinely seem to crop up out of nowhere to most casual readers.
