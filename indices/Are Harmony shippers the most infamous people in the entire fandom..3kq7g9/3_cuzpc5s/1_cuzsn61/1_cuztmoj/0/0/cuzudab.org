Hang on a minute, I didn't say the build up wasn't there /at all/. I said it was /sparse/. Which it is. Sure, the St. Mungo's scene was important, but it was just one, relatively small part of a large book in a larger series. JKR may be right about 'anvil-sized hints' when talking about Ron/Hermione; you'd have to be a moron to not see that coming, but Harry/Ginny is much more subtle, more like a mosquito's bite than a falling anvil.

Plus, it should be noted that I'm not arguing for H/Hr. I don't think Harry and Hermione would make a good couple based on canon. They could work when they're older and have changed priorities, but definitely not during their teenage years.
