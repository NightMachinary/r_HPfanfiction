One, attraction does come out of nowhere. Especially in teenage years. I'm not sure there are many other ways it does, really. Even so, Harry's attraction to Ginny was mild at the beginning of HBP and was gradually brought up more till the kiss scene with Dean. A multi-book build up of it would also have been unfeasible given the timeline of the series.

Second, are you really saying that some of those moments, especially the St Mungo's possession scare and the one where Harry was utterly miserable because he had seen his father being a bully and Ginny helped him, /weren't/ important scenes? Really?

Also, if you didn't see it the first time, shouldn't you have gone back and checked before making the statement like "Harry's attraction to Ginny does really seem to crop up out of nowhere" and claiming that Ginny had no development as a character? Given that there aren't many Ginny scenes in the earlier books, it shouldn't have been hard at all to look it up, really. It is especially weird when so many people go over the books trying to find the minutest detail that seems to say that Hermione is attracted to Harry when there are so many interactions between them, yet ignore the very few Ginny scenes because it doesn't support their ship, despite it being relatively blatant in Ginny's case.

Also, I doubt many people here are casual readers. For my part, I'm very familiar with canon. May be I just expect everyone else to be as well when it isn't the case?

And to confirm this, people not seeing something because they don't want to see something is really a thing. It is the same reason why Dumbledore is perceived to be evil and why Ron is perceived to be a fair weather friend. People genuinely believe all that, some good writers in the past have believed that, pretty much the same way people believe that Ginny was a non-presence before HBP, which I consider absurd because Ginny was given at least two important moments in OoTP, and I maintain OoTP more important to Ginny's character development than HBP.
