I wanna be honest, you came across as really confrontational and abrasive to someone who was expressing his opinion. You may not like his opinion, but he didn't come after you, you should do him the courtesy of not trying to antagonize him.

But no, seriously, more screen-time (page-time?) would have been great for Ginny's character. It's not so much that she suddenly became a different person, it's that she grew up emotionally and mentally almost totally outside of our awareness, but not Harry's, then we're expected to step into his head and see what he sees when he looks at her, and it's a jarring step.
