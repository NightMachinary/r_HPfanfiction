In defense of a Harmony shipper, I have never said Ginny was awful. I just was disappointed at how little her character was fleshed out. She is non existent in books 1, 3, and 4 and is involved in 5 about as much as Luna (so again, not really enough development for me) then BAM 6 happened. It is just strange to go from her being such a minor character to suddenly Harry has a beast in his chest? Come on. I just never thought she was developed away from her fan girl phase. Rather than seeing her change, we are told that she changed. There are some truly fantastic Fanfics with Ginny in them but they take the time to flesh out Ginny much more than JKR ever did. It is due to this lack of character depth that made book 6 so jarring to me.
