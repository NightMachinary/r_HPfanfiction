I think Harry/Hermione shippers can be a little bit more vehement than other ships, and more likely to try to evangelize. I think it's because they see themselves as competing with canon ships, whereas other non-canon ships like Harry/Draco see themselves as part of a fandom niche.

In my experience, Harry/Draco shippers are a bit more relaxed because most of them sort of realize that their ship didn't sail and was never going to sail. They're just shipping it because they enjoy it. Obviously you can go down the rabbit hole and convince yourself that Harry and Draco are meant to be, but at the end of the day I think most Harry/Draco shippers sort of stay in their lane.

There are plenty of Harmony shippers who were pretty much convinced that the entire book series was will they-won't they, or complain about the "sudden" Ron/Hermione in HBP.

I also think Harry/Draco shippers are a lot less likely to invoke bashing to get their OTP together, because they don't necessarily need to demonize Ginny. Ginny can be the nicest coolest person in the world, but as long as Harry's gay, she's not a threat to the OTP in any way.

If you ship Harry/Luna, maybe there's some Ginny bashing but Hermione/Ron can continue to exist in peace and Ginny can find some nice minor character. If you ship Hermione/Draco, maybe there's some Ron bashing but Ginny/Harry can exist in peace and Ron can find some nice minor character. With Harry/Hermione, both Ginny and Ron are still threats to Harry/Hermione.

And bashing them doesn't make Harmony shippers popular, because they're interfering with two of the biggest relationships in canon and warping Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Ginny as characters.
