There's also the fact that non canon shippers don't INSIST that their ship could have been canon. Harry/Hermione was never going to happen in canon. Insisting that it was the only possible outcome got a lot of people offside. Then the explosion in fury after HBP and the slut shaming of Ginny was insane.

I read Harry/Hermione. Enjoy it. But they're not canon. Were never going to be canon. It's the inability to accept that the pairing is AU that put a lot of people off.
