Eh... I am not sure how much of the reputation is earned.

I think part of it is that other major non-canon 'ships (e.g., Hermione/(Draco, Snape, and/or another Slytherin in Leather Pants)) have their own subfandoms that don't really communicate with the rest of the fandom. This creates a selection bias of sorts: you don't get to see the inanity from Dramione and such because you don't stumble on their pages unless you are actively looking for them, and if you are, you are probably sympathetic to what they have to say. (This subreddit is probably one of the few places where subfandoms intersect and interact.)

The other part is that Harmony is viewed as something that /could've been/ and is therefore viewed by its proponents as something worth advocating. Proponents of the canon pairings have canon on their side, so they do not need to be as proactive, and Dramionists and recognize that their 'ship was never in the running int he first place, so you don't see as much advocacy there either. (Fun fact: an FF.net search for Draco/Hermione fics yields about twice as many as Harry/Hermione fics; the ratio holds whether or not the search is for general characters or for the more-recently implemented "pairings".)

Which leads me to my second point: this question presupposes that there is an "entire fandom" for which it is meaningful to speak of a group being "infamous". There isn't. What's infamous among the Harmonians is famous among the Dramionists and vice versa; and that's without getting into slash.
