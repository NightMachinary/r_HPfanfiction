I /am/ one, so who am I to talk, but I think the reason this is the case is that they're in closer contact with the rest of the fanbase than the other candidates for infamy. Like, if you're a canon-ships person it's not like you have to spend a lot of time tip-toeing around the Snarry people, etc.---they do a pretty good job of self-segregating, just because it's easy to tell that they're into something different. But H/Hr people are always lurking just off to the side, writing stuff that sounds like something you /might/ like, if they weren't staring daggers at Ginny. (/Outside/ the fandom I'd say they're [we're] well behind the slash, otherwise unusual [mpreg, harems, incest, etc], and even Slytherin/hero pairings in terms of infamy.)

There's no doubt that the H/Hr fandom produces some terrible stuff, of course---I've never successfully gotten through something by, say, chemprof or Bobmin, let alone robst, and I don't think I ever will. But there are fewer people writing H/Hr, so you have fewer options. (Most of the long fics I've really enjoyed from the pairing come from before HBP came out.)

Dark horse candidate for fandom-wide infamy: The first "Indy!Harry" and "Manipulative Dumbledore" boom, with the 100,000 word training sequences, endlessly expandable trunks, power levels, Noble House of Potter-Black-Gaunt-Malfoy, etc.
