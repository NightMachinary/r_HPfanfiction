I guess it's a matter of personal experience. But my point is that if you want to write a Harry/Hermione fic, you have to bash two main characters (Ginny and Ron) and warp the characterization of two other main characters (Hermione and Harry). Whereas pairing one of the "core four" with an outsider allows half of the core four to continue existing.

I'm not saying that Drarry fics don't bash characters other than Ginny (like Ron), but if they do, then it's something they've added to create drama rather than something that's essentially required because of the nature of the pairing. Drarry /can/ destroy the trio friendship dynamic, but it doesn't actually need to.

[Hermione] + [Harry] = [bashed Ginny] + [bashed Ron] + [OOC Hermione] + [OOC Harry]

but

[Harry] + [Draco] = [bashed Ginny] + [canon paired/IC Ron] + [canon paired/IC Hermione] + [OOC Harry]

[Hermione] + [Snape] = [bashed Ron] + [canon paired/IC Ginny] + [canon paired/IC Harry] + [OOC Hermione]
