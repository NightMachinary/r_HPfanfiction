The Dangerverse (very AU, lots of OCs): Harry is rescued from the Dursleys at age 2ish by Remus and his OC partner. They rescue Sirius from Azkaban and form a "pack." I think it goes all the way to the end of 7th year and the end of Voldy.

Saving Harry: Harry is rescued from the Dursleys at age 8 by Sirius and Remus. Eventual SB/RL
