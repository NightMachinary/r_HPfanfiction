I can't decide if it's really good or really bad. As a novel (or the majority of a novel) it's pretty terrible. As fanfic, it seemed pretty good (to me, which doesn't really mean anything).

Concept that I like: take 11-year-old Harry Potter, about to enter Hogwarts. Make him an incredibly astute and science-minded young boy, and then see just how he'd react to all of the situations that J. K. Rowling threw him into. Written with a unique sense of humor. That right there is pretty good all around, and that's what the first few chapters are. I recommend them to anyone that is familiar with the Harry Potter universe.

Concept that I hate: author proceeds to drag it out over 80 chapters, getting more and more serious. Turn Harry Potter into some weird Machiavellian scheming adolescent. Combine that with poor writing that tells rather than shows, and the signs saying: WARNING - AUTHOR IS MAKING UP PLOT AS THEY GO ALONG and next thing you know it's all fallen apart.

Just my two cents, but again, what does that matter.
