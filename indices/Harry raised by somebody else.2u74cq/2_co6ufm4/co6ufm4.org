Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them - Harry runs from Dursleys, lives in the forest and convinces himself that he's an elf. A bit odd but interesting premise and good character study of Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them]]

Innocent - Harry raised by Sirius. I really like the new universe constructed by the author and the good take on a variety of characters. It's more focused on character building than super plot drama, but I quite like it. Two sequels, the second of which is currently updating. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]
