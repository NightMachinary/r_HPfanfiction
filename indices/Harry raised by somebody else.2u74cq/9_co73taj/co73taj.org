  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

This has always been one of my favorites. I have always like the stories that involve the Goblins and this one does it very well. Anything by Robst has been very good he writes some very good stories.
