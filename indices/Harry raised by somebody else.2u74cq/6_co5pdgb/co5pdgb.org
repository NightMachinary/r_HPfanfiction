I have not yet read it so I can't offer a personal recommendation, but a lot of people around here recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]], in which Professor McGonagall takes baby Harry from the Dursley's doorstep and gives him to a more deserving family to raise.
