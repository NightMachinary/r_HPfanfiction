#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy never asked for a second chance, nor did he particularly want one. But he found himself in his old body at eleven, and after a year at Hogwarts, he has a plan for the year before him: keep to himself, find Dobby, improve relations with fellow Slytherins to cordial but distant, get over this stupid obsession with Harry Potter, and no more jokes about controlling a Malfoy mountain troll. No one else thinks they're funny. And no more cursing people- well, only as many people as necessary...Draco Malfoy has never been very good at following plans.
