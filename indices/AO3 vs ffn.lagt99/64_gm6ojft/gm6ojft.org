AO3 all the way

Both as writer and reader I prefer AO3 is just better, most of the complains I read about ao3 are about the tagging system and diverse content (too much kink) but both are problems you can be addressed by getting use to the tag system which is actually pretty awesome.

Also the quality of the average work is higher on AO3.

I only use ffn because the HP fandom is huge there and it has some great fics but I have yet to find good writing in any of the other fandoms that I follow.
