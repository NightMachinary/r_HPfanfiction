AO3 all the way. The fact that people use the tags is what makes it work compared to Wattpad, and FF.net doesn't even try. I feel like most fics that I've read on ff have been from recs, while I actually fine good things on my own on ao3. Even though both sites have some bad books, ff seems to have more basic spelling errors and the like, while ao3 seems to lean towards bad plot and a lot of smut (tbh, that is occasionally what you want to read though...)
