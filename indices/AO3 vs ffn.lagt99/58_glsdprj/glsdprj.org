I prefer Ao3 but still like and use ffn, if less frequently.\\
I like ao3's layout and tag system more, and I prefer the 'entire work' option. Ffn is still good, with the app layout better than the website itself. In the app you can download your favourite works and use Folders. Ao3 has collections and bookmarks to Categorize your favorites better in my opinion.
