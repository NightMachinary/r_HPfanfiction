*FFN Yes! :*

- There is everything there.
- It's big!
- It's simple!
- You can recognize a low-effort spam right from summary!

*FFN No! :*

- The Great Purge (works deleted for wonky reasons, happens regularly)
- plagiarism-friendly, don't expect help this year
- non-responsive, non-adaptive
- don't expect much good stuff from NC-17

*AO3 Yes! :*

- Detailed search engine
- People are generally nicer *
- Some fandoms and preferences are very distinctly represented - if that's your thing, go there
- Chapter summaries are a godsend

*AO3 No! :*

- The tags are an unholy mess. This decreases the effectiveness of search engine.
- People are less specifically nice (on FFN you're more likely to get flamed on 'hello', but on AO3 you have to watch what you say because people hold grudges - and that's not even personal experience! I just browse a lot)
- Slash is king. Nothing against it, exactly, but I've read too many AO3 stories that got ruined by forced pairings, excessive agenda pushing and venomous comment replies. It's also worth noting that most stories there contain romance subplot, usually M/M, so it's hard to find a goodly-sized gen fic for the evening.
