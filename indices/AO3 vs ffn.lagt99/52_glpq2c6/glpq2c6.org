Generally, FFN has a lot more fics, but on the other hand in my experience AO3 has more fics for slash, fem slash, and rair pairs. It's also much easier to find fics that have a specific concept on AO3 due to the tags and filtering system. I perfer AO3 but I end up using FFN quite freqently due to how many fics exist there.
