  I've seen plenty of fics whose main ship would be very illegal IRL for very good reason.

It was in a different fandom than HP, but I remember finding a fic that was pure pedophilia (and damn the summary was not really clear on the point). It's one thing to be open minded, but I'm pretty sure it's illegal to write (or at least share) this kind of story.

Also, the fact that the story had absolutely NOTHING to do with the fandom outside of the characters name made me wonder why the hell would someone write it as a fanfic.
