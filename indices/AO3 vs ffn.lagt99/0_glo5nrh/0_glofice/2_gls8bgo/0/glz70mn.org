I can't speak to everywhere, but there are some places where written content doesn't fall foul of those kinds of laws, specifically because the definitions of 'child pornography' in their legal codes don't include written material, just visuals. The protection of children act in the UK only really makes reference to 'images' in that regard, for example.

I can't find the comment I made the last time someone brought this up to get the name of the specific legislation, but there's even one piece of legal work that actually uses the word 'photo' in its definitions. Law is weird.
