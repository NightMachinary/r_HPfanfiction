Exactly this.

Some of my favorite fanfic authors are only on ffn, but the people running it lack responsiveness, transparency, and consistency. Random unexplained site outages, removal of some fics without warning or explanation, inconsistent application of site rules, all of these are problems. It also has barely anything in terms of search functionality and no way to filter a Favorites list you're looking at, which makes finding new fics to read a PITA. The reader community can also get pretty toxic, especially anonymous troll reviewers.

AO3 solves a lot of the above problems, but has a few of its own. Overtagging and inconsistent tagging are probably two of the biggest issues, as others have pointed out. I also agree that at times the community swings the pendulum too far in the direction of permissiveness, leaving a not-insubstantial chunk of the site's content as niche fetish-bait - not trying to kink-shame, but I've seen plenty of fics whose main ship would be very illegal IRL for very good reason. Even the stuff that's not hideously unethical can drown out more "mainstream" content to the point where I sometimes wish the fetish-pandering would be spun off into a separate site.
