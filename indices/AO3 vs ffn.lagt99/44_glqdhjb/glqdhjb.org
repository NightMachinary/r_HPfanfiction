I used to read loads of FF about a decade+ ago, and I only ever used ffn, and I really liked it. I used to read it on my PSP browser (lol) before I went to bed.

Recently, I've started reading some fics again, mainly on my phone, and I like AO3 better for how it looks on the screen. Plus, there are no ads in the middle of works.

So, now I go AO3 and have not read fics because they were only on ffn.
