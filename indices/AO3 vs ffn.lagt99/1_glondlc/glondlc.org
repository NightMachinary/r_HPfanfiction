A /very/ important part of this conversation is the ownership of these two sites and their philosophies and mission.

FFN is a profit-driven company. That's why they have ads and strict content policies. They are beholden to their advertisers, and they need to prioritize their bottom line as a business. I remember the First Great Purge of 2003, and how SO MANY fics were lost due to the new content policies. When FFN receives a cease and desist or a DMCA takedown request, they comply, because they are more liable for damages from copyright infringement due to making money off the ads.

AO3 is run by a non-profit whose mission is to support "transformative" works. Everything from the extensible software system to the content archived is approached in the "free as in freedom" spirit of openness. Just about the only things you cannot do on AO3 are straight-up plagiarism and profit-seeking. When they receive a DMCA takedown request, their team of lawyers makes sure it's legit, and they also have political lobbyists to protect creators of transformative works.

Due to this philosophy and mission, I publish exclusively at AO3, and when someone rec's a fic at FFN, I check to see if I can read it at AO3 instead.
