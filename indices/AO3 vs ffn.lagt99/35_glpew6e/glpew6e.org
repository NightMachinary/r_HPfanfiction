When it comes to reading practicality I prefer FFN. Ao3 doesn't allow unofficial apps to run on IOS and doesn't seem like they are making one themselves. I hate reading AO3 through a browser.

When it comes to filter options, of course it's Ao3. They offer much more comprehensible filter searches than FFN.

When it comes to amount of content, it has to be FFN. FFN absolutely dwarfs Ao3 is the amount of stories on their site.

When it comes to censorship issues, then it's Ao3 again. FFN's nsfw purges are the most annoying thing when it comes to fics. I don't necessarily read for NSFW content but a lot of stories that are amazing has that content and when FFN comes around for another purge that story is lost forever unless the author backs it up or changes things.

All in all it's really a tossup. I mostly read FFN because Ao3 doesn't have an app that fits their stories on my phone screen nice and easy. If Ao3 offered one up on IOS then i'd likely be using it more than FFN.
