AO3 (preferred)

Clearer layout, more consistent use of tags (though some like to write paragraphs in them), better search functionality, and isn't purged every two seconds because of pressure (though that does have the downside of "Original Works" section being basically little but paedophilic content).

FFN

Larger archive of works going back longer but is very basic in terms of what it can and can't do, with working out pairings being a real nightmare via search.
