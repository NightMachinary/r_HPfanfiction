AO3 is so much easier to find things on with the tagging system, even if some fics are over tagged. I'm somewhat convinced that ffn actually has more decent fics that aren't just slash/smut/both, but the best way I can think of to find them is to just sort by favourites and hope the descriptions are actually descriptive, which is a pain.
