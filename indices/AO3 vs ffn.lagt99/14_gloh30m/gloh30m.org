AO3 no doubt at all. Way better sorting system, although can get really messy when the writer spams every tag known to man, and wish it had some other features like sort by main characters/pairings, it still absolutely destroys the very limited ffn tags. It's also way easier for users to upload their stuff, seriously ffn uploading system is totally outdated and unnecessary. And while I have a hard time choosing which site's layout I prefer, that just comes down to personal preference. If AO3 has one bad thing going against its the annoying verification process, but I understand why its there and once you have the account its obviously not a problem anymore.
