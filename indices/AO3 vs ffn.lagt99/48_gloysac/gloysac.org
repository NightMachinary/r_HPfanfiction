Ao3's tagging system is a absolute mess; that makes it nearly impossible to find anything your looking for; or manages to exclude exactly what your looking for.

ffn is the opposite, missing obvious tagging functions, to the point where authors have been shoving tags into the description of all things.

In terms of story quality both sites are pretty trash; with over 99% of stories being essentially unreadable. Overall both sites need some ways for readers to filter story by quality; that isnt favorites(Since most of the community has no taste, nor standards when it comes to literature).
