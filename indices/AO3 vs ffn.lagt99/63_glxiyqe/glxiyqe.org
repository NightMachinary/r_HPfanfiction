As a writer, Ao3 hands down, though I use both. It's so much easier to publish stories, add/edit chapters and sometimes I'll catch a typo when giving it a casual read-through after posting and cringe cause editing on ff is a pain, whereas I could change it in a second on Ao3.

I also find people comment more on Ao3 than ff.net, and that the comments are more in depth? Sometimes? While on ff.net more people tend to favourite and follow stories instead of commenting (though I can't say if that's something that happens across the board with everyone).
