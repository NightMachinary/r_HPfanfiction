If you asked a couple days ago I would have said FFN because they have an app and Ao3 doesn't. But when I got a new iPad and downloaded the app again it was completely different from how it used to be and I lost every story that I didn't favorite. (I had a bunch of stories on my reading list, but that is completely gone). So, I'm pretty salty about it and may just switch to Ao3 for some of the reasons other people listed.
