I prefer FFN. I do a search for stories greater than 10,000 words, with Harry as a character and tell it no romance. If I tried the same on AO3, I would then have to spend 30 minutes telling AO3 to ignore specific pairings to get any semblance of romance stories out of my list. I could just use the General tag in AO3, but even that is not perfect.
