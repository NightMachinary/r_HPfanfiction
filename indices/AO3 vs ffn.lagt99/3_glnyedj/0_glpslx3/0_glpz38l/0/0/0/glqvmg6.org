If you go back and read my comment again, you can see that I did not say to remove the current tag system. Simply to have a prioritized system that would go on top of it to let there be a distinction between major tags and minor ones.

I've used AO3 and FF both, and AO3's tag system varies from good to poor depending on the author in my experience. It makes searches in AO3 often fruitless, because it gives the same tag priority to something where it's the focus of the story and where it's tagged but only mentioned offhand in one chapter.

As it stands, I just use the two platforms for reading fics that I find recommended elsewhere, because the search features in both are quite meh.

Edit - this is also in response to someone who /liked/ Ao3's tag system and was unhappy about the tagging system with background relationships... so it's not just people who don't use Ao3
