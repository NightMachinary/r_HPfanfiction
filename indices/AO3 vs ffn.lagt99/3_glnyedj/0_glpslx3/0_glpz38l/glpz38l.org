This is the thing. And I think the amount of tags, especially pairing tags can put people off a story as much as draw them in?

Like, I have no interest reading a Dramione focussed story. But I'll read a story that just so happens to have Dramione in the background?

Whereas I know some people might see Dramione tagged and run for the hills without even giving the story a go you know?

It's hard to know if it's a good thing or a bad thing having so many tags..
