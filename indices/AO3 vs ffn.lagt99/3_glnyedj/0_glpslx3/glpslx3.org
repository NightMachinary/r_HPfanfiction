Rare pairings are a lot harder to find on Ao3 since overtagging is an issue. If a pairing is tagged on FFN, you know it will be central. If its tagged on Archive, it might be central, a throwaway background mention or a 200 word chapter in a drabble collection.

That being said, excluding tags, especially content tags, will help you to keep the worst out of your search results.
