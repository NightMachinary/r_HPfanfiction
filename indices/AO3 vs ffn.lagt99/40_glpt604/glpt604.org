I prefer ao3 for the netiquette and the tags, and the fact that it is crowd sourced in stead of surviving on banners and commercials that are taking up my entire phone screen.

So I find myself most often on ao3, while missing ffn's dark/light button.

That said, what bugs the hell out of me is a 3500 word story on ao3 with 2/35 chapters, which is tagged for all 35 chapters, and has tags for characters that aren't even in the story yet. Then I miss ffn's sparse character & genre options in combination with the search function which still works.

I wouldn't mind a upper limit on ao3 for X tags on X posted words. Or tags per individual chapter.

Edit: downside of ao3: The 0-word fics that aren't written stories but comics, or entire WhatsApp conversations between characters or the podfics. They really ought to have their own search engine.
