Neither of them. I use [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]] (either as a stand-alone command-line application or the Calibre plugin), so I download all stories first and then read them as EPub, so it really doesn't matter where I get the file from (or it could be HPFanFic.org etc.).

For publishing, I use AO3, because it allows much better conversation.
