I prefer AO3. It's easier to upload and edit fics. It's easier to find fics I want by searching through tags. I can exclude things based on pairing or warning. I prefer the commenting system and being able to block anonymous reviews. Commenters are generally nicer to me on AO3 than they are on ffn. The support teams is very responsive - when someone copied and pasted entire sections from my fic, I reported them and the fic was taken down within days. On ffn it takes months to get a response from the staff, if you get one at all.
