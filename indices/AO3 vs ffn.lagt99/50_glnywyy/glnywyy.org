DAVIES I have BOTH! :) :) I upload first to AO3 and then copy paste into Fanfics doc manager because Ao3 is so much easier to use! :) Saving drafts and clicking through the menu is so much better than doing the stupid side bar stuff in FFN.net! Ao3 is super more streamlined and easier to use. :) :)
