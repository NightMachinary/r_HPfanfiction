As a writer, I prefer FFN, because although it is clunky and the ads are annoying, I get a lot more reader engagement.

I post the same content on FFN and AO3, and the comment rate on FFN is substantially higher. Haven't had an issue with trolls yet since I started writing again this year. FFN seems to have put more thought into their writer community: you can PM people and use forums, there's a better stat breakdown.

Genfic (aka all my multi-chapter stuff, I only really do ship-based oneshots) tends to sink on AO3. Doubly so if your characters are unpopular or you're writing an OC in the main cast.

Even so, on FFN, there's no way 300 people would read a one shot and not leave a single review. In fact, on FFN it has 200 views and 5 reviews. Reader engagement is really important to writers, and the way AO3 is set up promotes a kind of consumer culture where readers scroll, hit the kudos button maybe, and move on.

I also have found more fics that I like reading from FFN, possibly because I'm not too picky, so I just search a character I want to read about or by update date. Yeah, there's brilliant stuff on AO3, too, but a lot of it is cross-posted anyway.

But I can see how most readers would like AO3. But as a writer, I feel very lonely on there.
