I honestly don't see much of a difference when it comes down to it. Archive has more tagging options, but that's as much a blessing as it is a curse due to overtagging and how the search works. Excluding Hermione/Draco and Hermione/Snape does not exclude Hermione/Malfoy/Snape for example.

FFN is a bit annoying to upload to, but I never got the hate for that. Copy-paste from GDrive works fine, so really it's just an unnecessary intermediate step. Having to confirm their guidelines every week is more annoying. And getting the right tag order on Archive isn't any easier.
