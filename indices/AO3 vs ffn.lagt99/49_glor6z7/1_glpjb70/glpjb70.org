A couple things to note.

Ao3 does actually send u emails for any fics you are subscribed to when they update. Idk where you got the idea they dont but okay.

Also ao3 does have dark modes. I say modes because there are a lot of different colour schemes you can change the site to if you have an account. I dont remember exactly how but iirc it was rlly rlly easy.

Also your main complaint seems to be that you dont want to see any slash fics. And yeah if u exclude harry/draco it wont exclude other pairings that have the both of them... because that's a different pairing. The ability to exclude things is literally so simple to use I dont rlly understand most of the complaints about that.

Like I have legit never had a problem with the search function for ao3 so I guess I just dont understand where you are coming from. And while tags are sometimes abused it's not rlly overcomplicated at all. You see a tag u like you can click on it for other fics with that tag or you can exclude that tag so u dont get those fics.

Also u only ever need to keep 1 tab open for ao3 if u want to cuz u can add fics to a mark for later list u can go through whenever.

Literally all of your complaints are just you not understanding how to use the site. If it's so confusing just Google your question because likely someone has had the same problem and it's easily solved.
