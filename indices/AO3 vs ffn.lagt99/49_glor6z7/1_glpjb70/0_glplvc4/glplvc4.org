See thats the issue, its not easy, i shouldnt have to google how to use it because its so counterintuitive.

And ffn search function takes max 30 seconds. On ao3 you need to spend 10 minutes just to set up exceptions to what you dont want. Its so stupid! I rarely use emails, so bookmarking and then checking my email constantly to see if a fic has updated, when i can use ffn app where i just get a notification when something has updated?

There just isnt any way i would use something as clunky and complicated as ao3 when ffn makes it so easy and fast to use.
