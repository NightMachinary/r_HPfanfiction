A couple things to note. Ao3 is rlly rlly easy to use.

Subscription to a fic or author literally just sends u an email. If u want a notification set up your email to notify your phone or something that's also fairly easy.

Idk what type of fics u are looking for that need to take 10 minutes to go through tags to find tbh. It's literally so simple like there are already categories for which characters are most common among a tag or relationships. U can either select these only or exclude them. If u dont see a tag u want to find or exclude theres a handy search function to find the tag to exclude or include. Then u can modify search to complete or not, crossovers or not, exact word parameters, exact date parameters plus theres a couple different ways to sort the search.

Literally I have never found ao3 hard to use at all. Also if u want an example of how easy it is to change to a dark mode u legit just go to ao3 then your account then to your preferences and just pick literally any skin at all that's there. That took me literally 20 seconds to find only because my internet wasnt super fast.

And a major problem with ffn is that there are basically no tags at all. U can essentially only look for specific relationships whereas on ao3 u can look for anything from like severitus to obscurial harry there is so much variety. Ffn may not be in your own words as clunky as ao3 but that's mostly because of how much it just doesnt have at all.
