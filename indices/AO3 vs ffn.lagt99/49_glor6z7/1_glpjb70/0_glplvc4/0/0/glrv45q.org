Sorry but the Ao3 tagging system is a royal PITA. If I don't like Harry/Voldemort fics, I specifically exclude that type of fic from the available tags, then I have to tell it to exclude the Harry/Voldemort/Lucius that all of a sudden was available, then I have to tell it to exclude Harry/Voldemort/Wormtail that just showed up. If I don't want Harry/Voldemort, I shouldn't have to spend 10 minutes excluding every permutation of that pairing that keeps showing up.
