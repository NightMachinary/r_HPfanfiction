I prefer ffn, first the app is vastly superior. No adds, ficd auto update so i dont need to keep track of anything, and the search function is easy and simple to use.

Ao3 forces me to keep tabs open in a browser or use bookmarks and manually check for updates. Their search engine is shit and you need to spend 5 times as ling just filtering OUT any of the stuff you dont need. Exclude m/m ? How avout this harry/draco fic? Exclude harry/draco as well? How about harry/draco/snape?

Fuck ao3 and the horse it wanked to death. Its 90% slash, tagging system is overcomplicated, and then it doesnt even have darkmode.

I know ffn sucks for writers, which is horrible for readers because the writers now travel to the site thats shit for readers.

So. Ffn for readers, ao3 for writers.

Damn this turned into a rant..
