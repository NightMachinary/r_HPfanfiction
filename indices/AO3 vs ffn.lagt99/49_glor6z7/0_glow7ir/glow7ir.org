I think these are all valid criticisms and the excluding bit can get tiring. I will say that AO3 does send email notifications for new chapters, but definitely not the most user friendly for new updates. (I have an email folder that I can check for new updates for both FFN and AO3, but I wish I could get normal notifications.) Still, I've found I prefer the readability and search function on AO3, but I also didn't know FFN had an app.
