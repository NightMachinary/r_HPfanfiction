Pedophilia is a tag that is needed. Tags are there as a warning to the readers. If a fic ISN'T tagged when it has pedophilia in it, it is possible for a reader who might be triggered to read it without prior knowledge. You can't complain about such tags. The same is possible for the tags "murder, torture, rape". While all the tags can be used as a searching tool, which is completely up to the reader to decide which tag to search and therefore not the responsibility of the site, their main purpose is to tell people what they're getting into.
