Sure is. Because it could be tagged for a character who is a pedophile victim in their past, for a villain who is also a pedophile, or, for what you're concerned about, text sexualizing prepubescent kids. Ao3 has a zero censorship policy. Period. And they adhere to the laws of the state of New York, which is where they're based out of. It's text in NY, so it is not a crime so they will not censor. It exists. So do horror movies sensationalizing and glorifying horrible harm done to people. Censorship of literature has never lead to anything good. Don't like; don't read. I don't and will never understand this attitude of holding /fanfiction/ to some illusory higher standard than mainstream media, including published works that don't give us the courtesy of tags. It's fiction, it is not hurting real people, but this attitude does when people are targeted over their content---especially since the term has been expanded to include “any underage activity I object to.”
