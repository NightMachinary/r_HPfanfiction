Actually, Ao3 is the substantially more trafficked site these days, and is especially where you will find newer fandoms (case in point with My Hero Academia having 150k+ fics on ao3 and some 20k on FFN. You see a massive disparity with the MCU too).

FFN still has some of the older fandoms, and is still where genfic and het and canon ships are more likely to do better, but ao3 is the more overall active site.
