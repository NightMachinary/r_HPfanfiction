I am a reader only and prefer ao3. The ao3 mobile and desktop website are way better than ffn. I shifted over i wanna say over 5 yesrs ago. The tagging system and author notes in ao3 makes it a better experience to look at.

But i am reading on the comments that there is a ffn app? Is it any good? When did it come out?
