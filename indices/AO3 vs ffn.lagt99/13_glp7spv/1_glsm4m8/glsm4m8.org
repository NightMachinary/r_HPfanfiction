There is an ffn app but when you use the search function it doesn't always come up with all the stories with that name which can be frustrating if you're looking for a fic with a popular name eg Love Conquers All or stuff like that.

It is easier to read chapter by chapter though as you can swipe right for the next chapter or left for the previous one. I do like the app.
