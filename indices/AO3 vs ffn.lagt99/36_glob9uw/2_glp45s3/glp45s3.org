I'm surprised I had to scroll this far to find someone who agrees! I've been reading fic for over a decade now and honestly I only read based on recommendations now, so the search functions don't bother me- I'm always following a link. Plus, the FFN app has built in talk-to-text so I can listen to fic while driving or working.

Ao3 does offer the option to download a fic and o can upload that to a third party reader, but I prefer the simplicity of the app
