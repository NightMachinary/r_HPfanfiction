You can bookmark individual chapters in any fic on the ffn app. That's how I've been able to keep track of all the fics I've read 60-70% of.

Just hold down on a word on a chapter and the second option will have a red bookmark added. When you check the list of chapters, all your bookmarks for that fic are shown.
