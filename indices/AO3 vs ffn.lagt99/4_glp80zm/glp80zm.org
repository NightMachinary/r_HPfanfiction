I use both but prefer FF.net mainly because of the app but also because A03's tagging system, while great, is one of the most abused tagging systems i've ever seen. People either mislabel or refuse to tag stories properly.

I will remove Draco as a character, along with any tag that mentions draco being with any main character or side character, and he still shows up in the fic wanting to fuck Harry's ass.
