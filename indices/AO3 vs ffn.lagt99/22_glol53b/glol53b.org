Im a reader only. I usually prefer AO3 because its easier to find what I want. The tagging and search features are great, but it does make it hard to find less popular fics as they dominate the search results.

FFN is so hard to find things on. I rely on collections and favorites to follow to good reads which is frustrating because i'm sure there are great works that im missing because I cant search. I do like that they have text options tho, dark background large text is nice.
