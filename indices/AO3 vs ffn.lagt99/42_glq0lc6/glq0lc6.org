Honestly, I currently use primarily FFN for 2 reasons. Quantity of stories due to being the older platform And convenience of use because it has a relatively well designed app.

If AO3 could match that it would be my preferred choice. Currently is it just my preferred option for explicit fics only because ffn are fucking prudes
