Has anyone else noticed the different writing styles on them? In a bad way?

Game of Thrones/ASOIAF is what got me started on fanfic. I noticed some of the fics on FFN were super stilted, but I just assumed it was that fandom because ✨neckbeards ✨. But when I started reading HP fanfic, I found that the writing styles were similar. Like too formal to be read smoothly. Jilted, maybe. Like they're trying to sound like published authors, but end up sounding like wannabe Jane Austens.

That being said, I've found that Ao3 fics have young writers, but they are soooo much easier to exclude with the right tags.
