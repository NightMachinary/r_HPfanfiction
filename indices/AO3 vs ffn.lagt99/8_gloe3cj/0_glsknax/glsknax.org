I find a lot of fics on AO3 have this weird poetic writing style where way more text is dedicated to what the characters are feeling than what is happening. Not a huge fan of this style, as it's kind of hard to actually follow what's happening in the story. I don't find it as often on FFN, but FFN has more fics with garbage grammar and spelling.
