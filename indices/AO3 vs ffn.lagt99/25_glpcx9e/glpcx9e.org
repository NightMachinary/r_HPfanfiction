Depends...

FFN has much more in the outsiders fandom which I read in for years. Ao3 outsiders content is fairly minimal.

In HP, ffn has a lot more fics (tho ao3 has plenty) and it's easier to search rare pairs and easier to search if you just want a fic centered on a certain character (esp if it's a smaller character). But you can only search genre and can't search specific tropes.

Ao3 allows you to search very specific tags which I love when I'm looking for something very specific “Voldemort wins AU” or “Fred weasley lives” I think reading on ao3 on a phone is bit nicer for the dark mode. And I really like being able to see lots of tags upfront because it gives me better scope of story before I start like on FFN I hate a vague summary. And you can exclude certain tags!

But ao3 is awful for searching minor characters like I want so badly to read stories where Parvati or Blaise are major characters but unless I search them in a ship it's impossible and even then it's hard.

I think tags are great but they should limit how many characters/pairings can be tagged. Or have a way to structure...the story is about Harry/draco and Ron/Pansy...but in this world it's Sirius/Remus and Tonks/Charlie in the background ya know?
