I prefer AO3, with some very big caveats regarding tags and a little bit regarding that I've found less people bookmarking than favouriting/following on FFN. Favourites and follows are my quick way to find fics, and even with tags I find that's it's still often more reliable to see what people who have similar tastes like rather than spend an hour trying to find a fic.
