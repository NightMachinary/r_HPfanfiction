Ao3. It's easy to upload and edit your texts from author side. You can download pdf to read on multiple devices over a long period of time from a readers side. Plus I like more explicit stories, which are a no-no for ffn.

There are some amazing stories on ffn (marriage stone anyone??) But I tend to look around and ask if anyone has it on pdf or such rather than deal with them and their cramped ass texts
