James and Lily suddenly turn into psychopathic child abusers and either abandon Harry at the Dursely's, or completely ignore him in favour of the WBWL (usually named John for some reason).

Both James and Lily suddenly care immensely what the public thinks of them and spend an inordinate amount of time attending parties and similar events, taking the WBWL with them but leaving Harry at home.

Usually either Sirius or Remus is the only one who even notices Harry, everyone else is fine with completely ignoring him.

Dumbledore seems to spend more time visiting the Potters than a man with three important jobs should.

James has a completely unhinged view of Slytherins and will want to disown Harry when he is sorted into Slytherin, but either Lily or Dumbledore stop him.

Despite receiving extensive tutoring from the best scholars and instructors money can buy, or even better, taught by Dumbleore himself the WBWL is still a worst wizard than Harry, usually laziness is the excuse.

The Weasely's are always close friends with the Potters, with Ron and Ginny acting like creepy stalkers towards the WBWL and ignore Harry. Only Fred and George seem to give Harry any attention at all.

I might come back and add more if I can think of anything, been a while since I've read any WBWL stories.
