Also, a short script I had posted on the topic a while ago, which contains some suggestions:

/[In the Great Hall, some time after */Harry*/'s name comes out of the Goblet of Fire...]/

*Harry:* /[standing on a table]/ Listen up, everybody! /I SWEAR ON MY ---/

*Dumbledore:* No, Harry, don't! If you prove your innocence that easily now, you will ruin all my well-constructed plans to sacrifice you to the Greater Good after stealing all your money and giving your precious bodily fluids to the Weasleys! I just said all that out loud, didn't I...

*Grindelwald:* /[from Numengard]/ What the hell, man?! First, you're all "Yes, Gellert, let's take over the world for the Greater Good." Then, you leave and come back to hex the crap out of me because you don't like Greater Good any more, and stick me in this here cell. And now, you're all for it again. Make up your mind, man!

*Dumbledore:* Shut up! /SILENCIO!/

*Grindelwald:* Also, even ordinary skilled adult wizards, but particularly mighty ones like ourselves, don't need to enunciate simple spells like --- /[is silenced]/

*Hermione:* Wow, Dumbledore is so great and honest and powerful! I totally believe everything he says, because I am totally incapable of disobeying or disbelieving any Authority Figures or Books or Books of Authority Figures. Harry, you shouldn't make a Wizard Oath, even if it will solve all your problems, because Dumbledore says you shouldn't!

*Harry:* No! You were always holding me back with your helpfulness and studiousness. Without you, I would have learned All the Magic myself, becoming worthy of my heritage as Lord Potter/Black/Gryffidnor/Slytherin/etc. ---

*Sirius:* Hey, I'm not dead yet! /[is ignored]/

*Harry:* --- but I am through being led around and manipulated by manipulative manipulators (who manipulate)! /I SWEAR ON MY MOTES/ that I didn't put my name into the Goblet! /SO MOTE IT MOTE! [waves his wand, producing */Motes*/]/

*Random Spectator #1:* Wow, those are really big motes! I don't know what to think now!

*Random Spectator #2:* Harry must be a Very Powerful Wizard to produce such ginormous motes!

*Luna:* I think this mote is trying to build a nest in my hair. I am surprisingly OK with that.

*Dumbledore:* Noooo! Harry has gone Independent! I am foiled!

*Harry:* Well, looks like I don't have to do the Triwizard anymore. What should I do now? I know, I'll start a harem!

*Hermione:* /[to */herself*]* Wow, I want Harry to be my Authority Figure now! /[to */Harry*]* Can I join?

*Harry:* Sure.

*Hermione:* I am ever so glad that I don't have to think or do anything for the rest of this fic!

*Random female student #1 (or Tonks):* Can I?

*Harry:* Sure.

*Random female student #2 (or Tonks):* Can I?

*Harry:* Sure.

*Ginny:* Can I?

*Harry:* No! The Weasleys betrayed me!

*Ron:* Only a little.

*Harry:* Except for the Twins. The Twins are still cool. But not Ginny.

*Ginny:* Nooooo! /[runs off crying, brews Amortentia, accidentally feeds some to */Ron*/, and the rest is NSFSanity]/

/[Meanwhile, elsewhere...]â€‹/

*Draco:* Professor Snape, where are we going with these brooms?

*Snape:* Mister Malfoy, if I were to appear in the same scene as Potter at this point, I would be humiliated by him in a duel---if I were lucky; and something similar goes for you. Therefore, we shall exercise our Slytherin virtue of knowing when to make an expeditious retreat, by making an expeditious retreat.

*Draco:* But... But I never got to confess my forbidden love for Hermione!

*Snape:* Neither did I, Mister Malfoy. Neither did I. Alas, you can't always get what you want; and neither can I. /[clenches fist]/ Only Potter can!
