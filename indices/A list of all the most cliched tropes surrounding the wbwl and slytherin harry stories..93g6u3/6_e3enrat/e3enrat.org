Hermione Worships Authority (and Dumbledore in particular) and can't do anything but quote from books. She disapproves of Harry's Rebellious and Independent attitude, constantly criticising his Doing What Must Be Done, even when he tries to help her.

Despite having good marks---though not as good as Harry's, of course---she is completely useless, even as a sidekick (because Harry is Smart and can do his own research, far more effectively and efficiently than her).

Eventually, WBWL, whoever it might be, will attempt to force himself on Hermione, and she will be completely helpless to resist him; but fortunately, Harry will rescue her in the nick of time. She will then be his helpmate for the rest of the fic, and exhibit no personality whatsoever.
