I honestly do feel bad for the Slytherins. They really do get the short end of the shaft; everyone expects them to be evil and join Voldemort. This preconception is really quite dangerous, Heaven forbid that not all of them are that way. It doesn't help that canon did little to correct it. As much as I love Ron (and Hagrid) in canon, he falls victim to this as well.

Perhaps Voldemort would have had a harder time recruiting them if they weren't already thought of as evil. Self fullfilling prophecies...
