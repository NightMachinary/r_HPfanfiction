The opposite also applies. Just because we do not see a good Slytherin does not mean one does not exist. It is this line of thinking where we make assumptions that we should not make.

As to your second point? It isn't fair to characterize people like that at all, that's just plain awful. Just because they do not show definitive proof of "goodness" does not mean we should hate them or look down upon them. Since we did we assume the worst of people, especially when they have done nothing to deserve it. A sorting into Slytherin does not mean you are a bigot or Death Eater; I'm not going to make an assumption based off of a sorting of all things.
