The problem with your response is that the House Unity clause only works if they are the supreme authority. They aren't - they are still children. Teachers and Dumbledore are. Plus if Harry is vocally against it, he also gains support from a good chunk of the school.

You are tipping the balance way too hard towards the students and towards each house. And, Harry has never let bullying, hexing, or peer pressure push him against his morals. It's literally the reason his hand was cut up so much in the fifth book.

And allowing innocent people to be hurt to save yourself is complacency and downright makes you an accessory of the crime through knowledge but inaction.
