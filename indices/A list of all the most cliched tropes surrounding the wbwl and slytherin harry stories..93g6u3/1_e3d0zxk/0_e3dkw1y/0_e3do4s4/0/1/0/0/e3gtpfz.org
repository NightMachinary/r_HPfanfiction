This is a dumb response.

No it is not. Pretty realistic actually.

Why would you want to be part of the House Unity if it means being part of or allowing a bigoted group to run freely?

Fear. If you don't follow the rules Government has made, cops will drag ur ass to prison. Same principles here. If you don't follow the house rules that everyone is following and agrees to, you get hated, hexed, bullied, etc.

It's one thing if you are an underground faction or a spy, and another if you are just allowing it to happen to save your own neck.

Lmao, Slytherin Common Room is literally like an Underground faction. And Harry allows bigotry because he literally is a firstie and will get hexed, bullied if he doesn't agree with the rest of his house. Its called Peer Pressure, its not made up and is a real world phenomenon just like the one I have mentioned previously.
