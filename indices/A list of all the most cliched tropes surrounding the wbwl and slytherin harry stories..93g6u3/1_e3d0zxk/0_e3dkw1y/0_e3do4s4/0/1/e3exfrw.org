Lmao, this answer is getting downvoted.

This answer's mentions a major plot point of all WBWL stories, that is why Harry doesn't stop Malfoy when he spouts his bigotry at muggle borns. There is something called Slytherin House rules, in which House Unity is always the first and biggest rule. So even if Harry disagrees with Malfoy he cannot argue with him in front of others of other houses. By downvoting this answer we classify and ally ourselves with the James Potter and WBWL Potter who we say are prejudiced towards Slytherins.
