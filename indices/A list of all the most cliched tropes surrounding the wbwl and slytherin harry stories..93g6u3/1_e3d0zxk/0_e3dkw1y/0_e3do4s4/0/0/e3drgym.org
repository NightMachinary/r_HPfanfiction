Could there be good Slytherins? Of course. But if they never show that they don't back Draco, if they never take stand against bigotry, if they let him be the face of their house, then it's on them that everyone thinks they are all evil.

If all you do is follow the evil leader and never even speak up or otherwise show that you're not evil, you deserve to be thought of as evil.
