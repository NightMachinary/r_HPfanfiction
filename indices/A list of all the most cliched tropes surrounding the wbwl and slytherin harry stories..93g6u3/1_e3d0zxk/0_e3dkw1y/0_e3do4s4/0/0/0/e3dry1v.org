So if someone does not show that they are not evil it is ok to assume that they are evil? That line of reasoning just doesn't hold at all.

  If all you do is follow the evil leader and never even speak up or otherwise show that you're not evil, you deserve to be thought of as evil.

That's the same as holding every German citizen responsible for the Holocaust. I certainly don't believe every German citizen during that time period was evil. Do you?

Remember this is from Harry's POV as well. We don't know that every or even most Slytherins followed Draco; Draco is just the most prominent as he appears most often in Harry's life.
