No, I believe, as I stated, that when you're associating with evil, you deserve to be seen as evil. You cannot "stay out of things" if you are part of a group represented by evil people.

If you're part of a boy scout group, and half your number erects a burning cross, not saying anything, not doing anything - not quitting the group, nor pushing to get them dismissed - isn't "staying out of things", but "tacitly supporting evil".

You might not be evil - but you deserve to be judged as evil.
