"House Unity" is a stupid fanon concept made up to explain why no Slytherin stood against Draco - and it doesn't work. If no one can disagree with a fellow Slytherin in public, then all it takes is one Slytherin regularly saying "pureblood ideology is stupid", and Draco and co. would be forced to shut up forever in public.

Really, whoever thought this drivel up never considered how that would actually work if there really were substantial parts of House Slytherin who disagreed with blood bigotry.
