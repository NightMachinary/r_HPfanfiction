In this scenario there are three types of people:

- Good people: Those who stand up for what is right
- Evil people: Voldemort, Hitler, Death Eaters
- Average Joes: Those who try and stay out of things.

The good people are good, the evil people are evil, /but it is not fair to say that the idle are evil./ Just because an average joe happened to be a Slytherin doesn't make them evil. If an average joe that was a Hufflepuff did nothing we wouldn't think them evil? Why does the Slytherin deserve that label?

I believe we are likely at an impasse, as it appears you believe there are only good and evil.
