Man, just read a WBWL story. If you sympathize with Harry, then you should delete your comments, because you're literally doing the opposite. Slytherins function on the House Unity principals. You cannot disagree with fellow Slytherins in public. Though Harry may want to hex Malfoy into the next week.

You might not be evil - but you deserve to be judged as evil.

Lmao- what? You realize you're acting like Ronald And the WBWL Potter and James Potter in this sentence. Ohh....the hypocrisy and the Irony. You sympathize with Harry and speak like WBWL Potter....
