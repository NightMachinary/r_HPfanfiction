The thing is, we never, ever see a good Slytherin in canon. We see bad Gryffindors (McLaggen), Bad Hufflepuffs (Macmillan and Justin during book 2, and their reaction in book 4), and Luna getting bullied certainly implies bad things about Ravenclaw, but where are the good Slytherins? The ones who support Harry? Who tell Draco to shut up when he sprouts his bigoted slurs?

You don't need to feel bad for the Slytherins in canon since they do not show even a hint of not being solidly behind Team Bigot, or even Team Death Eater.
