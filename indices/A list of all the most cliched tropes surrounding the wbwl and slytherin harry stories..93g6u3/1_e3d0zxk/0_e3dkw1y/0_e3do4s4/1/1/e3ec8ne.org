If your canon Slytherin exemplar only came back to teach because he felt the possibilities of exploiting Harry's fame was too much to pass up, cares only for students who can advance his own personal comfort, and was stupid enough to explain the most blackest of magics to a bloody 17 year old, then perhaps Slytherin was pretty shit.
