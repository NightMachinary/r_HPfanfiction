The Slytherins are noble souls, bullied by the evil Gryffindors, beset by ignorant mudbloods, and they are a family, defending each other against unprovoked aggression from the other Houses.

Every Slytherin is also a master politican at age 11, already planning - cunningly! - their and Britain's future by making alliances (Not friendships - that's for the bullies in Gryffindor!) with each other.

Blood matters. JKR was wrong, your family matters and your blood grants you special powers if you're a pureblood. Marrying a mudblood means ending your family power!

Only the Slytherins are versed in Wizarding Culture. Everyone else, pureblood or not, are savages and barbarians and know nothing about their culture. Mudbloods can't learn it anyway.
