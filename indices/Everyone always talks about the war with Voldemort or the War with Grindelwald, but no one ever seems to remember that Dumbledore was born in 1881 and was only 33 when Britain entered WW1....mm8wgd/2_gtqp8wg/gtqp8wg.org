Rowling has gone pretty far out of her way to make it clear that the wizarding world is totally separate from the muggle one when it comes to wars. Even the issue with Grindelwald is portrayed as being entirely coincidental. It is wholly coincidental that the Grindelwald war happened at the exact same time as World War II and covered the same core theater of conflict. The two events are in no way related, according to Rowling, and any similarities they share is sheer coincidence.

I personally happen to DISAGREE with this approach, which I'll talk about in a moment, but given that context, I would ASSUME that since World War II did not matter at all to the wizarding community, that World War I (i.e. The Great War) passed by them completely unremarked upon. They did not participate, and it did not matter.

This is really down to what I call the Hitler Problem. If you're some sort of modern fantasy writer, and your writing happens to encompass that era of history, you have two choices: ignore Hitler, or embrace Hitler. MOST writers choose option 1, which is to ignore Hitler, which is the safest option for public relations. There is zero chance anyone will be upset about it, even if it is superficially absurd to suppose that it is true. The second option, which far fewer people use, is to "embrace" Hitler by directly involving him in the story in some way, or involving the events that happened. This makes way more sense logically, but it also runs the risk of offending people.

Rowling went with Option 1, and in fact went in for it so hard that she's practically wished Hitler out of existence. You can see another instance of Option 1 in The Dresden Files, though that is a somewhat softer example. Instead of Hitler never being discussed at all, it comes up, but it is generally acknowledged that Kimmler was the more dangerous of the two, since he nearly destroyed the world and came /extremely/ close to ascending to godhood. Also, Kimmler was literally a card-carrying member of the NSDAP and had his own occult research division in the German military at the time, so he had a direct connection to Hitler. This is in direct contrast to Grindelwald, who is, ALLEGEDLY, just some random guy who happened to be alive in the same generation and whose rebellion and war had nothing to do with anything else happening at the same time in those same countries.

At some point during her worldbuilding, Rowling made the executive decision to never mention Hitler or National Socialist Germany, EVER, even though important parts of the plot are the result of things that happened during that time period that need to be explained. Dumbledore's motivations and attitudes don't make much sense if he lives in a vacuum: you have to explain his falling out with Grindelwald, his estrangement from his brother, and Ariana's death, for any of Dumbledore's long term choices and decisions to make sense. In addition, Dumbledore was 'merely' a genius academic until he killed Grindelwald, so Grindelwald's whole story is the catalyst for Dumbledore's fame and influence: without Dark Lord Gellert Grindelwald the legend of Albus Dumbledore does not exist. And yet, in spite of how involved the foundation of the story was in that time period, Rowling absolutely refused to bring up Hitler or allow any connection with Hitler to be made in her story. She was so adamant about this divorce from mentioning Hitler that she went so far as to spell out that /World War II did not matter to wizards and they barely noticed it happening./ Half of the planet fighting the other half of the planet was beneath the dignity or notice of the wizarding community, and they were entirely divorced from both the influence of the war and any material or ideological consequences that came about as a result of it.

So, given Rowling's own statements on the issue, I would have to assume that if they didn't notice World War II, then they almost certainly didn't notice the Great War either. I would assume that obviously the muggleborns cared a great deal about it, and the halfbloods of the time were aware of it, but wizards as a whole ignored it or were dismissive of it. Muggles fighting muggles with strange muggle contraptions, not a very big deal and nothing to be concerned about. If you see any funny gas coming your way, cast a bubble head charm on yourself and carry on.
