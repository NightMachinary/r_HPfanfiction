1. it is implied that Grindelwald insisted that they had to lead muggles for muggle's own sake.
2. I think it is more like they realized the muggles are crazy beyond they thought. Magic overrides mundane nature and they don't seem to adopt guns or something. If they are terrified, then they should have used guns and artillery in their conflict. By JKR's definition magic is superior. So... muggles are too obsessed with violence that they developed the non-magical method to kill their own population that is on-par or more than the entire Wizarding population. It is just crazy.
3. I doubt Wizards would fancy 'big' things. Muggle fancy big and blasting things, but wizards seem to focus on more obscure things after their adolescence. Muggles could have seemed like a crazy child, strengthening Grindelwald's argument.
4. It is implied that the Wizard government did not go to war for very long, while muggles are treating war as a sport. "Wow, muggle filths are really beyond imagination!".
