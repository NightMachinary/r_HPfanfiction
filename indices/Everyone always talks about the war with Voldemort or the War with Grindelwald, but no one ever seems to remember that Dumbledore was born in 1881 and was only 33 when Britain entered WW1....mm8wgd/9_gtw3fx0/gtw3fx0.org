Wizarding nations are functionally almost completely independant from the muggle nations they share geography with, oh they pop over to say hello whenever a new leader is elected, but they have their own laws, own politics and certainly aren't about to go fight a war for them.

Reactions will probably depend on how long ago the most recent magical war was and how it was fought, but since we never hear mention of anything big, I'd assume it was quite some time ago, perhaps even pre-statute (open warfare being rather hard to conceal), and the response would therefore be "Those muggles truly are barbaric, slaughtering each other over petty disagreements and is such a gruesome and excessive manners too, I'm certainly glad we're not part of that society"

It could easily have been part of what made Grindelwald's rhetoric so appealing to people like Albus, the muggles are clearly doing a horrible job of ruling themselves, so much violence and collateral damage, wouldn't it be better if we, who war much more rarely, were to lead them.
