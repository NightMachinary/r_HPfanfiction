I dont think wizards are outclassed by muggles in terms of destruction whatsoever. Mainly due too the fact wizards also have what could be considered WMDs, (fiendfire, dementors, dragons, lethifolds, etc) and by just corraling and unleashing or just unleashing they could bring muggles too there knees. Especially with wizards right in the middle of many high end muggle settlements, with muggles unable to find them.
