'Surpassing' is a strong word considering competent wizards have access to unlimited explosions, fire and kinetic force to only name just a few of the things witches and wizards can do. Don't forget that Fiendfyre isn't that hard to cast (as shown by Crabbe), the trick is to be able to control it, which you don't really need to - you only need to be able to disapparate away quickly enough - since Fiendfyre is not like Gubraithian Fire which is everlasting and a different thing.
