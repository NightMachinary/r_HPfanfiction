I think that might have been the last moment when wizards got somewhat involved in muggle affairs and paid a massive price of bood fighting alongside their muggle counterparts.

It would make sense for Grindelwald and Voldemort to rise to such prominence after that - having a substantial number of your best and brightest dying in a mindless slaughter tends to shift societies.

And, well, it was a perfect opportunity - we know wizards from different counties dont necessarily get along with each other, so I can definitely see them picking up on the hard-core nationalism of the times.
