It definitely had an impact - i'd imagine being on the frontlines of the war muggles started had twofold consequences:

1. One side that didn't want to have anything to do with non-magicals whatsoever, since they're clearly not worth the cost
2. One side that wanted to lead muggles instead, to make them civilised and not prone to wanton slaughter.

The difference between Dumbledore and Grindelwald (both in camp 2) sprung from different approaches - Dumbledore most likely wanted each country to do their own muggle-leading thing, since that seemed like a good idea not to shake the boat too much, whereas Grindelwald wanted to go forth and unite the world under one state, to take the 'no more war' further down it's logical path (after all, no countries - no conflict, right?)

And from that you get WW2 being somewhat influenced by Grindelwald alliance with the nazis.

OFC none of it is canon but i think some setup like that would make good grounds for some story in that period.
