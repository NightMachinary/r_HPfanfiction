I think JK was saying that Archer Evermonde passed emergency legislation that forbade wizards to get involved in the war. Whether similar practices were observed all over the world is unknown but it could be likely that it would have been a direction coming from ICW since the concern was that there would be breeches of the Statute if wizards got involved in the conflict. So assuming this, it's quite likely that the wizarding world stood out the first war with minor exceptions such as Henry Potter and those that secretly helped their Muggle neighbors (but JK makes it seem like it was on minor stuff so not really a big deal).
