I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but I really like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/][Realizations]]. The gist of it is that the Dursleys move to Australia and abandon Harry, who goes to live at the Leaky Cauldron for the summer - but he ends up using a disguise, so the whole Wizarding World considers Harry "missing".

He doesn't technically leave the Wizarding World, but he does leave his role as the famous Harry Potter, so I think it has a lot of the same appeal. (Plus he does make some Muggle friends and I love their whole plotline).

The plot gets a bit convoluted towards the end but it's really good overall imo, I hope you like it!
