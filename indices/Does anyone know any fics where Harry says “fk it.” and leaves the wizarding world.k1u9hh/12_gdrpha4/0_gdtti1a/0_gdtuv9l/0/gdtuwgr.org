#+begin_quote
  Thanks to a special interest in Muggle culture, Pansy comes across something rather interesting on the internet: someone who looks very much like Harry Potter is posting videos of himself dancing on YouTube under the name "Evan James".But Harry Potter has been missing and unheard of for years. They say he couldn't take the fame and he'd just up and left the UK behind, with rumour placing him somewhere on the Continent. When Pansy shows Draco one of the videos, something ... well, awakens in him. Something he had very much tried to move on from and forget---that he has loved Harry Potter ever since they were fourteen.Pansy convinces Draco that it's time he travels to Ibiza to find Harry and "shoot his shot", once and for all.
