There is some from back in the day. I somewhat remember one where Harry is imperiused into firing a killing curse at Cedric's dead body right as they return to Hogwarts. It was a Harry/Susan Bones fic.

I also vaguely remember a Harry/Seamus one and possibly a Harry/Human!Hedwig one.

However, in none of these do the jailed Death Eaters take Harry under their wing. Not seen that in a fic.
