Off the top of my head,

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by Diane Castle]]: Nonmagical AU: "Harworts" is a school for superspies, Harry is the next James Bond, Ron is nobility and the social skills of the group, and Hermione is a genius hacker and gadgeteer.
- Generally, [[/u/Starfox5]]'s fics tend to feature an ensemble cast led by the BAMF!Trio.
