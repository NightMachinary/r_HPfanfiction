What the fuck. Literally nothing about this story has to do with magic or Harry Potter. I don't give a fuck that Harry's supposed to show up later, as it clearly shows that you tagged it complete with 1 chapter. This fic is as far from Harry Potter as possible. The least you could do is change the tags and add some warnings for the oc's.
