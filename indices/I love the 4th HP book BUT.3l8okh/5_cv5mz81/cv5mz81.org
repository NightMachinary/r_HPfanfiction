One question that I think has gone unexplored: are the events fixed by the Goblet in every respect? Imagine that the answer is no: the events themselves are surprises arranged by the judges. The dates are fixed, though, so one day in advance Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor sequentially tussle with a dragon 'for fun'. The next day (barring injuries), all /four/ competitors +play a rigged game of+ start off the tournament with a rousing game of Paper, Rock, Scissors, Magic. (Harry is not told about the fourth play that /always/ beats the other three.) The official scores just happen to reflect how much better the other three are at dragon-wrangling. Huh. Imagine that. Months later, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor all go down to the lake...
