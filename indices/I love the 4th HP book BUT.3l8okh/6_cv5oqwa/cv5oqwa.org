i think it's pretty obvious the cup is not binding simply because dumbledore considers if he should let harry compete or not. if there was no choice he wouldn't even discus it. the real question for me is if he has guessed about the voldi-resurection at the end. since he already knows about at least one horcrux and harrys scar is it all just part of his plans; he knows voldi needs to live in order for him to kill harry and has no problem setting him up to do so -if he knows he'll survive or not is another matter.
