I like to pretend that (1) Hogwarts students write their names on their homework, same as anywhere else, and (2) Impostor Moody tore one off of Harry's homework, so the thing submitted to the cup at least had Harry's name written by his own hand. The confounding forced the cup to think there was a School #4 with just this one entrant.

He could put a fake copy of the ink back if the item was to be returned. (Do students usually get papers back? I don't know.) Harry probably wouldn't notice that some magical property of part of his homework was different.

Otherwise, I have to accept that the cup is just a powerful magical artifact that can extract punishment against anyone, but just happens to usually be this very lawful, rule-based thing.
