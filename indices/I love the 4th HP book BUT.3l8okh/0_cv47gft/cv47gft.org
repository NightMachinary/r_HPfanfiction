I think that scene would have been completely different if Harry had a parent or some kind of advocate. If that happened to Ron, Mrs. Weasley would /shut that shit down./ Harry was 14.

But the adults in the room are: Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor Dumbledore, Barty Crouch, Professor McGonagall, Bagman, and Professor Snape.

Dumbledore, apart from anything else, has a vested interest in giving Harry as much experience as possible. So he's not going to fall all over himself sheltering Harry.

Dumbledore's first instinct is to ask (an imperiused) Crouch, who states that it's in the rulebook that Harry must compete. Bagman affirms Crouch's statement by saying that if Crouch says they're no loophole, then there's no loophole. Then Moody (Barty Crouch Jr.) arrives, and he skillfully transitions the conversation by treating Harry's participation like it's a foregone conclusion.

Dumbledore, operating on the wisdom of both Moody and Crouch and not really in any rush to disqualify Harry in the first place, decides that Harry should compete. McGonagall is the closest thing Harry has to an advocate, but she's not inclined to overrule Dumbledore. Karkaroff and Maxime obviously aren't happy, but at this point the host school's headmaster and the host country's ministry representives have decided that Harry should compete. So they're irritated and Karkaroff suggests that they will be boycotting in future, but neither of them think they can overrule the others.
