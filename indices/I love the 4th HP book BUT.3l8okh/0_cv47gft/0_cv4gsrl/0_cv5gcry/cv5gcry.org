I've always felt that where that falls down is in the intent of the person entering them. Barty Crouch Jnr - whatever else you say about him - definitely did intend Harry to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Yes, he had ulterior motives in doing so, but they still entirely rested on his competing.

With "contracts catch criminals" that same underlying intent would not exist. It's not something that can be tricked or contrived into working - it's magic, after all - and so any of those setups wouldn't apply.

(Besides which, the Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. There's no reason to suspect that this is something that can be done at the flip of a dime.)
