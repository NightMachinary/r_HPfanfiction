I'd say that the theory is sound but it's Harry's intent that got him into the fix. Barty Jnr. tore off his signature and put a Confundus on the Goblet but Harry was dreaming of glory just like half the kids in the school were that week. If that didn't work, I have no doubt that Barty would have come up with some other nifty schemes to get Harry in the graveyard at the right day and time. If I was Barty, I'd probably be hoping the Confundus didn't work, because the back-up plan might not require him to spend the whole year in disguise, surrounded by enemies.
