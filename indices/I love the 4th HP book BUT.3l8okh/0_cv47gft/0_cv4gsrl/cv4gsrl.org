Well, to be honest, I always felt that nobody in the story thought about the implications of Harry getting entered against his will.

If it really was a magically binding contract, then why not use it to hunt down fugitives? Either they show up for some pretty rigged tasks in the Biannual Fugitive Games or they suffer whatever magical consequences come from breaking a contract. Either way, it's a win/win for the good guys.

If it wasn't a magically binding contract, then Harry got turbo screwed and it would make quite a bit of sense that no one really believed he didn't enter himself. Everyone would wonder why he's actually still competing if he doesn't want anything to do with it like he keeps saying.

Also when I was reading The Goblet of Fire, I kept thinking that Harry really needed a publicist. Even if Rita is an irritating rumor-monger, she obviously has a lot of loyal readers so when Harry starts off antagonizing her, I got pretty frustrated. Although it does also set up the fifth book since Harry burned his bridges with the press in this book so they'd be a lot less hesitant to smear him when Fudge asked them to.
