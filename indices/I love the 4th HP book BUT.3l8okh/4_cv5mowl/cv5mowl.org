I think one of the interesting aspects is in fanfics and how they have no way of dealing with it.

If there's time travel, or just sufficient genre savviness, Harry & co. anticipate something like this but are unable to block it. Worse, when they manage it, it's very much at odds with the original story. Magical oaths or something.

I imagine a situation where Harry is sure this will happen. He and friends create a duplicate Goblet with the same appearance and none of the complex magic. It just accepts names. There's a reverse heist where they have to conceal the real goblet from beyond the age line. Let's say they just make it invisible somehow (cloak?) but leave it right where it is, and put the decoy in front, still mostly within the age area. Then before the drawing they dump out all of the names entered into the decoy, find Harry's, and forward the rest into the real goblet all at once. The fake goblet is confounded, but it doesn't have any agency, so they just get rid of it. For extra cheek, time travel is involved so Harry only bothers to put in Viktor's, Fleur's, and Cedric's names.

Still needs a twist, or something to make it interesting.
