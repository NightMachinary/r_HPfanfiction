I think you're getting rather hung up on Muggle contract law. A "magically binding contract" is obviously a magical phenomenon, not a legal construct.

  Doesn't explain how you can make a binding between some random person and the goblet.

The Goblet of Fire binds the competitor, not the person putting the name in. The confundus charm just gets the Goblet to pick a specific person to compete. The ability to magically compel anyone in the world to compete is an intrinsic feature of the Goblet of Fire.
