  I just can't understand how this magical binding can happen. You'd have to willingly agree to it or *anybody can make magical bindings*.

Anyone skilled enough to cast a confundus that can fool the Goblet of Fire, who has access to the Goblet of Fire, which only lights for the Triwizard tournament and which can only bind people to compete in the Triwizard.

It's quite a limited ability.
