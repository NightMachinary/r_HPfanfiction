First off, warnings for speculation.

You know, books > movies any day, but just for this case, I am going make use of the latter. The movie scene in Dumbledore's office, where Snape suggests they let the events of the tournament unfold to find out who is behind this setup explains it the best. Plus, it doesn't contradict canon; it /is/ something that could have occurred behind the scenes. Maybe Dumbledore could have found a way to break the contract eventually, but why do so when he can use Harry as bait while keeping him 'relatively safe'? ( An unpredictable enemy might have done much worse to get to Harry if his inital plan was foiled.)
