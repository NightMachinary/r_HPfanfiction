Cheers, I honestly didn't remember that. But anyway, I plucked that particular line only from the movie for this exact reason: irrelevant of the rest of the movie's circumstances, it presents a plausible explanation that doesn't make the plot seem that contrived.

And as I said, it is just speculation of what 'could be'.
