I was thinking about that some this morning. I don't get it at all either, but here's possibilities I came up with.\\
-- They are young, desperately lonely, and in need of validation of any sort, and perhaps think that this will somehow make them feel better, not realizing the hollowness of praise that is not at all earned. (Just as you suggest -- the comments simply couldn't make one truly happy.)\\
-- They are young trolls curious to see how many people they can get to believe they wrote the stolen story. I mean, in this instance, the author stole three exceptionally well-known stories -- maybe s/he was doing it as a stupid joke to reel in the less well-read HP fans? (= someone has way too much time on their hands.)\\
-- They are young/idiotic authors who somehow think if they can win over readers with "good" (stolen) fics, they'll have a ready-made fanbase when they publish their own fics. (This would again require them to have limited knowledge of how well-read many HP fans are in fanfics.)\\
-- They are graduate students doing a study on plagiarism or similar in the fanfiction world. This sounds ridiculous, I know, but when I was in grad school I had a friend who studied plagiarism and blog posts, and she would actually set up studies were she replicated content from popular blog sites. I really don't think that's going on here, but who knows?

Honestly, any reason (other than the last, I suppose), points to a sad, rather pathetic individual who has too much time on their hands.
