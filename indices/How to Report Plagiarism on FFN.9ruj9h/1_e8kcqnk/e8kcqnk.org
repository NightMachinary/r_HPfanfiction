This is slightly off topic but I recently joined reddit and I am surprised by the number of posts I have seen about this sort of plagiarism. I am unable to understand why people are doing this. Posting a fic on internet does not really earn anyone any rewards other than reviews from the readers. But if someone posts something that is not at all their own, what do they stand to gain? The comments would not make them happy because they know the praise is for someone else. Even if their username gets some recognition, I don't know if that is really beneficial on the internet. So what do you think is the reason behind people posting someone else's work as their own?

PS: I am not condoning the act. If anything, it is very upsetting to find out that this is such a common occurence. The actual authors of the story put in a lot of effort into the story and deserve to be recognized for them.
