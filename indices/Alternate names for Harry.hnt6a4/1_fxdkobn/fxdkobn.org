Depends....Looking at this list of canon purebloods...it would just depend on the lore of the pureblood family you're creating.

The Carrows have kind of a Greek/Roman thing going on from the list.

The Gaunts have Evil Gaunt, Omen Gaunt, Evil Omen Gaunt, Raven Gaunt.

I have no idea what is going on here with the Lestranges except it looks like they should have taken a break from marrying into and out of the Black family.

I think the Longbottoms just went with severely British sounding as a theme here with the exception of Callidora here who doesn't count because she was a Black.

The Malfoys kind of had a luxury and wealth theme until Narcissa married in. Apparently, the Black family was eating the other families.

Basically, just pick a theme and the feeling behind the lore of the pureblood last name or surrender to the Black family tree and flip through everything to do with stars ever. Even obsolete ones. I named my Pok√©mon PC, Praesepe, after a star cluster in the Cancer constellation.

Pick your poison, my friend

*Edit: Changed fancy to luxury and wealth. They have albino peacocks. I had to subtract some of the class that the word fancy gives to that. Obnoxious
