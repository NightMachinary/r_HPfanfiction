Leo would work, because 1. it's a star constellation, like Sirius, and 2. represents Gryffindor. and it's also a normal muggle name, and I could see purebloods with it as well. you could go more posh with it, like Leonis or Leonidus tbh. not if you weren't going for Gryffindor though...

otherwise, I would probably choose depending on what I was going for. if he was Master of death, then other names of Death, or death gods from other religions, would fit. maybe even Charon (the guy who takes the souls through the river)

Hades being god of underworld, and "had" means snake in my language, so if I were to go for MoD and slytherin, I would probably choose Haden. it also starts with "H".

you could also go with canon wizards, like from chocolate frog cards.
