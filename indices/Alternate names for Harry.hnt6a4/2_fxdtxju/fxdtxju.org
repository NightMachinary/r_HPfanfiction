If your main two concerns are giving him another ordinary name and it being too weird, and giving him a unique name and it being too pretentious, you could try Henry. Harry is a nickname for Henry, so it's not like a completely different name you're calling him by, but since his name is apparently just Harry it's also different enough to warrant using as a disguise.
