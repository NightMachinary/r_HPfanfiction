I don't know the name of the fic, but I ranted last month about it. It started sometime soon after the CoS kerfuffle, and took 133 chapters to cover up to 19th July the same year.

I might have stuck around if I'd enjoyed it, but the story wasn't interesting enough to be worth the effort.

There was another story a few months ago, 480k words and still hadn't covered the full school year. A Wizenmaggot sesh took four chapters, and the following 4 days took nine chapters. Bloody ridiculous.
