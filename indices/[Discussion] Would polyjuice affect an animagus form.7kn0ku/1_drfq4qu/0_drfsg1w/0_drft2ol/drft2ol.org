Following the same reasoning, it would be the same as taking the hair of any old animal, since an animagus is physically an animal in every way - and in some magical ways too, considering their immunity to lycanthropy.

EDIT: I suppose it might work if they are the same species, and probably wear off normally - or cause something similar to furry-Hermione if they transform back to human before the effects wear out.

Considering the low number of (registered) animagi, I suppose this wasn't taken into consideration when the potion was invented.
