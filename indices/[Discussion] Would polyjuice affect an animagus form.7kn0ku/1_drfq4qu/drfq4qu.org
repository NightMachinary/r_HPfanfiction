We know that it affects people's physical traits. All seven Harry's needed glasses. To me, that seems to be the limit: it copies everything non-magical and physical. None of them ever mentioned having scars that hurt, so it seems to be unaffected by anything magical.

I imagine that would apply for other magical properties too, like for instance animagus forms.

Magically, Hermitrix and Rorry would still be Hermione and Ron in any way but appearance and physical condition.
