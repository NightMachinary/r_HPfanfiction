Good point. Even though turning into a rat would allow you to be really sneaky, it also leaves you pretty vulnerable to predators. But then again, there's a lot of animals that eat snakes, too, so...

Although I suppose the difference there is that when Voldemort was possessing snakes, he hadn't yet returned to his physical form, and I don't think he really cared what happened to his vessel after he'd used it to his own ends.

But tbh, I don't think he would have ever considered using polyjuice on anyone, regardless of whether they were an animagus or not. Not only was having his own body back extremely important to him, I also think he would have considered any other body, human or animal, to be inferior to his own.
