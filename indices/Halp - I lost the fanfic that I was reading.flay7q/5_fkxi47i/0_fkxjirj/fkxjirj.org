I was reading it through reddit. I just kept it open on the reddit app.

Starts at the end of the trio's third year. Hermione gets sent back 20 years and goes to live with the McGonagalls over the summer. So she starts her fourth year with Lily, Severus, etc.

It was an epic.

She was still in Gryffindor

She still used her last name
