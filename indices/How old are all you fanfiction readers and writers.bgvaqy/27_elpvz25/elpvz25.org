Yay I win, I'm the oldest. I'm 53, which yes I agree is quite old. I love fanfiction and got into it by accident - on a friend's recommendation - and only two years ago. My friend is almost as old as me, but doesn't read much in the HP universe. Before I knew fanfiction existed I used to write it anyway - unpublished. I'm still unpublished because it's not very good. I'm a teacher and an awful lot of my students read fanfiction, so you're definitely not alone OP.
