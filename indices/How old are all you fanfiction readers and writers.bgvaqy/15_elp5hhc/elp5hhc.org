I went through much the same thing when I was 15, I'm now 32. I started reading fanfiction in 1998 (when I was 12) and used to have a binder with my favourites printed out that even came to school with me. My nerd game was strong. It didn't do me any favours when it came to being popular and I did get mocked for it, but it was something I loved. I'm just old enough to remember old printed zines where you had fanfiction published, so it's been around a long time for me and evolved from that to geocities to ffnet to ao3.

​

I started writing at 14, and back then, it felt like everyone was older than me. When I started writing at 14, it felt like a good creative writing outlet. When we were asked to try an unusual format for English class, I wrote fanfiction and I ended up having a discussion with the teacher about it (who was fascinated by the concept), Fanfiction, even then, held more appeal than a lot of the books in the school in the school library because I either knew the characters or I could relate to the writing. It was also a much more queer friendly space than a late nineties British senior school library was. I remember reading somewhere about how fanfiction is transformative, if gives you a chance to explore identity and experiences and what you think about things and as a young writer, I definitely found that helped me find what I liked to write and read. Even as I went on to read a wider variety of published works as I got older, I still loved fanfiction for it's freedom, creativity and for a community that helped me learn how to write in the way I wanted to. It was inspiring, it was fun and it was free. The older authors were by and large encouraging to younger writers and often helped on fanfiction boards like mugglenets old one or force,net when I was stuck. Despite some of the nastier feedback or trolls or offline mockery, fanfiction has been a huge part of my life for twenty years. Though I will take writing breaks for years at a time, will go a little while where I inhale it daily or I won't read or write in a specific fandom for a decade, I don't see it stopping any time soon. There's too much to read, write, meta about and get inspired by.

​

I will add to this by saying that some of my friends have gone on to be teachers or work with teenagers, which has meant they've had to go back and either scrub their fanfiction from when they were fifteen under their real name or make sure it's under a pen name as no one wants to know their teacher wrote a lot of unrealistic lemons (sexually explicit fanfiction) in their teens. They also have to make sure anything they post now is from nothing that will link to their offline email, real name, etc. While this seems fairly standard these days, back in the day, a lot of people just used their real name. Due to this use of pen names, you never really know who is a fic writer and who isn't. It can surprise you. I ended up finding out that one of my neighbours was a fic writer whose fics I'd read only a few years ago. It's more widespread than you think, though I'll admit, I saw most people do it in college rather than high school.

​

The tl;dr of this is a lot of us were you once. Stick with it if you enjoy it, it can be rewarding and fun even if there is a stigma. Fanfiction writers are like spies - you never know who is one in secret.
