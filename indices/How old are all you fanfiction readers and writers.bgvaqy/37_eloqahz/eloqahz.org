26, but I started reading at 13, started writing at 15. Honestly though it's not like my writing has improved- I think it's gotten worse. But I have more life experience so I think I actually know what I'm talking about when it comes to relationships and character interactions. But 15 is a great age to write fanfic- it's all about exploring what you like to read and it's a great way to hone your writing skills and creativity
