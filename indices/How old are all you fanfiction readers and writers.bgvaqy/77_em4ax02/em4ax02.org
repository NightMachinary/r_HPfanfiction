I'm 66. Got started on Ranma fanfiction well over a decade ago (I don't remember exactly when), and got into Harry Potter by reading crossovers. I've written two crack HP one-shots, but they've only been put on a Yahoo! Groups mailing list.

I look on reading fanfiction as an outgrowth of my long-term (since age 7) interest in science fiction & fantasy. Fanfiction, like everything else, generally follows Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap). Finding one of the good ones, though ...

Some of my friends and family know I read it, and some don't. Not a big deal either way; long before I read fanfiction, I used to get "you read that kiddie rocket ship stuff?" comments sometimes.
