I'm just a scrubby 20 year old university student. Been reading fanfiction periodically since I was 13 or 14, but only really got into it and started writing my own in the last year or so. I look back on some of the stuff I once read religiously now and wonder what the bloody hell I was thinking (or whether I was thinking at all).
