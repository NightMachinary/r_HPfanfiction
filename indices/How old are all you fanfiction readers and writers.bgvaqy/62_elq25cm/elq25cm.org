I was 12 or 13 when I started reading and writing. I don't remember exactly how I found it, or what I first read (canon Sherlock Holmes fics?).

My first published story was a oneshot for /Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic/, before that was a Mary Sue self insert for LoTR, and chapter rewrites in my head for various /Warriors/ novels.

I'm 23 now and my tastes are a bit more varied than wheat they used to be.
