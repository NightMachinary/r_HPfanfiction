I'm 17. I've been reading fan fiction since like 2008. I think the fact that it's mostly older people in this sub is a guarantee, due to adults and people who have been consuming fan fiction for a long time have been weeding out the fan fiction they think are god awful from their ride or die fics (side note- it's so interesting that there can be many different opinions on the same fic. For example HPMOR. I read the first three chapters and liked it, but then my opinion of the book took a nosedive from the jarring character displays, reiterations of the same three chapters, and just dumbassery of Harry even though he's supposed to be this holier than thou genius; while others think that it's the best thing since sliced bread and will cut you if you say one bad thing about it. Absolute snobs). I've noticed a commonality between multiple genres/types of fanfics people are looking for. We've been reading fan fiction for so goddamn long that we want to read the best of the best, and that's mostly through word of mouth recommendation (experience). So while you can know a lot of fanfics, to really get to the nitty gritty of it, it's mostly older people who have the best recommendations because they're the most knowledgeable on the subject and they know their way around certain subgenres and their opinions change over time.
