I'm 21, I started reading fanfiction at probably 7 or 8, wrote my first one at 9, then started fresh at 14 and have been writing since. I gained a lot of rp experience between 9 and 14 so the difference between my first fic and the one I started at 14 are striking.

I knew a few people growing up who read fanfics but not many. It's still fairly small these days, but I'm friends with fellow writers now--it's pretty nice. I've nevee written a HP fic though, only read.
