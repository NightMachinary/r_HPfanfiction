I'm 24 and I'm new to the writing aspect of fanfictions. I only wrote and published my first fic a few weeks ago. I read HPMOR and Oh God Not Again at age 18, but I only really got into reading fanfics when a friend introduced me to DP&SW several months ago.

thankfully, my mother's a linguist, and dealing with her throughout my life probably has affected my writing style for the better, even if it makes me snobby about the writing style of things I read.
