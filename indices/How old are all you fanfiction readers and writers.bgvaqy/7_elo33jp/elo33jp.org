I'm 18 and I know one other person who has read fanfictions previously. Most people dislike them and I get why. Most readers/writers come off as rather young, but this subreddit is the exact opposite. A lot of people here I feel are very much so older than the usual demographic of fanfic enthusiasts. There is a reason the stereotyp of the 14 y/o girl reading smut exists.
