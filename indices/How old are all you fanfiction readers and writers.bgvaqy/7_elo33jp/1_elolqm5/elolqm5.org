Much like you I'm 18. I feel that the stereotype is so prevalent to outsiders is because they only see the rather poor quality stuff that is somehow in the top favourites or in latest updates. There are certainly a lots of 14 y/o around but because outsiders don't see the really good stuff so just dismiss everything and everyone else.
