I'm 61, got into fandom at 48, and have no shame about it, although I'm circumspect about sharing my hobby with nonfandom people. I've written (unpublished) original fiction all my life, but I was going through writer's block when I first stumbled across HP fandom online. It added pleasure and friendship to a life that was quite miserable for several years, plus it gave me an outlet to write when I might not have had it otherwise.

The fabulous thing about fandom is the community of shared interests, although no one would deny it has its batshit elements. But fanfiction allowed me to write for fun again, relax my critical standards, and get feedback that wasn't all about improvement and professional standards. Audience response is always a gift (not counting flames, of course), but it's very, very different when it's given with emotion and genuine excitement than in a classroom or workshop context.

So enjoy your hobby, OP. There's nothing wrong with it, and it can be as much or as little a part of your life as you want it to be. You can go away and come back. You can participate or lurk. It's entirely up to you.
