I recommend not talking about writing/reading fanfic with those who aren't fannish. People are judgmental, and probably won't understand.

As or me--I've been reading mostly since 2000. I mean, there are a few Trek zines in my past, but that wasn't a regular thing before the Internet fanfic world took off.
