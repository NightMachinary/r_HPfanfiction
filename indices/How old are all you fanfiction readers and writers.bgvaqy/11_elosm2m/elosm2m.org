Now 23. Read the first ff (HPMoR) about 5 years ago. I yet have to dip my finger into writing one though... Honestly, you cant make others lifes worst by reading fanfics, so you should definitly keep doing what you want to do. Usually people dont get why the others do things, and since we are humans, we ridicule each other. In my opinion reading fanfics is the same as reading a book from famous/not so famous authors. Only I know that whoever wrote the story has something common with me: undieing love to a fandom. So I see two approach: either show them what they miss, or leave them alone and let them have their own fun.
