I'm 24.

I started reading fanfics around Summer 2017 (I read HPMoR during 2014ish, but it didn't give me any interest in HP fanfic in general) after reading Backwards with Purpose, reading basically anything since I didn't really have a standard yet and everything was new and fancy, I was 23 back then. At the time I mostly read Harry-centric fanfics, set in Hogwarts during the 90s.

In late April 2018, I read 2 different SS-centric fics, one set in the Marauder-era (They Didn't Know We Were Seeds), the other during his entire life (The Snape Chronicles). They permanently changed my preferences -- both in terms of what characters I prefer reading about (SS-centric), and changed my views on pairings to almost what they are now. Some time later, I read a Tonks-centric fic set in HP's 5th year that also added HPNT as one of my favorite pairings -- but it's not a common ship so finding good fics of that kind is a bit tricky. My preferences hasn't changed since.
