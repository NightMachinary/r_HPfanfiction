I started at 12, now I'm in my twenties.

Ignore them. I was really self-conscious about it for a while, because it was such a geeky thing to do, etc, etc. As always, none of my real friends cared. Was there some gentle teasing? Yes. Was it malicious? No. Were there people who would have been malicious if I'd talked about it? Probably, but I didn't ask for their opinion anyway.

When you get to college, or get a job, or whatever you decide to do, you'll find that you aren't the only person, far from it. There's more people in the real world, and far fewer who have the time and inclination to get so worked up about what someone else is doing with their life.

I've had people come up to me and start conversations with me about fanfiction because they've seen me reading in class (sorry not sorry). One of my high school friends who used to tease me reads it now and asks for recommendations.

TLDR; read what you want, and don't worry what others think. You're under no obligation to tell them anything about your life if you don't want to.
