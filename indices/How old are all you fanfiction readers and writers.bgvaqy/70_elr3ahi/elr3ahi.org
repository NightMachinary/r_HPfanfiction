I'm 18 and started writing fanfictions when I was 13 or 14. My last one, /The Lost Child/, was my first actual story hasn't been updated in a long time. I've noticed that because of the ages I wrote it at and how many changes I went through mentally and emotionally it's very inconsistent and parts of it are poorly written. My plan is to rework the whole thing as I'm not a lot more mature and a lot more experienced as a writer. Hopefully I'll have the majority of it improved and at a much higher quality of storytelling by Autumn this year.

If anyone's curious about this story, I'll link it here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10789135/1/The-Lost-Child]]
