31 now, but I made my first attempts at 14/15. Gave it up for a while and started writing fanfic again at about 29. I definitely have a different approach to it now, and I love how much fun it still is!

I actually spent 5 months last year entirely rewriting something I first attempted at 15, and that was really amazing --- seeing this story idea develop and shift from its initially terrible execution into something both my fifteen-year-old self and I can now be proud of.
