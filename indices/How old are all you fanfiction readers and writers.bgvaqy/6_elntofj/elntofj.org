Well, now i am 17 so not such a big age gap, but when i started i was 13 or less so it depends. Now, any fandom has a specific age range. I mean, you can read HP fanfiction until you reach the fifties but most readers are the few loyals that have caught the very release of the books and are still inyerested and up to the youngest.
