[[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/7435103][Dragonheart Caravan]] by Witchdragon

5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him?

Harry is adopted by a gypsy family and travels the world but he still goes to Hogwarts at 11. There are a few warnings so pay attention to them but this is a truly awesome fic and worth reading.
