Not quite a match, but my fic linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) is starting on a Dursley partial-redemption sub-plot. It's been hinted at in previous chapters and I'm going all-in with the next chapter that's like 95% finished.

Spoilers for the next chapter, which will be out pretty soon: The Dursleys visit Hogwarts as part of a good-but-manipulative Dumbledore plot. Petunia gets a wakeup call; she's still a bitch, but she's a self-aware bitch that wants to change because Lily pulled a power-of-love move from the grave. Dudley is stupid still, but willingly took a step towards mending his relationship with Harry. And Vernon accidentally invoked Dobby's ire, which will give him a healthy respect for (read: fear of) magic. Also Dragon!Harry threatens to eat Vernon, so... yeah.

As for your other points:

1. Even with the Dursleys having been cruel (and not even that much crueler than canon), I'm not bashing them. I don't like bashfics and I'll never bash any character.
2. Harry /is/ strong for obvious reasons, but he's no more magically gifted than a slightly-above-average second year. And he doesn't solve problems, he makes them! Like the goblin rebellion he accidentally started. Or nearly driving Hogwarts to Bankruptcy.
3. Future Harry after one day in politics: "Which ministry wizard should I eat first?" And Harry after day two: "Ugh! Umbridge gave me indigestion...." So, yeah, politics!Harry is not happening.
4. Harry is /distinctly/ a young man. He is also a dragon, and that's OK (ha!).
5. Sirius has his own background plot going on. It doesn't involve Harry except accidentally.
6. Yes.
