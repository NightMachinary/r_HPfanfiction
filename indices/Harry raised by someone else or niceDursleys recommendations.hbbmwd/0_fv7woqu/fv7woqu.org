- /A Different Future/ - Sorry if there's bashing, it's been so long since I've read it I honestly can't remember if there is bashing. Harry left on the doorstep of a church by the Dursleys, is found by Romani(gypsies), and adopted by them. Unfortunately, it's incomplete and appears to be abandoned.

- /A Better Man/ by Valandar - A sort of "Peggy-Sue/For the Want of a Nail" fic centered around one thing. After the war, Vernon Dursley dies. In Hell, the full scope of his transgressions is revealed to him with the knowledge that what he did was wrong, but he's offered a chance at redemption when Harry utters the words, "I wish you were *a better man*." It's not your typical peggy sue fic, where people go back in time with full knowledge of the future. This is one where Vernon is sent back to live his life again, and at a crucial moment, is shifted onto a different path.

- /Blue Magic/ by Tellur - A crossover with the /Mass Effect/ universe, which has Harry rescued from Dudley during a game of "Harry Hunting" a few years before he was due to start at Hogwarts. There is a sort of bashing here, but it's of the wizarding world in general, and Dumbledore doing his best in a deeply flawed system. Again, this appears to be abandoned. it got an update last year, but before that it went 4 years without an update.

- /Harry McGonagall/ by witowsmp - After observing the Dursleys all day, and deciding that they're completely unsuitable as guardians for Harry Potter, She takes him to be raised by her relatives in America. I can't remember if there's any bashing in this one. It's been a while since I've read it.
