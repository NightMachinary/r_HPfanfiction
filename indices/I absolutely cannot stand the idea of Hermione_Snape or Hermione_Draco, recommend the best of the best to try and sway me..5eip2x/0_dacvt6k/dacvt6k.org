The Fallout by everythursday is WONDERFUL. For fluff The Politicians Wife (sorry, forgot author!) is also fantastic.

EDIT:

I just thought of this, but if you want Draco/Hermione and Snape/Hermione, [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=14][The Fool, The Emperor, and the Hanged Man by ianthe_waiting]] has both, and I found it an enjoyable read. It might not be everyone's cup of tea though.
