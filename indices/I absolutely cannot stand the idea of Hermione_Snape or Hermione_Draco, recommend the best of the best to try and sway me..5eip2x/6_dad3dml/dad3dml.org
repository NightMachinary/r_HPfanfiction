These first two are what popped my SS/HG cherry and got me hooked:

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20151115140920/http://www.witchfics.org/abby/tosod.html][The Other Side of Darkness]] by Abby. Still my favorite to this day. After a strange potion renders one of Harry's coworkers catatonic, Hermione must ask Snape for help identifying it...but he knows more than he is letting on.

And its equally superb sequel called [[https://web.archive.org/web/30151115140856/http://www.witchfics.org/abby/survival.html][Survivals and Remembrances]] where Lucius seeks revenge on Snape by blackmailing him against Hermione.

I prefer my Hermione strong willed and independent. Naturally, there are some fics that depict an abusive relationship, but I don't feel those do either character justice. These two stories I linked are the perfect example of how I imagine these two complex, flawed humans.
