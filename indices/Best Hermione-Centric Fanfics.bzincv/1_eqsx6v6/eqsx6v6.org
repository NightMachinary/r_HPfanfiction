There's linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) and its sequel /Lady Archimedes/. You probably know it already, it gets recommended quite a bit.

You might like linkffn(The Morrigan by adriata) which is a Slytherin!Hermione fic with some twists.

[[/r/HPfanfiction]]'s very own [[/u/AchilleTalon]] wrote linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) and that certainly features a strong Hermione.

Less of a 'Strong Hermione' fic since its in her younger years at Hogwarts, but linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew) might also interest you.
