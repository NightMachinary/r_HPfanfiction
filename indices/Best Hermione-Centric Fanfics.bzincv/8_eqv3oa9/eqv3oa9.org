Reign of the Serpent. It's a MASSIVE AU... seriously, the wizarding world is VERY different from canon... and it has a bit of an ensemble cast. But Hermione's definitely the main protagonist; she's the POV character for most of the early chapters, and the one through whom we learn about the world... and throughout, Hermione's the one with the big agenda, the one intent on fighting a corrupt system. Plus, it's just a really good story.
