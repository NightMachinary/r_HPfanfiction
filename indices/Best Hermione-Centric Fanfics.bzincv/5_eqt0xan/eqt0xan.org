My favorite is definitely linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthology, or by jacobk). Another good one is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] which is a Muggle AU, James Bond style world where Hogwarts is a school for spies. Hermione does a lot of butt kicking in this one :)

Linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) is a Snape/Hermione fic, but there is time travel involved, and not the way most fics do it. Hermione is quite kick ass in this one, and also in linkffn(The Young Adventurer's Club) which again features Snape/Hermione, but with unconventional time travel and an interesting plot.
