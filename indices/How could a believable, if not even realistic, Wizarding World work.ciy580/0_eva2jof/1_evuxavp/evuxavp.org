Prosecution of witchcraft was at its most rabied when Western imperialism started to take off, especially since Christianity was such a huge part of it. Maybe they felt that taking part in such political activity would draw undue attention to the Wizarding World, and therefore decided to keep to themselves. The same empires that were taking over the world were also burning witches en masse, and I don't see why witches and wizards would feel any loyalty or patriotism towards them.
