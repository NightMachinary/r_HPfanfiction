Small countries probably wouldn't have corresponding magical ones as it would be impractical. So magical Luxemburg wouldn't be a thing, and it'd be part of magical Prussia or something. There's a good chance that the duke of magical France didn't get caught in the French Revolution and there's still one ruling magical France today. Same with whoever worked with the Russian Tsars, the commies probably wouldn't have accepted the wizards in their countries and as such wouldn't have even known about them. The magical Ottoman Empire might still be a thing. There's also a chance that Native Americans might have their own independent nations.

Read linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution; Divided and Entwined; Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider; Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis) for where I got these ideas from.
