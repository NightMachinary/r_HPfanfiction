I would think that international borders would either be very different from modern muggle borders, or there must be some internal force which requires wizarding borders to match the borders of muggle countries (perhaps as a clause in the statute of secrecy, on the logic that it will prevent the wizarding and muggle worlds from drifting too far apart).

If the borders are different, it would lead to wondering how they are different. Presumably they would have stayed roughly similar up until 1689, and then you have a few generations of wizards with lingering sympathies, loyalties, and connections to the muggle nations. And consider that Dumbledore died at 115, and was in seemingly good physical and mental health. Someone works at the Ministry who remembers proctoring Dumbledore's exams. That means they must have been a reasonably experienced witch/wizards by the time Dumbledore was around 17. Surely proctoring exams isn't something you stroll straight into from school, so she must have been in her 20's at least by that point and was still going strong in 1995.

So those generations with connections to the muggle world will have been in influence for...a long time. I'd guess the century following the statute coming in, wizards would have likely continued to conform to muggle international politics, at least in part. So it would be...the time of Empire building that they really started to differ on that logic. Maybe because wizards decided not to participate? Could that be because the factors that made colonial areas good targets for western nations don't apply to the magical world? Indeed, the things that make having colonies valuable don't apply to wizards particularly. It'd just be an expensive point of pride.

Can't continue this line of thought now, but I might come back to it later and continue the thought experiment.
