There is one big inherent problem with making the wizarding world believable in JK's universe. Muggleborns.

The existence of Muggleborns makes the Statute of Secrecy inherently stupid and impossible to uphold without significant and severe authoritarianism.

So you'd have to start by either having Magic known about by Muggles, or get rid of Muggleborns.
