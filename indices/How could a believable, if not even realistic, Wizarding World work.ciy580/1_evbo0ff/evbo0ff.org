There'd be no muggles in such world. Magic is an inherent evolutionary advantage, even if we assume it appeared only during the time of first civilizations being created it would give the magicals the opportunity to breed the non-magicality out of humanity's gene pool. After all a magical/muggle relation is likely to result in magical child, and i kinda don't believe people with power to manipulate minds and hearts of others would never come up with that one guy that wanted to one-up Genghis-Khan in terms of amount of descendants.
