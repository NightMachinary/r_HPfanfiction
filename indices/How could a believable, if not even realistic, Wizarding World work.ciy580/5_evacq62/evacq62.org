The specific concerns you list are not necessarily as hard to work around as you think. CCTV was beginning to become widespread in the 90s, but provided wizards avoided police stations, other government buildings, and major public transport hubs they should be able to work around it - assuming that they know to do so. That Kings Cross works normally on September the 1st indicates that enough of them /do/ know to do so. CCTV wouldn't become a really significant impediment until the mid 2000s when it began to be seriously networked and automation started to come in, and it became very widespread.

Bulgaria existed as an independent entity a couple of times in the pre-modern era, and under Ottoman rule they were found to be useful rebels by the Austro-Hungarian empire several times in the 1680s. You can just say that one of those revolts did rather well in the magical world, or that magical Bulgaria remained independent when the non-magical peoples were absorbed into the Ottoman empire in the 13th century.

Arthur is ignorant of /some/ technology and cultural artefacts but not of muggles per se. Remember, he managed to enchant a car, and he presumably did so with the intention of using it.

The language is kept comprehensible because of muggle-born "immigration", continuing relations between wizards and their muggle relatives, and social and business contact between the two groups. The statute of secrecy is about /secrecy/, not /segregation/.

Yes, we don't see much of that inter-community interaction in the books, and we see some people who want segregation, but the books make no attempt to show us all of magical society. You can wriggle around a lot of the problems with the books if you take them as being primarily the viewpoint of one sheltered child who has very few friends, experiencing events that are unusual (unusual both for us readers and for the society he lives in), and with other unreliable narrators who have agendas of their own.
