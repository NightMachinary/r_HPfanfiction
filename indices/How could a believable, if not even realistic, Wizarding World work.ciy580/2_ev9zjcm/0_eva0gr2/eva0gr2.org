I mean think of the mechanics of it. Either slavery was compelled by Some kind of magic or it would be highly impractical. Harry accidentally apparates before he even turns 11. Accidental magic even among untrained withches and wizards would make their work unpredictable and less useful.

Add to that the fact that House Elves exist. At least inside the house, a large portion of the slave role has already been filled.

Finally Wizards seem to place value far less in labor and far more in skill. There isn't a whole lot of nonmagical stuff that wizards struggle to acquire.
