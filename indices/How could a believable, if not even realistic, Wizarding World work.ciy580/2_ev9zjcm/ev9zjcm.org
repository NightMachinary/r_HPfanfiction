Look the historical thing that bothers me the most is slavery.

Did it not exist in JK's world? What about muggleborns who were born into slavery? Was there a specific group who stole muggleborn kids born into slavery, were they freed or made into slaves for other wizards and witches?

When the colonisation of India, Africa, America, Australia etc happened did the wizards and witches not fight back to keep their countries and people's safe?

Racism doesn't seem to be a thing in her world so it can't be our world because so much shit happened in our histories that boils down to â€˜This persons skin makes then subhuman'

Trying to write a history of the American Colonies tied in with the wizarding world just doesn't work unless you remove slavery from the equation and that drastically changes the world setting
