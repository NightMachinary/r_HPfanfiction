About muggleborn slaves/serf: If you mean New World slavery, then most likely. Elsewhere around the world it was more institutionised, so it would not be that big of a deal. An idea: a peasant kid (a serf) who was found by a wizard to possess magic is taken away and his death statged (a transfigured dog or something, let's say he drowned in a well). That could be one explanation.

As to magic on other continents. Here, you have a carte blanche. We literally know very little. It could be that Africa never had an organized magical world. China, India and the rest of the Far East could be even more removed from their muggle counterparts as the European muggles etc.

There are logical ways to explain all of that, but it to make it consistent would be a very large hassle.
