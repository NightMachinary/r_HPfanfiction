"buy" their freedom? You're a wizard! Use your wand!

For the Statute of Secrecy to remain in existence during the period of the slave trade, either Wizards would have needed to be actively complicit in maintaining slavery (i.e stopping the magical born children of slaves from interfering in slavery) despite having no support for it themselves and knowing it's morally evil and having the ability with magic to end it in an afternoon, or every muggleborn from a slave family would have to be a sociopath content to abandon their family and never, even as an adult, try to help them.
