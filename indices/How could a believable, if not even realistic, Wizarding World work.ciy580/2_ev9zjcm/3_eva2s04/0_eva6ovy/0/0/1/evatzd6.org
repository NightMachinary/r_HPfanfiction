Better than staying slaves. Families getting seperate wasn't exactly an unexpected thing with slavery. I guess they could eventually try to free their families but idk if the magical government would allocate enough funding to buy freedom for an entire family for each enslaved muggleborn. That's kinda idealistic, if the government of wizarding Britain around 1995 is any indication for the integrity of the usual magical government then I'd expect tons of corruption from the rich old purebloods who have house elves and don't particularly care about mudbloods.
