They couldn't have allowed any major interference without getting serious trouble from international politics. That applies to any kind of interference that couldn't be explained away without magic. If someone did something which could've made people think about magic and endangered secrecy, there would've been an international team of obliviators coming in, undoing everything and arresting the one responsible immediately, no matter the circumstances. Wizards would do tons of subtle things to help, but nothing major as it'd be undone anyway. International politics would justify it as necessary for the continued survival of wizards around the world.

Let's not forget that a lot of rich and influential wizards don't give a damn about filthy muggles and mudbloods suffering. They'd do anything to secure secrecy as a world without secrecy would be a lot more trouble for them.

Secrecy is a really big deal for wizards around the world. Even Voldemort didn't dare any attacks on muggles that couldn't be explained away as hurricanes or engineering failures because he didn't want a situation where every single wizarding nation around the world declares war on him, which would happen if he broke secrecy.
