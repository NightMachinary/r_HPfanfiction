When was the magical world ever lighthearted or perfectly moral? The government is corrupt, magic nazis walk free if they've got money, nobody really cares about muggles that much (nobody tells them when their children are petrified?), and when the government starts rounding up the mudbloods most of the population just goes along with it. The magical world is just as bad as the nonmagical one. Corrupt and nobody gives a damn about foreigners, at least not enough for the government to do anything.
