Besides, you are a muggle born wizard with some ambition, imagine how easy it would be to become rich? Impersonate a millionaire, imperio and obliviate his bank manager, show up in Gringotts with a (shrunk) trunk full of sterling and gold (goblins ask no questions), et voila! Rich wizard, fresh out of Hogwarts. The insider info you could get before corporate quarterly earnings, maybe steal IP, spy for the government for immunity, mind boggling...

Then you buy dark books through intermediaries, get a fine, heavily warded mansion, finance elections... sky's the limit, mudblood or not.

In fact, this is turning into a prompt for a fanfiction, isn't it?
