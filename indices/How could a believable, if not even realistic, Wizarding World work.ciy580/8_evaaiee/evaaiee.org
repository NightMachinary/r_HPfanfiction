One issue I have is the PM being informed by the Minister of Magic of magical affairs and just being passive about it.

There is no way they would not have located, recruited, researched on and prepared against enemy wizards. What if a rival nation has a powerful group of hit wizards aimed at the UK government? These are people that can apparate, impersonate, turn to animals, paralyze, mind control... Too great an opportunity to pass, too dangerous to ignore. They would have magical MI-6 operatives. Goblins would be warding all sensitive government facilities, and get paid way more that the tiny magical community can afford.

And dark lords going after muggle born wizards that don't ask their muggle government for protection? They just die?
