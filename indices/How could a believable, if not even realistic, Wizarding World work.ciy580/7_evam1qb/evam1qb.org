In the case of Arthur Weasley, I don't think his "ignorance" is a problem in itself. The work of Arthur, and of the "Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office" seem to be very simple : Someone jinxed a muggle artifact, they are called on the crime scene to "collect" it. The arrest of the wizard who did it seem to be left to the Magical Law Enforcement, and I think even the Oblivaton of the Muggle victims is handled by another department.

So, to do his job, Arthur only need to be able to identify a jinxed item (I do say jinxed because I think a cursed one is already above is paycheck and dealed by Aurors and/or Curse Breakers), considering the magic "leave traces", even someone with absolutely no knowledge of the Muggle World should potentially be able to do it.\\
Add at this that most of the Jinxed items which are mentioned in canon are items used in both world (dissapearing keys, bitting doorknobs . . .) and it makes it even simpler for a pureblood to do.

​

I would also like to mention that, even if it doesn't like this, Arthur Weasley is rather knowledgable of the Muggle World for a Pureblood. He knows, for example, enough about a car to enchant it without making it obvious, and is able to drive it the Muggle way, I doubt most pureblood could do this.\\
Also, the Muggles things Arthur ask about are always very particular things :

- In CoS, he asks Harry what rubber ducks are used for : they are useless (if you forget about the "special" use a kinda sheltered 12 years boy like Harry should not know about)
- In GoF, he has trouble starting a fire with matches : he is a wizard who learnt how to ignite things in 1st year like everyone else, matches are inferior to a wand.
- In OotP, he doesn't know how to use the subway : why would he even use the subway. The closest thing to the subway for a wizard should be the "floo network", which is already far superior to subway. He also has several ways to teleport, and even a magic car or a broom should he want to go slower. A wizard would never be forced to use the floo, basically all their method of travels are faster and/or more confortable than it.

​

All the Muggle things he doesn't know about are things that are not only specific, but things a wizard would never encounter in his life. So the fact that he doesn't know about it doesn't bother me and I think he can easily do his job even without knowing this.\\
If I had to make a comparison, Arthur is a bit like a specialist doctor : if you go to a podiatrist complaining about your eyes, the guys will tell you he has no idea how to help you and direct you toward another doctor, does it make him a bad doctor? The difference is that Arthur loves everything about the Muggles and will try to learn things even outside of what is concerned by his work.
