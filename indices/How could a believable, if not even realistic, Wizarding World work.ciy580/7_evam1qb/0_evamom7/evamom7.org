I have to disagree on all the points. Arthur Weasley is an intelligent, competent wizard, but in the books he's a moron. You mentioned him not being able to use the subway... as far as I remember he could not use muggle money. How can somebody be involved with muggles in his daily job and not know what a paper pound looks like? It doesn't make any sense.

As to the rubber duck thing, that might just be curiosity and a bit of naiveity. From a wizard's perspective it might be a bit silly.

The matches... Perhaps. I could see a sheltered wizard not understanding them, but not someone who deals with muggle artifacts for a living. I'm sure he handled lots of matches in his career. It's one of the reasons why I even started this thread, since most of muggle/wizard interactions in canon make no sense.

So, no I would not agree, and I don't think your analogy with the specialist doctor works, or even makes sense. If I were to expand on it, it would be like going to a neurosurgeon for advice and him not knowing what flu is.
