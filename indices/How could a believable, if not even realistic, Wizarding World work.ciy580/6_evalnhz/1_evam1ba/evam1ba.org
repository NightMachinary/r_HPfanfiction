It does, it's a nice AU (that's really fucked up) but it doesn't really touch upon the Wizarding World being a believable entity in the 20th century. Though it does try at least (the experimentation, the anti-wizard weapons, then the muggle help with Gringotts)... but it only affects the main characters and not really the world building

There are very few stories that attempt even this level of complexity.
