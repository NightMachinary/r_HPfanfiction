Hello! Allow me to introduce you to the lovely and heart-breaking works of The Divine Comedian, whose stories are brilliant and funny and very, very sad. Her bio page on FFnet literally has a note that says, "I love the characters I'm borrowing. However, terrible things tend to happen to them in my fics. Assume that no-one is safe."
