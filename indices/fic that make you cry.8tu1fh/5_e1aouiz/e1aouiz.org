There's a scene that is quite emotional in linkffn(Whispers in th NIght) after Harry falls down because of the dementors during Quidditch.

I also cried like a baby in linkffn(Yellow Submarine; The Beast Within) , Submarine because that's a fucked up fic and Ginny and Harry have serious issues. TBW because of the scene where Harry is listening to Imagine Dragons (there's a "cover" story behind this) after Greyback's attack on Hogwarts (its AU, third year)
