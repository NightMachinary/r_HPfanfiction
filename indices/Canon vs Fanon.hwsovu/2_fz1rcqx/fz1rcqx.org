  I like when fan fiction steps away from canon especially canon that I hate.

This sub is pretty likeminded, so while most might like deviation from the canon they hate, they do enjoy a lot of what makes up canon if the survey is anything to go by. We all dislike different things about canon and, as Hellstrike said, we all have different rules from can and can't be broken in fan fiction.

Daphne is interesting. I think most here like Daphne, which has a lot to do with the fact that she's usually written as anywhere from nice to Hermione to up her ass. I've never seen HP/DG where Hermione is against it because of the bits of info JKR gave us.
