I have pretty much never seen a story get considerable hate just because it drifted away from canon. Also the sentence

#+begin_quote
  Like for example Harry/Daphne ships get some hate because Daphne may as well be an oc
#+end_quote

doesn't make sense as an example in this argument. If a fic with Harry/Daphne pairing gets hate, I don't think it's because practically OC character is somehow OOC
