Sorry, as I said I kinda jumbled through the second half of the post because I forgot what I was trying to say exactly. As for Harry/Daphne I primarily used that as the example because because of the few posts I'd read the past week, hate might've been too strong a word. I guess the point I was trying to make is its fanfiction what does it matter if someone strays too far from canon. I'm not the best at typing out what I'm trying to say and I want to avoid the whole “if you don't like it don't read it” argument.
