I made a start, and I'll congratulate you on writing so much.

I'm struggling, though, with what feels like a very OOC Malfoy family. Narcissa befriending the Bloodstones because their power could be useful, I could easily see. Narcissa befriending them against her husband's wishes because of female solidarity with a woman who ran off with a political nobody - no, that doesn't sound like her. And Lucius of canon is the type for ice-cold revenge, not such revealing displays.
