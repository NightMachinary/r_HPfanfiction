I need to add to this, to point out that her befriending the malfoys was necessary for the plot to advance, and I actually had two versions of this story, one where they go a completely different route and I got halted on a standstill because everything was...uh... weird. The other version had the Malfoys being killed off entirely, because some death eater told Voldemort that Lucius was going to betray them, and so Voldemort offed them but it was Draco who was left spared because Dobby took him "somewhere safe", it was a totally alternative timeline with diferent outcomes that I couldn't seem to finish.
