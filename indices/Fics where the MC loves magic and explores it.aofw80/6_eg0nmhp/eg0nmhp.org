linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has quite a few scenes where Harry, Draco and Hermione experiment with magic.

linkffn(Significant Digits) is a continuation of HPMoR where Harry runs a hospital/research lab. More transfiguration exploits with the Philosopher's Stone and magical space travel.

linkffn(The Arithmancer) has Hermione doing a lot of spellcrafting and inventing things. She even (almost) gets the magical equivalent of a nobel prize for proving that radioactive materials cannot be transfigured. Later on they use a lot of her spells against Voldemort.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) has Harry invent all kinds of Runic devices. Communicators, portkey trackers, magic beams.
