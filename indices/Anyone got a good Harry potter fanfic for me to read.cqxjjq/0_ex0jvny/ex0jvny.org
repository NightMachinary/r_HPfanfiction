There is [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/htmlview?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app][a list of most recommended fics]] on this sub from 2011 to 2018.

There is also [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/][a HPFanfiction Recommender]] that lets you search for more recent popular fics and authors.

Some of the top ones over the years:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is totally hilarious. No romance, although 'Harry' capitulates in the end to Ginny's unrequited 'love'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]], linkffn(11191235), is still in Year 3. No romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my favorite postwar fic. Harry, betrayed again by the establishment, declared war on the Ministry and Wizengamot. No romance, but implied Harry/Hermione/Ron pairing (confirmed by the author in PM).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is a great dimensional travel. Badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a new, very different world during a mission. Highly emotional, no romance, but readers can imagine Harry and Hermione getting together after the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is a dark war epic in an extreme AU. It's one of the very few fics that has Harry raised by his own parents, but he actually turns out to be a lot more vicious than in canon. Harry has some romance early on, but later his relationship with his wife has almost degenerated into political maneuverings.
