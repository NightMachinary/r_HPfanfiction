Linkffn(Wolf Lord, The odds were never in my favor, All according to plan, Make-A-wish, Bungle in the Jungle, Bureaucratic Error)

There is a set for you, in order: A werewolf Harry without the Alpha/Omega/Mpreg BS. A fem!Harry AU with some excellent World Building, A Bellatrix Black sent forward in time by the personification of Chaos. A true classic of Harry saying fuck it and running away only to wind up fixing everything/causing havoc where ever he goes. The same initial concept but going with Bill to Brazil. Finally, Remus waking up after the Battle of Hogwarts at the start of third year.
