Diffrence is that muggleborns were coming in and no one helped them adjust and when they did it was in a cringe Syltherin way like you musn't be human and show emotion no you must be rich and have nice clothes. Wizards discrimating agaisnt people who have no control over who they are is dumb as shit. Like the fic in question made me lose repsect for so many charcters like Hermoine as she was arguing a valid point like enslaving elves is wrong jus cuz you like doing something doesn't mean you don't deserve rights and payment. But the author was like lol no they like doing it so it's fine to enslave an entire race ha. People have no qualms with goblin being indepdent so why not elves. Another thing was making it so impressive that a pureblood talked to a muggleborn and it's alwasy Hermoine and there excuse is always 'she's smart so in the future she'll be a good ally' so you're saying someone needs to have something in order for them to be useful and eligible to be your freind. If that isn't the most shallow thing I've ever heard. In the canon (I know it's a fic so I take it with a grain of salt when comparing) all the muggleborns we encouter are jsut normal nice people who don't bother anyone yet all the purebloods who still care about blood literally are the villains.

For your last point honestly no I wouldn't as in our society I understand the hatred i've felt towards white people for killing and enslaving people like me only to realise that almost everyone I encouter isn't like that at all. It would work vice versa also with muggles hating wizards for a plethra of things and yeah muggles probably started it first but now they no nothing of magic and yet people still hate them and muggleborns liek how ignorant must you be to realise how dumb that is.
