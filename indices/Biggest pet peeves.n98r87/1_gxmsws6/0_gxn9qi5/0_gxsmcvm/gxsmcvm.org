Okay so two things with that. First of please break up your sentences more and work on punctuation because the run on sentences physically hurt to read. Secondly, I think the trope of blood supremacy and the dislike of muggleborns being due to them not following customs and culture has some merit. People look at the Wizarding world and immediately think that it is backwards and compare it to other periods in muggle history but at the end of the day the Wizarding world is a completely separate entity.

Harry's lack of knowledge of the Wizarding world gives us a view of it that doesn't include any positives or big differences, whether that is a writing error for Rowling or intentional because of who he hangs around with is up for debate. Imagine if people immigrated to your country and then immediately began firing off about how backwards it is and attempted to change things about the culture that you and the whole population enjoy. Can't you see that causing a rift between the natives and the immigrants? This is the same thing that is happening here. I really enjoy if an author goes out of their way to change Wizarding society and give it more substance because that gives another reason for the Purebloods to have a valid excuse for disliking the muggleborns who hate the society. Now I'm not condoning the Blood Purist agenda or arguing the Death Eaters are in the right to torture, kill, and rape because they obviously aren't but it gives Voldemort a better way of recruiting and helps reinforce why he rose up so easily in the first place.

That along with the way Christianity and other monotheistic religions led to so much negatively and animosity towards and magic users or magical society in general gives great insight to why muggles and muggleborns are hated. Can you honestly say that if you were a wizard or witch you wouldn't feel anger reading and studying up on the way that people would be dragged through the streets drowned, stoned, or burnt at the stake just because they have magic. Yeah flame freezing charms are a thing but what about the children who experienced accidental magic or the people who were caught away from their wands. Or give thought to the fact that flame freezing charms were probably made for the purpose of trying to save those who were being burnt at the stake, along with other magics.
