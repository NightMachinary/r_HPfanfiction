I was reading a !Slytherin Harry fic inspired me to write this post cuz it was so bad like If you're into that stuff fine but they actually made up points to make Voldemort and Slytherins less bad like they changed it from we want rid of all muggle-borns and anyone with muggle connection to muggle-borns disrespect our culture even though it would be impossible for them not to and we don't like them cuz their insensitive never mind the fact the authors new logic made less sense. NOt only was it preaching this exclusive open narrow mindedness nonsense that sounded like EDL members who complain about Muslims coming to 'their country' stealing jobs and not integrating with everyone else. I was going to leave a comment but I don't think I could contain how much I wanted to say. The worst part was the actual customs were so dumb and archaic yet they had Hermoine probably the last witch on earth who would ever conform to dumb stuff like that plus it had the super powerful Harry which was the biggest turnoff ever like he's 12 stop making him study and read ahead and get all O's being a perfect student like how is that fun
