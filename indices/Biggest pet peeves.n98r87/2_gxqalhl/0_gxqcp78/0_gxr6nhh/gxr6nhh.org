That's what I'm trying for my Harry/Ron fic. It'll have a lot of canon characters that are queer. Early on it focuses on Harry and Ron's developing relationship, with rocky bits and confusion because Harry doesn't understand that he's bisexual. Ron doesn't want to push him because he doesn't know if Harry reciprocates those feelings. It takes a burst of accidental magic for him to realize the feeling he has about Ron is romantic in nature.
