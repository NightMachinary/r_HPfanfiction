Okay, I like slash and femslash. I love queer fics because that's what I am.

But I'm tired of finding fics where gay couples (specifically gay men) are portrayed as one being overly aggressive and dominating, and they other overly submissive and effeminate. It is really awkward and sometimes comes across as rapey.
