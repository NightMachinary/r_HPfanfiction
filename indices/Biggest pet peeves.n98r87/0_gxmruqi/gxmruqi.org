Bashing.\\
If there is bashing, I am out without a second thought. I am not wasting my time on a fic with such low-quality writing.

Hint to any author out there: If you are writing a 'bash-character' then just don't write the character in the first place. It is literally just a drain on the story and is clearly just there for the author to get off on.
