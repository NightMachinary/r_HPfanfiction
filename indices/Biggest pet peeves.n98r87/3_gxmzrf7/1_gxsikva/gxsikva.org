Most of the other stories using that as a justification for a harem /will/ feature other group marriages. Neville and some combo of Susan Bones/Hannah Abbot/Luna Lovegood being one of the more common. Daft Morons has Susan and Hannah deciding they're a package deal at a young age, and eventually selecting Neville as their guy. I just read a Haphne story where NL/SB/LL is a triad marriage, and Harry is monogamous.

While I do like Xianxia, I have to agree with you that a lot of the harems really don't do a good job of keeping the members interesting or relevant after they join.
