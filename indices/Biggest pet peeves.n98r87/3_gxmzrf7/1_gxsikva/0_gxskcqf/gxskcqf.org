I would say that Neville (who is usually raised to Harry best friend/ follower in this kind of stories) does not really count since Neville is so close to Harry. It's less "Harem is a normal thing in the Magical World", and more "He is with me so he gets his own Harem".\\
It's comparable to the problem I have with a lot of "Lordship" fics: Harry is not the only person in the magical world with a brain. If a 12 years old can find a loophole in the law that let him have several lordship and a total control over the Wizengamot avec reading 2 law books, then several other people should also have figured it.

I may dislike "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" for a variety of reasons, but at least the story does a good job at introducing Harem. By showing that "Random Lord NÂ°45" does have his own Harem despite being mostly irrevelant to the story, it demonstrates that Harems are an integrate part of the Wizarding Culture, though one that is rather frown upon.
