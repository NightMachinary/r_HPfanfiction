Even fantasy stories need realism, it's just that the realism needs to fit the rules of that particular fantasy world.

The /Malazan Book of the Fallen/ and /TheLord of the Rings/ are both fantasy but it would be unrealistic for Gandalf to start chucking Moranth munitions of the walls of Helm Hammerhand just like it would be unrealistic to have the Bridgeburners teaming up with dwarves to eliminate invading goblins.
