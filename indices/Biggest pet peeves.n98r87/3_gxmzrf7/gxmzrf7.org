It is usually announced at the start of the fic, which means that it's less about losing interest and more about never having any, but I can't stand Harem.

From the start, I have never been a fan of Harem. The stories that use Harem (such as all the Xianxia or Wuxia) tend to be full of tropes that I dislike, such as the Female Character that lose all personality and development the moment she joins the harem, or the MC being more focused on his next target (sorry "love") than on the actual plot.

But I hate it even more in HP because the universe is clearly not made for Harem. If Harem is truly that common in the Magical World (like the "he needs one girl by Noble House" that is often used in Lordship! stories), then why the hell is Harry the only one with a Harem. And if Harem is not a cultural thing, then why the hell is nobody reacting to Harry having a harem? I know it's a bit stupid to talk about "realism" in a fantasy story, but is there anything less believable than two 14 years old girls saying "/We decided to share you/"? And that's only with 2 girls, most of the Harem story seem to have between 4 and every named girls as part of Harry's harem (which would clearly not create a demographic problem in the next generation when most children would be sibling).

Outside of that, I also dislike any fic that advertise an "improved Harry", because most of them just make Harry an unlikable ass while giving him a Harem.
