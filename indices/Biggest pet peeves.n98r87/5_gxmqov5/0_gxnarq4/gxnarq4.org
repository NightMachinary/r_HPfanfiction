I like when romance is a side piece of a story that takes up chapters where nothing should be happening then it switches back to the story such as this crossover fic I've been reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18043160/chapters/48826937]]

the actual romance doesn't overshadow the action and I love that.

The potter vault I'm either or sometimes it can be meh I'll just skip it and it's like it was never there but sometimes it takes the mic. I also have read the accidental animagus and yeah it was trash like really bad just completely ignore everything about how animagi work love that and conveniently end up at the grangers
