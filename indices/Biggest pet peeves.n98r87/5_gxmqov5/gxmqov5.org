1. Dan and Emma Granger. The moment those names pop up, my interest in the story evaporates very quickly. Only one of the stories with those names that I have encountered (The Accidental Animagus) was almost bearable, but it turned out to be so boring that I gave up at chapter 10 or so.

2. "There has to be a Potter Family Vault, not just the Trust Vault you've been using." Seriously, what is the need to make Harry richer than he is in canon? Especially since we don't know for sure how rich he is. You can make him a multi-millionaire without going against canon, and I can't even imagine any plot reasons he would need to be richer than that.

3. Rituals and other excuses to make characters more powerful. I'm currently reading New Blood, and one unique thing in its worldbuilding is that witchcraft is a different branch of magic from wizardry, and it's based on rituals that make its practitioners much more powerful. For some unexplained reason witchcraft is rare and frowned upon, and for some other unexplained reason most magical people don't even know about it. Then Hermione starts practicing it, and wow, amazing super-powers are unlocked! At the moment I'm considering stopping reading the story, but also because it has become increasingly boring.

4. Mary Sues and author self-inserts/mouthpieces are bad. Another major annoyance in New Blood.

5. Too much focus on romance. All story elements need drama and tension to be interesting. Many fanfiction writers seem to like their characters on a lovely honeymoon (probably a personal fantasy), but it's something I have grown absolutely tired with. As a side plot romance can be interesting, but such stories are so rare that I try to avoid stories with romance altogether.

6. Filler. I get it that when a fanfiction writer gets constant good feedback on their chapters, they are tempted to write more, even if the result is chapters that are unnecessary to the plot and character development. A Cadmean Victory is a story with probably two thirds of the text just filler, and it earned its place as my least favourite story I have finished reading.
