I don't mind most of what you have here, but Emma is one of my peeves. Somehow, I have a real problem with a woman who was born in Britain in the fifties, being named Emma. I just don't see it being a thing. That being said, I know there were girls named Emma at the time, like Emma Thompson. Still, it definitely seems more like a nineties thing.

As for mouthpieces, I actually don't mind them, if the author takes time to build it up, and gives proper context. If it comes in completely from left field, it's definitely annoying.
