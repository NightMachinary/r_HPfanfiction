Of course it's okay to give a character more limits, but another vault is unnecessary. It could be a part of the vault contract between the Potter family and Gringotts that an underage person is only allowed to withdraw a small amount per year.

It is not explicitly stated that Harry couldn't have afforded to buy the Firebolt. This is the paragraph from PoA:

#+begin_quote
  Price on request ... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life --- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask for the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.

Harry just assumed the Firebolt was expensive enough to cost all the money he had in his vault, but he didn't actually know.
