I've gotten quite a few reviews on my story, which 'lamented' the fact that my Harry doesn't become a stone cold killer fast enough. And they usually leave those reviews after reading three chapters. And there's 14 chapters of story to read!

My Harry is a very kind person who has been through a lot in his life and everything he's trying to do, is about making the world a better place.

I wanted him to struggle with deliberately taking a life, regardless of whose life it is. I wanted that struggle to be a part of his development.

Now, I understand why some people don't like it, and some of the critique is perfectly justified. However the way people express their views, does not lend itself to them being heard. Be polite, and show respect, even if you don't like what others write.
