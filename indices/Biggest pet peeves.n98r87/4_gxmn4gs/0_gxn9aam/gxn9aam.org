I agree with most of what you said. However...

I think most people expect, and have no problem with accepting constructive criticism. Thing is, 90% of 'critisism' on ffn, at least, isn't criticism, but just people being assholes.

"Your Harry is an idiot."

"Your Harry should just go and kill himself."

"Your Harry is a pathetic piece of shit."

"This is crap."

"This story is crap, and the author is a retard."

When some stories get a bunch of these, then I can fully understand why authors react like the way you just described.

And to those who leave comments like these on other people's work: you're the one's who are sad and pathetic, and seem to find some kind of fulfillment in making other people feel miserable. Just shut your shithole, if you can't say something constructive.
