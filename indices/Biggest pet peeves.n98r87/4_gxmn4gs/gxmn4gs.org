I'm pretty sure no one puts that much heart in fics that they burn their house down. However my biggest pet peeve is people arguing that fanfics can be anything if the author decides so and no one has the right to say anything about it. Sure... I'm not going to stop you from writing your fantasy about Voldemort secretly being a unicorn who likes to be humped by Harry's and Fluffy's child. But if you're going to make it public, expect criticism. At the very least appreciate the fact that I found your story good enough to brave through the crappier parts. So don't give me that bullshit "It's fanfiction so I write what I want." If you want to write whatever you want without criticism just don't post it anywhere.
