- Intelligent,logical Mc(main character)+ Friends vs out of character, â€˜lets do everything wrong to make the Mc look good' everyone else in the fic.

- Half hearted, lacking confidence even well into the fic Mc's, especially when it goes against the premise of the fic

- Over the top humor/sarcasm(these fics usually contain bashing) where it is not needed or out if character to do.

- This is a slight annoyance, but when authors overestimate something like responding after 5 minutes of staring during a flowing conversation, instead of like 5 seconds.

- Mc with too many friends that have to be involved in everything MC does.

- Discontinued Stories!!!!
