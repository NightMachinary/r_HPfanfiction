What's our goal reading amount? I know book clubs are like, a book a month. But the average book is around 64k words, while this starter fic is 3-4 times that.

If there's a discussion next friday is it on the whole thing with a free-for-all on spoilers? Or will it be the first 1/4th or something?

Just trying to figure out how the pacing will go.
