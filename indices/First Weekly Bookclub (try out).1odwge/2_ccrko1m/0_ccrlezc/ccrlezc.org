This is my first time organizing a book club, so its very much in beta, plus I didn't realize it was so long (I usually drill through fics so my perception of length is probably a bit off, im already 1/4 through and started about 2 hours or so ago).

I think it should be assumed that its a free-for-all spoilers on the table for the discussion thread. Next time, depending on how this time goes, a threshold limit might need establishing. The discussion thread wont officially end till the Sunday, but then its ongoing on the sub. But thanks you've really brought up a valid point, have you done something like this before?
