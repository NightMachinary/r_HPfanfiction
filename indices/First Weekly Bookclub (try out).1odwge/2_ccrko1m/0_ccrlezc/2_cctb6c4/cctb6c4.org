I know I'm a little late to the party, but this sounds like an awesome idea! However, I definitely agree that we need to set limits on amount read. I could read fanfic all day every day but I just don't have time. But I see you've done that :)

Relatedly, it would be awesome if we could consider releasing the next week's fic on Friday (at the beginning of the weekend), or doing this bi-weekly or something. I'd love to participate, but I work 50-60 hour weeks M-F and reading something announced on Sunday by the following Friday - especially a novel-length fic - just isn't going to happen. I imagine some of the other working people on the sub feel the same way.

Also agree with setting up a poll for the next fic-of-the-week - take recs in one thread and then let people upvote or just create a surveymonkey or something and let people vote there.
