Nice! It works, thanks.

So ff.net overrides the text merely through CSS? Can you tell what do they use for the top “layer”?

p.s. You can also add [[http://www.mrtech.com/extensions/#toolkit][/MR Tech's Toolkit/]] to your instruction to help others find usercontent.css more easily. It adds several options in F→Tools→Edit My Config, among which are access points to userContent and userChrome.
