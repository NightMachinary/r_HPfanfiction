To be honest, I do some programming but I'm not really a CSS guy. But yeah, ff.net overrode the ability to select things by wrapping them in a custom container that told your browser (through CSS) it was unclickable.

IIRC, if you look through the source, the thing FF.net uses to do the job is their custom built nocopy class.
