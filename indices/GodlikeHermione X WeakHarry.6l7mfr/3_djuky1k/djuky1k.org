Canon you mean? ;) (sorry, but this kind of really strikes me as an exaggerated version of canon, not that canon didn't kind of paint her that way already! It's like she can do no wrong (or at least she's never punished for doing something bad, like the DA-Parchment-Curse, which while justified (Umbridge was after all trying to ruin their education and was threatening expulsion!) was kind of over the top, too) and is basically the best at everything (just Dumbledore and Tom Riddle are better at magic than her it seems!)...the last book already was more like "Hermione Granger and the Deathly Hollows", because frankly Harry felt like a weak, clueless and stupid tag along who couldn't do shit and relied on others to do stuff for him (or to lie for/about him etc.) and at worst die for him! Hell, he still used that stupid disarming charm in a real fight (sorry, but I'd go fully lethal in any fight to the death, disarming only happens by cutting off the wand-arm or burning it etc. - not to mention that it makes him identifiable because it's his signature move!) instead of say a reductor curse or a cutting curse or even Avada Kedavra (it's not elegant, but it sure finishes fights and it isn't easily blocked!))
