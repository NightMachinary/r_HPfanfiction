Powerful!Harry does NOT mean weak everybody else (it just means that he's the exception to the rule, but that doesn't mean that everybody else is stupid and weak and it also doesn't mean that he will pick up an abused girl/woman as his girlfriend who will be utterly dependent on him and will only say "Yes dear! How high, dear?" when asked to jump or do something for him!), femdom stuff (and powerful female characters in modern media in general) often means exactly that (look at superhero movies with female heroes - they have to put all their male counterparts to shame, don't they? They can't have a weakness? They can't be human underneath all that "I am badass"-ness etc. :( )
