1. In absolute terms, Powerful!Harry indeed does not mean Weak!everybody else; but power is relative, especially if the threat is scaled to match the new power level of the protagonist. (Where the threat is not scaled, the power-up is usually pointless in the first place.)
2. Snark aside, the point is that Powerful!Hermione/Weak!Harry (with weakness being relative) is no more inherently femdom than Powerful!Harry/Weak!Hermione (again, relatively) is inherently maledom/Gorean. If it were all about magical power differentials, the relationship between Snape's parents would be femdom, since Tobias Snape was a Muggle; and yet it clearly wasn't. For that matter, in the two fics I linked, Harry isn't submissive at all.

I do agree with you about superhero media to a point. The way I see it, we, as a culture, are still trying to sort out what to do with superheroines, especially if they appear in comics and films alongside superheroes. They have to be badass, because they are superheroines, and we can't give them the Damsel in Disstress stereotype because we believe in equality, /but/ they must also be conventionally attractive, and they can't have too many unfeminine traits or habits, either. The result is the pile-up that you describe. Something similar goes for female action protagonists in general.
