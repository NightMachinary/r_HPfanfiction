Indeed, poor Harry...his upbringing left him weak (he really doesn't assert himself often IMHO, he only defends his friends and sometimes the truth ("Voldemort really is back!"), but he never confronts others over their bad behaviour towards himself (like those badges or that heir of Slytherin stuff - IMHO he should have told Hermione and the guys at the Hogshead to "go fuck yourself" because they didn't stick up for him and believed the media over a fellow student and thus they don't deserve his training and if they die because of that, then that's Dumbledore's fault because he didn't fight tooth and nail to block Umbridge!) or tells people that, no he doesn't want to do this (Hermione her bossyness and drive to study!) right now!) to this kind of thing, but any woman who goes after him and uses that weakness is kind of despicable (and/or insecure!)
