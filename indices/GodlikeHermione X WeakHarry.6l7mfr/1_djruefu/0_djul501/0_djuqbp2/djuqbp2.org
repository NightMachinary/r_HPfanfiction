I am not sure what your point is here. You seem to be suggesting that canon Harry /is/ a submissive, which would mean that a femdom relationship may in fact be good for him. (Me, I am not sure. I don't think that he's the natural leader that fanon often portrays him as, but he certainly doesn't like taking orders.)
