One of the reasons I dislike the fanon idea of "wards" is that canonically, wizards place very little faith in fixed magical protections. With one notable exception (the Bond of Blood Charm), even with the very best protective enchantments, the best they seem to be able to achieve against a determined, resourceful wizard is delay. In the magical arms race, the state of play is somewhat like the state of castles after the introduction of the cannon: fixed defences may still have some use, but there is no such thing as an impregnable defence.

Rather, wizards place much more store in active defence, such as:

- Having a wizard at hand to actively combat enemies e.g. Kingsley protecting the PM, or Order members guarding the Department of Mysteries;

- A powerful magical creature to protect a place e.g. Fluffy (the obstacle which presented Quirrell with the greatest difficulty in PS), Voldemort's inferi in the Cave, and more generally acromantula and sphinxes;

- Curses which seek to harm intruders after entry (rather than Charms to prevent entry in the first place) e.g. the cursed Peverell ring; the potion in the Cave.

The most protected places have a combination of these: the Lestrange vault was guarded by a dragon and had the Gemino curse inside; Egyptian tombs have curses, magical traps, and magical creatures defending them.

Personally I like this piece of worldbuilding. It reflects the general principle of "the problem is, the other side has magic too" - that is, whatever magic you may set up, while it may be OP against non-magical forces, there will always be another piece of magic to get around it. When you set human creativity against static defences, human creativity will always come out on top.

So ultimately, if you want to protect something, there is no replacement for being there in person. So to return to the OP question, I doubt there are "wards" in place to protect senior Muggle figures. However, there may well be wizards assigned to their protection. Unlikely to be an Auror in normal times, as they are a valuable resource that you can't just have sitting around protecting a Muggle all day, but maybe a mid-level DMLE official.
