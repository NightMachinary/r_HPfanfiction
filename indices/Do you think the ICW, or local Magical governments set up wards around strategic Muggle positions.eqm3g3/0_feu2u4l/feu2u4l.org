I always imagined that Wizards wouldn't really care. Between conjuration, alchemy, and transfiguration you can probably get everything you need, so why go to all the effort of robbing those primitive Muggles? Apart from the few who are emotionally motivated, it seems very few Magicals are willing to put in actual effort towards any goal. Makes sense, to my mind - having magic means most things are instantaneous and you don't really have to work towards much once you know the spell for it (and we've all had the conversation about how shit Magicals are at learning Magic), so why would you do difficult things when you have an easy solution to hand?

Even if someone did go to the effort of robbing Fort Knox, why would the magicals care about it? If memory serves, their coinage is enchanted somehow, so they'd be able to tell the difference if that gold (to continue your example) was used in their world. If a Muggleborn robbed Fort Knox and took over the Muggle World - equally, why would they care? Unless they revealed magic, it's not their problem.
