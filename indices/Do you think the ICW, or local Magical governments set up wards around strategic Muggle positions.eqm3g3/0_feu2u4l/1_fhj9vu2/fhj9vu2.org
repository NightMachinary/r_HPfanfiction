Alchemie is too expensive to be of use for the larger masses. Its most likely extremely hard to find someone who can teach it, and you have to be quite powerful to make the stuff last. Transfiguration wears off after some time so its really only making life more comfortable, but you will still need a real bed if u don't want to make on on a daily basis. And stealing gold from muggles does pay off... galleons are enchanted, but the gold has to come from somewhere\\
.You can't just run around steal stuff... really. It's actually pretty dumb to believe that the muggles don't know of the magical world. There is most likely some muggle organization that keeps an eye on what is happening in the magical world so that they can prepare/adjust everything. There is a whole lot of reasons why magical can abuse their powers too much. And I think that everyone can come up with some reasons after 1-2min of brainstorming. And I also believe that there is a 'peace' between magical and muggles because magicals are useful for the environment. They can literally heal nature and so on. Muggles, on the other hand, deliver stuff like raw resources, food, wine, etc. No self-respecting wizard/witch will work in a mine, and only the oldest and richest houses can afford a house elf.\\
Well, my point is that both parties are dependent on each other in some way or another. The books didn't make it clear of course since it doesn't really matter to the main plot, but to believe that wizards don't profit from muggles and vice versa is silly. And I also bet that at least 10% of the muggle population knows of the magical world to some degree. My belief is that the leaders of the muggles 'educate' the normal folk into thinking that magic isn't real and that everything can be explained in a logical way - like... I'm actually insane and need to visit a psychiatrist.\\
Not all muggle-borns end u working in the magical world, and their parents know about magic. Nobody can really think that they don't talk. Sure, the ministry will punish everyone who breaks their laws of secrecy, but we all know how incompetent they are since most purebloods still think that muggles live in dirty wooden cottages - and these are the people who are somewhat leading the magical world.
