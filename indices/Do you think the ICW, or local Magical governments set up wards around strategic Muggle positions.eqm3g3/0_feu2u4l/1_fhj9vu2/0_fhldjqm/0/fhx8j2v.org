Ok, I admit that I'm heavily influenced by fanfictions XD sry, I think I need to re-read the original books if I want to argument with pure canon stuff.

My argument with alchemy was that it should be rathe rhard to learn since it requires knowledge in multiple subjects (potions, transfiguration... etc) I think so. So I guess that nobody really would want to learn it only to make more money.

'useful for the environment' or 'they can heal nature' I thought about druids or so. But Im not sure if they are just a product of fanon :o
