No biggie. Headcanon whatever you wanna headcanon, but canon is what canon is. Personally, I prefer mostly fanon stuff myself anyway - Rowling was great at making a world seem magic, but she wasn't good at making her world seem like a world. Flimsy AF worldbuilding, as the kids might say these days. :)

You have a point there. It is probably hard to learn, but in the same way that mechanical engineering and chemistry is. If you wanna learn to make money, you'd probably be willing to put the effort in, just like you'd probably be willing to learn chemistry if you wanted to make meth. People get into medicine for the money, and that's a nightmare of a thing to get qualified to do.

I mean, druids are a real thing. We have a whole bunch of them gather at Stonehenge here every year. No actual magic, obviously, but they're a real group with things they believe in. Modern Druidry does the whole healing the world thing, but there's a lot of evidence that older Druids from before the big decrease in the group's popularity didn't. I don't remember them ever being mentioned in canon, but I'm not overly familiar with canon either. :)
