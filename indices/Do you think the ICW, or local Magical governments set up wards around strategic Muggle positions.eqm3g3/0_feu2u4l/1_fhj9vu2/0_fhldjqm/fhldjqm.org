Impermanent Transfiguration is pure fanon, for a first point. And I don't know where you got the idea that Alchemy is expensive. I couldn't find anything on that. It's also offered as an elective at Hogwarts, implying it's possible on a student budget. And there isn't enough Gold in any one place to make a gold theft worthwhile. There's about a 30x30m cube of gold worldwide. A tenth of that is in phones and other technology circuit boards and such.

But the main point about stealing is that unless you directly steal money, you need someone to buy what you're stealing. A fence, usually. If you don't have someone willing to buy your stolen shit, then stealing doesn't get you anything beyond the shit you've stolen. Like great, you have a truckload of apple watches, or iron bars or whatever else a magical person might need. That doesn't mean you automatically get rich. You have to find either a hundred people who want an apple watch or the random required thing and sell the goods to them in a way that can't easily be tracked or find a fence who'll buy the stuff off you and sell it on themselves. Just stealing gold, assuming you can hypothetically find enough to be worthwhile, is pointless without someone to buy the gold or to print it into coinage and enchant it for validity (like faking the magical watermark on paper money). That was my point. Stealing is easy, making money off the things you've stolen is hard. There's a reason most people don't do it beyond the social contract. You need an infrastructure to move your stolen goods on, and there aren't really enough Wizards to have that. And if you were to steal and then sell it in your shop (eg. if Fortescue stole a bunch of foodstuff units and sold them in his shop) then the Ministry would presumably notice and either get you for stealing or get you for not paying proper taxation on your imports or whatever. Selling stuff legally needs paperwork. Selling stuff illegally needs legwork.

I mean, all of that is possible, I suppose, but it's all speculation based on speculative foundations. Some people know because they probably should know isn't really a sound argument. If anything, it's more likely that the Wizard's simply exert their strength whenever they want something and the Muggle governments let them do it in order to avoid being obliviated or whatever magical consequences have been stated/implied to exist in punishment for them not doing what they want. A threat is actually more effective if you don't demonstrate than if you do - the wizards just need to appear like they can punish a Muggle for talking and the threat will be effective for the majority of people.

Plus, like we see in the books themselves, Kingsley is apparently so adequately understanding of Muggles that he can fake being one without the PM noticing. The 'they're all ignorant Purebloods' thing is mostly fanon based on a few big examples like Arthur and Fudge that could just as easily be personal ignorance rather than institutional examples. Malfoy knows what a Helicopter is and its general function, for example. They're ignorant, yes, but not as ignorant as fanon insists. It's why I don't think there'd be an Organisation of Muggles keeping the secret - Organisations have paperwork and the paperless office is a total myth, so any paperwork is something a Wizard could track.

I agree that they probably import the basics into the Wizarding world from the Muggles though. But there are other nations and other species who could take the mining load and similar jobs. They could probably purchase base metals from the Goblins, for instance.

I have no idea what you mean by 'useful for the environment' or 'they can heal nature'.
