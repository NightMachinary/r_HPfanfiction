Yeah, every muggleborn with a master in potions and charms has the potential to become filthy rich. Heck, they can smuggle drugs and make millions in a month... the possibilities are endless.\\
However, I think that its realistic to think that there is an actual organization that keeps an eye on such things so that people who use their brain once in their life don't exploit the situation.\\
It's just too unrealistic to believe that the Harry Potter world would work like it does if there isn't some type of controlling organ that keeps the 'normal' and the magical world split apart.
