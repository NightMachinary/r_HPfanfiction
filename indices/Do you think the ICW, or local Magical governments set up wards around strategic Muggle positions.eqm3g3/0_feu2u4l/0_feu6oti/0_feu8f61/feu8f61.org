Exactly. Clearly, they don't care. Which actually fits old British ruling policy of Laissez-faire government. I think it's rather like the Unseen University in Terry Pratchett's Discworld and their position on taxes. The University promises to pay taxes, provided the city doesn't ask them to. The Ministry promise not to care, so long as the public promises not to play merry-buggery with their already-shite economy. In an economy like we see in Rowling-Magical Britain, having all that gold wouldn't make you rich, it'd just devalue gold.
