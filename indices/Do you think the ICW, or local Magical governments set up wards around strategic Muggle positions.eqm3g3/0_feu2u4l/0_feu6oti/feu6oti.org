First of all, Muggle money can be exchanged into Galleons at reasonably favorable rate.

Second, Muggle money can be used to buy real physical gold (and other precious metals). Goblins and Wizards both take real gold.

Third, this money can be invested in other real assets such as real estate. You can cast Anti-Muggle charms on Muggle real estate, and it becomes a magical property! Hey, even Dursley's home can be connected to the Floo network!

Some people say that this is all illegal. Well, Ministry only cares if you throw around flashy spells in the public. They don't care what magic you do behind closed doors, and they don't care about memory charms at all. You see Wizards obliviating those poor Muggles at will in Book 4. You see Ron boasting about confunding a Muggle driving instructor in the Epilogue. Harry Potter, then the head of Magical Britain's elite police, actually finds it funny. The Trio was hunted by both Ministry and Death Eaters during Year 7 and cast all kinds of magic in Muggle areas, they were never caught. The Ministry's ability to monitor magic use in Muggle areas seems to be quite limited.
