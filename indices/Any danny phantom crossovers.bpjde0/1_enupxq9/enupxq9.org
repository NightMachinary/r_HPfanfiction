There's one where Danny is a wizard, Tucker isn't (and he's jealous about it) and Sam is a witch. Danny and Sam are 17, and they attend Casper Magic. It crosses over with Harry Potter during book 4. Dumbledore seeks Danny out for Phantom to help with some search or something. I'm trying to find it.
