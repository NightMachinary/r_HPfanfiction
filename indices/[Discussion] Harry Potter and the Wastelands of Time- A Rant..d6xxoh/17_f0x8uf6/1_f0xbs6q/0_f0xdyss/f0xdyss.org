It's kind of funny, but I'm the exact opposite. Anything under 100k and I'm rarely interested. There isn't enough time to get invested in the story if the whole thing is less than 300 pages. I guess it just depends on the type of reader you are. I read a lot of fantasy, so I tend to enjoy long series.
