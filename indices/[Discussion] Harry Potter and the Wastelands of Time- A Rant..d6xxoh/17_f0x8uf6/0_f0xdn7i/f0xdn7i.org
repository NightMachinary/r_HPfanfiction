I take two issues with this.

1) Just because a story is long doesn't mean it's meant to be one book. Fanfiction, by its nature, allows for everything to be posted under one title if the author desires. This means that authors oftentimes do post a series of novels they themselves acknowledge to be separate to the same single title. Two examples off the top of my head being Prince of the Dark Kingdom and Antithesis. Further, because of this aspect of fanfiction, there's no general need to separate a story into individual books. If the author wants to write everything as one continuous block there's no reason they can't if it works for their story.

2) I don't think it's fair in this case to use the standards of professionally published works when judging fanfiction. Publishing companies are out to make a profit and that is going to affect what is written and published. The size of the average novel that is published doesn't necessarily tell you anything about what the ideal size is of a high quality novel, it tells you publishing companies' preferred novel length. If anything, we should assume that the ideal length would be longer than the average published length and that the distribution of good lengths is likely wider than what we see published, as publishing companies' will obviously prefer shorter novels to cut costs.
