I'm one of those weirdos that refuses to read any story over 250k words. My theory is, if they haven't ended it by then, they don't get the concept of pacing and don't know how to write endings. For reference, the average novel is 80k-100k words long, so 250k is nearly long enough for a standard trilogy.
