Book 1 is definitely slow up until the end. Its basically a story to set up characters and power scales to be honest. The kinda crazy stuff starts at the end of Book 1 and just gets absolutely bananas halfway in Book 2. Book 3 just basically sets up almost Stephen King/Dragonball mashup that gets absurd in the best way possible.

The writing is much better in this than his other work too. It never gets tropey too badly either.
