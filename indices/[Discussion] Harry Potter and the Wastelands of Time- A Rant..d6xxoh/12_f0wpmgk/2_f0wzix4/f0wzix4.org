i loved that series. it and Awaken Sleeper by Water Mage are probably my favorite HP/Dresden Files crossovers. i'd also recommend Child of the Storm and Ghosts of the Past by nimbus llewelyn, which has a LOT more crossovers in it, heh.

short summary for those fics is that what happened in the first Thor movie wasn't Odin's first attempt to humble his son. that James Potter was Thor. and Odin was forced to remove his memories of that life when he went insane with rage after his and lily's deaths. to keep him from basically destroying earth. later, Loki restores his memories and a bunch of stuff happens.

also, Scarlet Witch is Harry's godmother. and the biological mother of Hermione (with John Constantine as the father) who was given up for adoption. and Harry Dresden is one of the secondary characters due to dating and being the apprentice of the new Sorceress Supreme.

oh, and the Phoenix Force is one of the Endless, also known as Destruction.
