Wastelands of Time is an amazing, brilliant story in all of the ways that stories can /be/ amazing and brilliant. It's easily one of the top Harry Potter fanfics. In worldbuilding, characterization, grammar, plot, and sheer quality of the English language it stands above all but a very few stories in the entire fandom.

If you can't overlook Harry Potter having the charm of a James Bond? Too bad, this isn't a canon-compliant story, go find something else to read.

Heartlands of time, which your piss-poor review somehow managed to encapsulate, is admittedly a far weaker story. The author stopped regular updates and somehow managed to lose the yarn of what made for a good story. Oh well! But that has no bearing on Wastelands.
