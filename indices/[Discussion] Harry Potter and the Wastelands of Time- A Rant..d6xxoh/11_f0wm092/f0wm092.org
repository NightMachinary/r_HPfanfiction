I couldn't agree with you more.

I've criticised this story before and been downvoted for doing so.

The one thing that stands for this story is the quality of the writing. There are no spelling mistakes, no grammatical errors (given a reasonable definition of none).

Apart from that. It's awful. And thank you so much for saying so.
