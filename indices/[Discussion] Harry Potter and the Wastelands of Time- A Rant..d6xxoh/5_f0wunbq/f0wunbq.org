It's one of those that I think is going to be incredibly dependent on the reader. I found it a lot of fun to read - it helps that I found it well written, and there's a balance of stuff happening and more mundane elements.

However, I don't mind not knowing everything. I found going along with the ride a fun one - in your case, you didn't. It'll happen.

I've had to give up on a lot of recommended fics that I've seen on here because of things that I just couldn't stomach that day - usually unexplained/badly explained character change from Harry, fairly bad descriptions of certain characters, creepy/cringey writing, etc.

But this is where I'm going to heavily disagree with you - the categorization of it as /awful/. Wastelands of time is a /great/ fic... for those who enjoy the way it's written. I'm not going to call fics like linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) or linkffn(Hail Odysseus) /awful/ fics... because a lot of people enjoy them for the fact that they're good /for them/. The elements that make me unable to enjoy/continue them are not ones that make them objectively awful for everyone - and if some people don't find those dealbreakers, that doesn't mean that they're wrong for enjoying the fic. I'd reserve /awful/ for those that are, well, more objectively awful - terrible writing, falls on its face, inconsistent, disgusting, whatever. It takes something more special for me to call something awful :P
