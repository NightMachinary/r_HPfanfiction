I remember reading the first few chapters and being intrigued by the narrative style but also thinking they had set themselves with a super low margin for error based on how they were telling their story and the stakes they had established.

I bailed out after six or seven chapters where it already felt (to me) like it was dragging and I saw it was over 260k+ words.

It reminded me a lot of the movie /Edge of Tomorrow/ in the tone it was trying to set. The movie succeeded because (for the most part) it stuck to the task and avoided pretension. The narrative style of the story (for me) seemed to revel in it's pretentiousness and delaying.
