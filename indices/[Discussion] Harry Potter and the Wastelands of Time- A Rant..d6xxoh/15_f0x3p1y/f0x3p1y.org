  Such as Harry constantly monologuing about having so little time to save the world, then going on a long ass vacation with Fleur all over France. I mean, you keep bitching about how every single second is important, yet you're hanging out with Fleur for several days on end while Voldemort makes progress in finding the "Most Powerful Society to Ever Exist".

You seem to have missed the part of the fic that covers Harry's backstory, i.e. the accumulation of lifetimes worth of previous attempts that at one point drove him to despair. The plot shows that Harry dwells on the good moments with the people he loves because he knows from experience that otherwise he risks losing hope and/or losing even more of his fraying sanity.

Also, the fic makes it clear that Harry knows from experience the exact time frame when certain crucially important things need to happen. Some periods require Harry to accomplish a lot very quickly, and in other periods Harry has to just mark time until events line up in such a way that he can act again. During those down-times Harry makes the most of the little time he has with the people he loves.

  Cronos and Rhea? Still no clue who/what the fuck they are.

Actually, the plot gives you plenty of clues to figure this out by the end of the first fic. Similarly, the backstory of Atlantis is mostly covered in the first fic, along with most of the answers to the mysteries that were built up over the course of the plot. The final moments introduce a few new mysteries, but the climax mostly resolved all of the previous ones.

The partial resolution and hold-over of a few unresolved problems is fairly standard for fiction, even published novels, so it's not like the author has committed some horrific writing crime the way you describe.

  And the fact that some people put it on a level with the Denarian trilogy literally makes me mad.

And yet Denarian Renegade is a fic that I can't read past the first chapter because to me the writing quality is so terrible.

Tastes vary. It's absurd to get mad just because some people like things that you don't.
