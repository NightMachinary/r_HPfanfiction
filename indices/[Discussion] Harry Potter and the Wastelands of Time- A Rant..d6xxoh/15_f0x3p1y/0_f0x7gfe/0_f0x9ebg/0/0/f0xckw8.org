Chronos:

Chronos /is/ Harry from the future who traveled to the past at some point after he was cursed with godlike time-related abilities by the petal shard. This was pretty obvious to me near the end of the fic after the various conversations between Harry and Chronos show how similar they are, and especially the scene in which Chronos tries to save Fleur. In the final few chapters even Harry keeps thinking to himself about the similarities between them, as if he is beginning to suspect the truth but trying to suppress it. Both are ancient and mad yet appear young, same smile, similar humor, they occasionally complete each-other's thoughts, etc.
