  I'm not mad because people like it and I don't.

And yet that's what you said:

  And the fact that some people put it on a level with the Denarian trilogy literally makes me mad.

Sure sounds like your frustration in that sentence is about people liking this fic as much as/more than a fic you like.

  How did Atlantis spontaneously come back into existence? What the hell is Cronos and Rhea? Why did Harry decide not to use the Clockwork sword? What importance does Fleur bring to this story, apart from being the prettiest possible girl that Harry could have gotten with? Why did an army, which supposedly destroyed a society so much more powerful than our own succumb so easily to Harry?
#+end_quote

All explained (or, in the case of -edit, corrected names- Chronos and Saturnia, at least heavily hinted at) in the fic.

  Everyone has their own tastes. Reading reviews about this story, I was stoked because it seemed to be brilliant. I was expecting a nonstop ride through ancient ruins, a desperate fight against an unstoppable evil. I wasn't expecting countless chapters of Fleur and Harry hanging out.

That's fair. It makes sense to be disappointed in the romance if that's not your cup of tea, and/or the romantic bits slowed down the pacing of the action. Other time-travel fics in this fandom maintain a faster pace throughout (for example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12820671/1/][All Our Yesterdays]]). I ended up liking the non-action parts of this fic because those scenes explore the heavy mental and emotional toll on the time traveler in a way I haven't seen done in any other story.

I can understand why people dislike the Fleur/Harry or Harry/Tonks bits because in the beginning I didn't care for those parts either. It's easy for Harry to come across as a creepy ladies' man because he is so familiar with them at a time when they have no memories of knowing him that well. Early on those parts don't seem to tie into the broader plot, so it can feel like a pointless detour, but as the story progressed I enjoyed seeing the character development and hints about Harry's history in those more peaceful scenes.
