Allure Immune Harry is a pretty fun short story that played with the trope the title suggests.

I really don't mind Half-Blood Romantic either. I quite like the interactions in this one. I think the quality however is going to completely depend on it sticking a solid landing however.

E.C. Scrubb had both Taking Umbridge and When a Veela Cries. I haven't read them in a while but I remember being sucked into them and really liking what I read.
