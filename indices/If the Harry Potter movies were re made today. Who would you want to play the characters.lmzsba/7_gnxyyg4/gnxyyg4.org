This is SO hard! Snape is the one I'd find difficult to replace. I know Adam Driver is the fan favorite- but I'd put my vote with Benedict Cumberbatch- he's got the voice and the swag.

Is this for a total re-do of HP or like Marauders era? I'm still hoping to see an awesome HBO/Netflix series where they can go into more detail. But the casting is going to have to be amazing. Cool question- I'm looking forward to reading what other people think!
