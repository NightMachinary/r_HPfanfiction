I never thought that Harry Potter was all that good a world for crossovers.

THe world of Fate/Stay Night, on the other hand, is pretty ideal for crossovers. So a HP/FSN crossover would work, but only if you brought Harry or some other character over as Caster. I might be interested in reading that if anyone knows of any fanfics along that vein.
