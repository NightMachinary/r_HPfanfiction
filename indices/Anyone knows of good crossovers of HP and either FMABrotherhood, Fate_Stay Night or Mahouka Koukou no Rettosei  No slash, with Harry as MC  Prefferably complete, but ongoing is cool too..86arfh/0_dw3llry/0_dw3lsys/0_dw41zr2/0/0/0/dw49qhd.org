Why wouldn't I? I don't even know what I might like considering that I have never read a x-over of those 3 with HP. And I didn't search either, Reddit was my first option cuz in general, suggestions are what ppl like, and that has highest probability of being a good fic. At least good enough to BE suggested. I do say one thing. I'm a sucker for romance, het or femslash, though not a fan of harem, unless its extremely welldone, which I've seen about 5 times in over 800 fics I've read.
