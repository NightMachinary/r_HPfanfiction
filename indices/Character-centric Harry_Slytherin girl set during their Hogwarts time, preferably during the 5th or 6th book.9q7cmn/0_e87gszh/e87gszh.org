linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw; The Pureblood Princess; The Lies that Bind; The Merging; Trapped in a Broomcloset; Cage and Key)

EDIT: Forgot to give my opinions on them.

The Legacy is imo the best contract trope there is. The only one that even comes close, and that's a strech, for me, is Contractual Invalidation. The romance part is so slow burn, that they only start to interact and actually become friends halfway in. Harry may seem a bit OP, but you can clearly see he struggles sometimes when outnumbered.

TPP by TE7 is a really fun fic, somewhat cute, but with a horrible ending, not because its sad or anything, but because its really bad, though it closes the circle OK. I liked till the last 2 chapters.

The Lies that Bind is phenomenal. But there's a bit of angst. Sorry.

The Merging has Harry with a ramp-up to OP, but not that much, and there's drawbacks later on. Its Harry/Tracey.

Trapped is cute, 0 angst, and still being updated, and I love the author, she's really nice and takes time to anwser reviews (at least mine she responds.) and has a few other Harry/Daph with different set-ups.

Cage and Key is really sweet but unfortunately its abandoned. There's enough words to enjoy it though.
