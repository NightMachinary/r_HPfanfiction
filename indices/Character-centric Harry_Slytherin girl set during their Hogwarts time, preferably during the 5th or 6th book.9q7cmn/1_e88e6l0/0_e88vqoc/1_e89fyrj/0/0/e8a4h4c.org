The only ones you can see her with are not in her generation, and generally on the other side??

I mean pretty much any named Slytherin +- 3 years who didn't take part in the Inquisition squad would be ages better for that match. Hell, give any of them a hidden book hobby (this is done with Dalphe a bit), instant connection.

Course I find the tendency to pair Hermione cross generation creepy. Sure, a few 'tossed in the past' can be fun, and who doesn't like the occasional "All you zombies" (and magic is great to explore those), but the sheer number of Snape/Hermione and Sirius/Hermione is downright disturbing.
