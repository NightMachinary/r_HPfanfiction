The only Slytherins I could see her paired with is Andromeda Tonks after the war, the younger Carrow twins (or anyone of equal background existence), or MAYBE Bellatrix Lestrange (the only competent Death Eater) if she forsakes Voldemort and joins Harry's side BEFORE the DoM battle (and is actually useful, unlike Snape). I've yet to find anything matching either of those criteria.

Mostly, I just don't see Hermione working out with any Weasley.
