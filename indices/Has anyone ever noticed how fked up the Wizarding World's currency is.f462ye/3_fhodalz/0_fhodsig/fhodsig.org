But that doesn't make sense. Galleon's are literally made of gold. By logic, they should be more comparable to a hundred dollar bill. If we take a look at cultures that used a similar currency system, knuts and sickles would be used the most. Galleons would mainly be only available to wealthy merchants and nobility.

For example, the Weasley's are supposedly a rather poor family. So poor, that they can't afford their son a new wand that should only cost 7 galleons. If Galleons are so common, then that should not have been a as much of a concern.
