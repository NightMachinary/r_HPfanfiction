That's the whole thing you're comparing it to traditional societies rather than fantasy standards for currency. You can't hold it up to standard scrutiny when you consider the actual context of the world. In a society where time itself can be turned back on itself and magic is a ruling force and death isn't the end, gold really isn't as much of an end all on value as it would be in a normal society. Sometimes you just have to let some of the details remain unfocused in a story, and if that doesn't work for you then take a shot at it yourself. (:
