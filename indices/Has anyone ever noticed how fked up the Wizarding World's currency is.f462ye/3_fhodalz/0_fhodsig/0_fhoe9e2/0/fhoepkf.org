What makes the best stories so great is how well they reflect reality. By not having a logical currency system, you make it harder to understand the value of the items in that world.

And don't get me started on the magic system of hp. I have my own set of issues with that ball of confusion.

How magic would affect the currency system has never been explored before to my knowledge (In the hp universe). But that is probably not a can of worms that we want to open right now, other wise we will be here all day.

I just might take you up on that one day. I have explored the idea of making an hp fanfic and I have thought of a few rules that would rule it.
