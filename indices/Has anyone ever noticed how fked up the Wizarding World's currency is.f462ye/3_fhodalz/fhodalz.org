Well think of it in terms of American currency for a second. A coffee at Starbucks might cost, say, 4.37 (random number) now at the counter the small change matters, but if I'm chatting with somebody, or mentioning it in a story, I'm just gonna say four dollar coffee or maybe five dollar coffee. Simply put, knuts and sickles are literally the small change of the wizarding world which means they are by rights inconsequential.
