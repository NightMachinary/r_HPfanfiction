An interesting way to look at it, but of course currency is only part of the story. Naturally, the types of goods wizards value will be different from what Muggles value by virtue of the existence of magic and the absence of technology.

The most obvious example being that oil is probably worthless to wizards. Conversely, I imagine books as much more valuable to wizards, because it appears that you can't create them with magic.

The other issue on the currency side of things is the liquidity of the Muggle-wizarding currency exchange. I doubt it's possible to convert large quantities of currency, due to (a) lack of demand for Muggle money and (b) likely currency controls established to protect secrecy. Indeed, given the Goblins' attachment to gold, gems etc., as well as their "deposit box" approach to "banking", I doubt they have any interest in paper money/fiat currency, and the Ministry probably forces them to convert small amounts of it as a service to assist the integration of Muggleborns.
