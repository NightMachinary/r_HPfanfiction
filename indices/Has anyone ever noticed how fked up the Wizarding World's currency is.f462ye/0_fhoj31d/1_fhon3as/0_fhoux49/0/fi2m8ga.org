  Conversely, I imagine books as much more valuable to wizards, because it appears that you can't create them with magic.

Whilst I don't disagree with your statement of books having great value in the wizarding world, I feel the presence of dictation quills makes their quasi-massproduction far more approachable. Perhaps it's more an issue of Intellectual Property that makes books so valuable. That being said, the ministry uses Court Scribes rather than enchanted quills, so they may be far rarer than I presume.

Goblins might have use for muggle currency in that it can be traded for gold. Perhaps it's only the Statute of Secrecy that holds them back form flooding the muggle world with counterfeit currency and buying up every ounce of rare metal.
