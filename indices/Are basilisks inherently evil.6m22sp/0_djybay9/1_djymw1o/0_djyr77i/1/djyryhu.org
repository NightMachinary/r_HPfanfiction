True. It would bring a lot of new problems too, though.

Transfiguration alone (and conjuration) means that you're in a post-scarcity economy (mostly), and this, in turn, would lead to a huge and ever growing leisure class.\\
That seems good at first sight, but it always creates a lot of problems. Most people need something to do, or they become depressed, or find shelter in various forms of entertainment.\\
It would lead to a lot of whole new social issues.\\
I'd love to see a fic addressing those matters.
