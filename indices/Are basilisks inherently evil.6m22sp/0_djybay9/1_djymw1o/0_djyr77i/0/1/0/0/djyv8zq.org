So a helicopter levitates when it is stationary midair or is that manipulating gravity by being able to hover? A feather is hovering/levitating by having the force of the magic to manipulate that gravity in that instance, surely. I'm not sure what your flair means, sorry, maybe I'm just being naive about the fair.
