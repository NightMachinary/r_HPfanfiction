  So a helicopter levitates
#+end_quote

Helicopters don't levitate. Please look up the definition of the word.

  that manipulating gravity by being able to hover?
#+end_quote

No, it's manipulating air in the same way a swimmer manipulates water, push enough aside of it at a fast enough pace to be capable of lifting itself above it.

#+begin_quote
  A feather is hovering/levitating by having the force of the magic to manipulate that gravity in that instance, surely.
#+end_quote

No, it levitates by levitating because of Magic, not because of Gravity Manipulation. These aren't comic book superpowers that need overcomplicated explanations, this is Magic, it just does. The X-Men Reddit is the other way.

  'm not sure what your flair means

Turtles all the way down means that something is like an infinite Russian nesting doll, always adding new layers and doing something expected and unexpected at the same time, only in Magic's case, the turtle gets bigger and scalier the farther you go down instead of smaller and less detailed like with the Russian nesting doll. In lamen's terms, Magic is Magic, don't overcomplicate it.
