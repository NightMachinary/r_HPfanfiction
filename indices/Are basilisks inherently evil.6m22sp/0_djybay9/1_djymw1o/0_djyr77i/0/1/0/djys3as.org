No. It's Levitating it, it is lifting the Object independent from Gravity.

(To Clarify, I'm not saying Wizards cannot Manipulate Gravity, I'm saying that it would take one of much greater power than a First Year, nor would it be advantageous as you can just use Telekinetic Spells to circumvent gravity anyways. What most people keep trying to do, is apply Muggle-Rationale to Magic, when Magic is a force that defies our own Rationalism. You're attempting to equate it to simple SuperPowers (Eg; Superman flys by Manipulating Gravity) but for a Wizard, they fly by flying, you may ask how that works if they're not manipulating gravity, but you will never find the answer. Refer to my flair.)
