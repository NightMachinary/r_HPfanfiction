No, all of what you've said is objectively wrong. Firstly, the Levitation Charm is a Levitation Charm, it does not manipulate gravity. Secondly, if Magic is naturally occurring in humans and there are magical-beings that existed long before both Wizards and Muggles, then it's safe to say that Magic is as natural as anything else. To say that Magic is a fuck you to the 'laws of nature' is to say that the 'laws of nature' exist. What if none of it were laws and it was all subjective to the Wizard?
