Obviously, magic breaks the laws of physics. That's the point.

You have nature and physics and the laws of the Universe. And then you have magic that trumps that and follows only it's own laws.

Wizards understand there are laws they can break, they experience it every day. You can't use magic to levitate a feather and not understand that you can't levitate a feather without magic.

  The Levitation Charm is a Levitation Charm, it does not manipulate gravity.

Even if it doesn't manipulate gravity directly, the result violates it, so it manipulates it as a result.\\
But if you don't like this example, what do you think about the simple Lumos charm, that casually violates entropy by creating light (which means energy) out of nothing? Or do you think magic is energy? That changes nothing, you're still adding energy to a system from nothing. That goes against every law of nature.
