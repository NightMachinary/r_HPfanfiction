  Obviously, magic breaks the laws of physics. That's the point. You have nature and physics and the laws of the Universe. And then you have magic that trumps that and follows only it's own laws. Wizards understand there are laws they can break, they experience it every day. You can't use magic to levitate a feather and not understand that you can't levitate a feather without magic.

You're really trying to sound like an intellectual, but all I get is a large amount of nothing. Magic is Magic, it doesn't violate anything, it just does, it's turtles all the way down. Trying to understand it, even for Wizards, is impossible.

Levitation is Levitation, no manipulation of Gravity Directly, the result doesn't violate it as it doesn't operate within it. You levitate it through Magic, not through the manipulation of gravity, therefore, it freely moves through the air as an independent variable.

Once again, you're saying Magic defies Scientific Laws, but Magic is a naturally occurring thing, in this case, therefore the Scientific Laws never existed in the first place.
