  Which means that as long as you fail to comply with the law, you're violating it.
#+end_quote

Once again, Circumvention in this context means to avoid something altogether, like Gravity. Scientific Law doesn't even matter, as we're talking about Gravity.

#+begin_quote
  No. the laws of physics were discovered and formulated by scientists. Gravity exists, whatever it has been discovered or not. People haven't had to wait for Newton before being able to fall or die.
#+end_quote

Well before Newton you were tied to the Earth because you were heavier than the air around yourself, not because of Gravity.

#+begin_quote
  My point isn't that magic manipulates gravity, it is that it breaks it.
#+end_quote

If it did, there would be a visible distortion whenever someone picked up an extremely heavy object such as the club.

#+begin_quote
  Here you're just reformulating what I say and telling me I'm wrong. Magic doesn't have to have a vendetta against physics. The moment it fails to comply with it, it breaks it.
#+end_quote

The moment something doesn't comply with Physics, it is no longer Law, it applies subjectively to a group of people.

#+begin_quote
  And yet it does. Otherwise, neither the feathers nor the club would fly. Physics don't allow it.
#+end_quote

Where is your citation on this? If you broke gravity to lift the club, then the club would likely break under the continuous pressure against itself.

#+begin_quote
  Precisely. It makes fire out of magic, it breaks physics.
#+end_quote

No, it just makes Fire, not out of anything, it just does. Stop assuming things and saying "it breaks physics". You create the fire independently from Physics.
