  So you make something levitate, regardless of gravity, without breaking the laws of gravity? Sorry, that's dumb.

No, that's Magic. You're trying too hard to make heads or tails, just enjoy it for what it is.

  Even if magic operates outside of physics, which is my point actually, while yours was that it is natural,

Magic operates both outside and inside. Natural and Unnatural. It all is dependent on what the Wizard does with it. However, it is naturally occurring in how it appears in Wizards, which is to say, its origin is outside of our understanding but also builds our understanding.

  In that case, how comes that they're still there when magic's not involved.

Confusing wording, but I think you're asking why Gravity still affects Muggles when Wizards can defy it, that is simply because it affects both and Wizards are just capable of circumventing it with their Magic. According to common-sense, if something doesn't unequivocally apply to everyone, it's not a law.
