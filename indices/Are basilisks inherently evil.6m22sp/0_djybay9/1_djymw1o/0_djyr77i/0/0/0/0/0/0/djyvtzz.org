  No, that's Magic. You're trying too hard to make heads or tails, just enjoy it for what it is.
#+end_quote

Magic is the cause, what about the result. The result obviously breaks physics and yet, you're denying it.

#+begin_quote
  Magic operates both outside and inside. Natural and Unnatural. It all is dependent on what the Wizard does with it. However, it is naturally occurring in how it appears in Wizards, which is to say, its origin is outside of our understanding but also builds our understanding.
#+end_quote

Magic is obviously separate from the rest of the laws of the universe. You can call it natural if you want, in a way it is, but it doesn't change that fact.

#+end_quote

The point of view of the wizards doesn't have anything to do with what is natural and what isn't. Just like the laws of physics have nothing to do with the point of view of the scientists, they can understand it better or worst, but the thing is there, whatever the way we think about it.

  Simply disproven by the fact that Ron can levitate the Troll's Club as easily as a Feather.
#+end_quote

How does it disprove anything? It simply means that levitating a troll's club is as easy as levitating a feather. The club still flies while it shouldn't, and the result still breaks the laws of physics, exactly the same way. If anything, it's a proof that magic isn't energy, which is my opinion anyway. Magic is magic and operates by magic and do so while ignoring the laws of physics.

  Confusing wording, but I think you're asking why Gravity still affects Muggles when Wizards can defy it, that is simply because it affects both and Wizards are just capable of circumventing it with their Magic.
#+end_quote

Precisely. Then if Wizards circumvent the gravity with magic, they are violating it. Physics and magic are thus to separate things and one trumps the other. Circumvent or violate a law, it's just different wordings, it means the exact same thing.

#+begin_quote
  According to common-sense, if something doesn't unequivocally apply to everyone, it's not a law.
#+end_quote

According to common sense, if magic can break a fundamental law of the universe, it's not subjected to it. It operates outside the usual laws of the universe, or regardless of them if you prefer.
