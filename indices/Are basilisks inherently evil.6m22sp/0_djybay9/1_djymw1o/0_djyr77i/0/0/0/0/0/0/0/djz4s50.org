  Circumvent or violate a law, it's just different wordings, it means the exact same thing.
#+end_quote

Not it doesn't, circumvent means to avoid the law altogether, violate it means to actively manipulate it in order to use it for a contradictory purpose in this case. In which, you are completely wrong, Levitation is Levitation, it does so by Levitating, how can it levitate without Gravity being Manipulated? Magic.

  Just like the laws of physics have nothing to do with the point of view of the scientists
#+end_quote

The laws of physics were created by scientists if their viewpoint doesn't matter, then the law doesn't exist.

  How does it disprove anything? It simply means that levitating a troll's club is as easy as levitating a feather.
#+end_quote

It disproves your theory that Magic somehow Manipulates Gravity in order to Levitate objects with the Levitation Charm, as the Levitation Charm would have been highly stress-tested if it had both Gravity and the weight of the Club weighing down on it. Yet Ron managed to easily drop it of his own volition.

  Magic is magic and operates by magic and do so while ignoring the laws of physics.
#+end_quote

Once again, where you're wrong. Magic doesn't have some kind of odd vendetta against Scientific Laws, Magic just does, it breaks nothing in the process, it does what is intended by the Wizard with minimal side effects (Excess energy from the spell creating lights and other visible signs such as beams and jets, user feeling something from the spell like their ears popping or a headache etc...)

I'll provide something easier than the Levitation Charm. How about the Fire-Making Charm? It doesn't heat up molecules, it makes fire, how does it make fire if not by our own way of thinking? Magic. Magic is turtles all the way down, many Mages greater than yourself have spent years wasting away on what it is and how it can apply within Human rationalism, but it doesn't and it can't.
