  Not it doesn't, circumvent means to avoid the law altogether, violate it means to actively manipulate it in order to use it for a contradictory purpose in this case.
#+end_quote

According to [[http://dictionary.cambridge.org]]

#+begin_quote
  to break or act against something, especially a law, agreement, principle, or something that should be treated with respect.
#+end_quote

Which means that as long as you fail to comply with the law, you're violating it.

  The laws of physics were created by scientists if their viewpoint doesn't matter, then the law doesn't exist.
#+end_quote

No. the laws of physics were discovered and formulated by scientists. Gravity exists, whatever it has been discovered or not. People haven't had to wait for Newton before being able to fall or die.

  It disproves your theory that Magic somehow Manipulates Gravity in order to Levitate objects with the Levitation Charm, as the Levitation Charm would have been highly stress-tested if it had both Gravity and the weight of the Club weighing down on it. Yet Ron managed to easily drop it of his own volition.
#+end_quote

My point isn't that magic manipulates gravity, it is that it breaks it. But even then, all it proves is how easy it is to manipulate gravity using magic.

#+begin_quote
  Once again, where you're wrong. Magic doesn't have some kind of odd vendetta against Scientific Laws, Magic just does
#+end_quote

Here you're just reformulating what I say and telling me I'm wrong. Magic doesn't have to have a vendetta against physics. The moment it fails to comply with it, it breaks it.

#+begin_quote
  it breaks nothing in the process
#+end_quote

And yet it does. Otherwise, neither the feathers nor the club would fly. Physics don't allow it.

#+begin_quote
  How about the Fire-Making Charm? It doesn't heat up molecules, it makes fire, how does it make fire if not by our own way of thinking? Magic.
#+end_quote

Precisely. It makes fire out of magic, it breaks physics.

#+begin_quote
  many Mages greater than yourself have spent years wasting away on what it is and how it can apply within Human rationalism, but it doesn't and it can't.
#+end_quote

And where exactly do I pretend to say what magic is? All I've taken into account is the ways we know magic operates and its results.
