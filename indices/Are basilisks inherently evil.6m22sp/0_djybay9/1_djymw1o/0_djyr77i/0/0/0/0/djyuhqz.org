  You're really trying to sound like an intellectual, but all I get is a large amount of nothing.

Nope, I'm just saying my piece. I care shit about sounding like an intellectual.

  Levitation is Levitation, no manipulation of Gravity Directly, the result doesn't violate it as it doesn't operate within it.
#+end_quote

So you make something levitate, regardless of gravity, without breaking the laws of gravity? Sorry, that's dumb.\\
Even if magic operates outside of physics, which is my point actually, while yours was that it is natural, the result still happens in the real world, and if in the real world a feather happens to fly when it should fall, then it breaks the rules of gravity, no matter the cause.

  Once again, you're saying Magic defies Scientific Laws, but Magic is a naturally occurring thing, in this case, therefore the Scientific Laws never existed in the first place.
#+end_quote

In that case, how comes that they're still there when magic's not involved.

You can stretch it however you want, it just doesn't work.
