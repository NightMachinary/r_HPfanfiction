Well, you've got to use some sort of will-overpowering magic to keep the toad sitting on the egg for as long as it needs to. You've got to overpower it's desire to move, eat, relieve itself so that it can sit on that egg. It's an unnatural behavior and it leads to an unnatural creation. Maybe that corruption of nature leads to the corrupted, malicious entity.
