When the basilisk in Chamber of Secrets actually talks (remember, one of the plot points is Harry hearing it through the walls), it says /"Come... come to me... Let me rip you... Let me tear you... Let me kill you."/

So yeah, sounds pretty evil to me. On the other hand, whenever it's heard speaking all it wants is to kill and to eat, so maybe it's just hungry and grumpy without being outright malicious.
