  The same applies to a basilisk! Hell, the one at Hogwarts was to be used as a last resort defense and only Tom Riddle corrupted it by using it to kill innocent children (it's lucky that he only managed to kill one person and that he had to send it back to hibernation because they would have otherwise closed Hogwarts, which he of course didn't want!)

It might be true, but there's nothing in Canon to suggest that.
