  No, just like no child (no matter what Christians believe!) is born with original sin! A child, no matter how it was conceived (rape, dark magic, a loving couple having sex, some scientist cloning a child etc. etc.), is an innocent and from here on out it's a nuture thing!

What you said is completely contradictory to your original statement. First, let's take a step back. You generalised a whole group of people into a single pigeon hole, good job? Next, you claim that no matter how a child is conceived it is pure of heart, so technically, you have a Neo-Conservative (the 'Christians' you're referring to) point of view on abortion. Bit hypocritical, dontcha' think?
