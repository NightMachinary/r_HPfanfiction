No, just like no child (no matter what Christians believe!) is born with original sin! A child, no matter how it was conceived (rape, dark magic, a loving couple having sex, some scientist cloning a child etc. etc.), is an innocent and from here on out it's a nuture thing! If you train/indoctrinate a child to be a spoiled, narcisistic and evil brat than the child will probably become that, but if you raise it in a loving environment and don't indoctrinate it? Well, then that child will grow up normally and most likely become a productive member of society!

The same applies to a basilisk! Hell, the one at Hogwarts was to be used as a last resort defense and only Tom Riddle corrupted it by using it to kill innocent children (it's lucky that he only managed to kill one person and that he had to send it back to hibernation because they would have otherwise closed Hogwarts, which he of course didn't want!)
