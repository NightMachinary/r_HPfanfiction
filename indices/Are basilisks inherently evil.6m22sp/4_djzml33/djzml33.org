Just because something is deadly to humans, and likes humans as food, doesn't make it evil. Nor, even if the creature just kills you because you are there. If that were to make it evil by nature, then Humans would be even eviler.

In that group, I include Dementors and Boggarts, a Dementor, if it has to feed itself from the souls of Humans it doesn't make it evil.

I would consider some creature evil, if, against it's nature, it were to torture another creature without any reason for it.
