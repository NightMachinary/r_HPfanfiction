[Warning Headcanon Alert]

Nothing in the Magical World is inherently dark, it is what the Wizard makes it. Some Wizard designed Magic spells that hurt people, disfigure people, and cripple people, therefore the Spells are considered Dark. And therefore most of those are grouped up in the 'Dark Magic' category. Now, this 'Dark Magic' is not nearly as powerful as say "Battle-Magic" (Specialized Spells that also serve to Defeat/Destroy/Incapacitate another being) but it is the equivalent of using an item that is Powerful in Early Game (and somewhat Powerful even later on) but becomes relatively obscure compared to the greater options once you train up, this is even further expressed with how much easier it is to cast 'Dark Magic' in canon.

So great, I managed to classify the Magic, but does it apply to The Basilisk? The Basilisk is created through sitting a toad on a chicken's egg, not really inherently Dark, but I guess the Wizard setting it up has the intent to make a Killing Machine, so he makes it Dark in a way. But, the Basilisk isn't a simple Spell, it is also a sentient creature, and it never really hurts anyone until it was ordered to do so by its master. So we have to look at it from the 'Dog' standpoint. If the Owner is bad, then it's highly likely that the Dog will turn out to be mean and bad to others as well, not because it wants to, but because that's all it knows. So if it doesn't know it's being bad, is it still technically committing bad acts? Especially when it's the will of their master. Technically, they think they're in the moral right because they're following orders like a good boy.
