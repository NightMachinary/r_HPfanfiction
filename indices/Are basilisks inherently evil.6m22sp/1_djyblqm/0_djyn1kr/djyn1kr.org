It also depends if dark and light are a magical or a political classification.\\
The former implies that something inside dark creatures makes them dark.\\
If it's the latter, they are simply creatures that the consensus or the regulator deems dark.\\
Both possibilities can work in a fanfiction.I don't know which one is canon if it's even been established.
