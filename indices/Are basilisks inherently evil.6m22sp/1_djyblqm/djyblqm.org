What is an evil creature? Are lions evil? Sharks? We need some sort of classification system, and that'll depend on your opinion.

A classification I like (idk if i's canon or not but it was in a fic i read and stuck with me), but a "dark" creature is one that either recognizes humans are sentient beings and still wishes to hurt them or is very easy to control by wizards and can wreck lots of damage.

Examples: Acromantulas can talk to people but still want to eat them.

Inferi are easily exploited by wizards.

Dragons are dangerous but not sentient and cannot be easily controlled, so it's not evil.

Under this framework a Basilisk would be dark as (depending on how u view parseltongue) they are either sentient, easily controllable, or both.
