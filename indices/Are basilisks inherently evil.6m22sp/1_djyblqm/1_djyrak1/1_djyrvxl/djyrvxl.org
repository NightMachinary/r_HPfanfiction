So I've seen a couple different renditions of Parsletongue. Some fics have it as a rare genetic trait, others a common genetic trait, and others (my favorite theory) as a language that can be learned. If it's the latter 2, there's a good amount of Parslemouths (though there might be few in the UK for whatever reason).

I've also seen different ways to how Parsletongue interacts w/ animals. With some, it converts the animal's base instincts into a human-understandable form. With others, it acts as a control system for snakes. The first means the basilisk wouldn't be easy to control, the latter essentially means all snakes are super easy to control.

My personal favorite is learnable parsletongue that allows u to control Snakes (by devoting a portion of your magic, you turn the snake into the equivalent of a remote-ctonrolled spy drone), in which case the Basilisk is very easy to control. But it depends on the fic.

EDIT: re-inferi, now that i think of it, I agree with you. Inferi are more constructs than animals.
