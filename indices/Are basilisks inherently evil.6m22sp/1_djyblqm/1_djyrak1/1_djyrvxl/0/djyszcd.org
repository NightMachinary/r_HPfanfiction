Canon seems to be that Parseltongue really is the language of snakes, that they can use it even if no wizard talks to them. After all, the Boa in the zoo tells Harry that it's getting back to Brazil. Parseltongue isn't dark per se, it just happens to be associated with dark wizards and snakes, which most wizards see as dark.

  My personal favorite is learnable parsletongue that allows u to control Snakes (by devoting a portion of your magic, you turn the snake into the equivalent of a remote-ctonrolled spy drone)

Voldemort has to possess Nagini when attacking Arthur in the department of mysteries though, which is the reason Harry possesses it also. It doesn't work well with this theory I think.

But then again, not all stories have to follow Canon.
