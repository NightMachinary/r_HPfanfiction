Are inferi creatures? I'd call them rather dumb magical constructs (like say a golem or Frankenstein's monster (the later is of course complicated because it's sentient and self-aware!)!)

Easily controlable? How many parselmouths are there? I'd say not many, so nope! A language can't be evil IMHO (no, not even parseltongue or that language of Mordor from Lord of the Rings!)
