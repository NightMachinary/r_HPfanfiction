Just to expand on this-

JRRT was a linguist, hence language being such a prominent theme in the Legendarium. One of the purest expressions of his love for language comes in how it's treated by the various peoples who populated his world. The elves, innately beautiful and good, tended to their language like a garden. But Orcs detested everything that existed, including themselves, and so each tribe or city of orcs spoke their own haphazardly made language which was only capable of expressing cruelty.

Sauron attempted but failed to unite the evils of Middle Earth under a wretched language of his own, which was known as Black Speech. In the Third Age, when the War of The Ring takes place, only Sauron, his highest lieutenants, and some special trolls are capable of speaking Black Speech in full. One of these lieutenants was the Mouth of Sauron, a twisted "diplomat" who met the last remaining forces of men before the Black Gate just before the final battle of the War of the Ring. He's, of course, hideous, but his mouth is especially destroyed from speaking Black Speech so often.

There are in fact two occasions when we someone "pure" speaks Black Speech, and it's the two times Gandalf recites the Ring's inscription. Both times, the room darkens and his usually kind voice becomes heavy and sinister.

There's a lot more to support Black Speech's inherent evil, but this comment is already turning into an essay, so I'll leave it there.
