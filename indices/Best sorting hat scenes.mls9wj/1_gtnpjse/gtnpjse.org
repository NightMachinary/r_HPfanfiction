The absolutely best sorting hat scene I've ever read was in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard series]] by mad_fairy. First story linkao3(10824855)

This is a very long series that stars with a mild Naruto cross-over (I've never seen Naruto and could follow it with no problems) before eventually going into a full-on Avatar: the Last Airbender cross-over.

If you just want to read the sorting scene, the setup---which is the actual good part---is at the end of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10824855/chapters/24082074][chapter 6]] (search for the word "boat" to jump to that scene, about 3/4 of the way down, and read through the end of the chapter). The sorting itself is at the beginning of chapter 7, but it won't make sense (or be nearly as entertaining) without the lead-in.
