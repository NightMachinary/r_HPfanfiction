Ron/OC, because fuck pair the spares, it's one of the tropes I hate the most. He doesn't really have any chemistry with the canon developed female characters, so why force it? He's the kind of guy chasing after every bird that gives him the time of the day until he's 30, the teenage sweethearts route fits neither his character nor the maturity levels he shows in canon.
