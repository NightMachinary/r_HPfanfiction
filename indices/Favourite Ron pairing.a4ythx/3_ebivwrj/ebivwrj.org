I don't have any strong feelings about Ron's pairings. I'm fine with Ron/Hermione, but don't mind Ron/Lavender or even the idea of Ron/Pansy. I never slash Ron because he seems like the straightest rod ever made in the factory, barring his little crush on Viktor back in the day. I think a really feminine quidditch fan (not player) would work well for him, probably an older woman.
