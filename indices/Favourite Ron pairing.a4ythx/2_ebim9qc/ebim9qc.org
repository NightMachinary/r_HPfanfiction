I think in canon Ron was THE one factor that kept Hermione from being a complete Mary Sue and therefore I like this pairing, even though I think they do not fit together all that well.

I think character wise Draco and Ron would make an absolutely amazing pairing, because they share the same insecurities and getting them together would be an amazingly twisted angst fest, something which I really like. They also both have parents that were not actually good parents at all, but are widely perceived as if they were. A fic working with that would be amazing. I am of course aware that this pairing is not exactly realistic, but I tend to ignore that reading ff anyway. I have never actually read a good story with the two of them, so if anyone has a rec, I would be delighted.

I think Ron got by far the shortest stick in canon and I hate what was done to his character. Ron would need someone who really really adores him and makes him feel like he is someone special for once, yet is awesome enough for him to feel like he has won a prize he does not deserve with his life partner.

I do not think such a character exists in canon.
