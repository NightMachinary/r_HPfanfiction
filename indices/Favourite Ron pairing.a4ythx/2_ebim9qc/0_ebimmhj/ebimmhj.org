  I think Ron got by far the shortest stick in canon and I hate what was done to his character. Ron would need someone who really really adores him and makes him feel like he is someone special for once, yet is awesome enough for him to feel like he has won a prize he does not deserve with his life partner.

  I do not think such a character exists in canon.
