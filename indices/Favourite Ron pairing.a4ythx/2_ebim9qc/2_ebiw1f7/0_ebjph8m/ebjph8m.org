My god, Hellstrike, something just occurred to me. I read one of your comments, in which you said that any pairing with Malfoy would have to happen before the "mudblood incident", something that Malfoy parroted when he was 12. That means you judge a 12yo like you would judge an adult. Therefore you can not be much older yourself. It makes so much sense now. Of course you think 12-17yo kids are fully responsible, when you yourself are in that age range. I do not know if I should be sorry for being so harsh on you, you do not ever try to see the other side of the coin, which is super annoying to me and I think you should get honest feedback. But yeah, you will learn, of course. I always assume automatically that everyone here is at least 20, so sorry for judging you more harshly than I usually would, I guess.
