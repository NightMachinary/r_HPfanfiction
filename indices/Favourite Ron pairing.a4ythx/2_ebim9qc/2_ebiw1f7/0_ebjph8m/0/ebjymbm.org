You are missing the point of that argument. There is no criminal liability or anything resulting from that. But at that point, Malfoy causes a lot of water under the bridge, creates a rift which cannot be mended, one he widens a lot during the third year where he pushes for Buckbeaks execution. That moment is a very good character indication because Malfoy is gleeful how Hagrid suffers. He is not just "parroting" something there, he is the driving force (he caused the incident, he made a huge deal out of an injury which was healed within an hour, his reaction is the reason why Daddy Malfoy and his Death Eater Chum got involved).

Do you really think that the founder of SPEW and "I made a mistake, so this sentient animal has to die" Malfoy would get along? That after the war Hermione could even hear the name Malfoy without suffering from PTSD after what Bellatrix did to her at MALFOY Manor while the Malfoys watched? That Hermione would remember anything but her childhood torment from the boy who called her "magical nigger" for five years?

But of course, I made the mistake of assuming that everyone here is at least twenty and understands something about romantic compatibility and traumatic memories.
