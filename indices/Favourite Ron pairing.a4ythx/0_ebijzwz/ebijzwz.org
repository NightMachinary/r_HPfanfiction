I'm fine with Ron/Hermione but don't 'ship' it in the way one might get invested in other pairings. It feels like a plausible romance to me, but I just don't particularly get invested. Of course, that's because Ron isn't really a compelling protagonist; he's a great side character, but he lacks a certain /je-ne-sais-quoi/ that makes Harry, Hermione, or even other secondary characters like Luna all seem like good choices for a main character.

Simply due to how real their friendship felt in the books, Harry/Ron is probably one of the only slash pairings I can easily see happening if everything but Harry and Ron's romantic orientations remained unchanged in the setting. But I haven't ever come across a fic with such a pairing that is otherwise to my taste, so this is kind of academic.

I know Ron/Luna has some traction, and... I mean, yeah, sure? It can be written well and be very sweet. It just always feels to me like the pairing mostly exists to "pair up the spares" once you've shipped Harry with Hermione, as opposed to something heartfelt. But a great story may come one day to prove me wrong.
