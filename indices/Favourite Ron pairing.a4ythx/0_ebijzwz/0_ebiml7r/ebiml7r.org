I don't think Ron/Luna could ever work. Primarily because I can't imagine Ron taking her passions seriously. If she were to ever start a tangent about the creatures she pursues, Ron would probably roll his eyes and not pay attention. And even without that issue in mind, I don't think Luna would be willing to put up with his attitude.
