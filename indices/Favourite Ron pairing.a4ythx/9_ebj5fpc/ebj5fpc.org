I honestly find most pairings involving Ron to be rather gross. Mostly due to his character flaws --- he's not the kind of person I'd want someone I actually like to date. Most egregious of this are R/H and R/L, even if these days I find Hermione to be a bit annoying. So it would have to be someone I have no strong feelings on whatsoever, while still being a decent pairing for him.

Unironically, I feel like Lavender would be this if she were actually written well.

That said? I usually prefer to keep him background at best.
