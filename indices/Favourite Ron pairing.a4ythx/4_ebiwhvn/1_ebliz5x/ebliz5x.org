Yes, background character. I saw two fics with Ron and Daphne, of all people. But I can't remember one of them. The other is the Lone Traveler: The Slytherin Chronicles linkffn(10825089). Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10825089/1/Lone-Traveler-The-Slytherin-Chronicles]]

I have to say, it's a good different. I liked it. If anyone remembers another fics with Ron/Daphne, please mention it.
