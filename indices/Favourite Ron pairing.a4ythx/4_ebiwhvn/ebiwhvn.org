  Which character do you like to see him romantically involved with the most?
#+end_quote

A background character (like Parvati or Susan Bones) because there was not a single canon character with whom he had any chemistry. Therefore it is up to the author to create such a character.

He and Hermione had absolutely nothing in common outside of the war and Harry. No shared interests, completely opposite character traits, neither really take the other seriously and they don't pull their punches when arguing. And the whole "lets mind rape a driving instructor to get laid" thing won't fly with Hermione at all if she ever finds out.

Lavender did not work out in canon, so that's a no as well.

Ron, for most of the books, was too insensitive for Luna, although there is a case to be made on the last third of HBP (after he was poisoned). I'm not convinced, but it is perhaps the "lesser evil".
