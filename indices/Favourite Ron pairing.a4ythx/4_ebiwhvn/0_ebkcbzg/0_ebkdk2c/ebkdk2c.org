Hermione challenged Ron to pass a driving exam without magic, he cheated and used magic on the instructor because he would have otherwise failed the exam, casually violating several laws (using magic on Muggle without due cause, using magic in front of muggles, fraud).

It is reasonable to assume that Hermione would express her pride at his accomplishment...

Honestly, if you want to put a finger on the single scene which makes Ron a horrible character, there you go. And he sees nothing wrong with that, despite the fact that he casually assaults a muggle and even confesses the whole thing to an Auror (and Harry is horrible in that scene because he doesn't even point out how wrong Ron's action was).

Edit: To make things clear, the "Ron is a horrible character" statement is solely about the epilogue. Other than that, I'm indifferent towards him, but that one scene is enough to ruin his entire character. His modus operandi is not different from a Death Eater there (who would have used the imperius but otherwise acted the same).
