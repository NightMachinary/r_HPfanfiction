WoT is pretty... surreal I guess would be the best word for it, in my opinion. I got three chapters in before I remembered having read it once, and since then I've not gotten enough sleep to properly read through it completely again, because it's too confusing. I read two whole chapters and none of it stuck >_<.

Also, I second your description of kb0's story.
