Fair warning: I started the sequel to my fic, posted six or so chapters, and got spammed with loads of negative reviews, several bordering on the psychotic, convincing me that my time was better spent elsewhere. I actually have a complete, 112k word sequel, but won't be posting it. I put a synopsis in my author notes if anyone cares.
