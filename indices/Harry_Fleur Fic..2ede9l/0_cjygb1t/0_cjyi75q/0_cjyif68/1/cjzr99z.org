It's quite odd, that nearly every great fanfiction author that I've read(with the exception of Commander Argus) stops writing fanfiction because of loonies threatening them and trying to track the author down. I'd almost say that it was all coordinated so only bad writers keep posting, but that would be assuming that crazy people are capable of working together.
