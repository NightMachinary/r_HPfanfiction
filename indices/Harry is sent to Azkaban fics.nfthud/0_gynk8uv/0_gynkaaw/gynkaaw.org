  Harry never killed or tortured anyone, yet they convicted him for the crimes and sentenced him to life in Azkaban. His friends believe him guilty, the Ministry is more corrupt than anyone realizes and Voldemort is closing in. When the Order comes across info that only Harry can help them with, they need to furlough the prisoner for his help. Can they trust him? Can he trust them?
