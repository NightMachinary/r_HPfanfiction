This is hands down the best Draco-centric fic I have read: linkffn(6432055).

It's very introspective, and explores Draco's character in an almost intimate way. It shows us his journey post-war, as he grows and changes, struggling to reconcile the world around him with the prejudices he held growing up. There's almost no connection with anything or anyone magical. It's just Draco, alone.

I really, really liked it.
