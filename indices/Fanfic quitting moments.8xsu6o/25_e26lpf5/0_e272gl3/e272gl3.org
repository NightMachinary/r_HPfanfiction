I agree with you on the matter of 11 year olds and decisionmaking.

Around that age, children still are in a phase where they are developing their morals and ethics. They question their parents, their teachers and any other rolemodel they have had.

And once puberty hits a long process of finding out whats good and right for more than just oneself begins.\\
It is unreasonable and unrealistic to expect a child to be capable of decisionmaking on a level of seasoned politicians.
