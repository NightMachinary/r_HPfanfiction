Politics usually make me jump ship because i cannot imagine anything more boring. There's been instances where it was done well or was uncommon enough that it didn't bother me but usually it's not fun to read and either has way too much impact or no impact at all on the main character. Also making 11 year olds do politics is the dumbest thing i've ever heard and making 11 year old Harry out-politic Dumbledore, Fudge, Malfoy and whatever other pureblood you can think of is absolutely stupid and not realistic at all (even in a world where magic is real).
