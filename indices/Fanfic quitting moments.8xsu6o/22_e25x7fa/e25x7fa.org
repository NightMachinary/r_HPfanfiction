I just typed this out in another thread and found it surprisingly relevent here too:

There was one I got most of the way through when I first discovered the realm of fanfiction (and BDSM) that was SS/HG, with Snape being a seasoned dominant who'd trained many submissives, and Hermione wanted to become a/his sub. It was good at the beginning, she was a bit of a brat and there was some hot-and-cold style angst as there tends to be in smut, but the further I got into it, the more times he would do something impulsive or stupid and apologize and plead "I've made so many mistakes with you," all while practicing horrible BDSM etiquette that took me right out of the story. Eventually though, the turning away point for me was when they decided to take it from in the bedroom to adopting it as their lifestyle, which led to him telling her what she could and couldn't do to help Harry and Ron find horcruxes, dictating whether or not she could even talk to them... By the time I gave up, she'd entirely lost any semblance of being Hermione because she wasn't allowed to be. I'm sure it was supposed to ultimately become a "Hermione rises up: We can be equals even if we're dom/sub, so let me do what I want sometimes" sort of exchange but I was tired of waiting for that part of the story.
