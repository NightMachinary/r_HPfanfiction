I'm pretty certain I read this story and enjoyed it but I definitely wanted more from the resolution. Is this where Hermione basically misses out on the final confrontation because Snape tricked her? Cause that story really needed a resolution with Hermione proving to him that she can in fact be his equal.

Edit: There was a story line at the very end with Snape properly training Hermione in defense and they start doing duelling competitions together but this is just in the epilogue and it was too little too late.
