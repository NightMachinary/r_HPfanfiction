  Additionally it reads very awkward when you have to switch to past tense to explain story elements that actually happened in the past.

That sounds a bit arbitrary. In past tense you have to switch to past perfect for things that happened in the past.

To me a well written present tense story has the advantage of being very immersive. It feels more like watching a movie when the author is good at showing instead of telling. Just very visceral and immediate.
