I find it weird how hated Second Person can be.

Like it is unusual and takes a little bit of mental gymnastics for me to get into the swing of reading it again but it isn't inherently bad.

Then again some of the other fandoms I read have a lot of second person content and forum quests and so on. So I kinda got used to it.
