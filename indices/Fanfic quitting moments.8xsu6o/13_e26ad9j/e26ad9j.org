When people start jerking off the main character every other sentence. Harry Crow will forever be my 'Worst of' pick because the writing was solid, the core idea was interesting, and then Harry just waltzes through every single damn thing in his life. Every time there is even the slightest obstacle he rolls right over it without actually doing anything and then everyone stares at him with stars in their eyes gasping and gossiping about how amazing and strong and sexy and powerful this fucking 11 year old is. I don't mind Harry winning, but it should be /some/ sort of challenge or else the story becomes incredibly tedious.

The only time anyone should ever remark on how cool and powerful the main character is is at the end of a long arc of clear struggle wherein they actually accomplish something that is /genuinely difficult/ to do. Becoming Hogwarts Champion (seriously wtf) /just because/ screams lazy writing; if one person can do it and no one else /ever/ has, what makes them so special?
