Canon rehashes are fine, but I don't see the point in writing those if you're gonna keep everything the same. I recently read a story where Snape gets deaged when Harry joins school and he's supposed to befriend and protect him. I gave up after a few chapters because literally everything is the same. Harry is in Slytherin but it makes no material difference to the story. Harry, Snape and Hermione become best friends, Ron and Draco get bashed, but the story otherwise proceeds as canon. I really liked the premise but what's the point. Might as well read the books.
