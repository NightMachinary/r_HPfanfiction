When it starts explaining in great overwrought details how sad and tragic a situation is and then proceeds to descend into endless angst.

If the situation itself isn't sad/can't make an emotional connection. Telling me about how I should feel endlessly isn't going to actually induce any feelings other than apathy and annoyance.
