It's just so disappointing, unrealistic, and just why. It's like they just gave up on using their brains or imagination and threw it in cause why not. I mean I've read stories where the author is close to being done but is exhausted or what not from writing it and it's obvious they just want it to be done so badly they don't care about ending it, so they write a sloppy unfulfilling end to the story and it's cringey and they're okay cause they're happy it's over for them but im like oh no not again :(
