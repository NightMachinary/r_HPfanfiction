  Bonus points if they end up killing each other or some stupid shit. Like why bother writing this fucking shit besides to waste everyones time. my god this enrages me.

They are trying to write a tragedy but they don't understand how tragedies work. Instead of a fatal character flaw that leads to their doom the two characters are awesome together and perfect in every way, but then get ripped apart by author fiat. Then you exclaim "Oh that's so tragic", therefore tragedy!

Now that I think about it, it's kinda ironic: There's lots of fanfics with indie!grey!Harry characters with fatal character flaws (like Anakin Skywalker who end ups dooming himself and everyone he cares for), but they almost never end in a proper tragedy. So kinda the opposite problem there.
