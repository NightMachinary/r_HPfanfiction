If the characters get too OOC I jump ship. THat's the first thing I do, then of course poorly written with grammar, spelling and formatting mistakes, my god it's bad.

I have a weird tendency to jump ship plot wise if a characters relationship makes no sense. Mainly if you take two characters that abhor each other, with the ENTIRE GOAL OF YOUR FIC to be to make them into friends/lovers/mentors/familial after a while, it REALLY annoys me so much so that I leave and will never read a fic of that authors again if they undo everything. For example if you build up a positive relationship between draco and harry or Pansy and hermione, etc you get the point, and I've seen authors over-time do that and do it well. They finally get it to the point of them being in whatever sort of relationship the story was ACTUALLY MEANT TO BE, then the author suddenly without reason reverses the entire thing and makes them bitter enemies again. Sometimes without a single reason, sometimes with a stupid reason that makes no sense. Bonus points if they end up killing each other or some stupid shit. Like why bother writing this fucking shit besides to waste everyones time. my god this enrages me. I can understand if it's a LEGIT argument, as every couple/friend/etc has them, but when you're making it like 'i could no longer take pansy stealing the green beans off my dinner plate, so I reached over and punched her in the face and avada kedavra'd her in the middle of the hall and everyone froze for a second before applauding and i was given an order of merlin first class for being a little cunt' I am like why

Also any story where harry takes the dark mark for WHATEVER fucing reason pisses me off. There was this one where Dumbledore approved the plan and said harry had to do it it was the only way like wtf is this shit
