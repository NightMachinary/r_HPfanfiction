  I don't know what's worse, fanfic that is well written, free of grammatical issues, but utterly lacking in imagination and solutions to canon events, or fics with interesting ideas that are strangled by crappy grammar and poor structure and expression of ideas.

Well said.

The whole point of a time-travel fic (for me) is to derail canon in dramatic or comical ways. But there was a phase when people wrote "Characters read the HP books" fanfics, so there must be some appeal to having characters react to canon events.
