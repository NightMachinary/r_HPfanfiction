Harry 'realising' that everything Dumbledores does and did, was to manipulate him to fit his villainy Masterplan.

An additional 'get out of here' is granted for the realisation to occur within the first few paragraphs, because we urgently need to establish that this story defines itself through the oversimplification of complex characters and the warping of their motives.

Two additional 'get out of here' are granted for: having manipulated him into bumping into the Weasley's at Kings Cross so that they may ensure his continued influence.

Oh, and also Soul Bonds and Veela Mates. Because choosing one's partner of one's own volition is overrated.
