I was slogging through a fic recently but kept going up until Harry met Draco on the train and told him off in a really high-brow, condescending way for his lack of pure-blood manners. It was absolutely cringe-worthy and any real 11-year-old would have mocked the hell out of Harry for trying to speak like a more obnoxious version of Percy Weasley.
