It depends on my mood. At times, I am curious to see another persons idea. Like a hypothetical 'what if' scenario extrapolated with someone else's labour. I just flick through, scrolling to see if there's anything interesting that occurs or is provided as a reason for things being the way they are. Sometimes if I like the idea and it's unique, but the writing isn't great, I will scroll through as well, just to see what happens or if the authors writing improves over time.

Quitting moments happen irregularly and depends on mood or context- most (of which I can remember) are really about pushing the limits so far of what is in the realm of Canon so far that it becomes illogical. i.e. strange focus on werewolf culture with Fenrir as like this weird protective alpha. Strange focus on sex as a deux ex machina (not tongue in cheek). Unexpected cross-overs that take a pivitol point in the story. Poorly executed concepts, characters, descriptions situations... It's all about the suspension of D'Belief. I typically never click on things that I am not interested in reading in the first place- Some pairings that completely lack any healthy relationship construction- i.e. Harry and Voldemort/ or torture!noncon! ect.

I get bored too. Sometimes situation, others writing, or for reasons unknown to me (even if it's my favorite class of fic.)
