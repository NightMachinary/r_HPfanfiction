I've had to abandon a few fics, usually because the story is going in a direction I don't like, or if established characters aren't written how they're portrayed in their original medium (barring obvious exceptions such as AU's and the like).

I also can't stand stuff like this:

"He was wearing a long, leather trench coat, with a slot for his katana out of the back (picture Blade's coat but red with skulls instead of black)".

Referencing material instead of taking the time to describe the object or person properly. It's an instant sign that the writer is young and inexperienced.
