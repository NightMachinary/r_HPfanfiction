Hadrian is just a shitty name in general, especially where it concerns the Potters. To me, if you really want a “Harry is short for...” thing, do Hardwin. Why? Well, 1) It is a nice name imho, and 2) It is the name of an actual ancestor of Harry. So it makes more sense.

Also, Hadrian comes from Adrian, which means “dark”, and I doubt Harry's parents would want that kind of connotation to their son in wizarding society.
