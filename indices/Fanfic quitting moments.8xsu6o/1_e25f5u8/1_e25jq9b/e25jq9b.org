I want there to be a story where there /is/ a Lord Hadrian Black around, he's 11, insufferably rich, has an irritatingly large number of rings, and is generally insufferable... but he's not Harry Potter. He's a separate Hogwarts student who happens to look a lot like him, though you can tell them apart because he has emerald orbs embedded in his eye sockets, as opposed to Harry who has green eyes.
