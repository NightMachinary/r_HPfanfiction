Just made a post about this but someone wrote a generally very interesting story but then went balls to the wall crazy with an, author admitted, inuniverse-IRA knockoff. It was so bad, so offensive, and so completely overtook the main story, which had nothing to do with that group originally, that I had to tap-out. Tbh basically every mention of Ireland by an American author talking about heritage and traditions and "the bad times" is just cringy as and makes me bail.
