Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Darkness-Dementia-Raven-Way

Weasley bashing, especially of Ron, Ginny, and Molly, and especially of the “Dumbledore paid the Weasleys to befriend Harry” variety

Superpower fics with the same stakes and obstacles as canon

Wrong BWL, especially of the “Harry was sent to live with the Dursleys and/or abused by James and Lily because they only love their ‘special' child” variety

“Black Family” fics where Sirius is raising Harry to be a snooty Pureblood, Narcissa is a battered woman, and Andromeda and Narcissa make up with the latter's racism being swept under the rug or ignored entirely

OOCness of almost any kind

Cisgender mpreg. Trans mpreg is fine if it's done tastefully.

I'm picky ¯_(ツ)_/¯
