•Stupid manipulative Dumbledore. I think it's important to talk about the weird and morally uncomfortable decisions that Dumbledore made. Unfortunately, the way that most fics approach this conversation is so off-putting that I generally avoid it all together.

Dumbledore is a complex character who makes a lot of mistakes, but he's also smart (or at least tries to be) and if you're going to write manipulative Dumbledore then have his manipulations be more clever and interesting than Dumbledore doing something shitty out of the blue and then muttering about the greater good while sucking sullenly on a lemon drop.

• Slytherins being depicted as profoundly different than anybody else because their cunning grants them unique abilities of forethought even as teenagers. Like, when Snape was a teenager he was rash enough to confront a suspected werewolf on the full moon, in the forest filled with dangerous creatures, next to a demon tree, based on information he got from a known antagonist.

• Snape suddenly becoming the champion of abused students. Snape is an unrepentant asshole who bullies and belittles children based off of whimsy and personal grudge. Snape literally verbally abuses students on a daily basis, he's not going to be first choice for talking about a difficult home life.

•Redemption fics where the given character (usually Draco or Snape) either suddenly becomes a good person spontaneously or the past is altered so they were a good person all along (so all of their actions are justified).

Nobody drastically alters their actions or belief system without a catalyst. If you have a story centred around redemption you have to at least attempt to address the questions involved in that discussion. (Is redemption possible? What does it mean to be forgiven? How much does it really matter whether it's your fault or not?)

•WBWL stories are usually shit so I usually avoid them

•Omegaverse is deeply disturbing
