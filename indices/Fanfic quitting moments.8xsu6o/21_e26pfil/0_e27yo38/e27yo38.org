  Dumbledore is a complex character who makes a lot of mistakes, but he's also smart (or at least tries to be) and if you're going to write manipulative Dumbledore then have his manipulations be more clever and interesting than Dumbledore doing something shitty out of the blue and then muttering about the greater good while sucking sullenly on a lemon drop.
