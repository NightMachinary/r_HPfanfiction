I'm thinking you're reffering to noodlehammer's story?(Something like "For magic" or something?)\\
Anyway, I think it's like having sex with a drunk person, sexual assault. I am ok with Harry not being bothered by it in that story, because he isn't depicted as someone concerned with the morality of his actions. He did kill at least 2 people before that particular point is reached, so it should've already showcased that he has no empathy, or at the very least, no empathy to others outside his inmediate circle of aquaintences.
