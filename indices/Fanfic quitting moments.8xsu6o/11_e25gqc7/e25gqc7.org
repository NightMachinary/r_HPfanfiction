To me, the single largest reason to stop reading a fic (provided I am past the first chapter already) is that fic's general blandness and inability to keep holding my interest. The language, the plot, the characterization can be alright, and I can certainly envision continuing reading the fic at some indeterminate point in the future. So it is more of an apathy thing.
