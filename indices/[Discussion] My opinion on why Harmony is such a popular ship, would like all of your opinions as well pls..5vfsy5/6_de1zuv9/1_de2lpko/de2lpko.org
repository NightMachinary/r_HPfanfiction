I agree with everything until the parenthesis. In the books the two of them have no romantic chemistry, and that is true in most fanfics as well. Especially Harmony fics.

I hate the assumption that people have that a guy and girl can't just be friends.

But if someone doesn't start a fics with the assumption that Harry and Hermione are destined to be together and actually develops the relationship and gives them some romantic chemistry, I'd be happy to read that fic. I actively avoid Dramione fics (sucessfully, I've never read one), but if you don't announce the pairing (telling me the pairing ahead of time is a pet peeve unless the story is about the pairing) and successfully develop the relationship, I would probably be okay with it.
