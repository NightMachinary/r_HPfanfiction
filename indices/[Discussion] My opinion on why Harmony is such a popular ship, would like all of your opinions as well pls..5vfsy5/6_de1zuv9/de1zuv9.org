I just can't read Harmony because I always thought of Harry and Hermione as brother and sister! It's the ONE aspect of cannon I can't let go of while reading fan fiction. They had such a real friendship in the books. It was rocky and kind of shitty at times but they always stuck together, no matter how bad it got. And shoving a romance between them just seems to diminish that friendship. You can have a guy-best-friend without falling in love with him.

(I can deal with Hermione-bashing because, lets be honest, we ALL wanted to slap her at least one in cannon. But Harmony always gives me the heeby-geebies)
