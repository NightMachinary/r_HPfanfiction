I think when they shot the movies they'd already gotten a lot of buzz that Harry and Hermione would be a better match, so they staged a lot of scenes to placate those fans while sticking to the story - Hermione is almost always on Harry's shoulder while Ron is a step away or behind. Most of the scenes supporting the Ron/Hermione pairing seem obligatory. That provides a lot of subliminal encouragement to Harmony shippers (of which I am one).
