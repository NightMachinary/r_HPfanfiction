Respect your opinion, but must disagree with a lot of this. Full disclosure I am a big Harry/Ginny fan.

  Harry x Ginny is not something I can see working out because Ginny is such a boring useless appendage when she is around Harry. On her own, Ginny fucking rocks. When she's around Harry, she's just useless.

I don't understand where this comes from. If any complaint is warranted, it's that we don't see her with Harry while they are together enough to form any opinion on how she is with him. But nothing in canon suggests she is boring with him or a useless appendage. The one real scene of them together is her making a funny joke. Not boring at all.

Before they get together, Ginny is actually the one who can get through to Harry better than anyone. She also doesn't hide around him (from OOTP on). When he is all pissed off during Christmas, Hermione won't go near him because she is afraid of upsetting him. Ginny says screw that, confronts him, makes him see reason, and gets him out of his funk.

  And the whole pining over Harry while she dated other boys really rubs me the wrong way as she never moved on properly from that girly crush she had.
#+end_quote

It's tough to say whether she was still "pining" over him or just still had feelings for him while dating other boys. I mean, she never gave up on him, but it isn't to say she wasn't legitimately trying to move on.

But personally, I just don't think Harry/Hermione is supported by canon. In GoF, Harry specifically notes its not much fun hanging around just Hermione as all they do is study. Hermione also is a bit of a nag and overly motherly towards Harry. Ginny is more supportive of Harry, preferring to take his side and be supportive rather than prove her point and be right, like Hermione is during the HBP book debacle.

  Hermione more than holds her ground with Harry. Unlike Ginny, she doesn't change around him.
#+end_quote

Certainly Ginny holds her ground well with Harry in OOTP. Also, once she's gotten over her "hero worship" by OOTP, I can find no evidence that she isn't herself around him. Ginny is probably more natural with Harry than anyone else.

Bottom line is Rowling very clearly showed why Harry and Ginny would work together. They share a sense of humor, have similar interestd, have a shared past with Riddle, and Ginny seems to know when to be there to support Harry and when to call him on his b.s. Can you really say the same for Hermione? Hermione might be right a lot of the time when she went against Harry, but in the context of whether they work as a couple, do any of these moments show that?

For example, when Hermione gets Harry's broom confiscated in PoA, she was probably right to do so. It's something a mother or big sister would do. But does that whole experience show that they are good as a couple? Harry was very upset and wouldn't speak with her for a while. How does that show they would work together?

Look how Ginny handled the HBP book. Harry was feeling really lousy about what he did. Hermione comes in basically rubbing salt in the wound and Ginny backs Harry up. Not just because she likes him, but because he is already feeling bad and alone, and needed support more than anything.

Regardless of whether Harry and Ginny belong together, the text shows quite frequently why Harry and Hermione would not be well-suited for each other.
