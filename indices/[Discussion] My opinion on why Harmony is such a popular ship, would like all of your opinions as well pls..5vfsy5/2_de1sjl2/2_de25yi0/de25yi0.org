  Harry and Hermione just have this sort of relationship where they compliment each other, but are also independent of each other even when together.

It's really about bringing out the best in each other. Of course the HP books center around their protagonist and it's very possible that without Harry Hermione would remain this anti-social know-it-all bookworm who prefers to play it safe from Book 1. Fred or George (possibly the same argument would go for Ron) could have never brought out her 'adventurous' side, because their behaviour is without 'sense' (for lack of a better term). She would break the rules though in order to help Hagrid and smuggle a Dragon out of Hogwarts. I'm not sure this is something she would have realized without Harry and it doesn't rely solely on the whole 'boy-who-lived' angle (see Dragon baby example), it's just the right thing to do and Harry is the kind of person who will always be suckered into that pulling Hermione right along (and she realizes that she enjoys it).

Her positive impact on Harry should be obvious. It's why many who dislike Ron feel like he's holding him back. It's okay to pause and think and knowledge isn't just for school but can have actually useful applications.
