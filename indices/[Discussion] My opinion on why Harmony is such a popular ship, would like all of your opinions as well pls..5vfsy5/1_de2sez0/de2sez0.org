What no one seems to have brought up.

They're both lonely outcasts. Harry suddenly is thrust in a new world and is popular, but at heart he is the kid that was abused and shoved under the stairs for years on end.

Meanwhile Hermione grew up isolated due to her smarts (somewhat similar to harry being punished for doing better than Dudly)

It would only be natural for them to gravitate towards each other.
