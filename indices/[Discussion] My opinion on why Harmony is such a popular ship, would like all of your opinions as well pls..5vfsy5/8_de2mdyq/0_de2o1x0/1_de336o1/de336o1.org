This is a good essay, /however/ this is [[/r/HPfanfiction]] and not [[/r/harrypotter]] :) Besides that I have some small problems:

If you change Hermione's (or Harry's!) personality very slightly, or simply his perception of her, you can make it quite work very well. You could make Harry be less annoyed by her (he doesn't need to like it, he just needs a way to deal with it without negative emotion), or make her a bit more mature in giving advice (For example in OOtP).

But the biggest part is that I don't see R/Hr working any /better/ than H/HR.

- Ron listens less to Hermione's advice
- He is even less studious than Harry
- He's rather rude, and she constantly tells him off, some quotes from PS:

#+begin_quote
  “Whatever House I'm in, I hope she's not in it,” said Ron.

  “And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”\\
  Ron glared at her as she left.

  “It's no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she's a nightmare, honestly.”
#+end_quote

Even JKR herself says so, by the way:

#+begin_quote
  [R/Hr] was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. [...]

  Oh, maybe she and Ron will be alright with a bit of counseling, you know.
#+end_quote

Wouldn't that work for HHR too? And about the DH she says:

#+begin_quote
  *In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit* and I'll tell you something very strange. When I wrote Hallows, I felt this quite strongly when I had Hermione and Harry together in the tent! I hadn't told [Steve] Kloves that and when he wrote the script he felt exactly the same thing at exactly the same point.
#+end_quote

And in OOtP clearly /likes/ (not love) Hermione:

#+begin_quote
  He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again ---\\
  And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath ---\\
  “EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
#+end_quote

Hermione is literally half of what powers his patronus. She is a big source of happiness for him. This essay doesn't even give her that much. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's Fun Times are Not Associated With Hermione:
#+end_quote

Harry likes being around Hermione. Her face is combined with happiness, with fun times - else she wouldn't power his patronus, and patroni are definitly associated with genuine happiness in canon.

The thing that I'm trying to say... I don't see H/Hr any less happening than R/Hr, except that Ron finds her attractive, which is a rather arbitrary decision. The changes needed to make H/Hr work would be minimal. His best argument is

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is too rational and not tactful or intuitive enough to deal sensitively with Harry's dark moods.
#+end_quote

You could easily fix that without changing either character too much. Harry isn't defined by his dark moods and Hermione isn't defined by her insensitivity, in fact she has the understanding to be sensitive:

#+begin_quote
  “Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily [to Ron], picking up her quill again. “She was the one who started it,” said Harry. “I wouldn't've --- she just sort of came at me --- and next thing she's crying all over me --- I didn't know what to do ---”\\
  “Don't blame you, mate,” said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought.\\
  “You just had to be nice to her,” said Hermione, looking up anxiously. “You were, weren't you?”
#+end_quote

She knows who and what Harry likes, especially later in the series:

#+begin_quote
  “Don't be silly,” said Hermione vaguely, “Harry's liked her for ages, haven't you, Harry?”\\
  He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages.
#+end_quote

I have no doubt if she really tried she could work with Harry, she'd only need to change herself slightly - and not for the worse! Is she is capable of doing that? In my opinion: Yes, she is.

Edit: Damn, this got longer than I expected.
