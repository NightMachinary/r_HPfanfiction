Something else I've noticed about the essay: It kinda expects them to immediately be in love from child age if they are supposed to be together. Sorta like the Ginny adoration that I explicitly hate about their relationship. There's a bunch of H/Hr fics that do this wrong too (in particular fics by Robst). Hermione /is/ annoying, especially in first year. I - as a grown up - think it's adorable, but if she's in your school year you're not going to fall in love with someone who annoys you about your homework all the time (especially at age 11) - and it's not a requirement in order for a relationship to develop later.

In my opinion a relationship between them before 5th year is kinda dumb and I think him going after someone like Cho first is also an important step in Harry's development. Such a trainwreck is the perfect opportunity to reconsider just going after the prettiest girl and wondering what you'd want out of a relationship... especially if your name is Harry Potter.
