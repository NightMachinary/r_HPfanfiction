And without [[/r/HarryPotter]], there would be no [[/r/HPfanfiction]], just saying. ;)

But the thing is, it cannot be "very slight" changes. To get rid of the fundamental problems with the H/Hr ship, there would need to be significant changes to either Harry or Hermione. For example, if Harry had not grown up with the Dursleys, he would not have been so ruggedly individualistic, and would not have had so much disdain at authority. However, given Hermione's authoritarian personality in canon, they don't fit together based on this criterium. Ron, on the other hand, seems to like it.

Though, I do see where you are going with this. Even though I do ship them, I'm not the biggest fan of R/Hr either. But remember that the essay was written about why they wouldn't work together from Harry's perspective, not from Hermione's. I also feel that using scenes from the first book (before both H/Hr and R/Hr have even become friends!) to try and disprove R/Hr is misleading.

The Wonderland interview you are citing, on the other hand, is clearly talking about who is better from Hermione's perspective. That should be logical, given that JKR did the interview with Emma Watson. But note that she is talking about H/Hr in comparison to R/Hr, and not as a stand-alone ship, let alone with H/G. Therefore, in some ways, H/Hr is better than R/Hr. But this doesn't mean they should be together, because Harry is best with Ginny in all ways - and given from what we know from JKR's interviews, she does view H/G in a better light than R/Hr.

I feel like your example of Hermione powering Harry's patronus is flawed, because Ron's face was also present, meaning that this was simply about friendship. Also, there is a difference between being happy with someone as a friend, and you being romantically compatible with them. Harry is very happy with Hermione as a friend (which the author does acknowledge): "Harry loves and admires Hermione because she is smart, brave, talented, quick thinking, sensible, hard working, generous, and loyal." But they just wouldn't work out together as a couple.

She knows who Harry likes at the moment (in OotP), but she is also working behind the scenes to put Ginny and Harry together (which Ginny admits at the end of HBP). So it seems that Hermione does recognize that her and Harry would never work out.

That ended up being pretty long too :P
