I think part of it is a lot of people believe on some level that men and women can't just be good friends. Or, that if a man and woman can have a strong friendship, it would naturally translate to a strong romantic relationship. When in fact one does not equal the other. The dynamics that make a strong platonic friendship are in many ways not related to what makes a strong romantic relationship.

Harry's friendship with Hermione, in my opinion, shows why they don't work in a relationship.
