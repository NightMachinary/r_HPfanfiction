Oddly personal reason: my wife is totally a Hermione. Unrepentant gunner in class, Type A perfectionist, looks good under her robes, doesn't get along with bitchy airheads. Since Harry is sort of the stand in for the reader, Harmony is sort of natural. That's the type of gal I like. For similar reasons Draco/Hermione gives me the heebie jeebies.
