Quite a big bunch of the book fans that ship H/Hr are just projecting themselves into either of them. Ron and Hermione have chemistry. Harry and Hermione are water and hot oil.

Also, people misinterpreting Ron's character a lot in the fandom doesn't help.

Pro tip: It's not Canon!Ron that doesn't deserve Hermione. It's Canon!Hermione that doesn't deserve Ron.
