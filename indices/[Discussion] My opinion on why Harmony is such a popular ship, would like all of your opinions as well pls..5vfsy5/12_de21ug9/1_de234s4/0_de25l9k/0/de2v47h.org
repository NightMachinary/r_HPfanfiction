Unnecessary? This Harry Potter you speak of, he must be really amazing, a true polymath capable of doing Everything by himself, not needing anybody's help or advice; and so very Powerful that in any fight he might find himself in, any allies he might have would just get in the way. Where can I read more about him? I've read Rowling's books, and they had a character with the same name, but he was nothing like that.
