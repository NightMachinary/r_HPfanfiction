  Manipulative!Dumbledore
#+end_quote

Is one of the most boring things to read, and it's pointless. I would much rather have a Dumbledore that is there to help Harry out and train him up. Last paragraph is a strawman in its entirety.

#+begin_quote
  So you're saying that most DA members did master it, even if not all of them could perform it at all times? Sounds like we're not really disagreeing.
#+end_quote

No, I'm saying that none of them mastered it as they couldn't do it faced with a Dementor. During the Battle of Hogwarts Shamus and the other two weren't in range of the Dementors, thus using the patronus in safety. Harry is the only one who attended DA that actually mastered it, and he is the teacher.

#+begin_quote
  And Harry doesn't? He constantly complains about all the time he has to spend studying, and all those essays he has to write for Transfiguration and Charms; what are those about if not theory of magic? I think that you are denigrating all the hard work Harry puts into his studies, however reluctantly.
#+end_quote

Essays can be done on topics you don't understand by simply rephrasing the material in a different way. Harry didn't get absolutely perfect scores on his essays (as he never mentioned it) so we are left to assume that he was mediocre or maybe even clueless at theory-related things.

#+begin_quote
  Then why are you making arguments based on a specific action in a specific scene in it?
#+end_quote

Because it was memorable, and it wasn't specific.

#+begin_quote
  Either he or Lockhart had; and Harry hadn't actually cast it in that scene.
#+end_quote

Exactly, Harry hadn't cast the Disarming Charm ever, until the scene with Lockhart in the Chamber's entry way.

#+begin_quote
  Now you're just making excuses. His other magic was unaffected, as far as I can recall.
#+end_quote

I mean, he didn't use it much until the third task. When he was already in the clear and most people didn't care if he put his name in or not.

#+begin_quote
  Eh?
#+end_quote

The spell that bound them to not reveal any information about the DA was on the DA parchment.

#+begin_quote
  Or unlucky. They were kids fighting experienced adults, and --- if you look at that fight scene --- Hermione was the only one targeted with lethal spells. (Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, the other kids were either purebloods or Harry, whom Voldemort wanted for himself; funny how that worked out.)
#+end_quote

Actually several spells were thrown around, especially at Harry. Hermione getting hit was due to her silencing an enemy but not accounting for wordless magic.

#+begin_quote
  (If you want a recognizable Harry who is, I strongly recommend linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira.mirth).)
#+end_quote

Read it before. Has the usual trope of Harry making friends in a house of people that hate him. It falls into the habit of giving a character that doesn't even show up in canon, a personality, and it got boring very fast.

#+begin_quote
  Special Powerful Light Magic from Dumbledore, which, in my opinion, completely misses the point of the books.
#+end_quote

Here we go with the Lights, the Greys, and the Darks. No, just, no, Magic doesn't have sides.

#+begin_quote
  underdeveloped general uber-talent
#+end_quote

Well, that's because he does. Pretty much the entire story we've heard about his 'potential', his 'ability', even Hermione has admitted that he is better than her in some aspects of magic. Sure, she can learn transfiguration faster, but Harry is the only one who would use it effectively in a battle (hence why we never see Hermione use it other than to conjure tiny birds to attack Ron).

#+begin_quote
  Very selective
#+end_quote

Sorry if JKR couldn't help but go on the Love>Magical Power train everytime it mattered. If Harry is the type of person to not take things sitting down, as you say. Why didn't he train himself up for Voldemort? Why didn't he ask Dumbledore directly for extra magical training? Especially since after his fourth year, all of Dumbledore's political duties were relieved, thus giving him free-time (that's why we got the Memory training that could have taken one day but instead took several weeks).

  Relationship Dynamics
#+end_quote

Kek, Voldemort relied on people more than canon Harry did. But, as I said, Harry could look for people to support him that aren't two people his own age. We have a large pool of highly trained wizards with life experience to choose from, you wan't a guy that can teach Harry how to transform into an animal? A useful ability that could have probably gotten him and his friends away from danger multiple times? Well Sirius Black is your guy. Want a highly-trained Auror who has more experience with taking out Dark Wizards than Mr. I took out Grindelwald? We've got Alistor Moody, a retired Auror with nothing better to do than throw spells out in the dark of night.

  an amazingly talented athlete (youngest Seeker in a century, killed a giant basilisk with a sword having never wielded one before)

So why didn't he take up Duelling? It's a sport.
