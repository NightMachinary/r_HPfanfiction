Dumbledore did what he could. It turned out that his friends --- who into danger with him, knowing exactly what they were risking --- were needed as well. That is part of the Power that Voldemort Knew Not.

  Harry has no characterization, made even clearer when he is just reactive the entire book series, you can't get him to do anything unless prompted, forced, or challenged.

That /is/ his characterization. He is an everyman hero, who rises to the occasion when called upon, but who generally wants to relax, have fun, enjoy life, hang out with friends, date, have a family, etc.. He is not a deep thinker, subjecting his feelings to rigorous scrutiny or pondering how his notions of justice apply to non-humans. Rowling's books provide plenty of insight.
