First of all, good idea on numbering discussion points in lieu of quoting.

Second of all, I want to confirm that you want to continue this discussion or whether you want to leave what you wrote as the last word, and then maybe come back to it later.

Some things you're writing are decidedly odd, like asserting that Harry wasn't in his teens (aged between 13 and 19 inclusive) at the end of DH; asserting that attending and participating in classes, doing homework, and passing exams isn't "studying"; and quoting Hitler as a source of wisdom.

It's up to you.
