  There you go again Uses Powerful Light Magic way above Seventh Year level

It's canon that he can learn powerful magic with relative ease. And there you go again, Hermione may learn spells fast in a classroom setting but Harry ultimately masters and learns exponentially quicker. Look at how he managed to cast a well-executed Disarming Charm despite only seeing it in passing once, from a Professor who likely mastered it to the point of not needing to use correct wand movements, and just incantation alone.

Sure, with studying Hermione is his equal, and maybe better in Transfiguration, but Harry is ultimately naturally talented, as shown when he managed to vanish the iguana without even practicing the spell. Her best kept secret was a Time-Turner that she literally needed because she thought she could take every class at once, she may have hubris, but no sense of self-awareness.

No, everyman heros are people that act like heroes in every situation, not matter the difference in circumstance. A Slytherin Harry would be distinctly different, especially if you take Harry before Hogwarts into account, where he would rather run away than stand up to his bullies (shown to not be a problem after getting into Gryffindor, as he stood up to Malfoy and his cronies multiple times). I only recall post-Dursley Harry doing that once in Deathly Hallows with the snatchers.

Hermione wanted to fix what wasn't broken. She went on a crusade for the better treatment of Elfish Welfare with no evidence, and just plain "It's their born rights!". Not even listening to the other side of the argument. That shows narcissism and tunnel-vision, not a very heroic combo. Whether her peers want to learn a charm? She has only done that for a stranger a total of once, and that was Ron before he was friends with her. I think you diluting headcanon, fanfiction, and canon into one big pot.

Without his friends he would have been considerably less reckless indeed. I can't recall a single moment where he was in trouble in Hogwarts, where the main cause hadn't been his friends, other then maybe fifth year? Where he acted super OOC for what Rowling was trying to build-up, to defend... something?
