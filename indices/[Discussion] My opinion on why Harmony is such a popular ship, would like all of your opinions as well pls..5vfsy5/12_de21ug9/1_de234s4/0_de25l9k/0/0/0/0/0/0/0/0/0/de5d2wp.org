  DA members only managed casting in relative safety. Hermione and Ron both failed at it during the battle of Hogwarts, and Deus Ex Finnigan and gang came to the rescue.
#+end_quote

So you're saying that most DA members did master it, even if not all of them could perform it at all times? Sounds like we're not really disagreeing.

  Independent study? She reads the course work and knows the theory, thus giving her a heavy basis. It's easy to preform something when you understand its inner-workings.
#+end_quote

And Harry doesn't? He constantly complains about all the time he has to spend studying, and all those essays he has to write for Transfiguration and Charms; what are those about if not theory of magic? I think that you are denigrating all the hard work Harry puts into his studies, however reluctantly.

#+begin_quote
  I don't recall the second book well in details, as it was a snooze fest.
#+end_quote

Then why are you making arguments based on a specific action in a specific scene in it?

#+begin_quote
  Did Snape tell them specifically to use the Disarming Charm on each other?
#+end_quote

Either he or Lockhart had; and Harry hadn't actually cast it in that scene.

#+begin_quote
  I remember them doing it in the DA, but I can't for the life of me remember Chamber, oh well.
#+end_quote

That's where it was introduced.

#+begin_quote
  The Summoning Charm was an interesting chapter to read, but we have to account for the fact that Harry wasn't in a good emotional state when casting the spell, and concentration is key for magic in any universe.
#+end_quote

Now you're just making excuses. His other magic was unaffected, as far as I can recall.

#+begin_quote
  Except, Vanishing is only started in O.W.L. Year, meanwhile Harry also had to deal with the torturing of McGonagall, the flight of George and Fred Weasely, etc... and still managed to score high. Once again, showing that despite not having one of the key things for a spell, he breaks a rule of magic.
#+end_quote

He gets a good but not perfect grade (E) on Transfiguration after a stressful year during which he nonetheless attends all classes does homework, not to mention getting his usual tutoring from Hermione. No rules of magic were broken.

#+begin_quote
  I would argue that Harry being considered the best in the year at DADA (the most encompassing form of magic taught at Hogwarts, dealing in charms, jinxes, hexes, curses, and transfiguration) by his own year, makes him better than others in his year.
#+end_quote

It's true DADA is a multidisciplinary class, but a lot of what DADA is about is also non-magical athleticism (i.e., hitting what you are aiming at) and general courage and nerve, like being able to face down a Boggart, as well as being able to think on one's feet. Also, I remember Taure making a pretty darned good case that Dark Arts spells (jinxes, hexes, and curses) are a class of magic of their own: despite being superficially similar to Charms, they actually have more in common with Transfiguration, since they are hard to reverse; and countering them all but requires being able to cast them. Point being, being great at DADA requires being decent at general magic, plus a few other traits. Nobody is claiming that Harry isn't a competent wizard, but next coming of Dumbledore, or even Lily, he ain't.

#+begin_quote
  I don't recall Hermione mastering Transfiguration Spells as fast later in the years, nor Charms, she may get somethings right the first time but not everything.
#+end_quote

Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence in this case. Most of the time, Harry isn't paying attention to what Hermione is doing in class.

#+begin_quote
  DA Parchment was kept from the entirety of the DA for a reason.
#+end_quote

Eh?

#+begin_quote
  She was researching Elf enslavement's history, not the subject itself. Saying you did something thoroughly and still not showing any proof just means that she didn't research the reasoning for their enslavement, just that it's happened for a while.
#+end_quote

You don't now that; but given her character, she is nothing if not thorough.

#+begin_quote
  Self-confidence and hubris are two different things, she was too confident in her spell work, and that's why she got hit by Dolohov's curse.
#+end_quote

Or unlucky. They were kids fighting experienced adults, and --- if you look at that fight scene --- Hermione was the only one targeted with lethal spells. (Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, the other kids were either purebloods or Harry, whom Voldemort wanted for himself; funny how that worked out.)

#+begin_quote
  Was referring to him standing up in the middle of class and defending himself to Umbridge. Odd and out of place, as Harry usually does the whole 'silent fury' type deal, but I guess with how much angst was in that book he was going to start casting accidental magic again.
#+end_quote

I see what you mean, though it felt reasonable to me at the time. Harry was angry, and Umbridge went out of her way to provoke him. Also, while Harry isn't eager to speechify, nor is he particularly shy expressing his opinions. Ultimately, Harry is a lot of things, but he isn't subtle. Playing a long game of some sort is not his style. (If you want a recognizable Harry who is, I strongly recommend linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira.mirth).)

#+begin_quote
  Look, I have no idea what the debate is even about at this point, it's becoming one of those boring canon duels where the two opponents just constantly throw beam/jet spells against the others shield, it's honestly boring and uninteresting. Hermione is a good wizard, but most of her strength comes from her understanding and extensive research of theory, Harry's comes from his natural talent when Rowling deems to show it. It's really that simple.
#+end_quote

I will happily remind you: you made a bunch of assertions about how Harry coulda-woulda-shoulda been more like Voldemort in his relationship dynamics and not had friends and had instead gotten Special Training in Special Powerful Light Magic from Dumbledore, which, in my opinion, completely misses the point of the books.

I pointed out (albeit sarcastically) relied on an assumption of Harry having some sort of an undeveloped general uber-talent in magic that Powerful!Harry mavens like yourself really like to believe, as opposed to his canon talents of being an amazingly talented athlete (youngest Seeker in a century, killed a giant basilisk with a sword having never wielded one before), with more courage and nerve than any three other Gryffindors combined, and a significantly above average, but not outstanding, talent for most magic, along with an extraordinary capacity for emotions to fuel his Patronus and an occasional Unforgivable, while arguably crippling his Occlumency against attackers who aren't Voldemort. When challenged, you defended your assumption with a very selective ant tenuous reading of canon, relevant parts of which you barely remembered.

At some point during that, I pointed out that Hermione might have been a better candidate for Special Training, which led you to start denigrating Hermione and me to start defending her, getting us even more side-tracked.

I would recommend a reread of canon books; but if you'd rather just persist in your beliefs, I recommend a swing or two of a dead cat on FF.net to find yet another Powerful!Gray!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore, Useless!Shrew!Hermione, Pathetic!Traitor!Ron, Amortentia!Molly, etc. masterpiece to read.
