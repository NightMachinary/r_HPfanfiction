DA members only managed casting in relative safety. Hermione and Ron both failed at it during the battle of Hogwarts, and Deus Ex Finnigan and gang came to the rescue.

Independent study? She reads the course work and knows the theory, thus giving her a heavy basis. It's easy to preform something when you understand its inner-workings.

I don't recall the second book well in details, as it was a snooze fest. Did Snape tell them specifically to use the Disarming Charm on each other? I remember them doing it in the DA, but I can't for the life of me remember Chamber, oh well. The Summoning Charm was an interesting chapter to read, but we have to account for the fact that Harry wasn't in a good emotional state when casting the spell, and concentration is key for magic in any universe.

Except, Vanishing is only started in O.W.L. Year, meanwhile Harry also had to deal with the torturing of McGonagall, the flight of George and Fred Weasely, etc... and still managed to score high. Once again, showing that despite not having one of the key things for a spell, he breaks a rule of magic. I would argue that Harry being considered the best in the year at DADA (the most encompassing form of magic taught at Hogwarts, dealing in charms, jinxes, hexes, curses, and transfiguration) by his own year, makes him better than others in his year. I don't recall Hermione mastering Transfiguration Spells as fast later in the years, nor Charms, she may get somethings right the first time but not everything. DA Parchment was kept from the entirety of the DA for a reason.

She was researching Elf enslavement's history, not the subject itself. Saying you did something thoroughly and still not showing any proof just means that she didn't research the reasoning for their enslavement, just that it's happened for a while.

Self-confidence and hubris are two different things, she was too confident in her spell work, and that's why she got hit by Dolohov's curse.

Was referring to him standing up in the middle of class and defending himself to Umbridge. Odd and out of place, as Harry usually does the whole 'silent fury' type deal, but I guess with how much angst was in that book he was going to start casting accidental magic again.

Look, I have no idea what the debate is even about at this point, it's becoming one of those boring canon duels where the two opponents just constantly throw beam/jet spells against the others shield, it's honestly boring and uninteresting. Hermione is a good wizard, but most of her strength comes from her understanding and extensive research of theory, Harry's comes from his natural talent when Rowling deems to show it. It's really that simple.
