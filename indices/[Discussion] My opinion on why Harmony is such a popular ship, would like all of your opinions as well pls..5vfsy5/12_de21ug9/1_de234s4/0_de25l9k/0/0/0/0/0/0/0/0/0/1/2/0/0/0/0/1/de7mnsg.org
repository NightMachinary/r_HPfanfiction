#+end_quote

Because Harry was said to be the youngest person to learn it.

  Furinculus at Draco right in the middle of the Summoning Charm
#+end_quote

A spell that he already knew, against an opponent the same age as him. Not much of a feat. I was arguing that slowed down speed of the learning of Summoning Charms was due to the fact that he was in an emotional rut, and even that he managed to cram it in one night, having little to no competence in it before hand.

#+begin_quote
  That's a rather contrived headcanon, compared to a much simpler and more consistent picture of Harry not being the prodigy that you seem to wish he were.
#+end_quote

Didn't say he was a prodigy in the slightest, once again you strawman the argument into some kind of figment-ed debate on whether Harry is a prodigy or not.

#+begin_quote
  That's just false. Hermione taught it to him after having "discovered" it. (It's ambiguous whether she found it in the library or discovered as in "scientific discovery", i.e., invented it.)
#+end_quote

That is most definitely a contrived headcanon.

#+begin_quote
  Not in passing. In lots of practice with Ron and Hermione during lunches leading up to the Third Task. Hermione and Ron probably learned them as well.
#+end_quote

In passing, as in during the period of time he learned the spells.

#+begin_quote
  Transfiguration is a useful magic, Harry could see it with his own two eyes, and he studied it along with everyone else, putting in his share of effort --- perhaps more, due to pressure from Hermione --- and earned a good enough grade to take the NEWT class. From what we saw, it came to him more easily than to Ron (though he had a hand-me-down wand at the time) but not as easily as it came to Hermione. Hardly an indication of prodigious talent. Now, a fic with TransfigurationMistress!Hermione would be interesting --- more canon support for it, and she and McGonagall would have an interesting dynamic.
#+end_quote

Le headcanon is strong. When did Harry extensively study transfiguration? You're, as you told me, finding information through lack of information.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was cheating from a book
#+end_quote

Has to be the dumbest argument I've ever heard. Especially since Hermione had used books throughout the entirety of her Hogwarts carrier, one can assume some even had footnotes in them. Does that make her a cheater? Nope, it just means that she could follow instructions.

  advanced-looking Conjuration in his second year,

Except it was a Hex, like you said, easier to learn harder to master.

  Powerful!Ron: when others were lifting feathers, he was lifting a troll's club, and with a hand-me-down wand at that;
#+end_quote

Going off the rails a bit mate.

#+begin_quote
  Say, had Snape modified an ingredient to speed up brewing but then forgotten to write down that a moderator of some sort is required to keep the potion from exploding (because that step was obvious to him)
#+end_quote

But he didn't. It's once again "what-ifs" that defend Hermione's choices and obvious jealousy, little to no facts. She wanted people to join SPEW, didn't tell them why house-elves were oppressed, or used several interview with clothed house-elves on their previous masters. She is like the author that attempts to wish-fulfill through her.

#+begin_quote
  But, would he be able and willing to invest as much time into it? Would it cultivate the same important sentiments, relationships, and allies?
#+end_quote

Invest? He's been training his Duelling since Third-Year inadvertently, who knows, it may come naturally to him as flying did.

#+begin_quote
  you'll have to be more specific about what tactics AgileDuelist!Harry might use against Voldemort that Voldemort couldn't easily counter.
#+end_quote

It's not AgileDuelist!Harry, it's more of DumbledorelikeDuellist!Harry. As Dumbledore had an over-aggressive Duelling style as well. Sitting back and allowing spells to hit you and turning them back at your opponent is a defensive style that Voldemort employed.

#+begin_quote
  That's probably accurate. To counter an epic-tier wizard like Voldemort, you need either another epic-tier wizard like Dumbledore or epic-tier magic like Sacrificial Protection. None of the Trio have the potential to be epic-tier in their teens, and possibly not ever.
#+end_quote

Cuts the quote in half and calls it my statement. Do you work for CNN? I said that Hermione would most definitely have a similar Duelling style to Voldemort, thus it would be advantageous to have someone with a polar-opposite Duelling style fight him.
