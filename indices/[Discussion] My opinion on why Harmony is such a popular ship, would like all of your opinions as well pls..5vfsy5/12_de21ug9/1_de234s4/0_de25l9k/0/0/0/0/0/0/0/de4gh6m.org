  It's canon that he can learn powerful magic with relative ease.
#+end_quote

He can? The Patronus took months of practice, and DA members only a year or two older learned it in a few weeks; other than that, there were some Dark Curses cast impulsively. (Those might count, but I don't know if they are particularly helpful against Voldemort.)

#+begin_quote
  And there you go again, Hermione may learn spells fast in a classroom setting
#+end_quote

Classroom setting, as well as independent study from books --- in other words, every way of learning other than personal tutelage, and we don't know about that one, since no one we know of ever offered her any.

#+begin_quote
  but Harry ultimately masters and learns exponentially quicker. Look at how he managed to cast a well-executed Disarming Charm despite only seeing it in passing once, from a Professor who likely mastered it to the point of not needing to use correct wand movements, and just incantation alone.
#+end_quote

Snape could have cast it silently, if he wanted to. However, Snape was demonstrating the spell, and his demonstration was deemed by everyone --- including other students --- to have been adequate for them to pair off for practice. Harry managing the Charm he was very interested in learning several days after that isn't that surprising. Nor do we know that he didn't practice it off-screen --- since he wanted to learn it, he probably did.

On the other hand, recall his struggles with the Summoning Charm, where he was doing as badly as Neville. Other than the really emotion-driven stuff like the Patronus and the Unforgivables, magic does not come to Harry that much more easily than to his peers.

#+begin_quote
  Sure, with studying Hermione is his equal, and maybe better in Transfiguration, but Harry is ultimately naturally talented, as shown when he managed to vanish the iguana without even practicing the spell.
#+end_quote

During his OWLs? He had spent the prior 5 years taking Transfiguration, the same as everyone else, with most classes and homework taking place off-screen. So, yes, he had practiced vanishing things a lot.

On the other hand, whenever a new spell or class of magic is introduced and we get to see Hermione's performance at all (i.e., not private lessons like Patronus or Occlumency, and not off-screen), she is invariably the first to master it: Transfiguration, nonverbal casting, Apparition, and there were probably others that I don't remember off the top of my head; and she casually picks up complex spells (Protean Charm, Memory Charm, False Memory Charm, Undetectable Extension Charm, DA Parchment Jinx, etc.) from books and executes them perfectly after no or limited practice like it was nothing. (There is also some indirect evidence that she might have picked up Occlumency, but it's not very strong.)

#+begin_quote
  Her best kept secret was a Time-Turner that she literally needed because she thought she could take every class at once, she may have hubris, but no sense of self-awareness.
#+end_quote

I was actually thinking about the DA Parchment Jinx in OotP, but keeping the Time-Turner secret is also a good example, so that makes two; thanks. No idea what overconfidence or hubris has to do with it.

#+begin_quote
  No, everyman heros are people that act like heroes in every situation, not matter the difference in circumstance. A Slytherin Harry would be distinctly different, especially if you take Harry before Hogwarts into account, where he would rather run away than stand up to his bullies (shown to not be a problem after getting into Gryffindor, as he stood up to Malfoy and his cronies multiple times). I only recall post-Dursley Harry doing that once in Deathly Hallows with the snatchers.
#+end_quote

We will never know what a Slytherin!Harry would have been like. Running away from a gang of bullies against whom he doesn't have a chance --- and when he would receive a worse punishment from his guardians if he did fight back --- is not really indicative of his character, I think.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione wanted to fix what wasn't broken.
#+end_quote

Oh, it was broken alright. However, I don't want to get into ethics of House-Elves at the moment.

#+begin_quote
  She went on a crusade for the better treatment of Elfish Welfare with no evidence, and just plain "It's their born rights!". Not even listening to the other side of the argument.
#+end_quote

From GoF:

    She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them. â€˜I've been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can't believe no one's done anything about it before now.'
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

When Hermione says she researched something thoroughly, she researched it thoroughly.

#+begin_quote
  That shows narcissism and tunnel-vision, not a very heroic combo.
#+end_quote

Well, you need to have an excess of self-confidence to believe that you can change the world as a teenager, and you've got to have focus to actually do it. If anything, these traits are necessary for this type of heroine or hero.

#+begin_quote
  Whether her peers want to learn a charm? She has only done that for a stranger a total of once, and that was Ron before he was friends with her. I think you diluting headcanon, fanfiction, and canon into one big pot.
#+end_quote

Call it headcanon, if you want. We don't get to see every minute of Harry's life, and we get to see Hermione only when she is around and Harry is paying attention to what she is doing, so we have to interpolate things from what we do see.

Anyway, there was also the DA. If Hermione wanted to maximize her DADA OWL scores, she could have stopped with a small group of Gryffindors, simplifying the logistics and all but eliminating the risk of being caught. She didn't, however.

#+begin_quote
  Without his friends he would have been considerably less reckless indeed. I can't recall a single moment where he was in trouble in Hogwarts, where the main cause hadn't been his friends, other then maybe fifth year?
#+end_quote

Interesting. My memory is that it's pretty much completely the other way round: Ron and Hermione don't generally drag Harry on adventures, Harry drags them.

#+begin_quote
  Where he acted super OOC for what Rowling was trying to build-up, to defend... something?
#+end_quote

Are you referring to the Department of Mysteries? Seemed pretty IC to me.
