  Is one of the most boring things to read, and it's pointless. I would much rather have a Dumbledore that is there to help Harry out and train him up. Last paragraph is a strawman in its entirety.
#+end_quote

I was being snarky. You fit the profile to a T.

#+begin_quote
  No, I'm saying that none of them mastered it as they couldn't do it faced with a Dementor. During the Battle of Hogwarts Shamus and the other two weren't in range of the Dementors, thus using the patronus in safety.
#+end_quote

Just like the time-turned Harry had in PoA?

#+begin_quote
  Harry is the only one who attended DA that actually mastered it, and he is the teacher.
#+end_quote

Hermione cast one in the Ministry, albeit with some difficulty. I'm pretty sure Ron had some successes as well, though I could be wrong about that.

#+begin_quote
  Essays can be done on topics you don't understand by simply rephrasing the material in a different way. Harry didn't get absolutely perfect scores on his essays (as he never mentioned it) so we are left to assume that he was mediocre or maybe even clueless at theory-related things.
#+end_quote

I don't think that's fair to Harry. He spends a lot of time on his homework, and he is plenty bright --- definitely significantly above average in general intelligence. He certainly doesn't understand magical theory as well as Hermione, but he probably understands it better than the average Hogwarts student (especially since Hermione looks over his essays --- or is that fanon?). In terms of end-results, he did almost exactly as well as Ron on his OWLs, except for DADA, on which he did better.

#+begin_quote
  Because it was memorable, and it wasn't specific.
#+end_quote

It was an argument for Harry's uber-talent that relied on Harry mastering a particular spell quickly and after an inadequate demonstration. It turned out that he didn't do it quickly and that the demonstration was considered to be quite adequate by all present.

#+begin_quote
  Exactly, Harry hadn't cast the Disarming Charm ever, until the scene with Lockhart in the Chamber's entry way.
#+end_quote

He cast it at Draco a few days later, as well.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, he didn't use it much until the third task. When he was already in the clear and most people didn't care if he put his name in or not.
#+end_quote

His very ability to perform the first Task relied on being able to Summon his broom.

#+begin_quote
  The spell that bound them to not reveal any information about the DA was on the DA parchment.
#+end_quote

I know. I was trying to figure out what Hermione keeping it secret had to do with anything.

#+begin_quote
  Actually several spells were thrown around, especially at Harry.
#+end_quote

Go reread that scene. What spells we do get to see aimed at Harry tend to be Stunners and such.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione getting hit was due to her silencing an enemy but not accounting for wordless magic.
#+end_quote

I don't think I ever claimed that Hermione was an epic duellist, or even particularly good or interested in it. It's just, Harry, while he might punch slightly above his weight class, isn't one either.

#+begin_quote
  Read it before. Has the usual trope of Harry making friends in a house of people that hate him.
#+end_quote

Seemed plausible to me; Slytherin isn't Game of Thrones Jr., it's a bunch of 11 year olds, and some of them find Draco grating.

#+begin_quote
  It falls into the habit of giving a character that doesn't even show up in canon, a personality, and it got boring very fast.
#+end_quote

How would you propose to write a Slytherin!Harry fanfic, then? Pretend that Harry's House and Year are exclusively Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy?

#+begin_quote
  Here we go with the Lights, the Greys, and the Darks. No, just, no, Magic doesn't have sides.
#+end_quote

I was using the nomenclature that you introduced in the very first line of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5vfsy5/discussion_my_opinion_on_why_harmony_is_such_a/de4a0a1/]] , and sarcastically at that.

#+begin_quote
  Well, that's because he does. Pretty much the entire story we've heard about his 'potential', his 'ability',
#+end_quote

The word "potential" appears in the canon books 8 times, none of them referring to Harry's potential. "Ability" appears a total of 22 times. When it referrs to Harry, it refers to Parselmouth ability (3), his Potions skills due to cheating from Snape's book (2), to love (1), and ability to sense Voldemort through his scar (1).

People are grateful to him and might expect great things from him for being BWL, and people admire his Patronus, which is a significant achievement, but probably not that significant: the reason so few adults can do it is that most adults don't take NEWTs in DADA, where it's taught; and the reason it's taught at the NEWT level is that unless you know Dumbledore's communication trick or expect to coral Dementors, it's completely useless.

#+begin_quote
  even Hermione has admitted that he is better than her in some aspects of magic.
#+end_quote

Seems accurate. Harry is better at practical DADA, flying, and Divination; Hermione at everything else.

#+begin_quote
  Sure, she can learn transfiguration faster,
#+end_quote

Transfiguration, Nonverbal Casting, Apparition, the Summoning Charm, and every other instance when we get a chance to compare, but who's counting?

#+begin_quote
  but Harry is the only one who would use it effectively in a battle (hence why we never see Hermione use it other than to conjure tiny birds to attack Ron).
#+end_quote

I don't recall Harry ever using Transfiguration in battle. When did that happen? (The only ones I do recall using it are McGonagall and Dumbledore.)

#+begin_quote
  Sorry if JKR couldn't help but go on the Love>Magical Power train everytime it mattered.
#+end_quote

That's because it mattered. Magic is not morally neutral. In any case, by "selective", I mean cherry-picking instances of Harry's overachievement --- either real or misremembered --- and ignoring instances where he shows his limitations.

#+begin_quote
  If Harry is the type of person to not take things sitting down, as you say. Why didn't he train himself up for Voldemort? Why didn't he ask Dumbledore directly for extra magical training? Especially since after his fourth year, all of Dumbledore's political duties were relieved, thus giving him free-time (that's why we got the Memory training that could have taken one day but instead took several weeks).
#+end_quote

It's not about the will, it's about the disposition. Harry doesn't plan for the long term like that. That said, I would argue that this behavior was actually rational under the circumstances. In a nutshell, Tom Riddle was the more talented wizard by far, and he had several decades' head start and the more ruthless disposition. There was no way Harry could be "trained up" in four or even seven years to face him in a pitched battle and win. Training in the Power That Voldemort Knows Better Than Anyone would therefore not have been productive, but it would have detracted from things that Harry actually wanted to do: hanging out with Ron, being mothered by Molly, playing Quiddich, dating --- all things that cultivated the Power That Voldemort Knows Not (not to mention all the combat-relevant skills developed in Quiddich).

More generally, Harry finds his existing coursework plenty challenging, so extra training seems superfluous. Like I wrote, training up Hermione to watch Harry's back would probably be more productive, but probably not worth Dumbledore's time either.

#+begin_quote
  Kek, Voldemort relied on people more than canon Harry did.
#+end_quote

Voldemort had numerous minions. Harry had a small number of loyal friends. There's a difference.

#+begin_quote
  But, as I said, Harry could look for people to support him that aren't two people his own age. We have a large pool of highly trained wizards with life experience to choose from,
#+end_quote

Well, most of these people, if they were to spend too much time in Hogwarts, would raise eyebrows. Since most important (to Harry) stuff that's even remotely predictable happens in Hogwarts, adults might not be the most practical support team.

For that matter, I think that you're underestimating just how short-staffed the Order is.

#+begin_quote
  you wan't a guy that can teach Harry how to transform into an animal? A useful ability that could have probably gotten him and his friends away from danger multiple times? Well Sirius Black is your guy.
#+end_quote

Unless all three of them lucked out with small, stealthy, or flight-capable forms, it's not nearly as useful as it sounds. Now that we've learned what that entails, I can see why Harry & Co. didn't go for it. It's tedious, time-consuming, risks permanent deformation, and with Harry's family history and Patronus, he'd probably get a stag, which is only slightly less useless than a kangaroo. (He can run a little faster, but he is a bigger target.)

#+begin_quote
  Want a highly-trained Auror who has more experience with taking out Dark Wizards than Mr. I took out Grindelwald? We've got Alistor Moody, a retired Auror with nothing better to do than throw spells out in the dark of night.
#+end_quote

Again, consider the logistics. The only book that took place mostly outside of Hogwarts was DH, and Moody was dead for most of that.

#+begin_quote
  So why didn't he take up Duelling? It's a sport.
#+end_quote

He might have, had the Dueling Club lasted.
