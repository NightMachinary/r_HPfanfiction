Ah, the classic "It's up to you to decide if you want to continue because I have nothing else of value to say and cannot disprove any of your points". I will consider this debate forfeited on your account then?

Harry didn't seem to have any attention on the subject, nor did he feel the need/want to acquire knowledge on it. He did not read any extra material than the bare-minimum for it (unlike DADA where he got books on Jinxes, Curses and Counter Curses etc...) He didn't sign up for Transfiguration Today, he didn't read any extra books on the properties of Elemental Transfiguration, it can be assumed that he didn't thoroughly study the subject then. We can assume that he was solely taught whatever knowledge he had on the subject.
