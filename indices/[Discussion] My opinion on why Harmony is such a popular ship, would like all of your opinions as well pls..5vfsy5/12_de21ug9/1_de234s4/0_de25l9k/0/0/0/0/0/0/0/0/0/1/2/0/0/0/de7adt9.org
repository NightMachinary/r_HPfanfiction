  "The Patronus is a form of advanced magic, which even the most qualified wizards can struggle with. Harry Potter is one of the youngest wizards to cast a corporeal Patronus, having been taught by Professor Lupin at the tender age of thirteen."-Pottermore, What is a Patronus?

  In that case, I don't understand why you brought up the whole Third Task matter. My understanding of your argument is that his difficulties with learning the Summoning Charm were not evidence for his lack of genius but rather explained away by his being discombobulated due to TWT; however, if that were the case, his existing magical abilities would have been affected as well, there might have been outbursts of accidental magic, and other evidence of that, and yet there weren't that I can recall. Am I forgetting anything? Was Harry fumbling other spells at the time?
#+end_quote

He wasn't using any other magic until the third task, is what I was pointing out. The Summoning Charm was either an inconsistency, or Harry's emotional status messing with his spells, as I assume focus is the most necessary thing to learning a spell. Accidental Magic seems like something that only happens to children, even Harry during POA using it was rather odd for everybody. Personally I think it was a bit of Rowling trying to show us how powerful Harry is, as she seems to use accidental magic like an ace, showing that that's all that's needed to scan for a powerful wizard.

  Dark Arts books are available in Hogwarts library. Hocrux books were there too, until Dumbledore removed them. Riddle was also a popular, charismatic student, who lived in a house known for producing Dark Wizards and charmed all his teachers but one besides. For that matter, how much training would he need? Given what happened with Sectumsempra, I suspect that Dark Arts are dangerous because they are too easy.
#+end_quote

I always thought that Dark Magic was easy to learn, hard to master. Hence why Harry couldn't cut through Draco completely, or why his Crucio came out like a Crucio but didn't last as long. This is further proven when Crabbe used Fiendfyre and didn't know how to stop it.

  Read the Pottermore stuff on the procedure.
#+end_quote

It's putting a mandrake leaf in your mouth for a month, then using that leaf for a potion while saying an incantation and drinking it everyday. While the process seems a bit tough, I doubt it's impossible, especially for someone like Harry who when motivated continues to try and try even if he doesn't always get it. While you may deny the fact that he learned the Patronus Charm in relative haste, you can't deny that he didn't continue trying and trying until he got it right.

#+begin_quote
  Harry liked Quiddich; the flying in particular, as well as being admired for something he did on his own merits, rather than something that killed his parents. Giving him Extra Training would detract from that.
#+end_quote

That's the whole point of the story. Harry changing as he gets older, if he stuck to his morals of eleven years old, then there is a reason why he would have lost the war either way.

  Learning the magic of the Patronus took months
#+end_quote

The lessons with Lupin were sporadic, and he didn't always have powerful memories for the Patronus itself. He didn't practice it every day of every month, it was more like every two weeks for a single day.

  TWT magic
#+end_quote

Tri-Wizard Tournament Magic? I mean, he still learned The Summoning Charm in one night of cramming with Hermione. He learned Point Me! from Hermione simply telling him the incantation. Reducto and all the other spells were likely learned in passing.

#+begin_quote
  So it's a hypothetical that we can't resolve either way, so not evidence of anything. What we see in canon suggests that other than some specific spells (Serpensortia), combat Transfiguration is only useful if one has other reasons to master Transfiguration.
#+end_quote

It'd be easier to see Transfiguration as 6 spells with single incantations followed by the latin name for the thing you're transfiguring the object into/conjuring/animating. Switching would be a matter of a single incantation without any name after it. Untransfiguring would be easy as well. Vanishing was supposed to be hard for Harry, but once again, that could be because of his emotional state during fifth year (Voldemort fucking with him and all). So then Serpensortia was a Hex or Jinx of some kind, if we use my idea of shooting something out being easier than controlling it for Darker Magic, then the situation with Malfoy and the Snake makes perfect sense. Regular Transfiguration is hard, because it requires a lot of effort, patience, imagination, understanding of the subject, and natural born skill. James Potter was supposed to be very good at the subject; from what we see of Teddy Lupin, parents can hand-down their abilities to children, so in turn there is a case to be made for a Transfiguration!Master Harry.

Due to Harry's reactive nature in the books, it was more of a question of who would tell him that Transfiguration is a useful magic? The answer is no one to put it simply. I guess it would have caused unnecessary issues with Hermione (remember how she reacted after Harry increased his skill in potions?) so Rowling just put a stop to them, someone might go thinking that they were the better paring or something, we can't have that.

  talented athlete with excellent reflexes
#+end_quote

That's exactly why Duelling would have done well for him, dodging spells would improve your reflexes far better than catching a snitch. And that is exactly why training him would have been vital. If you were to train Hermione, she would be a Voldemort-like Duellist, maybe even a bit worse. She would sit still and allow things to come to her, she would have to use shields instead of dodging, and she would apparate to gain advantage across the battle-field. Hermione would be instantaneously killed by a person like Voldemort, who had perfected that style of Duelling.

#+begin_quote
  more skilled opponent like Snape, to say nothing of Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Harry was beaten by Snape due to his reliance on spoken incantation, and the fact that he was in an emotional rut.

  That's not really unusual: what is extraordinary becomes mundane very quickly. For a worldly example, consider how amazing is, say, a smartphone from the point of view of someone from even 30 years ago.
#+end_quote

But a day after you get into the magical world fully? Is that how long it takes to get bored of an infinite force that can do whatever you want, provided you have the ability? I would think to someone living in the mundane world, that would be something you could never get bored of. Hermione being a prime-example in that regard.
