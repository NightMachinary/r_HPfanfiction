I hate that logic. When something isn't there, you look for a way to make it there in a kind of full circle way. No, I doubt Rowling was capable of that kind of thinking, or else she wouldn't need to tack on Pseudo-Characterization on Twitter and in Interviews.

No, Dumbledore didn't do what he could. He could have done more, sadly he saw Harry's attachment, and realised that any ancient magics he would teach Harry, would immediately be regurgitated to his friends who didn't have Occlumency, due to his dependency on them.

If he wasn't capable of higher thinking, you should tell that to him before he walked into the forest. Throughout the entire thing the narrator was going through Harry's existential crisis (which once again, we don't see from a 1st person POV, because Rowling is not capable of higher thinking herself) and the fact that he wanted to run more than help everybody.

If he was an everyman hero, the Sorting Hat wouldn't have wanted to send him to Slytherin. It would have been instant Gryffindor. The reasoning for the serious change, is likely because Harry had friends, he had a safety net so he couldn't fall, and had limiters on what he could do to ensure it even further.
