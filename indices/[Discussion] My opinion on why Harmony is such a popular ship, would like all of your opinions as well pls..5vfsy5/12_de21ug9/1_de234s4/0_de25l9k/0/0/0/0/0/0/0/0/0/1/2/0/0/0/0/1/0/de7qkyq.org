  Because Harry was said to be the youngest person to learn it.
#+end_quote

Not /the/ youngest; one of the youngest, technically. And, you yourself argued that it doesn't really count if the dementor can't see you (since you argued that Seamus doesn't count), which means that the one that does count is the start of OotP, when there were only a handful of Dementors to boot. (Personally, I think it counts whether or not there's a dementor nearby, since the magical skill involved in casting the spell is the same; the rest is courage, nerve, distractability, etc.; but that would mean that learning it at 13 as opposed to 16 in DA is no big deal, so it's not indicative of any great magical talent.)

    Furinculus at Draco right in the middle of the Summoning Charm
  #+end_quote

  A spell that he already knew, against an opponent the same age as him. Not much of a feat. I was arguing that slowed down speed of the learning of Summoning Charms was due to the fact that he was in an emotional rut, and even that he managed to cram it in one night, having little to no competence in it before hand.
#+end_quote

This Amazing Emotional Rut, that didn't actually manifest in any concrete way except this very specific way that is critical to your case. Like I said, painfully contrived.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    That's a rather contrived headcanon, compared to a much simpler and more consistent picture of Harry not being the prodigy that you seem to wish he were.
  #+end_quote

  Didn't say he was a prodigy in the slightest, once again you strawman the argument into some kind of figment-ed debate on whether Harry is a prodigy or not.
#+end_quote

Well, we seem to be debating about whether or not Harry was a talented enough wizard to be able to fight Voldemort (a confirmed prodigy) on even terms while still in his teens, whether his accidental magic indicates that he is very powerful at the start of the story, etc.. The word "prodigy" seems to fit, but if you insist, we can use a different one.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    That's just false. Hermione taught it to him after having "discovered" it. (It's ambiguous whether she found it in the library or discovered as in "scientific discovery", i.e., invented it.)
  #+end_quote

  That is most definitely a contrived headcanon.
#+end_quote

Now you're just doing the /Tu Quoque/ Fallacy, and misamedly, since it's an ambiguity and I happen to think that Hermione probably didn't invent it; but then you're using as an excuse to ignore the more important point that it was Hermione --- and not Sirius --- that showed Harry the Charm, and it's right there in the text, and there's no indication of him learning it any faster than others. I reiterate my recommendation that you brush up on canon.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Not in passing. In lots of practice with Ron and Hermione during lunches leading up to the Third Task. Hermione and Ron probably learned them as well.
  #+end_quote

  In passing, as in during the period of time he learned the spells.
#+end_quote

That's a tautology. He learned the spells when he learned the spells, over months of lunches, and with the help of his friends, who also learned the spells or at least helped him practice. There's nothing extraordinary about it.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Transfiguration is a useful magic, Harry could see it with his own two eyes, and he studied it along with everyone else, putting in his share of effort --- perhaps more, due to pressure from Hermione --- and earned a good enough grade to take the NEWT class. From what we saw, it came to him more easily than to Ron (though he had a hand-me-down wand at the time) but not as easily as it came to Hermione. Hardly an indication of prodigious talent. Now, a fic with TransfigurationMistress!Hermione would be interesting --- more canon support for it, and she and McGonagall would have an interesting dynamic.
  #+end_quote

  Le headcanon is strong.
#+end_quote

I assume you are referring to my speculation about Hermione's potential; the rest is plain reading of canon.

#+begin_quote
  When did Harry extensively study transfiguration? You're, as you told me, finding information through lack of information.
#+end_quote

He studied it for six years at Hogwarts, in McGonagall's class and through homework assigned in that class, just like everyone else. Do you deny that?

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Harry was cheating from a book
  #+end_quote

  Has to be the dumbest argument I've ever heard. Especially since Hermione had used books throughout the entirety of her Hogwarts carrier, one can assume some even had footnotes in them. Does that make her a cheater? Nope, it just means that she could follow instructions.
#+end_quote

Going to the library to research a topic is not the same as looking up the answers to specific class problems in the very same book. It's a gray area, and Hermione might be more strict than others. My other point about dangerousness was probably more important.

    advanced-looking Conjuration in his second year,
  #+end_quote

  Except it was a Hex, like you said, easier to learn harder to master.
#+end_quote

It's ambiguous. The point is that you can make a better case for Transfigurationist!Draco than the one you had made for Harry.

#+begin_quote

    Powerful!Ron: when others were lifting feathers, he was lifting a troll's club, and with a hand-me-down wand at that;
  #+end_quote

  Going off the rails a bit mate.
#+end_quote

Read what I actually wrote. I am not asserting a Powerful!Ron; I'm pointing out that you can make a case for anything with enough mental gymnastics, and that doesn't mean that it's a good case.

    Say, had Snape modified an ingredient to speed up brewing but then forgotten to write down that a moderator of some sort is required to keep the potion from exploding (because that step was obvious to him)
  #+end_quote

  But he didn't. It's once again "what-ifs" that defend Hermione's choices and obvious jealousy, little to no facts. [+ Hermione SPEW stuff]
#+end_quote

With 20-20 hindsight, we know that Snape's Potions instructions were good. Neither Harry nor Hermione had any way of knowing that /at the time she made her argument/. You can't judge a character (or a person) for not taking into account information he or she didn't have and couldn't have obtained without nontrivial risk and expense (i.e., actually brewing the Potions). On the other hand, you /can/ judge a character for recklessness when they make a decision not having considered the limitations of their knowledge --- such as Harry with the HBP book or Hermione with SPEW.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    But, would he be able and willing to invest as much time into it? Would it cultivate the same important sentiments, relationships, and allies?
  #+end_quote

  Invest? He's been training his Duelling since Third-Year inadvertently, who knows, it may come naturally to him as flying did.
#+end_quote

Maybe, maybe not. The point is, we know he likes Quiddich and flying in particular. Duelling? Harry isn't particularly competitive that I can recall, so my prediction would be that Quiddich > Duelling, but intelligent, well-intentioned people can disagree on this particular point.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    you'll have to be more specific about what tactics AgileDuelist!Harry might use against Voldemort that Voldemort couldn't easily counter.
  #+end_quote

  It's not AgileDuelist!Harry, it's more of DumbledorelikeDuellist!Harry. As Dumbledore had an over-aggressive Duelling style as well. Sitting back and allowing spells to hit you and turning them back at your opponent is a defensive style that Voldemort employed.
#+end_quote

I thought that you meant that Harry's athletic talents could facilitate a combat style that could beat Voldemort while requiring less magical skill than what's needed to match Voldemort spell-for-spell. If you're advocating Dumbledore's style, Harry's not going to be able to manage that in his teens, no matter how hard you train him in Duelling and Transfiguration: it would require him to be a /more/ talented wizard than Voldemort and Dumbledore, since both of them had decades' headstart. And, Dumbledore's style requires a phoenix.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    That's probably accurate. To counter an epic-tier wizard like Voldemort, you need either another epic-tier wizard like Dumbledore or epic-tier magic like Sacrificial Protection. None of the Trio have the potential to be epic-tier in their teens, and possibly not ever.
  #+end_quote

  Cuts the quote in half and calls it my statement. Do you work for CNN?
#+end_quote

Reddit has a 10k character limit on posts, and I keep hitting it. I don't think what I cut was misleading. (On the other hand, I'm still waiting for counterarguments to some of my better points; or should I consider them conceded?)

#+begin_quote
  I said that Hermione would most definitely have a similar Duelling style to Voldemort, thus it would be advantageous to have someone with a polar-opposite Duelling style fight him.
#+end_quote

I don't think there's any point speculating what fighting style Hermione might develop if she focused on learning to fight, because none of the Trio could be "trained up" to beat Voldemort in a pitched battle while in their teens in the first place. Training up Hermione to watch Harry's back would be more about protecting him from more ordinary threats, while Prophecy / Sacrificial Protection / Brother Wands / Wandlore stuff facilitated Harry defeating Voldemort himself.
