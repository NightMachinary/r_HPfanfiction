  Forgetting Order of The Phoenix are we?
#+end_quote

The point is that if Seamus doesn't count, then neither does Harry in his third year --- he doesn't cast it in the face of a Dementor until his fifth.

In any case, given experiences of characters who'd been in both situations, what separates being able to cast in ideal circumstances from being able to cast against a Dementor is not degree of magical talent or skill but rather non-magical personality traits like courage, nerve, and a certain kind of stubbornness.

#+begin_quote
  But you later say that he doesn't have the mental strength to think ahead? You should probably choose one, it's getting a bit out of composition.
#+end_quote

Oh, Harry does his week-to-week homework certainly --- with some reluctance and procrastination --- and he also does extra studying when he has an immediate magical need (Dementors -> Patronus, TWT -> DADA). What I don't see him doing is any sort of long-term plan for independent study.

#+begin_quote
  He had yet to try the spell after demonstration.
#+end_quote

And your point? He had seen the spell demonstrated, and that was deemed adequate for everybody present to start practicing, so it's not an unusual feat that he was able to do it after the demonstration.

#+begin_quote
  Page number?
#+end_quote

It's p. 355 in the ePub edition I have.

#+begin_quote
  Out of context. You said that he was capable of casting different spells with no hindrance to magical ability due to his sporadic emotional state, yet it took him much longer to learn the summoning charm because of his emotional state.
#+end_quote

In that case, I don't understand why you brought up the whole Third Task matter. My understanding of your argument is that his difficulties with learning the Summoning Charm were not evidence for his lack of genius but rather explained away by his being discombobulated due to TWT; however, if that were the case, his existing magical abilities would have been affected as well, there might have been outbursts of accidental magic, and other evidence of that, and yet there weren't that I can recall. Am I forgetting anything? Was Harry fumbling other spells at the time?

#+begin_quote
  Is the Patronus not a spirit gurdian that uses its light to repel a Dementor? It's powerful light-based magic, I see nothing wrong with calling it light.
#+end_quote

So what's your problem with me using the expression ironically?

#+begin_quote
  Remus is quoted as saying it's way past the level of anything you'd learn at Hogwarts, including NEWT level.
#+end_quote

The Wikia wiki says something to this end, but I can't find an actual canon reference that it's not taught at Hogwarts, so I'm going to have to ask you for one before I buy that.

#+begin_quote
  Pottermore says that it is the sign of a greatly powerful wizard.
#+end_quote

Link, please. Pottermore article on the Patronus says no such thing. If anything, conviction of one's own rightness plays a bigger role --- Umbridge could cast one.

#+begin_quote
  What do you think training Harry entails?
#+end_quote

To the point of facing Voldemort in a pitched battle and winning without some Deux Ex Machina like Brother Wands or Sacrificial Protection? I'm the one who thinks it's not possible. You're the one advocating for it. You tell me.

#+begin_quote
  I doubt it would take more than even three years to get him there. How many years do you think Voldemort had to train in his 'Ancient Magic' before the war started.
#+end_quote

If we go by the Wikia, the fighting started around 1970, so Voldemort was 44. He had made his first horcruxes while still at Hogwarts. Quite a few years, in short.

#+begin_quote
  he may have picked up a couple good spellbooks on certain curses, but no comprehensive Dark Magic training, unless he had an unknown mentor.
#+end_quote

Dark Arts books are available in Hogwarts library. Hocrux books were there too, until Dumbledore removed them. Riddle was also a popular, charismatic student, who lived in a house known for producing Dark Wizards and charmed all his teachers but one besides. For that matter, how much training would he need? Given what happened with Secumstempa, I suspect that Dark Arts are dangerous because they are /too easy/.

#+begin_quote
  We see a transfigured serpent made of fire that Dumbledore already made
#+end_quote

He fought Dumbledore to a standstill. What more do you want?

#+begin_quote
  His greatest feat in the book was unassisted flying, and that is more of a vulnerability in combat than a strength.
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. For all their versatility, wands have crappy ergonomics for aiming and slow rate of fire (even with nonverbal casting, which IIRC weakens the spell), so their effective range is pretty bad. Now, a target in the air requires a direct hit to count, while there are spells that can harm a target on the ground upon a near miss through fire or debris. So, that's a tactical advantage right there.

#+begin_quote
  Numerous minions that he knew by name and personally exchanged with. Voldemort definitely had friends, maybe even people he cared about, his search for immortality was just a little stronger, he constantly reminded himself that only he could be immortal, and attachment was pointless, despite already being attached.
#+end_quote

Tom Riddle had people who considered him a friend and thought they were his friends. However, all evidence points towards him being a classic psychopath, viewing people as tools at best and obstacles at worst. By the time he returned from death, only a handful remained who still remembered him from Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius, Remus, and James did it in two years, and they were third years (when they started), and hiding from professors the whole entire time. A Harry assisted by a full-grown Sirius would be easily able to get it down in the same span, or maybe less.
#+end_quote

Read the Pottermore stuff on the procedure. The most amazing thing about their feat is not that they pulled it off but that they pulled it off without anybody else noticing.

#+begin_quote
  More evidence points to Phoenix, Griffin, or Lion.
#+end_quote

Fair enough about the Patronus, but a /phoenix/, really? Can animagi even be magical creatures? And, a lion isn't that much more useful than a stag: a bit better CQC attack, but an even bigger target and worse endurance. In fact, while a stag can hide in a forest in England (outside of hunting season), a lion would stand out.

Of the Marauders, Pettigrew got the hands-down most useful form.

All that said, given his love of Quiddich, I think that if not a stag, Harry had a pretty good shot at a bird form, which would have been useful indeed, so maybe he should have tried it.

#+begin_quote
  It was shown that students can have tutoring on the side (Occlumency lessons disguised as Potions). How hard is it to sneak Moody in with Dumbledore's assistance?
#+end_quote

Perhaps it could be done, at the cost of things that made Harry's life worth living. I still don't buy that Harry would benefit from it. His classes are sufficiently challenging for him, as far as I can tell. DADA is an exception, of course, but since extra training is not going to significantly change his odds against Voldemort, I don't see the point of extra tutoring in that.

#+begin_quote
  Last I checked, Duelling was a one on one thing. Harry showed no remote interest in it, even when it was helpful to him, yet he apparently liked sports.
#+end_quote

Harry liked Quiddich; the flying in particular, as well as being admired for something he did on his own merits, rather than something that killed his parents. Giving him Extra Training would detract from that.

#+begin_quote
  Edit: Concerning the Transfiguration thing. In that context I was saying that if Harry was to put a bit more stock into Transfiguration, instead of seeing it as a hurdle for OWLs, he would have relied on it a bit more in combat.
#+end_quote

So it's a hypothetical that we can't resolve either way, so not evidence of anything. What we see in canon suggests that other than some specific spells (Serpensortia), combat Transfiguration is only useful if one has other reasons to master Transfiguration.

#+begin_quote
  He is shown to learn and utilize magic in a short span of time when needed
#+end_quote

Learning the magic of the Patronus took months, as did TWT magic. (Google for a timeline of PoA if you want to verify.) Dark Arts he seems to have some talent for, probably best not developed.

In any case, Harry's advantage is less that he can learn lots of powerful magic quickly and more that he is a highly talented athlete with excellent reflexes, good at keeping his head when under pressure and can generally pick the right spell to use in the situation. I would contend that this is less about magical talents and more about non-magical ones.

However, this sort of talent can only take one so far against a more skilled opponent like Snape, to say nothing of Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Sadly, he became unconcerned with magic itself despite showing great interest right before getting on the train,
#+end_quote

That's not really unusual: what is extraordinary becomes mundane very quickly. For a worldly example, consider how amazing is, say, a smartphone from the point of view of someone from even 30 years ago. Yet, how many people, upon getting one, become preoccupied with learning how to program apps on one, much less learn how one works?

#+begin_quote
  On a side note, is there a reason why he didn't consider the Sword of Gryffindor for the first task? It's a versatile weapon, shown to be capable of taking out serpentine creatures much like a Dragon, unintentionally impregnates itself with whatever it touches. If Harry stabbed through the roof of the Dragon's mouth, the sword would start spewing out fire. Sounds awesome.
#+end_quote

It kind of does. On the other hand, with SoG after CoS, there's no middle ground: he'd either kill the dragon with basilisk poison or fail the task. I think it's better that he won without killing the dragon.
