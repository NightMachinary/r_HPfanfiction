1) Harry wasn't in his teens at the end of Deathly Hallows, since he was at the age of majority and capable of drinking alcohol, it can be assumed that he is an adult on all counts.

2) Dumbledore's style doesn't require a Phoenix, it's just a lot easier to keep up with the all-out attack, rather than stopping to apparate out of the way of a killing curse. You could easily mimic it with a Phoenix Animagus.

3) The easiest way to become more than those two wizards is by training under one of them. Once again, Dumbledore is the answer. He taught McGonagall how to attain her Animagus, and taught her Transfiguration when he was a Professor.

Had he been in his prime, I believe that he would have overwhelmed Voldemort. Elder Wand or not, it was his old body that acted as an Achilles Heel.

So we have to ask this who could take the place of a younger Dumbledore? To me, all of it points to Harry Potter. Sure Dumbledore could go out and train an Auror Cadet with already all the basic knowledge, since they have the full seven years of Hogwarts under their belt, plus Auror Training. But in the end it comes down to Harry, just Harry he understands that the Prophecy is self-fulfilling, and that attempting to circumvent it by training someone else, would only result in a very dead Harry and a very gone Wizarding World.

Lets look at what Training may entail, since you believe that it is this miraculous sixty year feat. Duelling, Elemental Magic, Transfiguration, DADA, Dark Arts (maybe), Occlumency.

Duelling is easy, it's just forms and learning how to read your opponent, looking for blind sides. A good example of this is the Duel in the Artrium, as that is the only elaborated upon Duel in the book.

Elemental Magic is a hard subject in truth, but I'm sure it's nothing that Harry can't handle. Judging by Harry's later life in Cursed Child, we can assume he has an affinity for fire magic.

Transfiguration is Dumbledore's forte, it isn't even a question that he could help Harry master it.

DADA is Harry's forte, once again, no question.

The Dark Arts themselves are a bit of an odd spot for Dumbledore, maybe he would teach Harry a few general spells? But they would definitely not delve into Necromancy or anything like that, as there simply isn't enough time, although Time-Turner Training wouldn't be impossible.

Dumbledore already confirmed that he could have taught Harry Occlumency in fifth year, and likely helped Harry a lot better, had it not been for his lack of knowledge of Harry's connection with Voldemort. If he spent more time with Harry, we can assume that he would understand the best solution for Voldemort constantly pervading Harry's thoughts.

4) What are the better points you made, now that you brought it up? You can say that you made them but so far I don't see any.

If you're referring to the Snape points: if a potion could explode or some special limiter Snape made specifically for that potion was there, he would have put it in regardless, there is no reasoning for it not to be there. Once again, you use lack of knowledge in supply for knowledge, Snape wrote all of it down as a sixth year, if he didn't learn about special limiters, what makes you think Harry did? They have the same teacher after all (Horace Slughorn). And even in the unlikely chance that he didn't write down some kind of obvious instruction, clearly it was clear enough for Harry, as he got by just fine with Sectumsempra-For Enemies and nothing else.

If you're referring to any of the Hermione points: I believe it was Hitler himself who referred to people that solely relied on Memory for intelligence as being walking dictionaries without true genius (or would you prefer Albert Einstein? "Any fool can know, but it takes a true genius to understand"). Sure she could repeat all of her material, but she couldn't innovate, the Advanced Potion Making book itself was written for people with enough expertise in Potions to be able to innovate in the subject and understand how to subtly edit it. I doubt that it's cheating if you use an Expert's notes, that's just studying, which, as you put, is not cheating.

  He studied it for six years at Hogwarts, in McGonagall's class and through homework assigned in that class, just like everyone else. Do you deny that?

How is that extensively studying a subject though? He was taught the subject, he did homework on it, but to say that he began buying extra-circular books to study with is untrue. Look at how far he delved into defense, he got curses and counter curses, several other unnamed books that he alluded to (how else did he learn several blasting curses, confringo, etc... in the span of two months between Dumbledore's funeral and Chapter 2 of DH?)
