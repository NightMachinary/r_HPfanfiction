    "The Patronus is a form of advanced magic, which even the most qualified wizards can struggle with..."-Pottermore, What is a Patronus?
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

How do you go from the notion that some qualified (i.e., adequate, not necessarily great) wizards /can/ struggle with it (which, given its emotional and moralistic nature, can be for reasons other than skill), to it being an indicator of some great talent?

Nor did you address the point that what differentiates someone who can cast the Patronus under ideal circumstances and someone who can cast it at a dementor is indicative of non-magical personality traits, rather than magical skill. (Recall that dementors drain the very emotions needed to cast a Patronus.)

#+begin_quote
  He wasn't using any other magic until the third task, is what I was pointing out.
#+end_quote

That's just false. He had no difficulty casting Furinculus at Draco right in the middle of the Summoning Charm episode, for example.

#+begin_quote
  The Summoning Charm was either an inconsistency, or Harry's emotional status messing with his spells, as I assume focus is the most necessary thing to learning a spell.
#+end_quote

So, it's critical for learning a spell, but not for casting it? That's a rather contrived headcanon, compared to a much simpler and more consistent picture of Harry not being the prodigy that you seem to wish he were.

#+begin_quote
  Personally I think it was a bit of Rowling trying to show us how powerful Harry is, as she seems to use accidental magic like an ace, showing that that's all that's needed to scan for a powerful wizard.
#+end_quote

We actually have no idea how much uncontrolled Accidental Magic is typical. What we do know is that it comes out in response to danger and stress first and foremost: there's a reason Neville's uncle hung him out of a window trying to elicit it and it came out when he accidentally dropped him. Harry had a very stressful childhood, so lots of Accidental magic is to be expected.

JKR uses /controlled and conscious/ accidental magic to indicate talent; that Lily with what appears to be fairly low-stress childhood was able to do it is genuinely impressive, and similarly with Tom. Harry never had conscious control.

#+begin_quote
  I always thought that Dark Magic was easy to learn, hard to master.
#+end_quote

That works.

#+begin_quote
  While the process seems a bit tough, I doubt it's impossible
#+end_quote

That's what I wrote. The hard part is not doing it in the first place, it's doing it in secret. And, there's still the question of whether it'd be worth the effort if he ended up with a stag or a lion.

*Harry:* /[transforms into lion]/ Roar!

*Moderately Competent Opponent:* /STUPEFY!/

*Harry:* /[can't shield and is a big target, so is knocked out]/

*MCO:* Not half as scary as Kettleburn's or Hagrid's class.

#+begin_quote
  While you may deny the fact that he learned the Patronus Charm in relative haste,
#+end_quote

That's because he didn't.

#+begin_quote
  That's the whole point of the story. Harry changing as he gets older, if he stuck to his morals of eleven years old, then there is a reason why he would have lost the war either way.
#+end_quote

What do you mean here? He grew up, sure, but he pretty much stuck to his morals (with an occasional, usually impulsive, transgression), and he didn't lose.

#+begin_quote
  The lessons with Lupin were sporadic,... He didn't practice it every day of every month, it was more like every two weeks for a single day.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty certain that Patronus lessons in DA were shorter and much fewer in number, with the students being only a year or two older than Harry was at the time, and at least two managing a corporeal Patronus, with others managing it later.

Even if I'm wrong about it being taught at NEWT level --- which is plausible, since it's nearly useless if you don't expect to have to deal with dementors and don't know Dumbledore's messenger trick --- it's clearly still not as difficult as people make it out to be. For that matter, an interesting headcanon (from linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconcilliation)) is that the Patronus's obscurity is Ministry deliberately keeping the populace helpless against their terror weapon of choice.

#+begin_quote
  Tri-Wizard Tournament Magic? I mean, he still learned The Summoning Charm in one night of cramming with Hermione.
#+end_quote

That was after several classroom lessons, extra essays assigned by Flitwick to him and Neville, extra library research with Hermione, and that's just what I can recall off the top of my head. That one night was a culmination of all his efforts up to that point.

#+begin_quote
  He learned Point Me! from Sirius simply telling him the incantation.
#+end_quote

That's just false. Hermione taught it to him after having "discovered" it. (It's ambiguous whether she found it in the library or discovered as in "scientific discovery", i.e., invented it.)

#+begin_quote
  Reducto and all the other spells were likely learned in passing.
#+end_quote

Not in passing. In lots of practice with Ron and Hermione during lunches leading up to the Third Task. Hermione and Ron probably learned them as well.

Look, lots of mechanics of magic and skill level stuff is ambiguous and highly debatable, but can you please at least get the unambiguous book canon right?

#+begin_quote
  It'd be easier to see Transfiguration as 6 spells with single incantations followed by the latin name for the thing you're transfiguring the object into/conjuring/animating.
#+end_quote

Maybe. Lots of plausible headcanons for that, but kind of beside the point.

#+begin_quote
  James Potter was supposed to be very good at the subject; from what we see of Teddy Lupin, parents can hand-down their abilities to children, so in turn there is a case to be made for a Transfiguration!Master Harry.
#+end_quote

You can make a case for pretty much any ability for any character. That doesn't mean it would be a good case. You can make a better case for TransfigurationMaster!Draco, since he actually performed an advanced-looking Conjuration in his second year, as opposed to arguing from hereditary talent. You can make a case for Powerful!Ron: when others were lifting feathers, he was lifting a troll's club, and with a hand-me-down wand at that; and in his second year, he had a /broken/ wand, and he still passed all his classes, clearly indicating a talent for wandless magic. I've seen a fic that made a case for Powerful!Neville: he was so powerful that he couldn't control his magic, causing mishaps, and, also, his magic interfered with Potions he was brewing.

#+begin_quote
  Due to Harry's reactive nature in the books, it was more of a question of who would tell him that Transfiguration is a useful magic? The answer is no one to put it simply.
#+end_quote

Transfiguration is a useful magic, Harry could see it with his own two eyes, and he studied it along with everyone else, putting in his share of effort --- perhaps more, due to pressure from Hermione --- and earned a good enough grade to take the NEWT class. From what we saw, it came to him more easily than to Ron (though he had a hand-me-down wand at the time) but not as easily as it came to Hermione. Hardly an indication of prodigious talent.

Now, a fic with TransfigurationMistress!Hermione would be interesting --- more canon support for it, and she and McGonagall would have an interesting dynamic.

#+begin_quote
  (remember how she reacted after Harry increased his skill in potions?)
#+end_quote

At least some of that was due to the fact that Harry was cheating from a book of unknown provenance. And, she was right: it was sheer luck that it was Secumstempa that was underdocumented and not one of the potions improvements. Say, had Snape modified an ingredient to speed up brewing but then forgotten to write down that a moderator of some sort is required to keep the potion from exploding (because that step was obvious to him), people could have gotten hurt.

#+begin_quote
  That's exactly why Duelling would have done well for him, dodging spells would improve your reflexes far better than catching a snitch.
#+end_quote

But, would he be able and willing to invest as much time into it? Would it cultivate the same important sentiments, relationships, and allies?

#+begin_quote
  And that is exactly why training him would have been vital.
#+end_quote

From what little we see of how evenly matched skilled adults (e.g., Molly and Bellatrix) duel, the jumpy style of Harry makes more sense for adolescents. Once better shields, nonverbal casting (increasing the rate of fire), and more powerful attack spells become available, duels that don't end in an ambush actually become more about a rapid-fire exchange of spells.

I don't see athleticism giving a meaningful advantage against someone on Voldemort's tier; you'll have to be more specific about what tactics AgileDuelist!Harry might use against Voldemort that Voldemort couldn't easily counter.

#+begin_quote
  If you were to train Hermione, ... would be instantaneously killed by a person like Voldemort, who had perfected that style of Duelling.
#+end_quote

That's probably accurate. To counter an epic-tier wizard like Voldemort, you need either another epic-tier wizard like Dumbledore or epic-tier magic like Sacrificial Protection. None of the Trio have the potential to be epic-tier in their teens, and possibly not ever.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was beaten by Snape due to his reliance on spoken incantation, and the fact that he was in an emotional rut.
#+end_quote

Spoken incantation, lack of Occlumency, and general lack of skill and experience. Harry doesn't do great against Rowle and Dolohov either. In general, Harry does not win many pitched battles against skilled adults. I kind of wish the Seven Potters plan had Harry on a broom. /That/ would have been his moment to shine.

#+begin_quote
  But a day after you get into the magical world fully? Is that how long it takes to get bored of an infinite force that can do whatever you want, provided you have the ability?
#+end_quote

Not bored. Reminded that actually doing it is /schoolwork/ --- a lot of hard and tedious work that often doesn't have an obvious purpose, and when it does, that purpose is months, perhaps years away. All that, just as he's finally made a friend who's fun to hang out with, and learned about all the new toys and confectioneries and games that magic makes possible.
