  Ah, the classic "It's up to you to decide if you want to continue because I have nothing else of value to say and cannot disprove any of your points". I will consider this debate forfeited on your account then?

It was a good-faith question. Your last post included things like suddenly getting basic English words wrong and a gross social misjudgment like expecting that quoting Hitler in defense of a claim would make the claim more persuasive to anyone who isn't a neo-Nazi or close. My reply was an attempt at a non-condescending way to ask you if you were OK or if you wanted a cooldown period, because people can and do get a bit hot under the collar about things like fanfic.

All that said, this whole thread /is/ taking up more of my time than I like, and I am not interested in debating with someone who immediately assumes bad faith on my part, so, yes, I am going to disengage. Feel free to declare yourself the winner of this debate.
