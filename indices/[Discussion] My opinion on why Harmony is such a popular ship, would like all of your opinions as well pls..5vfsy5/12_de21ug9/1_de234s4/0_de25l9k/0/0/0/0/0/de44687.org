  I hate that logic. When something isn't there, you look for a way to make it there in a kind of full circle way.

You've got seven books worth of material describing how Harry thinks, feels, and reacts to a wide variety of circumstances. If that's not enough to establish a decent idea of what kind of a person Harry is and how he evolves over time, I don't know what would be.

  No, Dumbledore didn't do what he could. He could have done more, sadly he saw Harry's attachment, and realised that any ancient magics he would teach Harry, would immediately be regurgitated to his friends who didn't have Occlumency, due to his dependency on them.
#+end_quote

There you go again, with that other Harry Potter who is so amazingly talented that he can learn these Ancient Magics and use them effectively while in his teens, and who learns Occlumency easily, while his pathetic friends aren't capable of it at all.

Funnily enough, if Dumbledore could spare the time to personally train someone like that, his time would probably be better spent training Hermione to watch Harry's back: she learns magic faster, can be relied upon to do any independent study and practice she would need to, is generally more ruthless, and has no difficulty keeping secrets from her friends.

  If he wasn't capable of higher thinking, you should tell that to him before he walked into the forest.
#+end_quote

Not what I wrote. I wrote that he is not a deep thinker, and listed some examples of what he doesn't do but what a "deep thinker" might. It doesn't even mean that he isn't capable of pondering these things, but he just doesn't feel compelled to.

  If he was an everyman hero, the Sorting Hat wouldn't have wanted to send him to Slytherin. It would have been instant Gryffindor.
#+end_quote

The very point of an everyman hero is that he would fit into any House, but he would then rise to the occasion when the circumstances called for it. For example, Horace Slughorn liked to hobnob with the famous, the wealthy, and the talented, and used his connections to provide himself with creature comforts and entertainment --- a quintessential non-Death-Eater Slytherin --- but when Voldemort came for Hogwarts, he dueled him personally.

Contrast that with, say, Hermione, who was always on the lookout for ways to fix the world, whether the world wants it or not: whether it's making sure that her peers all learn some Charm or other (whether or not they want her help) or freeing House-Elves (whether they want to be or not). She is a classic Gryffindor heroine.

  The reasoning for the serious change, is likely because Harry had friends, he had a safety net so he couldn't fall, and had limiters on what he could do to ensure it even further.
#+end_quote

You say it like it's a bad thing. Harry go into plenty of trouble even /with/ his friends. If he were even more reckless, I don't know if he'd have survived to see Voldemort's resurrection.
