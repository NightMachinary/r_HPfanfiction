  Just like the time-turned Harry had in PoA?

Forgetting Order of The Phoenix are we?

  I don't think that's fair to Harry. He spends a lot of time on his homework, and he is plenty bright --- definitely significantly above average in general intelligence. He certainly doesn't understand magical theory as well as Hermione, but he probably understands it better than the average Hogwarts student (especially since Hermione looks over his essays --- or is that fanon?). In terms of end-results, he did almost exactly as well as Ron on his OWLs, except for DADA, on which he did better.
#+end_quote

But you later say that he doesn't have the mental strength to think ahead? You should probably choose one, it's getting a bit out of composition.

  It was an argument for Harry's uber-talent that relied on Harry mastering a particular spell quickly and after an inadequate demonstration. It turned out that he didn't do it quickly and that the demonstration was considered to be quite adequate by all present.
#+end_quote

He had yet to try the spell after demonstration.

#+begin_quote
  He cast it at Draco a few days later, as well.
#+end_quote

Page number?

#+begin_quote
  His very ability to perform the first Task relied on being able to Summon his broom.
#+end_quote

Out of context. You said that he was capable of casting different spells with no hindrance to magical ability due to his sporadic emotional state, yet it took him much longer to learn the summoning charm because of his emotional state.

  I was using the nomenclature that you introduced in the very first line of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5vfsy5/discussion_my_opinion_on_why_harmony_is_such_a/de4a0a1/]] , and sarcastically at that.

Is the Patronus not a spirit gurdian that uses its light to repel a Dementor? It's powerful light-based magic, I see nothing wrong with calling it light.

#+begin_quote
  few adults can do it is that most adults don't take NEWTs in DADA, where it's taught; and the reason it's taught at the NEWT level is that unless you know Dumbledore's communication trick or expect to coral Dementors, it's completely useless.
#+end_quote

Remus is quoted as saying it's way past the level of anything you'd learn at Hogwarts, including NEWT level. Pottermore says that it is the sign of a greatly powerful wizard. Author's words contradict your head-canon, and while JKR seems to be off her meds recently, I'll stick with that.

#+begin_quote
  There was no way Harry could be "trained up" in four or even seven years to face him in a pitched battle and win.
#+end_quote

What do you think training Harry entails? I doubt it would take more than even three years to get him there. How many years do you think Voldemort had to train in his 'Ancient Magic' before the war started. From ages 1-10 he was simply using controlled accidental magic against children, while impressive, accidental magic have never accounted for power. Ages 11-18 he was in Hogwarts, attempting to ground himself in the Dark Magic that was already there. Aside from the Horcrux, we don't know what he studied, but it wasn't anything too big if he thought he needed to continue his education the full seven-years to be a competent wizard. We know that for a good 2-3 years Voldemort was in Knockturn Alley selling and buying artifacts of great historical importance, he may have picked up a couple good spellbooks on certain curses, but no comprehensive Dark Magic training, unless he had an unknown mentor.

It was only when he went under; then we can assume he began his journey into the dark, and he was already twenty-one. Aside from his boasting of pushing magic farther than it's been pushed, we don't see much from him. We see a transfigured serpent made of fire that Dumbledore already made, we see him use the killing curse, conjured a silver portable shield (likely actually made of silver, breaking a rule of magic about transfiguration in the process) and used several other unremarkable spells. His greatest feat in the book was unassisted flying, and that is more of a vulnerability in combat than a strength.

Numerous minions that he knew by name and personally exchanged with. Voldemort definitely had friends, maybe even people he cared about, his search for immortality was just a little stronger, he constantly reminded himself that only he could be immortal, and attachment was pointless, despite already being attached.

  tedious, time-consuming
#+end_quote

Sirius, Remus, and James did it in two years, and they were third years (when they started), and hiding from professors the whole entire time. A Harry assisted by a full-grown Sirius would be easily able to get it down in the same span, or maybe less.

More evidence points to Phoenix, Griffin, or Lion. Patronus' change, likely depending on the fuel you use for them. Harry uses family, so his dad comes out. Tonks used Remus and a werewolf came out.

#+begin_quote
  The only book that took place mostly outside of Hogwarts was DH, and Moody was dead for most of that.
#+end_quote

It was shown that students can have tutoring on the side (Occlumency lessons disguised as Potions). How hard is it to sneak Moody in with Dumbledore's assistance?

#+begin_quote
  Duelling Club
#+end_quote

Last I checked, Duelling was a one on one thing. Harry showed no remote interest in it, even when it was helpful to him, yet he apparently liked sports.

Edit: Concerning the Transfiguration thing. In that context I was saying that if Harry was to put a bit more stock into Transfiguration, instead of seeing it as a hurdle for OWLs, he would have relied on it a bit more in combat. He is shown to learn and utilize magic in a short span of time when needed (The ever-mentioned Patronus Charm, several spells during Tri-Wizard, Multiple Spells before he left Privet Drive for the battle of the seven Potters, Crucio even when he was incapable of certain requirements, could even cast the Killing Curse at Bellatrix at the time if what Voldemort was saying was true). Sadly, he became unconcerned with magic itself despite showing great interest right before getting on the train, to the point where his first magical class (Transfiguration) wasn't even given that much prevalence in his mind.

On a side note, is there a reason why he didn't consider the Sword of Gryffindor for the first task? It's a versatile weapon, shown to be capable of taking out serpentine creatures much like a Dragon, unintentionally impregnates itself with whatever it touches. If Harry stabbed through the roof of the Dragon's mouth, the sword would start spewing out fire. Sounds awesome. I understand he doesn't know about the impregnates thing, but it would still be cool to see him mirror his first actual battle in the second book with the book correlating directly with it in terms of even numbers.
