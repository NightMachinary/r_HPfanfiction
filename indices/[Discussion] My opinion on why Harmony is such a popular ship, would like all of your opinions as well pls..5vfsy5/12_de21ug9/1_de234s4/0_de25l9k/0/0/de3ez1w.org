Who said no one? I'm talking about his friends, who are the same age as him. Obviously there's the Order and Dumbledore for advice and help, I doubt Hermione's ability to memorise and Ron's ability to leave during important moments outdo a 140 Year Old Wizard who was capable of besting both of the most powerful Dark Lords in recent history, in terms of advice.

Once again, Rowling's books don't provide any insight into Harry. This is made abundantly clear when all he has to say about Fleur is "She's pretty", and he attempts to reason with the man that murdered his parents, inadvertently murdered the last of his family, and wants to murder what's left of his comrades at Hogwarts. Harry has no characterization, made even clearer when he is just reactive the entire book series, you can't get him to do anything unless prompted, forced, or challenged.
