  Logical? Depends on what standpoint you look from. She was being very rash by doing it behind Harry's back

You're preaching to the choir. I told you from the beginning that I agree that she could have handled it better. But it also is Hermione and it may simply be outside of her capabilities to convince Harry and Ron of turning in the broom. Turning it in herself is the next best thing and I would have gladly done the same.

  The point is, this was an internal matter and she made it unnecessarily external.

What are you even going on about? "Oh I guess Harry is dead now, I'm glad though that we did keep it as an internal matter!". Adjust your priorities! The worst that can happen is Harry doesn't have his fancy new Firebolt anymore if Hermione is wrong about the broom and he's mad for a while. It's completely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.

  The Hogwarts library has books on Dark Magic, Ancient/Dark Creatures, Horcruxes, Training Dragons, and likely all the course work for all seven years. Yet, there isn't a book about identifying a cursed object?

Please, think things through. So assume Hermione learns some spell or whatever to detect Dark curses, she doesn't detect anything though. What now? "Oh I guess the broom is fine!" That would still be retarded, she's a child! Name one person with the means and motive who would just gift Harry a perfectly fine Firebolt out of the blue? It's completely insane. If it weren't for Sirius Black my next guess would be Lucius Malfoy (who's pissed because of Dobby). If it were me I wouldn't even want to touch that Broom.
