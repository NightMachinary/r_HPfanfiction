Because Sirius Black hasn't tried to kill Harry two years in a row. The chances of him managing to go to the broom store in question, when Diagon Alley was probably on complete lock-down for him, is preposterous.

Curses may or may not exist for that type of thing. We have the people called Curse-Breakers, but so far we haven't figured out the difference between a Dark Enchantment and a Curse that you can somehow place on the object through unknown means. But, like I said, it's highly unlikely that there is anyone in the Harry Potter world that at the time could have stripped the broom of enchantments, placed new bad enchantments on it, and somehow managed a flying charm matching the quality of a Professional Broom creator. We know that Sirius is relatively powerful at this point (Kills 13 Muggles, even though almost every wizard phrases as killing 13 people, so they think that Sirius is a much bigger threat than he is) but, Hermione could have easily done research and found diagnostic charms for those curses herself.
