  The chances of him managing to go to the broom store in question, when Diagon Alley was probably on complete lock-down for him, is preposterous.

Wait.. now I'm *really* confused. You do understand though that he did buy the broom, right? Like, that's what happens in the books, right? So we have to imagine that he either used polyjuice, a house-elf, asked someone who didn't recognize him to buy it for him or ordered it by mail. What are you getting at?

  Curses may or may not exist for that type of thing.

So curses may or may not exist, Sirius Black may or may not be strong enough to cast dangerous curses himself, Sirius Black may or may not know dangerous criminals who could curse the broom for him, A school girl may or may not be capable of detecting such dangerous curses, Dumbledore propabably should have send Hermione to the Gaunt Shack to check the ring for curses for him... are you even trying to make a coherent argument anymore in order to hate on Hermione for doing something completely logical and being sensible?
