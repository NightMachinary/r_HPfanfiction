  1) As far as Harry knows, Voldemort isn't even in the country.

Why are you talking about Voldemort? This is about Sirius Black, who as far as everyone knows is a homicidal maniac who wants to murder Harry Potter. He obviously can afford a Firebolt. Why would he send him a Firebolt that isn't deadly in some way? What's your point?

  I've yet to see any object curse someone, other than maybe Marvolo's ring and the necklace Draco wanted to give Dumbledore

So you agree that curses exist that are triggered in certain situations and that are deadly? I don't understand what we are even discussing here. Bombarda was just an example of a possible effect.
