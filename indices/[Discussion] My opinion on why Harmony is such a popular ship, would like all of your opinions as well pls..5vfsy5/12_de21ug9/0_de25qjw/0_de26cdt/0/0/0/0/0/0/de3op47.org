Logical? Depends on what standpoint you look from. She was being very rash by doing it behind Harry's back, she didn't have any facts with her other than 'maybe', and it was somehow allowed into Hogwarts. I thought Hogwarts checked through every piece of mail that came through? That's why Fred and George had to sneak things through the secret passages. The point is, this was an internal matter and she made it unnecessarily external. The Hogwarts library has books on Dark Magic, Ancient/Dark Creatures, Horcruxes, Training Dragons, and likely all the course work for all seven years. Yet, there isn't a book about identifying a cursed object?
