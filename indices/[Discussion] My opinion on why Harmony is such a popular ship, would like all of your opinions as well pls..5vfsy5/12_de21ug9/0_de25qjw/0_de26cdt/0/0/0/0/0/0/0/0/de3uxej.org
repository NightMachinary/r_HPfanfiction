Because he would spend a fortune to get Harry Potter a broom, rather than his own son? I don't think Lucius' funds could handle buying a firebolt, hence Draco using the 2001 for the rest of the school year(s). Yes, if she didn't detect anything, the broom would have been fine. Not that there was anything on it to begin with.

But, he wouldn't have needed to get mad if she just covertly preformed diagnostics on the broom. If she found something (and something with enough magical presence to explode upon Harry sitting on it will definitely be detected) then she tells Harry and he gives it up to them himself.

It's an unnecessary conflict that didn't need to happen if she just had a tad more of her 'Brightest Witch of Her Age' mojo that she has whenever she crams in the library. If she can make Polyjuice potion at twelve, a potion that most adults have a difficult time brewing, literally Auror-level, she could preform a suitable diagnostic charm.
