1) As far as Harry knows, Voldemort isn't even in the country. The possibility of him having enough money to buy Harry one of the most expensive brooms, then having enough power in that wraith like state to break enchantments that were so high quality that they made the broom 10x as expensive as a Nimbus 2000 is extremely low. That's the reason the broom is exponentially more expensive than the Nimbus, did you think it was faster simply because of the wood it was made from?

2) Bombarda is a curse, there is no such thing as a triggered curse. I've yet to see any object curse someone, other than maybe Marvolo's ring and the necklace Draco wanted to give Dumbledore, but Marvolo's ring was alluded to have a ton of enchantments on it, and it was a piece of jewelry (which might be easier to curse, rather than an already enchanted broom).
