  I enjoy when people attempt to cross-analyze, as if I'm trying to project myself onto fictional characters. Yes, it was completely without warning, as in, she said that he needed to tell McGonagall, but he didn't, so she did it for him.

It's just a pattern I notice a lot in the fandom especially by writers who advocate a more pragmatic/grey/darkish Harry. Any ruthlessness by the protagonist is lauded and shown as admirable, yet characters who show similar characteristics are mercilessly bashed or killed off

  Harry's broom may or may not be cursed, it's unlikely to be capable of killing him as the Firebolt has tons of enchantments to prevent just that

Is that in canon or did you just make that up? Anyway, I would expect a *sabotaged* broom wouldn't have those safety enchantments anymore, because that's the whole point. Also who cares about safety enchantments if there's just a triggered Bombarda attached to it or something. Safety enchantments aren't going to do shit if you're just pink mist.

  Obviously saving his life is more important, but, she had no evidence that it was in fact cursed.

Really? Someone out there is out to kill you and you randomly get a super expensive Broom in the mail. Who the fuck in their right mind would just sit on it and ride it? It is super fucking ovious that it should be checked by the best Wizards they can get before anyone rides it. I don't even understand why that's a point of contention. Ron and Harry are both incredibly stupid.
