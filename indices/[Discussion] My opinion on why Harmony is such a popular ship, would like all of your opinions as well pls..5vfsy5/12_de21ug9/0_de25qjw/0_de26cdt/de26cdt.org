I enjoy when people attempt to cross-analyze, as if I'm trying to project myself onto fictional characters. Yes, it was completely without warning, as in, she said that he needed to tell McGonagall, but he didn't, so she did it for him.

Obviously saving his life is more important, but, she had no evidence that it was in fact cursed. She just assumed so, and acted on her instinct, and was proven wrong, all while causing hostility in their friendship. It's not a question of Harry can do it, why can't Hermione? It's a question of the different stakes. Harry's broom may or may not be cursed, it's unlikely to be capable of killing him as the Firebolt has tons of enchantments to prevent just that, so mid-flight, he may get thrown off, if that, he brakes an arm or maybe a leg. What do you think Lord Voldemort would do to Harry's best-friends? He obviously didn't want to take the chance for Ginny, a girl that he had just gotten in a relationship with a month ago. So let's say yes, his friends didn't want to leave, and he decided to keep them around. Wouldn't it be prudent to learn how to protect them? To prevent a situation like the one with the Snatchers from happening?
