  I still can't get over the third year, and her telling McGonagall about the secret broom to get it striped down. It was a huge betrayal of trust, as it just sort of 'happened' without any warning.

Without warning? No.

And she was totally right about everything, the only thing she did wrong was the antisocial way in which she handled it ("my way or the highway"). Which weirdly enough is a quality that you seem to admire a few sentences later and wish Harry would show more of:

  Harry should have understood his role by third of fourth year, realising that having friends was only a weakness that he couldn't count on.

What's more important from Hermione's perspective? Being friends with Harry or saving his life? She's pretty ruthless here and it's interesting that this is acceptable to you when it is done by the Protagonist (as a stand-in for yourself possibly?), but not by anyone else.

Calling the whole thing a betrayal is really a stretch. I'm also going to take away a friends car keys if they insist they are sober but appear to be drunk - even if I could be wrong and they might be perfectly fit to drive.
