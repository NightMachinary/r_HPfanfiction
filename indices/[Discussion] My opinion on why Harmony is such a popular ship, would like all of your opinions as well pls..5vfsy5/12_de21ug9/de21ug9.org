Yep, Book Hermione felt like she was more obstacle rather than friend. I still can't get over the third year, and her telling McGonagall about the secret broom to get it striped down. It was a huge betrayal of trust, as it just sort of 'happened' without any warning. Then there was the fourth year, where she spent more time with Ron for no reason. But I always felt that the drama in Harry Potter was unnecessary, Harry should have understood his role by third or fourth year, realising that having friends was only a weakness that he couldn't count on. I would have enjoyed a character arc like that, because having all these moments of drama with Harry and a female protagonist, just shows even more that the author of the story is female, whilst we're supposed to be looking through Harry's eyes. As, Harry makes no mention to any of Hermione's 'developments' and JKR said that Hermione herself was canonically gorgeous (when she was talking about why Emma was perfect, she stated that "She was everything Hermione is, Beautiful, Smart, Clever...") It would be rather odd that a male like Harry wouldn't notice, even if they had a 'brother-sister' type relationship.
