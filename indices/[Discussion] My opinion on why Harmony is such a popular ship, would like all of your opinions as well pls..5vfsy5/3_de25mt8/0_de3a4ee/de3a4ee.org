I don't believe in the pairing but:\\
* How is hoping that the broomstick incident showing that she doesn't have empathy for Harry? If anything it shows she cares about him enough to get the broom checked despite if he wanted to or not.\\
* I don't remember the context of pulling him out of Mrs. Weasley's embrace so I can't comment on this\\
* The need to prove herself right, people have that all the time in friendships/relationships.\\
Of course #1 and #2 don't really show anything subtracting from the possibility of her liking him in a romantic way.
