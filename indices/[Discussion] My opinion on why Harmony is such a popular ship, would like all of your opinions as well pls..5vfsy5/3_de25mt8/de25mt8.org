Not a fan of the pairing so that will colour my view.

I put it down to two things: Hermione is the only girl in the books that is approaching fully fleshed out as a character and that puts her in a much better position that Ginny, for example. The other main reason is the films. The pairing is pushed heavily and Ron and Ginny are given less of the limelight that they are in the books.

There are key moments in the books where Hermione shows her lack of empathy for Harry; the broomstick incident in PoA, pulling him out of Mrs Weasley's embrace at the end of GoF and the need to prove herself right over the potions book in HBP. (Edit) which, for me show that she is not the one for Harry.
