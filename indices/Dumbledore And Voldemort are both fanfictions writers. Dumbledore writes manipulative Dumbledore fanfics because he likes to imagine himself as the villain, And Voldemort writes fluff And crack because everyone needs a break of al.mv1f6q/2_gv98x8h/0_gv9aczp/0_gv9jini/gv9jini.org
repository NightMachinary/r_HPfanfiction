Meanwhile Harry and Draco hear about this and avoid each other like the Plague. And become more public about Hermione and Astoria respectively to shit everyone else up.

.... Imma just leave that in. You know what I meant. I hate typing on phones anymore.

Edit: To clarify.

/The Slytherin Common Room/

Draco: “About bloody time. I had always suspected, Pottah had feelings for Granger. Seems those stupid rumors about me and him gave him the push to at least tell everyone how he feels about her.”

Astoria: “And you about me. I mean, I already had it figured out. I just wanted to hear you say it.”

Draco: “Heh, yeah.” /Takes hold of Astoria's hands and pulls her into his lap/

/Meanwhile in a broom closet near the Gryffindor Common Room/

Harry: “I still don't understand why you still want to come out here for this. Even after that whole fiasco.”

Hermione: “I think it's more fun to keep the others guessing. Anyway, sneaking around is what lead them to start spreading rumors about you and Malfoy and me and Greengrass to begin with. If at least they're unashamed of giving the others a show, that's fine by me.”

Harry: “That smile. I know that smile. And I like what that smile leads to.”

Hermione: “Yeah? C'mere.” /Grabs the front of Harry's shirt and yanks him towards her for a big damn kiss/

Sidenote: It just occurred to me that you can't reply to your own replies.
