I've been reading fanfiction for...probably too long (I wrote my first shitty chapters of fanfiction in the fourth grade- I'm in college now) and after a while I accepted that I was missing out on a ton of great fanfiction due to avoiding slash and spent some time working through that. I can definitely understand why all of the slash in HP fics would be disappointing, though.
