[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] has Harry as Death visiting canon Harry, is the easiest way I can describe it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10678294/1/Silk-Roads][Silk Roads]] has Master of Death Harry in another dimension, with time travel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5751435/1/Stories-of-the-Lone-Traveler][Stories of the Lone Traveler]] has dimension hopping Harry Potter, through other Books, Shows and more. It's a cool read, and some of the story arcs are fun "What could have been" type stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] has an old Harry Potter with some unexplained time travel at the moment that is a Dark Lord, allying with Lord Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] is my favorite fanfiction at the moment, with a Fem!Harry being sent bank thousands of years in time and is now trying to fit in with the people she left behind.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]] is looking to have an immortal Harry, with the way his existence is explained to him. It has dimension travel at the start, is a bit long winded but I do like it a lot.

I can look for some more if you need me to, but these should last you a while.
