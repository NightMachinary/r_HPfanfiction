No problem! A lot of these type of fic are time travel, dimension hopping, Crossovers, Harry siding with the Dark Lord or being a Dark Lord so I hope you don't mind overly much.

The Inquisitor Carrow series is a Crossover with Warhammer, which I know nothing about so I can't really explain it much, but they were a fun read. Harry is like 300 years old? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Book 1]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8707895/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-Bureaucracy-of-Failure][Book 2]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10499319/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-Tournament-of-Tribulations][Book 3]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9899145/1/Great-Expectations][Great Expectations]] is a Crossover with Avengers, and again I don't know much about that world, but Harry is the MoD and he and Hermione travel to that world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to put your Galleons where your mouth is]] is a MoD!Harry, focusing on a lot of rebirth. He is reborn as Sirius and Regulus' older brother. It's completed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6866113/1/To-Bow-with-Pride][To Bow with Pride]] has some dimension travelling where Harry becomes the tutor to the children of the Black family during the seventies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8317364/1/The-Founders-Four][The Founders Four]] has Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny dimension traveling , with the memories of the founders of Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9081608/1/Fire-Born][Fire Born]] is focussed on the MoD being reborn again and again. Fem!Harry grows up with Tom Riddle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2234227/1/Hermione-s-Change][Hermione's Change]] is a cool one shot that I would recommend.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1893607/1/The-Quiet-Place][The Quiet Place]] is a one shot as well. I can't really explain it without spoiling the surprise, but I would recommend it.

I don't know how many more fics I have favorited on my fanfiction profile, but I could probably find a couple more.
