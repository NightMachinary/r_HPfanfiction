Update: finished your first set of reccs and started book one of the Inquisitor Carrow series- it's great so far and all of the stories have been well worth reading. Thanks again for all of the reccs.

Personal favorites: Silk Roads, which, while full of issues, was a really fun read as well as A Long Journey Home, which is one of the better fics I've ever read, I think.
