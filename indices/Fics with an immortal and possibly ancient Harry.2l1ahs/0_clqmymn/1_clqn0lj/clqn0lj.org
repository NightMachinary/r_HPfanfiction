I'd appreciate more reccs when you get the chance- I go through them rather quickly (I spend two of my classes more or less ignoring the professors in favor of fanfiction) and can always use more.

Thanks a ton for these, though, seriously- just glancing at a couple leaves me pretty excited to start reading. I'm Still Here especially sounds right up my alley- I've been thinking about writing a full-length original novel with a related premise, even, though I never seem to get around to writing more than a couple of chapters at once.

So much thanks, [[/u/ThisIsForYouSir-]] you're totally based.

EDIT: Caught up with I'm Still Here and it's been fantastic- definitely looking forward to the next installation in the series. Moving on to something else now.
