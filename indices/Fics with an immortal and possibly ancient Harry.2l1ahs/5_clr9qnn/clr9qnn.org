[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8957424/1/Illusions-of-Grandeur][Illusions of Grandeur]] by Kanathia is a HP/Supernatural crossover that features an ancient and immortal Harry. This will probably be much better if you're already familiar with Supernatural.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.
