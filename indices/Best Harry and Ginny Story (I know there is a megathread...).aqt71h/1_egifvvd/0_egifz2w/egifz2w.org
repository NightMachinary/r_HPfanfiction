That's true actually I guess but I don't like Ginny in canon she's too much of a Mary Sue and doesn't deserve Harry. Here she struggled and was heart broken and her character and pain was built up, i loved her. And yeah Ginny still was in character she just loved Harry which made her act different, but still like herself. If you get what I mean, rude at times, funny, and more emotional which just makes her more of a character to me
