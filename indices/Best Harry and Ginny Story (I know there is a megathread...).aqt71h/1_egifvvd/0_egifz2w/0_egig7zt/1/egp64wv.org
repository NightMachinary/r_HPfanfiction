Actually Ginny in seeking Ginny is canon lol she had a temper, she's confident, social and pretty. Just her athletic ability is not there and the same sort of fierceness. And she has a weakness which is her love for Harry. She probably wouldn't the turned out like that in canon but we can never know. She's way more of a balanced character rather than a Mary Sue in that story which makes it just friggin perfect. The reason why early Harry Ginny fics were glorious is because they were written before Ginny's character in the 6th book and left room for a lot of imagination and characterization. After that if you write a love story between her and Harry you have to write her as perfect like she was portrayed
