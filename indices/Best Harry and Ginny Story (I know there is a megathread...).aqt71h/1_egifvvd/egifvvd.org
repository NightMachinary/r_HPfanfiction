Was going to recommend Seeking Ginny until you said "Make sure all characters are in character." Like hell Ginny's characterization in Seeking Ginny is anything like her characterization in canon after HBP. In that light your requirements seem ambiguous.

With that said, Linkffn(Backward with Purpose Part I: Always and Always by Deadwoodpecker) is pretty fabulous.
