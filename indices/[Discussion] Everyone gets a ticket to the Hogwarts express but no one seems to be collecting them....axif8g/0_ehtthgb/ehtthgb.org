You didn't miss anything and it's not a plot hole. The children receive tickets but there is no conductor, nor ticket gates. That's all there is to it.

It's easy enough to speculate as to why they get tickets. Firstly, tickets still could be required to ride the train, even without anyone checking them. I've been on plenty of trains in the Muggle world where my ticket was never checked (this is quite common in rural train services). It just operates on an honesty system (and who would be trying to get a free ride to Hogsmeade when you can just floo/apparate/knight bus much quicker...).

But even if the tickets are completely non-functional, there are still plenty of possible reasons for their existence - tradition, just a bit of fun, etc.
