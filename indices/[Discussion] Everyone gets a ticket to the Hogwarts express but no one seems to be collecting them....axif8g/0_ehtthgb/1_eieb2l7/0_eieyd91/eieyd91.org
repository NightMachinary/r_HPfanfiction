If you're discussing the Dementor incident in PoA, Hermione says she's going to speak to the driver, not a conductor. Would need to see the Lupin quote but I suspect the same.

Edit: just checked, Lupin speaks about the driver too.

(I'm checking the US edition so it's possible this is a British/American difference).
