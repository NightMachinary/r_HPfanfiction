Astoria could say completely horrible true things about him:

“I heard he melted Professor Quirrell's face off using only his hands.”

“Him and Ron Weasley made Professor Lockhart lose his mind and now he's in the crazy ward at St Mungo's.”

“He stunned Professor Snape so Sirius Black could escape.”

“He is very close with a werewolf.”

“He was the last person to see Barty Crouch before he died.”

“Him and Hermione Granger led Professor Umbridge out to the Forbidden Forest to have her gang-raped by a herd of centaurs.”
