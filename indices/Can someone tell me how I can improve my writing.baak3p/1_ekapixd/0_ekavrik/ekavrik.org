Oh, I thought cutting off mid-sentence was fine! I guess I was a bit shortsighted in thinking that interrupting characters would move the story a bit faster, but it ended up breaking the flow...

I do have a story line; I suppose I'm not that good with sideplots. I had no idea it seemed random, and it sucks that people think this way.

Thanks for the advice! I hope I can keep these in mind when I write the next chapter.
