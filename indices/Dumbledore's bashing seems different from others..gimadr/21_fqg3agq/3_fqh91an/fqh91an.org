Neville's family hanging him out a window and attempting to drown him was laughed off because they thought he was a squib. The discrimination against squibs in the wizarding world is comparable to old fashioned and outdated beliefs about disabled people. IIRC, in extreme cases parents did kill children for being disabled, as well as disowning them (which we see in canon), and throwing them into the streets.

If Neville had been a normal magical child with accidental magic, this treatment would be seen as wrong by the rest of the family, and therefore isn't one of the best examples of normalised wizard abuse. I can't think of any other case of a wizard being abused like assumed-squib Neville is.
