  The fact that Harry suffered no lasting damage is a testament to how little JK Rowling understands the abuse she wrote for Harry and how little she understands children of abuse in general.

JKR started a charity called Lumos that aims to return children in orphanages to their parents so they can get individual attemtion rather than being neglected (in these situations, parents are too poor to raise the kids, so they send the kids to orphanages in countries where orphanages still exist, the parents are alive and want to keep their children, but can't, her charity aims to discourage funding to these orphanages, because the money rarely goes to the kids anyway, and to instead redistribute the money to the parents so they can raise their own kids. I don't mean to paint her as perfect, but in this area, she does good). She started this charity in part as a result of her research while writing HBP, so after she started the series. However, I still disagree with your assertion. JKR's main character being an orphan in a horrible home, and then discovering a magical new land/world/home is an extremely common and long tradition in children's literature. Pippi Longstockings, Anne of Green Gables, Peter Pan, Lyra from His Dark Materials, Series of Unfortunate Events, and so many more. None of these characters are psychologically realistic. I've recently read a book called The Rhetoric of Characters in Children's LIterature by Maria Nikolajeva, and she suggests that books have no obligation to be psychologically realistic, she is not alone in feeling that way. She says especially literature that draws on such long-standing tropes and traditions, such as children's literature which draws on fairy tales and moral stories. Certainly they /can/, but it is a stylistic and valid choice to deviate from reality, and most do on purpose. The degree depends on a variety of things (which is what the book is about, so far to much to get into here). JKR"s characters are not psychologically realistic, which we both probably agree, but I disagree that this reflects anything about JKR's level of knowledge.
