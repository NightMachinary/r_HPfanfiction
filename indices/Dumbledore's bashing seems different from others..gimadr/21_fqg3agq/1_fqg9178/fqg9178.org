I'll counter that by saying Harry's canon treatment at the hands of the Dursleys is unacceptable and was unacceptable even by the standards of the 80s. The fact that Harry suffered no lasting damage is a testament to how little JK Rowling understands the abuse she wrote for Harry and how little she understands children of abuse in general.

Also, Dumbledore dropping off a baby on a doorstep in the middle of the night with the rest of the magical world unaware of where their savior had been living for 11 years implies in the extreme that Dumbledore took sole control over the placement of the child.

The Smeltings stick and Nevilles treatment at the hands of his family are further attestation that Rowling doesn't understand the abuse that she writes about, rather than in universe justifications for the actions of characters.
