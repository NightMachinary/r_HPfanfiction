Eh, no, that`s not true at all, it`s not a sheltered perspective to think of a child being kept in a closet for 10 years, being denied clothing and protection. That`s not true at all, even in the 40`s that would be considered appalling, specially when the family has the means to provide for them. Petunia tried to hit him with a frying pan, that`s not `Uh, it`s just a disciplinary beating` that could seriously hurt a child.

And that`s not counting the emotional abuse, no love, no care, no emotional support, THAT`S not common in a developed community. That`s criminal.

Any CS from the 80`s would`ve removed him from there and the Dursley`s would have faced legal problems.

The problem here is Dumbledore never checked on him, never did anything in those 10 or so years to show he cared.

Honestly if Harry was a normal teenager he would be a very different character and given the chance to retaliate, his bout of underage sorcery would probably have killed the Dursleys or hurt them severely.
