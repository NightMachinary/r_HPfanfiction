Abuse is unacceptable morally at all times, but in reality it's always been quite common. Harry's abuse was unusual in some of the specifics, but overall it's well within the scope of experiences that billions of children have gone through. "Civilisation" has gone centuries not merely tolerating abuse of that level or worse, but protecting or even praising it. The perspective that Harry must be this horribly damaged victim is a very sheltered and modern one.
