Part of it is people really exaggerate how bad the Dursleys are and how much Harry living there is Dumbledore's choice/fault.

The Dursleys are certainly emotionally abusive by modern standards, but the only one ever really indicated to be violent is Dudley, Harry doesn't actually suffer any lasting harm (seriously nowhere in canon is he some horribly malnourished cripple). And do realize this is a setting where a muggle school where children beat each other with sticks is considered a prestigious establishment and magical families do stuff like hang children out of windows.\\
And it's not as though there's actually a reasonable alternative, Harry has no other family at all. And not only is family needed for the blood protection (I'm of the opinion that it is necessary, it never came up in canon because it actually worked and kept people away) but leaving kids with family is normal and I really can't see anyone thinking shoving Harry in an orphanage is a good idea.
