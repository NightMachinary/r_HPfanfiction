Except that a large chunk of the characters are later revealed to be related to him because his grandma was a Black. Along with a bunch of other things that make this decision dubious.

The Malfoys, Weasleys, and Tonks are all 3rd or 2nd once removed iirc. I don't think those are the only ones either, but they're the ones with significant parts in the story.

Dursleys are the closest relatives I agree. But since Snape knew Petunia, and presumably Remus had at least met them, it wouldn't have been hard to ask about them.
