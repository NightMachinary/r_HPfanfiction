I didn't say anything about the Ministry caring, what I said is that giving a child to their relatives to raise is literally the most normal and commonplace thing to do yet people treat it as an inherently wrong decision. Yes, in a jurisdiction with competent child protective services Harry would eventually have been *removed* from that situation but that's where he'd have been sent in the first place too (plus that removal wouldn't just have been a single social worker going "yah I'm taking the boy and giving him to who /I/ think should raise him, kthnxbye").

I am fine with fics that actually handle/resolve Harry's home situation logically, it's people that think Dumbledore should just have taken a toddler and given him to whoever he pleased that I find weird.
