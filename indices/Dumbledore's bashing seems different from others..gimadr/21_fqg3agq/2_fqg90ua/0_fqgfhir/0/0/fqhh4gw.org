The Ministry never cared, you are speaking as if the Ministry actually has a handle in these kinds of proceedings, in Harry`s case that handle was "Dumbledore took care of it".

Any serious government would've removed Harry from that home, that's not how you handle foster children.

His relatives are simply incapable of taking care of him, so he should go to a foster home or something, but no one never checked, never asked, that's much more out of line than trying to find a proper home for him.
