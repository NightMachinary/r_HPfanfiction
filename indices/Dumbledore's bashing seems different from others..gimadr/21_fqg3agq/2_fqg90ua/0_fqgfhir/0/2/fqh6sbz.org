  Like I mentioned elsewhere, I don't understand this line of thought at all. Giving an orphaned toddler to his closest, actually known living relatives is literally the only "in line" thing that someone not actually in charge of the child should do - I actually find the fandom idea that you can just take a very young boy and arbitrarily give him to whoever you think would raise them best (or even just keep him yourself! People actually suggest this!) to be rather wild and a bit concerning.

Then atleast make sure that the person the parents chose to be the potential guardian has a trial before he gets sent to hell on earth, or you know leave him with Remus under a fidelius protected home, i'm sure Lily and James would choose either of them instead of Petunia any day.

The problem is that Remus is a werewolf and the public would be outraged, but then again no one stopped pepole from abusing his name to create a false image of Harry and used his name to sell products.
