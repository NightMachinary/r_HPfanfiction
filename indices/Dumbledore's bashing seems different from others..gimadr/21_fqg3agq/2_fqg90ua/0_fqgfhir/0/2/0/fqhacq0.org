  Then atleast make sure that the person the parents chose to be the potential guardian has a trial before he gets sent to hell on earth

I don't see how Dumbledore has the power to do that - actually, I don't think he's /ever/ shown that level of power over wizarding government proceedings. Literally the most he's shown to do is act as something of a witness in Barty Jr's trial.

I feel like people forget that the Order of the Phoenix was a /vigilante group/, and treat Dumbledore like he was running the Ministry at the time. That was Crouch Sr. and Minister Bagnold.

  or you know leave him with Remus under a fidelius protected home, i'm sure Lily and James would choose either of them instead of Petunia any day.

So...step over the line of responsibility/duty despite not being in charge of him in any way other than being his headmaster ten years later and decide by himself who to give a /one year old child/ to? And somehow y'all think that would not be an abuse of power and position?

I don't know how or why we've gotten to the point that this actually has to be said but you can't just decide (as a headmaster, not even as a social worker!) to give a baby to someone to raise because they were friends with the child's parents in school. That would be quite egregious even in our modern world with functioning child protective services and all.

I'm perfectly fine with criticizing Dumbledore for not checking up on Harry more (or checking up on him but not doing anything about his home conditions) but to criticize him for giving a baby that he had no guardianship over to its aunt like a normal person is just silly in my opinion. Like, how far is this supposed to stretch? Was Dumbledore also supposed to proactively prevent Neville from going to the Longbottoms because they were ended up being so badly abusive to him that he ends up a nervous wreck with no self-confidence to speak of by the time he starts at Hogwarts? Or does only Harry deserve to be protected and Neville can fend for himself because he's not the /Boy who Lived/ - or maybe it's because the Longbottoms are magical and the Dursleys are Muggles?
