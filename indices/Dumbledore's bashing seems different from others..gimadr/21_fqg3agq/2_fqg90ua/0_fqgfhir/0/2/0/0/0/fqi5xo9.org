Even at that, I'm fairly sure real social workers would hesitate to hand said kids over to you if you were the immediate and glaring suspect in facilitating their parents' murder.

Again I don't see anything wrong with /giving/ Harry to the Dursleys (even if the blood protection wasn't at play). I do have a (moral) problem with not checking on him pre-Hogwarts, but even at that I find it weird how people hyperfocus on Dumbledore and Harry and ignore everyone else involved. I've already mentioned the discrepancy between how this fandom carries pitchforks for abused Harry but not for the probably worse abused Neville, but also it's rare indeed to see a fic call out e.g. McGonagall for not checking on Harry either. She knew exactly where he was right from the start, was well-equipped to observe him discreetly (in cat Animagus form), and as James and Lily's head of house was arguably supposed to be closer to them than the much older Dumbledore, yet she does nothing about Harry either.
