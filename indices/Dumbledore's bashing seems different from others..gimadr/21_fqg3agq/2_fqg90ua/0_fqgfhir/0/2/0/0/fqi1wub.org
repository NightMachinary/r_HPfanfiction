The problem is there was never a will from james and lily that was ever revealed in canon to tell us where his parents wanted him to go. We also don't truly know what role godparents really fill (and they were both alive and well before Dumbledore abandons Harry on the front step). I'm the godfather for a couple of kids. Most is purely ceremonial but for two the parents made sure that I would get their kids if something happened to them.

Without the will or knowing the role we really don't know if what Dumbledore did was legally wrong (morally we know it is simply from leaving him on the front step and never checking on him.
