I agree and add to the fact that she disagreed with harry's placement because "...they are the worst sort of muggles..."

There are a few fics that as soon as Harry finds out who had a hand in placing him at the Dursleys he immediately detests them and wants nothing to do with them.

There's a fic that harry revives the longbottom's and they press charges against Neville's uncle and grandmother for abuse.
