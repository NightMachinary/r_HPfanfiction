  However, since Dumbledore just took Harry and sent him to the Dursleys despite the fact that it's never stated that he's in any way in charge of him other than being his headmaster 10 years later suggests that he was out of line.

Like I mentioned elsewhere, I don't understand this line of thought at all. Giving an orphaned toddler to his closest, actually known living relatives is literally the only "in line" thing that someone not actually in charge of the child should do - I actually find the fandom idea that you can just take a very young boy and arbitrarily give him to whoever you think would raise them best (or even just keep him yourself! People actually suggest this!) to be rather wild and a bit concerning.
