Who gave Dumbledore the right to put Harry into any home? It's pretty clear that the only reason in canon that he placed him there was to protect him using his mother's sacrifice since Petunia was related to her- nothing to actually do with him going to his closest relatives to care for him. There were other ways to protect him without those protections. Granted that they did end up saving him during a couple parts of the series- but we're also shown that he only needs to stay a few weeks out of a year to actually maintain the protections. Keep in mind that Dumbledore doesn't seem to be acting on the Ministry's behalf in placing Harry per the law, he seems to just take him from Godric's Hollow and placing him where he wants. At this point we only know him as his future headmaster, not a guardian.

As I said, unless Lily and James actually put Dumbledore in charge of Harry's care if anything happened to Sirius, it wasn't his place to choose where Harry was to go. Since we know they had made Sirius as his guardian, and that they were at war and would naturally know there was a risk that any of them could die, it's possible that they did give Dumbledore that permission. However, this is never brought up or hinted at in canon. What is stated in canon is that Petunia and Vernon hated all things magical, Petunia hated everything about her sister, Dumbledore knew this and knew Harry would be mistreated in that home, and Dumbledore had to threaten Petunia at least a couple of times to get her to let Harry stay at their house.

So, we have a few potential options. One, Dumbledore placed Harry at the Dursleys' on behalf of the Ministry as per the law due to all of Harry's guardians being dead or imprisoned. Dumbledore knew Harry would be abused there and did nothing to stop it. Two, Dumbledore legally placed him there due to being granted control of his guardianship by the Potters, and he still knew about the abuse and did nothing to stop it. Three, Dumbledore illegally placed him there outside of the law and against the Potters' wishes. He still knew about the abuse and did nothing to stop it. No matter how you want to put it, he majorly fucked up.

Really, the only way to write Dumbledore sending Harry to the Dursleys and not have him look like a bad guy would be to have him place Harry there due to the law having him go to his closest relatives, have him be completely ignorant of how the Dursleys would treat him, find a valid reason to never have anyone check up on him ever, then have him removed from the home (or provide some form of protection for him if you're going to keep up the blood-protection stuff) when Harry comes to Hogwarts and Dumbledore learns about the abuse.
