Actually that's fanon. Charles and Dorea fall in his family tree somewhere but they aren't his grandparents. However, since Dumbledore just took Harry and sent him to the Dursleys despite the fact that it's never stated that he's in any way in charge of him other than being his headmaster 10 years later suggests that he was out of line. There's also the fact that the Potters appointed Sirius to be Harry's godfather, and they were all at war and could die, so it doesn't make sense for them to not have backup arrangements in case Sirius wasn't able to care for Harry. Sirius and Peter were out if the picture and since they suspected Remus (for some stupid reason) he probably wouldn't be an option. But that still leaves other Order members they trusted. Maybe they did leave his care to Dumbledore if they trusted him after Sirius, but if they did he just proved that he couldn't be relied on.
