The fact that Harry doesn't suffer permanent (physical) harm doesn't mean he wasn't abused. Punching me in the face is a crime even if I don't have to go to the ER.

  Child physical abuse is defined by the World Health Organisation (1999) as actions or inactions, which result in actual or potential physical harm, that are within the control of or preventable by the parent, carer, or authorised person (such as a school teacher).

Petunia swinging a fry pan at his head counts /even though/ she missed. Vernon grabbing him and dragging him counts. Denying him food counts. Denying him medical care counts. Encouraging another child to attack him counts.

He is /also/ emotionally abused. Things like making him sleep in a closet when there are two empty bedrooms. Or buying him an ice lolly when Dudley gets a huge knickerbocker. The psychological scars from emotional abuse are real. But independently of the emotional abuse, he was physically abused.
