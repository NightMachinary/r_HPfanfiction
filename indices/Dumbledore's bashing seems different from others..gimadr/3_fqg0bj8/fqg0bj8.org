I mean, in canon Dumbledore was grooming Harry as a sacrifice to kill Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.

  ...

  Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?

  ...

  If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will, truly, mean the end of Voldemort.'

  Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.

  ‘You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?'

  ‘Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?'

  ‘Lately, only those whom I could not save,' said Snape. He stood up. ‘You have used me.'

  ‘Meaning?'

  ‘I have spied for you, and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter --'

  ...

  Dumbledore's betrayal was almost nothing. ... he realised that now. He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his lifespan had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. ... How neat ... to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort.

Of course, Harry understands the necessity, but it was still manipulative and still a betrayal.
