This is the argument I find most baffling. Dumbledore's manipulations in terms of Harry's death are all quite clearly directed to the opposite. It would be child's play for Harry to die, which is all that's needed to destroy the horcrux. Dumbledore went to huge lengths not to ensure that Harry died, but to give him a chance to live again afterwards.
