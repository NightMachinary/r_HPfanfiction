I know, Dumbledore could have killed Harry and saved himself so much trouble, he could have orchestrated Harry to die over Little Whinging or something, but he went through the trouble to give him a survival path because he wanted Harry to live. Dumbledore didn't believe in the prophecy, which is the only reason anyone would think a child has a chance to defeat Voldemort, so essentially Dumbledore didn't think Harry could do it, at least not until the magic lined up (Voldemort taking Harry's blood and Harry's wand taking Voldemort's power and recognizing Voldemort as an enemy are the two biggest things). These are not hidden plots in the book, there are prominent plots.
