  Not addressing the very real and bashable fact that Dumbledore by his own admission raised and molded Harry so that he would sacrifice himself.

I think it may be argued, actually. There's lots of evidence that Dumbledore is lying to Snape. He closes his eyes to ensure Snape can't tell he's lying to him. The narrator mentions how his eyes remain closed through this conversation, then he opens his eyes after he finishes telling Snape that Harry must die. Snape being the story's premiere Occlumens, I would argue it's very relevant to consider why the story would bother mentioning someone's closed eyes three times in a conversation with this person.
