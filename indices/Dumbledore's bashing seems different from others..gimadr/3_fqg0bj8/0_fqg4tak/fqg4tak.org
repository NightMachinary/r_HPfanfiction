OP countered the bashing point of "/Dumbledore is keeping Harry in the Dark about everything because he is a lamb for slaughter/". By countering the reasons that Dumbledore kept Harry in the dark. Not addressing the very real and bashable fact that Dumbledore by his own admission raised and molded Harry so that he would sacrifice himself. Yes he did it believing that Harry would survive, but he did it anyway, and that can't be explained away.
