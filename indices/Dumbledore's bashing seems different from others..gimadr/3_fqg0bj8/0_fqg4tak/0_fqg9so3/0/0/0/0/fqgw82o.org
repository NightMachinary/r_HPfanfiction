  It's not clear exactly why Dumbledore wanted Harry to claim the Hallows then, given that he believed them to be masterful enchantments rather than works of Death himself. It wasn't about making sure Harry survived though as that was already covered
#+end_quote

Dumbledore didn't want Harry to claim them all. The Elder Wand was supposed to end with his death. As Dumbledore said in the quote he thought Harry would take the wrong idea from the stories (as Harry nearly did in the middle of the book) and claim the Hallows for the wrong reason.

Dumbledore failed to master Death by being blinded by the Resurrection Stone and it cost him his life. He could let the Cloak and the Wand slip out of his hands but the power to bring back what he lost was too much temptation.

He gave Harry the Resurrection Stone only at the end when Harry knew what to do and wouldn't be tempted to do more than talk to those he lost.
