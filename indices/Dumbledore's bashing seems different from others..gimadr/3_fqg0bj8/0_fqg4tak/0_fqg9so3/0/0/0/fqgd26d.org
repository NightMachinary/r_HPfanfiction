The plan that Harry is referring to here is Dumbledores plan to break the power of the Elder wand if possible and to keep it out of the hands of Voldemort otherwise. He intended for Snape to become the wands master but that plan failed.

Its unclear what Dumbledore's thoughts regarding the nature of the Hallows and the Master of Death truely are, as he both states that he thinks "it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations." implying that the unification of the Hallows gives no special power over death, while at the same time having intentionally introduced the idea of the Hallows to the trio in a specific manner: "

‘I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.'"

It's not clear exactly why Dumbledore wanted Harry to claim the Hallows then, given that he believed them to be masterful enchantments rather than works of Death himself. It wasn't about making sure Harry survived though as that was already covered

‘But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,' Harry started again, ‘and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?' ‘I think you know,' said Dumbledore. ‘Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.' ‘He took my blood,' said Harry. ‘Precisely!' said Dumbledore. ‘He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!
