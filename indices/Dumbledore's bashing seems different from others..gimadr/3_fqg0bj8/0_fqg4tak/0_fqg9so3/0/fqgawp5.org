Not established flat out, but the "gleam of something like triumph" in Dumbledore's eyes when he's told that Harry's blood was used in the ritual, along with his statement in Deathly Hallows that "he took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you" implies that Dumbledore at the very least hoped that this was a possibility if he was not outright convinced that Harry could survive death at the hands of Voldemort one more time.

A minor and fairly easily discardable point in favor of manipulative Dumbledore is that Triumph usually implies the success of the Triumphant one, or that Voldemort using Harry's blood was something that Dumbledore wanted to happen and had planned for.
