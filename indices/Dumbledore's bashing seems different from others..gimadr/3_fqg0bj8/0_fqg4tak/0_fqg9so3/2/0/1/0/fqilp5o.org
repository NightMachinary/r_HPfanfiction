Exactly my point. He can't test it, he can't plan for it, so it makes absolutely zero sense for him to plan it out like a chessmaster.

All the people saying "he raised harry to sacrifice himself!" are forgetting that Voldemort was unbeatable, immortal and would always resurrect in perpetuity until the scarcrux was destroyed. What else was he supposed to do? There are no prisons that can hold an immortal man, the walls will always crumble and the wardens will all die before he does.

Dumbledore made the best choice possible in his situation. I'd like to see the people who crticize that choice to be thrust into this situation and choose more wisely.
