This is kind of the central issue of having a child protagonist. If Harry was an adult throughout the books, if Albus didn't have in loco parentis powers and responsibilities as a school headmaster, then most of the objections to his behavior disappear.

The fact that Harry is a child that Dumbledore has power over is what makes his actions skeezy.
