  Harry had no such agency.

Not at first, but when Dumbledore asked him to face Voldemort at age 16, Harry agreed to do it, he wanted to, even, he was scared Dumbledore wouldn't let him fight. I know people think Dumbledore molded Harry to feel that way, but I really don't think that makes sense with a close reading. Dumbledore's plan changed throughout the series, and frankly, I really don't see any grooming happening. Like, I just don't see that pscyhological influence happening.
