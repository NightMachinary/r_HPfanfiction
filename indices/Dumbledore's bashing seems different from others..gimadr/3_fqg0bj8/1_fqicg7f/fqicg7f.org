  I mean, in canon Dumbledore was grooming Harry as a sacrifice to kill Voldemort.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure he was. From infancy through year five, he planned for Harry to die/be sacrificed, but I don't think he thought throughout those years that Harry would actually defeat Voldemort (and the Horcruxes aspect of the project didn't come in until CoS also). What would make him think Harry has a chance? Dumbledore does not trust prophecies, which he states frequently, so he doesn't take for granted that Harry will have the skills to do it just because a prophecy says so. The only reason he would need /Harry/ to defeat Voldemort is if he believed in the prophecy or if he believed in Harry himself. I think he does believe in one or both of those eventually (the end of OotP, specifically), but it was not what Harry was /raised/ for. When Snape says that pig for slaughter line, Dumbledore is intentionally misleading him to think that, but Dumbledore clarifies his plan in King's Cross
