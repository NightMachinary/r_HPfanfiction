The only thing I'll say is that the whole argument about Dumbledore not trusting himself with power is incredibly naive. He holds three, extremely important positions. Headmaster alone should raise suspicions, as Hogwarts is the most strategically important place in the country, even more so than the Ministry. Not to mention the personality cult centered around him, just as it later happens with the Boy Who Lived. Yeah, his bashing sucks and is taken to every logical extreme possible. But the man would be called a dictator in our real world.
