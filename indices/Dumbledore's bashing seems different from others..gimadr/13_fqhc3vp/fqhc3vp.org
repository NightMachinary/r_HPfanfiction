  But in the case of Dumbledore, he seems different since when bashed, his motivations are always the complete opposite of what we are said in canon :
#+end_quote

In the case of Dumbledore, his motivations in canon are... complicated. And more than that, they're hidden.

Let's take your first point for instance:

#+begin_quote
  "Dumbledore is keeping Harry in the Dark about everything because he is a lamb for slaughter". In canon, Dumbledore clearly say to Harry that he kept him in the dark not only because of his connection to Voldemort (anything said to Harry could potentially be learnt by Voldemort), but also because he loved him too much and didn't want to put such a burden on him.
#+end_quote

In canon, Dumbledore does say that, sure. But is that /convincing/? I don't know if I agree with Dumbles myself - after all, if I knew that someone I loved would have to essentially commit suicide to stop magical hitler, I wouldn't brush it off and have them only realize it at the last moment. Or if I knew they were already involved in something, I wouldn't keep them in the dark in an effort to keep them away from it.

So Dumbledore's canon motivation stem mostly from what /Dumbledore/ tells us - and that isn't always going to be convincing. Yes, the pushback against him goes to ridiculous extremes in a lot of fics, and in a really bad way - but I don't think it's any more extreme or weird than the Weasley bashing, or Hermione bashing, or any of the other aspects. It relies on turning up his duplicity and his schemes up to 11 - which then invalidates all of what he has to say to defend himself, because of /course/ Dumbledore is lying about it. It'd be like if we had a character who had blue as their favorite color - but the only time canon mentions it is when the character themselves says it, and they're also a chronic liar. I would understand readers that would then not view that as canon.

So of your 3 points, 1 & 2 can be explained that way (rejecting how Dumbledore presents himself) and 3 can be explained by a Manipulative!Dumbledore wanting to rule from the shadows - an author would have to explain it, but I think it's not difficult to reconcile with a darker, more secretive view of Dumbledore.
