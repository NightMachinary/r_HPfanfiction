I'll concede on that point regarding JK Rowlings decision to not be psychologically realistic. I didn't know about her work with the charity. The book you mention sounds enlightening.

I will then modify my original statement to say that the fact that Harry suffers no lasting damage from his abuse at the hands of the Dursleys is a literary choice that cannot be used to disregard the severity of their actions against him.
