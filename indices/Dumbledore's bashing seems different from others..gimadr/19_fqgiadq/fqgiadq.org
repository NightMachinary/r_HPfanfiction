Most fanfiction is written by (near-)teenagers for teeanagers, so it is no surprise that the complete reversal of authority is normal. It is the same for good Draco/Snape: just because the authority (JKR in the canon) says they are bad, we must write how they are good. And just because Dumbledore (and Weasleys and Hermione) are good (and Ginny is Harry's girl), they must be bad. I have written more about this on my blog in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][the review]] of linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities).
