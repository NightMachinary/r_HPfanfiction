The thing is, there are a /lot/ of things in the books that add up to Dumbledore being, at the very least, incredibly manipulative and misleading. For all that his words are those of someone who cares, sometimes I can't help but think he was lying when he said it.

-   Hagrid, on Dumbledore's orders, takes Harry Potter from Sirius Black at the wreckage of the Potter's house, before Sirius was arrested, effectively kidnapping him from his rightful guardian.

-   He repeatedly returned Harry to an environment he knew to be abusive, when there were other potential methods of keeping him safe.

-   He cut off Harry from emotional support after severe emotional trauma(I really don't blame Harry at all for being explosively moody throughout the 5th book. He's clearly suffering from untreated PTSD, having been tortured and witnessing someone being murdered in front of him).

-   He never got Sirius Black a trial, despite being head of what amounts to being Wizarding Britian's highest judiciary body.

-   Several times he should have traveled faster. I suppose it might be excusable to ride a broom from Hogwarts to the Ministry in the /Philosopher's Stone/ before we're introduced to faster modes of transport(portkey, floo, apparition), but in the 5th book, when we've been introduced to all of those, yet somehow, despite those, the kids flying thestrals still manage to beat the Order of the Phoenix to the Ministry of Magic, when the flight of at least 800 kilometers would have taken /hours/.\\
    To be fair, I suppose this could be down to Snape not realizing they went to the Ministry, when they disappeared with Umbridge in the Forbidden Forest).

-   Dumbledore's stated reasoning for distancing himself from Harry in Order of the Phoenix is utterly idiotic.\\
    He says that it would have made Harry Potter too tempting a target, but the thing is, every appearance of Voldemort in the books is marked by his obsession to beat The Boy Who Lived, even BEFORE the Prophecy is revealed to Harry(and through him, us).\\
  It has also been stated repeatedly that Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort ever feared.\\
    In essence, Dumbledore is either an idiot in this scene, or flat out lying about his reasons for distancing himself when Harry most needed the support of an authority figure.

Sorry, while I do ultimately like Dumbledore, especially when a fanfic does a good job of him fixing his mistakes or just not making them, there's a lot he does in canon that's counterproductive to his supposed goals.
