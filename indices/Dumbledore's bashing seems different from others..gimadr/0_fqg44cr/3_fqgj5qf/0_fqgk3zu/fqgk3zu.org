You made my point yourself, while not named as of yet, Dumbledores ability to pop into existence at a location was introduced in the very same book in which he chooses not to use it. Meaning that both the reader and the writer are aware of this ability.

Even if we as readers of the first book didn't know of Dumbeldores ability to apparate at the time, when taken as a whole he does have that ability. Peoples issues with Dumbledore is an in universe examination of actions and motives, not a literary stance. The in universe nature of the examination by nature precludes any hand waving regarding tone changes in the books or ideas Rowling hadn't had yet. In universe , apparation exists, Dumbledore can do it, and he chose to fly to London, giving Quirrel the opportunity he had been waiting for.
