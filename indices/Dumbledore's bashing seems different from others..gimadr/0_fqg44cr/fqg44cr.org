LiathGray's response is really well written and summarizes things much the same way I would, so I'd like to address instead something that you said in your post.

  But in the case of Dumbledore, he seems different since when bashed, his motivations are always the complete opposite of what we are said in canon

This is the problem. People that bash Dumbledores character are not flanderizing and radicalizing his canon characterization, but his canon actions. In canon, his words, motivations, and characterization as seen through the lens of other characters is mostly positive, flawed still yes, but mostly positive.

His actions however are inconsistent with that characterization. When someone seeks to reconcile the characterization of Dumbledore with his actions (leaving the school by broom when he knew Voldemort was after the stone, letting Snape bully students for years, sending Harry to the Dursleys without any safeguards or explanation to Harry, not figuring out the Basilisk or Chamber, etc etc) something has to give.

For some authors that comes through the crafting of explanations, contrivances that explain away most of the issues, that tie Dumbledore's hands so he couldn't act better, that make the bad decisions he made the better of two bad choices, and so on.

For other authors the explanations come easier when not portraying Dumbledore in a positive light. Why did Dumbledore leave the stone behind protections that seem particularly suited to the experiences and talents of Harry Potter, Ron Weasely, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom and then leave the school by broom? For these authors (and supported by JK herself via Dumbledore's words and Harry's conclusion at the end of the book) the only explanation is that Dumbledore specifically chose to engineer a situation in which an eleven year old boy would confront his parents murderer in a scenario that the child believed to be life or death. Even if there were a million safeguards in place, including an invisible Dumbledore actually standing between Harry and Voldemort at all times, placing a child in that situation is fucked up. Creating the situation by letting the child figure out clues and "[doing] things the right way" before making it seem like the fate of the world was in their hands so they would rush into what could have been their doom is manipulative.

Those explanations for Dumbledore are what get expounded on, and blown up, and exaggerated to give the Dumbledore of bashing infamy, not his canon characterization.
