One big thing for me was the troll incident. Quirrell: "Troll in the dungeon! Troll in the dungeon! Thought you ought to know." Dumbledore: "Prefects lead your houses back to your dormitories." (The fact that they are all in the great hall with the professors, therefore safe and are asked to go is enough ridiculous as it is) Slytherins: "... Our dorm IS in the dungeon!" And everyone seems to have just forgotten it.
