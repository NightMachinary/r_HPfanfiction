  And it is a title for someone at the head of the ICW, kind of odd how such a title can be removed by a national government though.

He is present in the ICW as a representative of Britain. When the British Ministry removed him as their representative, he automatically lost the position of Supreme Mugwump. At the OotP, when he's restored to his positions, he becomes Chief Warlock of the Wizemgamot but is only a member of the ICW, not its head.
