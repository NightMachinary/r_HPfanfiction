  And it is a title for someone at the head of the ICW, kind of odd how such a title can be removed by a national government though.

That's part of the point, no? You can't really declare Supreme Mugwump of the ICW to be some sort of incredible position of power when it can be taken away so easily (and based on just gossip and spite, no less). His headmastership is /far/ more difficult to lose.
