I don't quite see what that has to do with what I said?

Just saying "So and so is the head of X" says literally nothing about how much power they actually wield, both in terms of what they can actually /do/ in that position and in terms of how strongly they can hold on to that position.

Take a real world president for example: there are clearly known/laid out powers of each country's president /and/ it's very difficult to (legally) remove a president from their seat regardless of how much they're pissing off the other powers that be. So we can call "president" a powerful position because a president can do and influence a lot and push a lot of boundaries during their term without retaliation.

Or take Elizabeth II, as another example, she is technically Canada's head of state but has pretty much zero real-world influence on the way the country is run. However she is pretty much set for life (literally) in her position and it comes with a lot of known, huge benefits so you can still call it a powerful position because she exerts a sort of meta-influence due to the wealth and respect she commands.

Then contrast that with the Supreme Mugwump position, where 1) we know literally nothing about what executive powers the holder has, 2) we don't know of any extra benefits to the position like wealth or artefacts, and 3) it's apparently very easy to get kicked out of the position, to the point that the British Ministry could do it just because they didn't like what Dumbledore was merely /saying/. What then is the power in such a position?
