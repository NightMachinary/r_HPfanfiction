Do you really need it expanded upon?

There is an Old English word spelled the same "mugwump". Which means “Mugwump is a derogatory word for somebody in charge who affects to be above petty squabbles and factions. So when your boss tries to make peace at the meeting table like an impartial angel, he is being a mugwump.”

And it is a title for someone at the head of the ICW, kind of odd how such a title can be removed by a national government though.

As for Chief Warlock, this is noted:

There were three successive heads of the Wizengamot who possessed chestnut and unicorn wands, the combination, as Garrick Ollivander noted, showing a predilection for those concerned with matters of justice and law.

Which suggests that they are indeed the head of a law court.
