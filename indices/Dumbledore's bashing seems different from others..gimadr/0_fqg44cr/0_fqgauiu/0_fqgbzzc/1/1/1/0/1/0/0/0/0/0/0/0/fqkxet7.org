The feudal system is more than having an upper class. It involves a king selling land to barons, who in turn lease parts of their land to knights. The knights then provide a military service to the barons, which the king can demand to use if necessary. At least in feudal England, calling someone a "lord" was a relative term to indicate one's specific superior (overlord, landlord, lord of the manor, etc). The term is used differently in different situations and evolved over time (which is of course why Voldemort can call himself a Lord, for example), but that is my understanding of its use during feudal England. There's more to feudalism, obviously, but regardless, I don't think this is the type of system used in 1990s magical Britain. There is no indication of royalty, barons, or knights. And while there is clearly prejudice against Muggleborns, I don't recall any mention of any laws favoring purebloods.
