  it suggests that the moral thing to do is for Dumbledore to become a dictator

Do you know where the term "dictator" comes from? It was a Roman office, an office with vast emergency powers only bestowed upon for the resolution of a crisis or after 6 months. Dumbledore could have taken a page from that book, fixed affairs in magical Britain and still have 5 months to spare where he could collect wool socks.
