Anybody can learn languages and standup for the underdogs(idk about the last one tho) if they are sufficiently motivated and are hardworking but albus has massive power he's the head of the United nations magical edition and the head (whoever that is idk about UK politics)of parliament magical edition and the headmaster of the most popular and best school of magic for wizards and witches and is the most powerful wizard while he's still alive (tho imo he and voldy are tied) the amount of influence he has is immense. He can shape the political landscape locally and internationally and he can put himself on a pedestal infront of the students so that when they become adults\\
They are more favourable to do what he wants.
