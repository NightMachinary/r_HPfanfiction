Dumebldore was not evil. Some of his actions were, but that was more due to negligence because Rowling needed him to be that way.

Canon Dumbledore seems almost burnt-out, tired of fighting. IMO that part of his character should have been explored more. Why he did not carry the fight despite all of his powers. But I do not consider him evil in the same way as Voldemort or even Draco Malfoy.
