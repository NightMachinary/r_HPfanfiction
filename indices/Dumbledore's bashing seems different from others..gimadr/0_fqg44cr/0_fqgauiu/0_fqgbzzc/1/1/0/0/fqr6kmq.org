I believe our differences of interpretations are not so much about Dumbledore, but our broader differences in how we read literature in general, specifically children's fantasy literature. It's not a problem to have different frameworks, it is just a way to understand how we read and understand texts and it helps us understand how others do too. But literary theory is expensive, dense, time-consuming, confusing, and therefore useless. I loved these books and I loved talking about them so much that I wanted to do it better. I'm four years into an essay about Dumbledore, even. I keep changing it because I keep learning more about literary theory and how to apply it to understanding his characterization, I'm still a long way off, but I'm trying my best. It reminds me that meme where people tell big HP fans to "read another book!", but I think re-reading is the best way to truly understand a book, and even better if we truly truly love it, because we can more easliy make thematic connections that are harder to make if we didn't actually /feel/ the story through enjoyment. These books inspired me to explore literary theory in a way no other book would have done. I love HP more than ever, so I think it was a good thing overall, but this thread made me cry the other day because I realized everything I've done in the last four years is useless and will never be useful. This is not towards you, but I can't help feel like the general online fandom hates these books. Most aren't interested in exploring why they think the things they do; for example, Aberforth is taken as an unbiased source of information. Why do we see him as unbiased? I find that most people are not interested in exploring that question. I know fans can't actually hate the thing they love, but every time someone posts something they like about the books, the comments are always negative, almost belittling the poster for not realizing that the thing they love is actually problematic or even evil. As if growing up is realizing the books are bad and we should feel bad for taking so long to realize it. As a writer myself, fanfiction and otherwise, I cannot imagine writing anything as good as the HP books, so I am okay accepting that it has flaws without being negative about it. At least, I hope I am. I'm not out here trying to say JKR is a genius or anything ridiculous like that, but I also want to enjoy the stories again, enjoy them as inherently unrealistic fair- tale-like stories, not a reflection of our reality. I want to talk about the books without getting depressed for days. I did not fall in love with a realistic world, I fell in love with a fictional whimsical one. I'm interested in theme and character which are inherently things that don't exist in real life. We can never know real people the way we can understand fictional ones, they are designed for that very purpose, to feel real when they actually aren't. But I feel so alone in this fandom for that. What does theme matter in discussion like this? World-building is obviously important, and I'm not going to say the HP one is perfect, but it's more humorous than realistic, and I think that is what it set out to be. But it feels like if there's not an explanation of what, for example, the Wizengamot actually does, then it's filled in however most damages Dumbledore, rinse and repeat for every world-building gap. On top of this, I just get confused about what people in general actually want Dumbledore to be. There are so many mixed messages. Here I was thinking people wanted Dumbledore to share information to delegates so they can do things instead of himself, but then someone in this thread gets upvoted for saying Dumbledore should have become a dictator. I just get exhausted. I was a grown ass adult crying over an online discussion about a children's book the other day and then had to explain why to my spouse and my mother. Obviously that reflects my own flaws, but nevertheless, I've got to take a break from the internet fandom.

Cheers, and thank you for your interest in talking about Dumbledore. I'm sorry I can't carry on the conversation.
