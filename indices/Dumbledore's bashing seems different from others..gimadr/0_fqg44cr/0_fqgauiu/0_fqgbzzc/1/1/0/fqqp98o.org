But does he stand up for the underdog? Let's look at two cases:

1. Hagrid was expelled and his wand snapped for something he didn't do. Okay, so Dumbledore wasn't the headmaster then so he couldn't stop it, but he did get Hagrid hired as the groundskeeper. That is the ONLY thing Dumbledore did for Hagrid: he got him a job (as a thirteen-year-old, but that wasn't all that unusual back then). He didn't clear his name, doesn't give him any way to continue his education, and when Fudge comes to cart Hagrid off to Azkaban in Harry's second year, Dumbledore is unable to stop his arrest. It's only after the events in the Chamber of Secrets that Hagrid is exonerated (with no apparent input from Dumbledore). THEN, I guess Dumbledore could be said to "stand up" for him by making him an instructor... a person who never finished their third year, didn't take OWLS much less NEWTS, isn't an accredited teacher (not that that seems to be an issue in JKR's world) and hasn't legally been able to use a wand for 50 years. That's not an underdog, that's a disaster waiting to happen (and it did).
2. Remus Lupin was allowed to attend even though his is a werewolf, but only by hiding that fact from the entire school. Is that standing up for an underdog (no pun intended)? Only if it was not an isolated case. How many other werewolves are out there, denied an education? Remus is proof that they can safely be educated with other children, but does he use that example to allow other werewolves in? Well, we don't know for sure, but the fact that Remus is still a SECRET werewolf when he comes in to teach indicates otherwise.

It can be argued that both of these cases are outside Dumbledore's scope. So let's talk inside his scope: NOT ONCE does Dumbledore do anything about the rampant bullying in his school. Not even lip service. There's no greater underdog than a bullying victim, and Dumbledore does nothing but condone it by his silence.
