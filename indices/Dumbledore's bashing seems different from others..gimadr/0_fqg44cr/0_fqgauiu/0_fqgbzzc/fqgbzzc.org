A big one where he completely fails to walk the walk is his remark on his unsuitability to hold power with regards to turning down the ministry. While he may have not been using his position as headmaster to plot evil plots in canon, having power over the youth of the country and what they are taught is a huge position of authority. Not to mention that he is also the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.

Some fics turn those positions into mostly ceremonial ones with no real power in order to close the plotholes, but otherwise Dumbledore is in a position of power over foreign delegates, the judicial system, and the education system. Not so afraid of power as he claims.
