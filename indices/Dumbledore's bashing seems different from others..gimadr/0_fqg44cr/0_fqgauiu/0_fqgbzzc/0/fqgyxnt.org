Even if we assume that all the other positions of power are ceremonial and all Dumbledore is is a teacher and guide, he still continously misuses that power.

He puts the whole school at risk in his plan to draw out voldemort in philosophers stone. We know he knew or suspected Quirrel at least, even if he may not have known that Voldemort was possessing it.

In goblet of fire he essentially allows Fudge to use extra-judicial powers to kill Barty Crouch, in the same school that he had promised a year ago that he would never allow a dementor to enter.

Most tellingly for me, in half blood prince while knowing that Draco Malfoy is trying to kill him he puts the whole school at risk yet again - Katie and Ron both could have died because Dumbledore does not do anything about a serious plot of murder that he knows about. Malfoy is able to bring dangerous and sadistic death eaters like Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback (who we are told 'likes them young') into the school and only Harry distributing Felix Felices and great luck saves children from being killed. At best we can say he was protecting Snape's position as a spy, but once again he compromises the safety of the students to do so. Dumbledore is a terrible headmaster.
