  At best we can say he was protecting Snape's position as a spy, but once again he compromises the safety of the students to do so. Dumbledore is a terrible headmaster.

Even that is a terrible argument.

Harry openly accuses Malfoy of being the one to attack Katie. He also has attacked Harry at the very start of the term. Even if Harry has no proof, he can use that excuse to "investigate" Malfoy and get rid of him. Or at least neutralize him by forcing him into an Order safehouse to keep him away from Voldemort.

Snape is an Occlumens; he can /lie/ to Voldemort, if needed. As long as Malfoy is alive and well, and Snape intends to kill Dumbledore, he remains safe from his stupid decision to give an Unbreakable Vow to a woman who had no power or influence to compel it.
