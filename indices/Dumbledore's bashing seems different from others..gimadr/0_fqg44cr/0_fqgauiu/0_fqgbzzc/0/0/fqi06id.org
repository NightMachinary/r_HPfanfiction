Throughout canon Dumbledore consistently shows that he cares more about the possibility of redeeming one "bad" guy than all of the innocents they harm. That also bleeds into how the OOTP initially engages with the Deatheaters. Why in the world would you start an engagement against known murderers, rapists, and terrorists with stunners etc instead of more damaging curses to put them down.

Hell he knows that lucius was responsible for the diary entering the school and then lucius is stopped in mid killing curse and is allowed to leave with no consequences. Harry's memory could have been used to give the DMLE enough justification to pour Veritserum down lucius' throat.
