Sure, but as a witness to Dumbledore's general character, you can't just write him off. Without knowing the detailed situation, he pretty shrewdly has worked out the general nature of what Dumbledore has asked Harry to do, and something of the character of how Dumbledore asked him to do it.

That doesn't mean Dumbledore was wrong, or that Aberforth is right, but it does tell us something about Dumbledore's general character as seen by his brother who has stayed in touch his entire life.

If you combine that with Dombledore's canon actions as seen through more adult eyes, along with even how Dumbledore himself explains his actions, and Snape's memories of Dumbledore explaining things, it gives a less wise, more arrogant, more utilitarian, picture.

And I think that's great! The books grow up with Harry. Harry loses all his mentor/father figures over the course of the books, either because they die or because he can no longer see them in that role. The seventh book is a long, slow process of Harry starting to see Dumbledore as a human who may have made some bad choices and can be questioned, not a mysterious, wise, elderly sage. It is that hard part of growing up in which even the most loving parents let us down.
