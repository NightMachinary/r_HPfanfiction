  Sure, but as a witness to Dumbledore's general character, you can't just write him off.

I certainly don't write him off. I am genuinely frustrated that this is apparently such a controversial idea. Aberforth is /clearly/ biased about his brother, /and he should be/, but that does not change the fact he is biased. Albus has never been open with his brother /about anything/, so of course Aberforth will not understand the situation. Aberforth think Albus was /happy/ when Ariana died. That is the height of misunderstanding Albus!!

But readers have an advantage over Aberforth, /we/ have access to more information than he does. We have thre knowledge that books are designed to be known, they are not chaotic like real like, so we understand that when Albus picks a grave marker, it has meaning, and there is so much meaning in Ariana's gravestone. "For where your treasure is, there will be your heart also". The wiki has this to say about what this means in the context of the Bible,

  In the previous two verses Jesus explained why one should store one's treasure in heaven rather than on earth. This verse states that if one places one's treasure in heaven that is where one's heart or attention will be. This is an implicit warning, which is made clear later in the chapter, that if one's treasure is on earth, one's heart and attention will also be on earthly matters, to the exclusion of God. While the previous verses stated that placing one's treasures in heaven was wise, this one shifts to warning that not doing so might lead to a life of futility seeking treasures that will not matter in light of eternity. Matthew 6:24 makes this explicit. This verse also makes clear that treasure is not some specific collection of objects, but is rather anything that one values in life.

Isn't there any meaning in this? Doesn't this show us where Dumbledore's mind was at the moment Ariana died? Doesn't this reveal that Aberforth is uninformed about the inner-workings of his brother's mind?

Then there's the Elder Wand. Dumbledore spend years /avoiding/ doing the right thing, avoiding going after Grindelwald, because he was scared that Grindelwald just might know the actual spell which killed Ariana, and that it just might have been Dumbledore's own spell that did it, and the fear and terror of that truth paralized him. His defeat of Grindelwald does not prove he is brave like his contemporaries believe, because the reader is privileged with more information on him than Dumbledore's contemporaries have. We can see that Dumbledore's defeat of Grindelwald reveal he is actually a huge coward. And it was this cowardice that delayed him, he feared the death of his sister so much that it was stronger than his desire for the Elder Wand. The manner in which he wont he wand (the symbol for desiring power) shows us that he had conquered that particular trait, but it also shows us how little he conquered his fear of others' death.

Dumbledore's own death by the Resurrection Stone is another example of how little Aberforth understands his brother. Dumbledore never learned to accept the deaths of his family, he never grieved in a healthy way, or moved past his own shame and culpability about his sister dying, and this "weakness" (though I would probably fail here too) lead to him losing all rationality and picking up the Stone. The madness of his reaction reveals his character, reveals his weakness, reveals that Aberforth does not understand his brother when he thinks Aberforth is happy to be "free" that Ariana and the rest of their family is dead. Harry and the reader is privileged with understanding the fuller context.

Aberforth is a fantastic clue to understanding Dumbledore's character, but it doesn't mean his information is accurate. Same with Rita Skeeter, Aunt Muriel, Doge, Bagshot, and even Snape in the pig for slaughter scene serve the same function in the story as Aberforth, they make us doubt Dumbledore. It is up to the reader to use their information and compare it to what Dumbledore's says in King's Cross and in all the other times he's sat down and explained his thoughts. That way we find the reality, and it does not paint Dumbledore as a perfect character, because that is /not/ what I'm trying to say. But it does show us that Aberforth is biased and misinformed. It's not his fault, but he still is.

I am not a child who can't look at Dumbledore as flawed. I am an adult who tries very hard to understand those flaws. He is interesting to me because of why he is flawed, because of what I've learned about him and the books through exploring these flaws in extreme detail. He is interesting to me because of the mystery techniques used in revealing his flawed character to the reader, he is interesting to me because nobody knows him entirely and only Harry and the reader are privileged to have access to that information, so discovering who he is becomes a journey. And part of that journey is realizing, among other things, that Aberforth is biased and misinformed. I do not feel like this is radical thing to say based on his presentation in the books, and based on his insistence that Albus is happy that Ariana died.
