First, I don't think it's so much that Dumbledore doesn't believe in prophecies /at all/ as he doesn't believe that Divination as a class has meaningful practical application, at least for those who don't have the natural gift, and those are rare even among wizards.

Otherwise, IMO it's also easy to make and believe the argument that Dumbledore at some point started to believe in his own legend to some extent, failing to trust others with information on an assumption such as he knows best, the burden is his to bear, or the others are too weak, unreliable, or untested to succeed at what needs to be done. Is he evil? I doubt that, but I would agree that some of his choices at least appear to those who don't know his thinking processes to be negligent or incompetent at best. Fact is, he isn't perfect, and while I can't think of a fic that plays a bash of him like your description of the more common bash trope off the top of my head I'm pretty sure there's been at least one I've read that did so (admittedly that's not a glowing review of Dumbledore bashes in general but still).

Also, never forget that this is fanfiction lol and people can write whatever they want.
