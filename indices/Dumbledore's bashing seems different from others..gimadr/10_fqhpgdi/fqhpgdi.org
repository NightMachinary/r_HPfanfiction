Well in all fairness to JKR this series was created for kids/young adults. It had an interesting enough story line to pull in adults (and it ran long enough that those kids/young adults who were the Targetted audience grew up and had their own kids).

The hero of her story was a kid, and for an 11 year old to be the hero it means that the adults around him/her need to do stupid things. If they don't and actually step in doing what an adult should do there wouldn't be much of a story.

So the question becomes how do you justify the adults doing stupid things? There really is only a handful of reasons that can be used/believable.

1. Not enough information
2. Misunderstanding the information
3. Honest Mistake
4. Some level of Negligence
5. Some level of incompetence
6. Believing the adult knows best
7. Believing the is infallible
8. All part of a manipulative plan
9. All part of an evil plan

For the most part JKR has Dumbledore's actions be due to Believing the adult knows best, that he is infallible, and then finally part of a manipulative plan. (I know I could make a good argument on an evil plan for Dumbledore I don't think JKR ever intended him to be evil.)

Molly Weasley's actions easily fall into not enough information, misunderstanding the information, and the adult knows best rationales.

Of course, as another commenter mentioned this is fan fiction so authors are encouraged to look at canon and develop their own rationale for why the adults did stupid things. Which then often leads to a manipulative Molly or an evil Molly etc.
