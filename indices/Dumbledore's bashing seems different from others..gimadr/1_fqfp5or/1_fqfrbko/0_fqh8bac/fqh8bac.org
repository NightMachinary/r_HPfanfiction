Harry /was/ physically abused. He might not have ended up in hospital, and yeah, the 80s were very different in regards to 'discipling' children, but it isn't that much of a stretch to think Harry could have. Vernon was shown to hit, strangle, manhandle and threaten Harry (even Dudley got hit once in PS), and it is clear Harry believes Vernon would do worse. Petunia swings a frying pan at Harry's head and it doesn't even matter to her.

  Harry didn't move.

  “I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.

  “Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.

  “OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them.

  Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one---

  “Out! OUT!” Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall...

  He [Uncle Vernon] looked so dangerous with half his moustache missing that no-one dared to argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding to the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the backseat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up when he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.

  “Now you listen here, boy,” he [Uncle Vernon] snarled, “I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured---and as far as all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion---asked for all they got, getting up mixed up with those wizarding types---just what I always expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end---”

  Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.

  At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. (“Just our nephew --- very disturbed --- meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs. . . .”) He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Ma- sons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.

  He [Uncle Vernon] was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. “Well, I've got news for you, boy. ... I'm locking you up. ... You're never going back to that school...never...and if you try and magic yourself out---they'll expel you!”

  And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry upstairs.

  “Well,” said Harry, choosing his words carefully, “it'll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge that I go to that St. Whatsits---”

  “St. Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon's voice.

  “Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large, purple face. “It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it sound convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?”

  “You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?” roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his ground.

  “Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,” he said grimly.

  Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.

  Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.

  “Put - it - away!” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry's ear. “Now. Before - anyone - sees!”

  “Well, it's a very responsible job, isn't it?” said Hermione absently. She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, SO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS? “You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!”

  “You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like.”

  Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waist length silver hair and beard.
