Doesn't Vernon's speech in chapter four of Philosopher's Stone imply that he never beat Harry in the first place? As for the rampant manhandling, as someone who grew up in the late 80s, being dragged around or tossed out of rooms if you're being unruly wasn't that uncommon. The passage you quoted from Order of the Phoenix is easily the worst offender, but I don't think that constitutes repeated physical abuse.

Vernon's actions strike me more as being born from impotent anger. Harry mentioning ducking a couple times in regards to him seems to imply that if he avoided the blow, Vernon wouldn't pursue any more physical action in retaliation. It seems to act more as a warning than a desire to inflict irreparable harm.

Vernon isn't a good person, and I'll argue that he was an awful parent to my dying day, but even if he tried I don't think he was successful in his physical abuse.
