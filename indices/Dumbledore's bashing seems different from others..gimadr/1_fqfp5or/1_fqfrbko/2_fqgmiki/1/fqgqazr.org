I'm definitely of the mind that books should be understood internally, that characters are fictional texts and not real psychological people, and that the rules of the book are not necessarily the rules of reality. That's the case for all books, not just genre books, but certainly there are different conventions in certain genres than in others. I do not think most HP readers would agree, though, hence the feelings on Dumbledore.
