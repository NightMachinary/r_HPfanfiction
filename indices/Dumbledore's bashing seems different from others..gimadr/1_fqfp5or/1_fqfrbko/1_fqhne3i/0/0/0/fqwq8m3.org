Er... according to Wikipedia, no. Specifically, what a reference there says is

#+begin_quote
  Today, being a godparent is not legally binding and carries no legal rights, although godparents *may* also serve as legal guardians for children *if this arrangement is documented in a valid will*.
#+end_quote

If you mean this quote

#+begin_quote
  In both religious and civil views, a godparent tends to be an individual chosen by the parents to take an interest in the child's upbringing and personal development, to offer mentorship or claim legal guardianship of the child if anything should happen to the parents.
#+end_quote

it doesn't say anything about /first/ right to custody.

It might be different in Magical Britain's laws but we don't have any reason to think so (AFAIK, which is why I asked).

The Potters do have a Bible quote on their gravestone. And the point could simply be "you are a good friend".
