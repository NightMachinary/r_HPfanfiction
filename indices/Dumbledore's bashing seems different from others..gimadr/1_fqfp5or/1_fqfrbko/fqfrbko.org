Some of it comes from hugely exaggerating the Dursleys abuse of Harry, then painting Dumbledore as a monster for not protecting Harry from being beaten half to death as a toddler or whatever. Children aren't ordinarily taken away from their parents/guardians for mental or emotional abuse even today. Standards were lower in the real world in the 80s, plus the wizarding world seems to have an even more cavalier attitude toward child welfare/safety.
