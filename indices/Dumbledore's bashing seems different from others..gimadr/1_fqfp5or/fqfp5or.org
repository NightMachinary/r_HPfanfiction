Some of it comes from the Dumbledore seeming negligent by letting Harry & co handle the Stone, the Basilisk, etc. For example, hiding the Philosopher's stone in a school full of kids with only a fairly easy obstacle course protecting it. If you interpret it by the standards of how a responsible headmaster of a school should act, it seems bad. Of course, stuff like that is just a plot device, and the stories would have been a lot more boring if the responsible adults came in and fixed everything.
