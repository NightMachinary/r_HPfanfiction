It's true that Dumbledore's actions are the result of plot necessity in many ways. That being said, most people that write fanfiction aren't looking at it from the perspective of plot devices. They aren't bashing the actions of JK Rowling the Plot Device Creator, they are examining actions and decisions of an in universe character and bashing the actions and decisions of the character.

In other words, the actions of Dumbledore the Plot Device are justifiable, the actions of Dumbledore the character are not.

An example that highlights the opposite is the Eagles in Lord of the Rings. As Plot Devices, they only show up as deus ex machina to rescue characters from impossible to escape situations. This seems unjustifiable to many viewers as they could be so much more helpful if they took a greater role rather than staying deus ex machina. As Characters though, they are little defined except in the Simarillion which explains their nature, their role in the world, their motivations, and their actions. (Also a little critical thinking explains why they didn't just fly the eagles to Mt Doom but that's another post)

Someone writing LOTR fanfiction involving the eagles is addressing the perceived failure of Tolkein. Whereas someone writing Dumbledore bashing is addressing the failures of Dumbledore, not Rowling.
