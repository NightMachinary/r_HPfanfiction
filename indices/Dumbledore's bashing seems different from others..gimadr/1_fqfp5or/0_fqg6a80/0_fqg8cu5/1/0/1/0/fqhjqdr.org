Alright, I'll explain to you how small words can impact a person. You seem pretty firm on your position, but for anyone else who is interested, I'll paint a picture for you.

Imagine that you're depressed. Your life drags on, you have no motivation, and you have no energy. You wonder what you're living for and don't have an answer other than simply saying that you have to keep going. When you finally go to the doctor to seek help, they diagnose you with depression. All of the emotions you've felt - the misery, the emptiness, the numb and cold reality that you endured - are now associated with that word. When you hear someone say the word "depression", your mind recalls the associations that you feel with that word, which would be the cold empty world you had come to hate.

Same thing with rape. You remember vividly how your body had been forced to endure pain that you'd never wanted simply because someone else wanted to derive pleasure from your suffering. When the police and first responders found you, you heard then saying that you were raped. The doctors say you were raped. Your new counselor says that you were raped. If you ever mention what you went through, you use the word rape. When you hear the word rape in any context, you immediately think back on how alone and afraid you felt as you screamed and begged for help and nobody came to help you until it was already over and you were crying in the aftermath.

The word "rape" was used in this comedy skit. For a majority of people, this doesn't mean anything. But for rape victims, many of them associate the word with the shame and pain they had felt. Rape is a "trigger" word, which activates a post traumatic response - PTSD . Just like how a veteran may be triggered by loud sounds that may sound similar to gunfire or explosions, words can also trigger PTSD. To prevent the victims of these events from having to endure that suffering, simply mentioning that words associated with trauma like "rape" and "suicide" are involved in a material can allow these people to avoid it and thus keep them mentally healthy without having to censor content to prevent these words from being you. It allows them to roam freely without being concerned that they might have to deal with their emotions going haywire and for everyone else to enjoy the comedy skit without having words that may be a trigger being omitted or censored. It's a healthy balance between censorship and freedom. This isn't very different than the warnings at the beginning of a movie stating that there is sexual content, gore, or violence. It helps people.

Hopefully this made things more clear for anyone interested.
