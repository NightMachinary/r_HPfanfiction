It spoilers. Which is quite annoying on Archive in some cases (eg the absence of "major character death" guarantees you that the MCs are in no danger of dying) and here ruins the joke by explaining it before it is seen.

I get where you are coming from, but it should be handled differently. Ideally, it would be a sitewide standard with the option to disable some or all warnings. Just select a bit of text you are writing, right-click and select any warning which applies.
