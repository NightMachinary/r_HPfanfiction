Dumbledore is weird. He's like a self insert after his fanfiction ends. It's not about him but he's the one with all the power. You would think he would know everything that happens in the school but he is consistently uninformed or intentionally neglectful. I read a fanfic where Dumbledore actually had a reason for arranging the philosopher stone scenario. He was expecting Quirrel to try and steal it. I really doubt possession is so common that he would think of that. But on the whole dumbledore is a badly written self insert with too much power and can't be allowed to be present when actual conflict occurs.
