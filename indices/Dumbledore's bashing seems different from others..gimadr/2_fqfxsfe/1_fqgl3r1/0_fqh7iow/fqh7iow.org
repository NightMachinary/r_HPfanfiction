  whether or not you consider the "manipulative Dumbledore" characterisation reasonable comes down to whether or not you believe the reader knows more than Dumbledore about what is magically, politically, and practically possible.

I would say it actually comes down to whether you view the books through an in-universe or real life lens. In-universe we can clearly see that Dumbledore's actions were at the very least morally questionable and that he cannot possibly have been as kindhearted as he appeared. At the very least he would have had to be purposefully setting Harry up to defeat Voldemort by putting him through terrible situations his entire life.

Through the lens of real life, though, it's a children's book series that later became a young adult's book series written by an author very bad at writing an internally consistent world. A lot of the issues with Dumbledore's character as it relates to Harry stems from the first couple books when the series is very clearly written for young children and essentially no effort to make the adult characters act reasonably is made. It's nonsensical from this perspective to try to align the actions of characters like Dumbledore from these books to the last few.

In fact, I think this is ultimately the answer to a lot of the questions people bring up about the world of Harry Potter. The answer is basically "J.K. Rowling put very little thought into writing a consistent world" and any in-universe answer is just trying to squeeze something halfway sensible into it.
