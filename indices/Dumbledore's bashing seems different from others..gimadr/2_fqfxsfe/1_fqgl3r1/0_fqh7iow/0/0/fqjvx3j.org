A competent Dumbledore couldn't possibly 1) not realise Harry's situation with the Dursleys, 2) not find out about Ginny being possessed by Voldemort or actually leave Hogwarts, 3) not realize that Moody wasn't Moody or not see the obvious fact that someone was going to try to kill Harry at some point during the tournament, etc. He's too competent and involved for a lot of what happened to make sense.

And you say only the Sorcerer's Stone like what happened in that book was trivial.
