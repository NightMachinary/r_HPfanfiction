Firstly, calm down. It's Harry Potter we're talking about. I really don't understand why people get so aggressive on this sub.

  If push came to shove he could've been placed at Hogwarts itself.
#+end_quote

With who to take care of him? Anybody trustworthy is too busy, and those trustworthy are very few. Dumbledore thought Sirius Black was a traitor, and Sirius was James' best friend. Who would he trust? He certainly couldn't watch over a child. McGonagall couldn't. Hagrid /shouldn't./

#+begin_quote
  Moreover, the Dursleys are factually not any safer for Harry than any other place. The house itself may have been immune to attack, but if they found the Dursleys there was nothing protecting him from being attacked on the way to school.
#+end_quote

Deathly Hallows hints otherwise. It's pointed out in Chapter 2 that once the protections fell, they would all be vulnerable. If they could be attacked at school, why wouldn't they have been then? Why wouldn't Death Eaters or Voldemort have kidnapped Vernon or Petunia or Dudley?

#+begin_quote
  It's knowing that someone is going around entering the chamber of secrets and setting a basilisk (which Dumbledore had to know about, if Hermione was able to figure it out Dumbledore would have put two and two together)
#+end_quote

Dumbledore could've been mislead with false clues. Basilisks aren't known to petrify people, and if he was led to believe the creature was something hairy with many legs from the students petrified 50 years previously, then it makes sense that he'd dismiss basilisks.

#+begin_quote
  I find it impossible to believe...
#+end_quote

I don't. They're not best friends and they probably weren't together all that much.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore is doing nothing to vet people?
#+end_quote

Presumably Dumbledore figured no one would dare to impersonate Moody.

#+begin_quote
  The Sorcerer's Stone is enough to firmly establish Dumbledore as a manipulator willingly putting Harry in danger to further his plans.
#+end_quote

No it's not. It's not fact that Dumbledore wanted Harry to go face Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Did you not read or not understand my first comment? The answer to that was literally the point of the comment you replied to. The answer to all of these questions is that JK Rowling does not write consistently or put much effort into creating a consistent world.
#+end_quote

But we're looking at things from an in-universe perspective. You don't get to use the JK Rowling excuse unless I do too, and if I do, then I'll dismiss every single point you just made with, "Well, Rowling didn't think about it. Dumbledore is still good."
