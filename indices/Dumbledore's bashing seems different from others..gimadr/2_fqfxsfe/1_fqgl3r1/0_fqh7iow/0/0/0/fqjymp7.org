  A competent Dumbledore couldn't possibly 1) not realise Harry's situation with the Dursleys
#+end_quote

He says he knew of Harry's situation. This is explained in book 5. He just believed Voldemort would get past any other defenses.

  2) not find out about Ginny being possessed by Voldemort
#+end_quote

I don't see why Dumbledore is incompetent for this. It could've been any student out of hundreds. What reason did he have to suspect Ginny?

  3) not realize that Moody wasn't Moody
#+end_quote

Crouch Jr played Moody well.

#+begin_quote
  not see the obvious fact that someone was going to try to kill Harry at some point during the tournament
#+end_quote

There's no reason to believe he didn't know this.

#+begin_quote
  And you say only the Sorcerer's Stone like what happened in that book was trivial.
#+end_quote

It's trivial to your point that Dumbledore repeatedly put Harry through terrible situations.

The thing that doesn't make any sense with all this the most is, why didn't anyone else notice? If this is so obvious, why didn't the likes of Hermione figure it out too? Why is Hermione more loyal to Dumbledore than Harry in the 7th book? Is she just dumb as shit?
