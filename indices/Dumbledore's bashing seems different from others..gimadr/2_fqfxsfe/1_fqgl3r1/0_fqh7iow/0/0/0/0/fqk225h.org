  He just believed Voldemort would get past any other defenses.
#+end_quote

Ridiculous. If push came to shove he could've been placed at Hogwarts itself. Moreover, the Dursleys are factually not any safer for Harry than any other place. The house itself may have been immune to attack, but if they found the Dursleys there was nothing protecting him from being attacked on the way to school.

  I don't see why Dumbledore is incompetent for this. It could've been any student out of hundreds. What reason did he have to suspect Ginny?
#+end_quote

It's not about suspecting Ginny specifically. It's knowing that someone is going around entering the chamber of secrets and setting a basilisk (which Dumbledore had to know about, if Hermione was able to figure it out Dumbledore would have put two and two together) and somehow not being able to figure out who was going where. Four children fifteen years before mapped the castle and made it tell where everyone in the castle was but Dumbledore couldn't do this? I know you're going to say that they didn't know about the Chamber either, but he doesn't need to find the chamber just who's walking about.

  Crouch Jr played Moody well.
#+end_quote

Bull-fucking-shit. Firstly, I find it impossible to believe that he played Moody so well a man as intelligent and apparently familiar with Moody as Dumbledore is wouldn't have noticed something for a year. They never had a conversation that would have brought something up Crouch didn't know? He couldn't have taken all of Moody's memories.

Secondly, you expect me to believe that a second double agent defense professor was able to enter the castle in three years after Voldemort literally came in on the back of someone's head and Dumbledore is doing nothing to vet people? It's not like things like Polyjuice potion or even the Imperius would be unexpected.

#+begin_quote
  There's no reason to believe he didn't know this.
#+end_quote

He would have gone over the challenges with a fine-tooth comb if he was behaving reasonably. For a man of Dumbledore's talents and with Dumbledore's resourced, it shouldn't have taken much to put up enough security to at least protect from something as simple as a portkey.

#+begin_quote
  It's trivial to your point that Dumbledore repeatedly put Harry through terrible situations.
#+end_quote

The Sorcerer's Stone is enough to firmly establish Dumbledore as a manipulator willingly putting Harry in danger to further his plans. The frequency with which he does that is not really the point, though as I've explained it happened often.

#+begin_quote
  The thing that doesn't make any sense with all this the most is, why didn't anyone else notice? If this is so obvious, why didn't the likes of Hermione figure it out too? Why is Hermione more loyal to Dumbledore than Harry in the 7th book? Is she just dumb as shit?

Did you not read or not understand my first comment? The answer to that was literally the point of the comment you replied to. The answer to all of these questions is that JK Rowling does not write consistently or put much effort into creating a consistent world.
