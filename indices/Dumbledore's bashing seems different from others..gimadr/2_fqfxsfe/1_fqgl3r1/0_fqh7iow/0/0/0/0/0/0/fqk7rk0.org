  Dumbledore thought Sirius Black was a traitor
#+end_quote

That's another inconsistency in Dumbledore's character, by the way. At the very least he would have wanted to speak to Sirius to find out what else he might have told or known about Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  With who to take care of him? Anybody trustworthy is too busy, and those trustworthy are very few.
#+end_quote

He could have made do. It's easier and safer to find a single person vetted to the extreme than it is to say "lol see ya, hope a Death Eater doesn't find you on your way home one day."

#+begin_quote
  Deathly Hallows hints otherwise. It's pointed out in Chapter 2 that once the protections fell, they would all be vulnerable. If they could be attacked at school, why wouldn't they have been then? Why wouldn't Death Eaters or Voldemort have kidnapped Vernon or Petunia or Dudley?
#+end_quote

Well, firstly, we know for a fact that he wasn't safe simply because he was living there. Ignoring everything that happened while he was at Hogwarts during the time the protection existed, he was still attacked by Dementors in the fifth book.

The answer to your question is, again, that it's an inconsistency due to JKR's low quality control. I'm sure someone can come up with a convoluted reason that makes some kind of sense in-universe, but that's the actual reason.

  Dumbledore could've been mislead with false clues. Basilisks aren't known to petrify people, and if he was led to believe the creature was something hairy with many legs from the students petrified 50 years previously, then it makes sense that he'd dismiss basilisks.
#+end_quote

There's a deadly monster capable of living for a millenia living in the castle and put there by a parslemouth who was one of the most powerful wizards to ever live. Three guesses about what type of creature it is. Further, I'm just not going to be convinced that a twelve year old girl largely unfamiliar with the wizarding world (two years is not enough to come even close to someone like Dumbledore) could figure this out and Dumbledore's just dumbfounded. Also, I'm not saying you're wrong, but I don't remember anyone that had reason to have seen it but Voldemort suggesting anything about what the monster looked like.

Also, not knowing what the monster was was the less important part of that. The more important part was not figuring out who was releasing it.

#+begin_quote
  I don't. They're not best friends and they probably weren't together all that much.
#+end_quote

They're close enough that the wiki writes that Moody was one of Dumbledore's closest friends and their relationship is well-known enough that Charlie Weasley chiefly remembers him as being Dumbledore's old friend. He was also a major member of the Order during the first war. But, sure, he and Dumbledore were basically strangers.

#+begin_quote
  Presumably Dumbledore figured no one would dare to impersonate Moody.
#+end_quote

This is so stupid I'm not even going to bother responding.

#+begin_quote
  No it's not. It's not fact that Dumbledore wanted Harry to go face Voldemort.
#+end_quote

From an in-universe perspective, yes, that is the only possible explanation.

#+begin_quote
  But we're looking at things from an in-universe perspective. You don't get to use the JK Rowling excuse unless I do too, and if I do, then I'll dismiss every single point you just made with, "Well, Rowling didn't think about it. Dumbledore is still good."
#+end_quote

Sure, in this particular discussion I'm writing from an in-universe perspective because you started arguing with me about my in-universe analysis but at no point did I say that viewing through a real-life lens is unacceptable. At the very least, I didn't say one perspective was better or worse in my first comment. I think I was pretty clear in my first comment that I think the real-life lens is the more reasonable, though. I wrote the following quote.

#+begin_quote
  In fact, I think this is ultimately the answer to a lot of the questions people bring up about the world of Harry Potter. The answer is basically "J.K. Rowling put very little thought into writing a consistent world" and any in-universe answer is just trying to squeeze something halfway sensible into it.
#+end_quote

You can say that Dumbledore is still good and most of his actions are just Rowling not thinking about it. That is what I think the most reasonable answer is. You just started arguing with me about my in-universe analysis so I responded.
