This is the core of it, it the end. In the books, we're told that Dumbledore's way was the only way available - that any other choice would have very likely resulted in a dead Harry.

Some readers take the canon position as presented. Others question it.

Ultimately, whether or not you consider the "manipulative Dumbledore" characterisation reasonable comes down to whether or not you believe the reader knows more than Dumbledore about what is magically, politically, and practically possible.
