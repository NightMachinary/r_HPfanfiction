I was ready to say good job for convincing me that your argument is stronger than mine when I took a walk to put something in the post box, and on my walk I kept thinking how this was just such poor writing, why would JKR make the two magics work the same way? I thought we /must/ be forgetting something. Then I remembered that the love/blood magic isn't tied to a perimeter like the Secret Keeper one is, it hinges instead on the combined mindset of Petunia and Harry calling it their home. Petunia must accept Harry into her home, and Harry must consider it his home. The magic is bound by this mindset. It breaks when Harry is 17 /or/ when he no longer considers it home.

  “Now, your mother's charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or” --- Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen --- “*/you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you're never going to live together again, correct?”/*

  Harry nodded.

  “*/So this time, when you leave, there'll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range/*. We're choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen."

I would argue this is a fundamental difference between the two spells. It also suggest there /is/ a range to the Number 4 protection, but it only becomes relevant when Harry no longer considers the place home. Perhaps the Fidelius Charm can still be argued to be more suitable, but in terms of the two spells being similar or different, I would say this shows they are different.

  And Pettigrew being able to harm Harry shows that the blood protection is also very limited in application.

Lily's sacrificial protection stopped Voldemort from killing Harry, not Voldemort's associates, so Peter can freely harm or kill Harry. This magic never expires (although it does change when Voldemort takes Harry's blood, obviously, but Peter would still be able to harm and kill Harry just the same, Peter's abily to harm and kill Harry is unaffected by Lily's sacrifice). Dumbledore's additional protections had nothing to do with Voldemort or his associates being able to /kill/ Harry, they had to do with being able to find him while he lived at Number 4. This one is the one that expires. And this one /might/ include Voldemort's associates, but that is left unspecified.
