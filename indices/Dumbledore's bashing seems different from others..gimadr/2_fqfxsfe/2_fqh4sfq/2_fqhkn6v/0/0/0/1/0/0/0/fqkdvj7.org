I do understand not necessarily taking Pottermore as canon, but in this case she did express similar thoughts about the charm in an old interview as well (can't remember which one at the moment) so though I play around with it a bit I think it's a fair idea of what she had in mind when she was writing everyone's interactions on/with Halloween '81. Especially Sirius' - he goes /straight/ to believing that Peter betrayed James and Lily (as opposed to having the info taken without his will, or possibly being in trouble himself), and I think it makes more sense if he knows the Fidelius is nigh unbreakable than if he's just lashing out.

This is one of my biggest gripes with the character to be honest (though it is more a gripe with Rowling). He supposedly has all of this power, but in the situations where wielding it would be an advantage, it's always someone else calling the shots. With Sirius' sentencing it's Crouch Sr, at Harry's trial it's Fudge and Umbridge, when he backs Harry in saying that Voldemort is back he's stripped of his titles, etc. It adds to the impression that he can and should be doing /something/ but is not doing it for some odd reason - it's certainly valid to interpret it as deliberate/manipulative, and I do enjoy fics like that when they don't go overboard and make the same mistake that Rowling did. You can't write such a powerful, intelligent character into your story and give him so little to do plot wise: whether Dumbledore is benevolent or malevolent, it still took way too long and too much luck for whatever his plans were to come to fruition.
