  One around Number 4 (that one could easily be replaced with a fidelius) and one which protected Harry, somewhat. That one was obsolete after the graveyard though.

This conversation is surprisingly heated, so I really don't mean anything by asking, but, is there any indication the Fidelius Charm is just like the protection Harry had at the Dursleys? The freedom of movement would be severely restricted, I imagine. Harry can walk to the beach at Bill and Fleur's, and Lily visited Bathilda Bagshot, so we don't really know where the edge of the spell is in those cases (or if Lily was able to visit for some other reason other than a boundary, for example, if Sirius told Bathilda the secret on purpose for the purposes of their visiting), and with Grimmauld place, the edge of the spell was the end of the doorstep. The love/blood protection, whatever its other faults, allows Harry to go to school, to the zoo, etc, and he remains equally protected from Voldemort (and Voldemort associates). The spells are described differently enough for me to feel they are different. I see no indication to adjust one or the other to make them more similar.

I mean, if the Fidelius Charm and Lily's sacrifice are /genuinely/ the same, then why would Dumbledore place Harry at the Dursleys in the first place? It means he's lying straight to Harry's face, and there'd have to be a second, unknown, reason why he placed Harry there.
