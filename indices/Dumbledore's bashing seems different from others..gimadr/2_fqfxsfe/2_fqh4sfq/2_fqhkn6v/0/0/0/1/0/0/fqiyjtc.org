Thank you!! I was using the old.reddit, and for some reason the formatting makes the links appear the same as regular text, so I was having trouble finding it.

And yes, I definitely agree that this information is super relevant:

#+begin_quote
  (although the secret cannot be forced, bewitched or tortured out of a Secret Keeper who does not wish to give up their secret; it must be given voluntarily).
#+end_quote

So yes, I totally agree, it cannot be forced out of the Secret Keeper!

I don't /always/ use Pottermore as canon, if I'm being honest, and in fact, very rarely do, but I feel in this case, the conclusion is the same with or without this information. That is to say, the books provide enough information to place the burden of Sirius's lack of justice on Barty Crouch Sr's shoulders, not Dumbledore's. Dumbledore holds impressive sounding titles, but the reader never sees these positions in action, and we have many significant examples of Barty Crouch Sr. handling the Death Eater's trials and in fact abusing his power doing so, and the only time we are even shown the Wizengamot is when Fudge deliberately corrupts it, so we are not privileged to see it in action uncorrupted. We also don't know when Dumbledore became its head, it may have been after Sirius's imprisonment, it may have been before, and we don't know how much power the head of the Wizengamot normally has either. The reader needs to imagine a significant amount here, which means there is nothing we can do with this information. Perhaps it is poor writing, or perhaps it is intentionally left out because it is irrelevant to understanding the story. I generally read books with the idea that the text gives us all the information we need.
