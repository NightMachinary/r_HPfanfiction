  That's the Ministry you want to trust his protection to? Again, okay lol

Who said anything about entrusting Harry to the Ministry? I said that if Dumbledore wants to remove Sirius's claim to Harry, he needs to do so before placing Harry with someone else.

  I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but you do understand what the point of the blood protection was, right?

There were two sorts of protections. One around Number 4 (that one could easily be replaced with a fidelius) and one which protected Harry, somewhat. That one was obsolete after the graveyard though. And, as Pettigrew demonstrated, it was useless against Death Eaters and therefore only the static, easily replaceable component was of any use.
