These are fair points, but it doesn't account for Dumbledore still thinking Sirius was the Secret Keeper and must therefore have been the spy. Dumbledore may not trust the government even at this point, and may have had legitimate concerns that Harry would be placed with a Death Eater. I'm not going to say that this /is/ what happened, because the fact remains there is just not enough information about this plotpoint, and the world-building/plotting has too many gaps in it for us to answer these questions. Especially concerning a plot point JKR admitted she forgot to account for. I don't see any reason to keep this particular topic going.
