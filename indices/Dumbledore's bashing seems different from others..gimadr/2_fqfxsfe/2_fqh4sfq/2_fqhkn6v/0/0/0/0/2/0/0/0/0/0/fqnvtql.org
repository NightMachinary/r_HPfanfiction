But not by November 1st. If he had Harry moved to the Dursleys somewhen in let's say December, we would not have this debate. But Dumbledore had McG scouting the Dursleys before the Potters were cold. And Hagrid says that he took Harry straight from the ruins and brought him to Number 4 (which means that he had no time for alternate instructions and he was told by Dumbledore to bring Harry to the Dursleys before Dumbledore even verified that both Potters were dead). The missing day plothole really messes things up here.
