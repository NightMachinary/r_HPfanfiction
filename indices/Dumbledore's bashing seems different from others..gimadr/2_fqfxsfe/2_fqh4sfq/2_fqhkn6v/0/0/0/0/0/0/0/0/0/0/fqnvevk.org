  I would hardly call it useless, it ensured Harry could live beyond the destruction of the Horcrux in his head

Didn't the protection expire on his 17th birthday? Because that was the whole reason for moving Harry in that stupid plan IIRC.

  . Umbridge could find him because she is (or was) unconnected to Voldemort, so Harry's protection didn't apply to her

Pettigrew could also harm Harry.

And on a slightly related note, the Horcrux in Harry should have never come to be due to Lily's protection. That is honestly my biggest gripe with the DH twist. The protection which just destroyed Voldemort can easily be circumvented by his soul?
