That I agree with, it is an injustice that Sirius did not have a trial. That we agree on and is not under debate. I am saying that the consequence of that injustice is that Harry obviously cannot live with Sirius. If Crouch Sr. had done his job properly and gave Sirius a trial and he was clearly innocent, and if Dumbledore completely ignored a free Sirius, then I would consider that Dumbledore's fault and consider the possibility that Dumbledore had ulterior motives. Dumbledore believed justice had been done concerning Sirius, he believed the right person was caught, Sirius even admitted to the crime, so Dumbledore had no reason to think the wrong guy was locked up and every reason to come up with a new home for the child. Having said that, I am familiar that many think Dumbledore secretly knew Sirius was innocent and wanted him out of the way for various reasons, so for those reasons, this question is obviously irrelevant. But for people who do not think Dumbledore wanted Harry to be neglected, then it doesn't make sense for him to want Sirius out of the way.
