  I think it's a fair idea of what she had in mind when she was writing everyone's interactions on/with Halloween '81
#+end_quote

Oh yeah, I definitely agree. It is definitely relevant to understanding what JKR had in mind.

  and I think it makes more sense if he knows the Fidelius is nigh unbreakable than if he's just lashing out.
#+end_quote

Ah, you're right!! It /must/ be nigh unbreakable, or /of course/ Sirius would think Peter was tortured into revealing it! It really doesn't make sense that he would immediately realize Peter is a traitor if it was /possible/ to torture that information out!

I've really 180ed on this point. Well argued!

  This is one of my biggest gripes with the character to be honest (though it is more a gripe with Rowling)
#+end_quote

i absolutely agree and feel this almost on a personal level. I feel like I have deconstructed the story to try to figure out it's "point" so to speak, to let the text itself guide me in the ways it /wants/ to be read, if that makes sense. For example, it's fantastical. nature, how many of the character are almost caricatures, but in delightful and interesting ways, how the names are all hyper-related to the character's attributes, etc. These are things that are decidedly /not/ realistic, so I feel a realistic approach to analyzing these books is not the right one. It might be for another book, though. Anyway, long story short, there are huge gaps of knowledge, and my feeling is that this is just not relevant, so it's not worth including. I've recently read a book called /The Rhetoric of Characters in Children's Literature/ by Maria Nikolajeva, and in it, she says that books only include what is important to understand them. I mean, people can of course not /agree/ with her on that if they want, but I do agree with that. For example, I do not think we need to know more about Hermione's parents to understand her. We know what we need to know to understand the important parts of the story. I feel like the desire to know more has nothing to do with our desire to understand Hermione or the story, but our desire to have encyclopedia knowledge of the world-building. But in terms of story and character, it is not important.

So from that standpoint, I'm fairly happy to accept that any "missing" information is not necessary for understanding. Having said that, I would also argue that a genre convention for fantasy is to have a detailed, extensive, consistent world-building, because if it does not, readers naturally start filling it in themselves, with sometimes catastrophic consequences to the characters. In this thread someone has suggested to me that Dumbledore is at fault for not preventing the feudal lords from creating suppressive laws against Muggleborns. People can and will fill in these holes in whatever way they want, and while that is usually encouraged for both readers and writers, I think in some cases it veers the readers totally off course, and in those cases, I think it's the author's fault. And that's what I think happened with Dumbledore. There is no reason he should be confusing for readers. Sure, in terms of fictional character, he's an intricate nuanced one, and readers need to put in /some/ effort I guess, but he's not hidden behind complicated dialogue and unexplained motives. But Aberforth gives us permission to assume his dialogue and explaination are lies, and that gives the reader /a lot/ of freedom. He can be anything the reader wants him to be at that point.

I don't know, when I'm actually reading the books, I think he is well written. It's only when I see what other people say about him that I decide he probably is poorly written after all. I go back and forth. Sometimes I go in the other extreme and think he's too well written, but I usually don't think that for very long.

  He supposedly has all of this power, but in the situations where wielding it would be an advantage, it's always someone else calling the shots.
#+end_quote

Another thing is, I don't think he ever /did/ have all this power. I think that is an assumption Harry and the reader intuit, but it's not necessarily accurate. We know that the Minister is the most powerful position in the government, and we know Dumbledore did not accept that position. Any other position he has is therefore necessarily less powerful. Any further information is relevant for those who read books for the world-building, but not necessarily relevant to those who read books for the characters. But also, like I said above, these gaps in knowledge invite way too much speculation that is counter-productive to the story, and therefore, a negative of the writing.

#+begin_quote
  when he backs Harry in saying that Voldemort is back he's stripped of his titles, etc. It adds to the impression that he can and should be doing something but is not doing it for some odd reason - t adds to the impression that he can and should be doing something but is not doing it for some odd reason - it's certainly valid to interpret it as deliberate/manipulative,
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I understand this point. Do you mean that Dumbledore losing his titles shows that he did not use them properly before he lost them? Because I would argue the opposite, he was punished for being too vocal. I"m sorry, I think I"m just confused on the point your making, and I don't want to assume.
