  Who said anything about entrusting Harry to the Ministry? I said that if Dumbledore wants to remove Sirius's claim to Harry, he needs to do so before placing Harry with someone else.

I was referring rather snarkily to your suggestion that he be placed under the same sort of protection as at the Tonks house, sorry

  That one was obsolete after the graveyard though. And, as Pettigrew demonstrated, it was useless against Death Eaters and therefore only the static, easily replaceable component was of any use.

It was never supposed to be of use against Death Eaters, or just against general harm. It was specifically supposed to be of use against /Voldemort/, because that was the one person the entirety of Wizarding Britain had no answer to. And it's almost as if it ends up saving his life in his very first year in Hogwarts and ultimately leads to him surviving the destruction of the Horcrux in him, but okay.
