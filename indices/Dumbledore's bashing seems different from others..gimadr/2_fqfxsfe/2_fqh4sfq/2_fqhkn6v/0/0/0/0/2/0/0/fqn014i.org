According to the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/event/circa-november-1-1981-peter-pettigrew-fakes-his/][HP Lexicon timeline]], Pettigrew faked is death on either the 1st or the 2nd, with a note saying they are 90% sure it was on the first. Harry is picked up by Hagrid the night of the 31st, and not delivered to the Dursleys until the night of the 1st. This accounts for Hagrid borrowing the bike from an as-yet unsuspected Sirius Black and also accounts for Sirius being unfit to parent 24 hours later.

But even if Peter faked his death on the 2nd, after Harry is placed at the Dursleys, this does not make Sirius present or fit to parent on the 1st, because that day he was missing, going mad with grief, and hunting down Peter, so he wasn't present to claim Harry or to clear his name, and Dumbledore and Lupin both believed their was a spy in the Order beforehand and both believed Sirius was the Potter's Secret Keeper and therefore must be the spy. So the natural conclusion is that the missing person is the guilty person, and therefore unfit to be a parent. They couldn't even find Sirius, and when he was discovered after murdering 13 people, whether on the first or the second, he confessed to the crime anyway.

edit: Obviously this was injustice, nobody accounted for Sirius's grief-stricken instability, and none of this is Sirius's fault, but the series of events is designed in such a way as it makes sense people would think Sirius guilty and therefore unfit to parent.
