  Didn't the protection expire on his 17th birthday?
#+end_quote

Dumbledore's /additional/ protection expired, but not Lily's sacrifice. I don't think I'm saying anything anybody else wouldn't say.

  And on a slightly related note, the Horcrux in Harry should have never come to be due to Lily's protection. That is honestly my biggest gripe with the DH twist. The protection which just destroyed Voldemort can easily be circumvented by his soul?

Why not? My understanding is that Lily's sacrifice meant that Voldemort could not kill Harry. The Horcrux attaching itself to Harry doesn't kill him, so it's not prevented by the magic, so I'm not sure I understand the issue.
