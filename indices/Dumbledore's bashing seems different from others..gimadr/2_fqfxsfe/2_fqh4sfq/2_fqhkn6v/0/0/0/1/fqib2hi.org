  Did you even read the Wizarding World link?

What link and/or info is that? I said in another comment that the benefit of the Secret Keeper is not that the position itself is unfallible, but that it minimized the fallible positions to just one. So finding the secret becomes a matter of finding the Secret Keeper, so the best secrets are the ones kept by the least likely perosn. This is why Sirius felt he was too obvious a pick and wanted Peter to replace him. But if I'm overlooking information, I'd be happy to change my mind.
