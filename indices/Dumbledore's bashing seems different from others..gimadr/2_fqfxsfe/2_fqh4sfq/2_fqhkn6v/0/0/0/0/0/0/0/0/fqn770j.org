There are two spells. The one which roasted Quirrel (blood protection) and the one which protects Number 4 (which was where Voldemort was waiting in front of). The blood protection was strong but had obvious flaws (Pettigrew was able to harm Harry) and was useless after the graveyard. The perimeter protection however can be replaced by other means and the fidelius would not be a downgrade in regards to mobility. No matter which spell you use, it will result in a siege if the location is known. That's why the fidelius would work better.
