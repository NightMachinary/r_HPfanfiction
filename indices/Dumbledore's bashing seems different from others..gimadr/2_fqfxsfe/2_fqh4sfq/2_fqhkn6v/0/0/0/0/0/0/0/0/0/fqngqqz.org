I would hardly call it /useless/, it ensured Harry could live beyond the destruction of the Horcrux in his head.

But that's just it, it would be a downgrade. Perhaps the downgrade is worth it for the other benefits, but the downgrade still exists. Harry would be stuck within a perimeter, unable to (for example) go the park that he is able to go to in the beginning of OotP, where he sees Dudley and his gang from a distance. That was only weeks after Voldemort returned and his protection at Number 4 was strong enough that a Squib and Mungungus Fletcher were considered suitable to watch over him. Umbridge could find him because she is (or was) unconnected to Voldemort, so Harry's protection didn't apply to her, because the protection did all the heavy lifting (and arguably, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus were not there to be protectors, but for intelligence purposes). Perhaps that alone suggests that a Fidelius charm is better because not only would he (probably) have more loving guardians in that scenario, but he would also be protected from other attackers too. That view is valid. But nevertheless, Harry's physical life would be more restricted in that scenario.

If the spells are the same, then why /didn't/ Dumbledore just use a Secret Keeper? What motivated him to do something else?
