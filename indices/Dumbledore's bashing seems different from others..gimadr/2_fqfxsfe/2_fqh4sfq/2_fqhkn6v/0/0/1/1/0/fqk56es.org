  Torture not. But "voluntarily" is pretty open to interpretation as someone would volunteer that information in exchange for their balls (or other body parts).
#+end_quote

I mean, that negates the entire point of saying torture doesn't work. Having said that, that information is from Pottermore, and I usually don't consider Pottermore canon anyway, and this addition to canon makes Sirius's fear that he is too obvious a little less dramatic and perhaps even slightly pointless, so personally I think the story is more interesting if torture /does/ work. But, at the same time, if you consider Pottermore canon, I really don't see how you can make the claim torture works when Pottermore unambiguously states that it doesn't. Where does torture stop and dismemberment start? I mean, how does dismemberment rest outside the arena of "torture" in the case of the Fidelius Charm? I'm all for you ignoring Pottermore if that's the angle you want to take, it's just your interpretation of the word 'torture' is a bit of a stretch for me.

If you follow the Wikipedia citation for that information, the citation includes the author's original wording,

#+begin_quote
  "In earlier times the role of godparent carried with it a legal responsibility for the child, should they become orphaned. Today, being a godparent is not legally binding and carries no legal rights, although godparents may also serve as legal guardians for children if this arrangement is documented in a valid will."

Even that source says it's not legally binding and only a thing of the past. I looked up the book in my local library, but it isn't there, but I did some other digging and found this from a [[http://www.hamilllawoffice.com/godparent/][Christian website]] in an article titled /Are Godparents and Guardians The Same Thing?/

  These days, I'm often asked by people whether their selection of godparents for their children is the same as naming legal guardians for their children. The answer is “no.”

  A godparent is someone who sponsors the child's baptism. This is mainly a religious role, not a legal one.

I also found and article from Forbes titled, [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/robclarfeld/2018/05/29/selecting-your-childrens-guardians-is-very-different-than-naming-their-godparents/#5cc456526d9e][/Selecting Your Children's Guardians Is Very Different Than Naming Their Godparents/]], and one on this estate planning website titled, [[https://albanislaw.com/the-godparent-myth-the-difference-between-godparents-and-guardians-in-estate-planning/][/The Godparent Myth: The Difference between Godparents and Guardians in Estate Planning/]]

Of course that is not to say it has never been the case that godparents are automatically legal guardians, but I find the evidence suggesting that Sirius /must be/ Harry's legal guardian a big stretch. It is not the norm in the Muggle world, so I see no reason why we should assume it is the norm in the Magical one. The books make no indication that being a godparent works differently in the Magical World. WIth fanfiction, of course, it can mean whatever we want it to mean, but as far as canon is concerned, I do not find that argument convincing.
