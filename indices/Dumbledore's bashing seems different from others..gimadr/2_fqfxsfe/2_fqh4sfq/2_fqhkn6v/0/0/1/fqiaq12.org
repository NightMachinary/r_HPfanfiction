  Sirius, at that time, had custody as befitting of his duty.

I'm not sure where this idea comes from, being a godfather even traditionally is not meant to be someone's back-up guardian, they are meant to guide they child's faith in God.

All my siblings and I have different godparents, but that has no bearing on who we would have lived with if our parents died. I asked my family too to make sure, and my dad said that godparents is mostly ceremonial now (as in they don't actually ensure the child's faith stays on the right path anymore).

  You can coerce them, however. Many men will talk if you put a knife to their balls

I agree with this. The benefit of the Secret Keeper is that only /one/ person knows the secret (which I believe can be coerced out of them). This means, for example, Voldemort couldn't threaten Bathilda Bagshot because she literally cannot reveal the secret no matter what. The Secret Keeper can, though. The benefit of the Secret Keeper is not that the Secret Keeper position is infallible, but that it minimized the number of fallible people who could snitch to just one, rather than many.

[edit: For those who consider Pottermore canon, what I said above is not accurate,

  (although the secret cannot be forced, bewitched or tortured out of a Secret Keeper who does not wish to give up their secret; it must be given voluntarily).

So torture would not work. I feel this makes Sirius's fear of being Secret Keeper slightly less credible and interesting, but there we go]

Having said that, I believe living that way is very restrictive and placing Harry at the Dursleys makes the most sense from all angles at the point Harry was placed there. Of course /over time/, things would get more compliated of course, but the initial decision to place him there makes sense to me.

But then if there were talks to move him, I feel like living in a Fidelius charm would be incredibly restrictive, especially in light of your comment about the Death Eaters outside Grimmauld Place. Neither Harry nor the family members could walk down the street much less live normal lives.
