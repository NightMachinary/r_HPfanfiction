  You mean he decided to give a child to his aunt after his parents were killed, with his mother triggering a blood protection via her death? What a complex machination that would have taken months to come up with.

He should not be committed to that path until Sirius is convicted. Sirius, at that time, had custody as befitting of his duty. If Dumbledore wants to remove Sirius from that position, he must do so before placing Harry somewhere.

You can coerce them, however. Many men will talk if you put a knife to their balls

  That's what you want to trust Harry to for his entire childhood? Okay lol

  the Fidelius is something you use when you want to hide people

And the dementors who almost executed him and his cousin were effectively repelled, right? And given that the Death Eaters could still camp outside of the rather short ranged protection, it really makes no difference what you put around Number 4. Best case scenario, Harry is besieged there until his 17th, then he dies. Realistically, he is starved out within two months tops. The best way to ensure's Harry's safety would have been secrecy, not static defences.
