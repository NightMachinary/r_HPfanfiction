  Given that McG spent the next day observing them, he must have decided on that placement even before the Pettigrew incident.

You mean he decided to give a child to his aunt after his parents were killed, with his mother triggering a blood protection via her death? What a complex machination that would have taken months to come up with.

  Dumbledore might have known about the Fidelius, but that does not mean that Sirius betrayed them.
#+end_quote

I'm sorry, but I honestly think that you're letting the fact that Sirius is known to be innocent to colour your perception of Halloween '81. Per actual canon (both hints in the book, and [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/secret-keeper][WoG from Rowling]]) you /can't/ torture a Secret out of a Secret Keeper (frankly, what would be the point of the spell then?). They have to volunteer the information /willingly/. It's not at all a leap to interpret the secret leaking as Sirius betraying the Potters, especially considering that he was completely hale and hearty to all observation.

  That does not sound like a traitor's doing.
#+end_quote

Oh, like Peter tearfully confronting Sirius in the street "did not sound like a traitor's doing"?

  And even canon shows us that there are other magical defences which can repel Voldemort and his cronies. The Tonks house manages to stop their entire force
#+end_quote

You mean the wartime protections placed on the Tonks house for the express purpose of withstanding Voldemort for one (1) night? That were /still/ broken eventually, within a month? /That's/ what you want to trust Harry to for his entire childhood? Okay lol

  when Voldemort takes over, all Order defences fail (presumably also the Fidelius charms, or otherwise every Order member was an idiot).
#+end_quote

The Order defences fail because they were supplemented by Ministry defences, and /those/ defences failed. In case you didn't pay any attention, the Fidelius charm on Grimmauld Place did not fail and neither did e.g. the charm on Shell Cottage. I'm not sure how you can call the entire Order idiots considering that the Fidelius is something you use when you want to /hide people/, and going into hiding forever is shockingly enough not the greatest tactic to prevent a megalomaniac from seizing power and doing whatever he wants with the general population.
