OBJECTION!

Dumbledore decided immediately to place Harry with the Dursleys, even if at that time, Sirius Black should have had priority as godfather (dibs on custody is one part of that duty). Given that McG spent the next day observing them, he must have decided on that placement even before the Pettigrew incident.

Dumbledore might have known about the Fidelius, but that does not mean that Sirius betrayed them. Someone could have tricked him into revealing information, or could have tortured/coerced him. And given that the "unblockable" killing curse failed to kill Harry, the infallibility of the Fidelius was in no way guaranteed. He dismissed Sirius even if Hagrid had a friendly encounter with him and Harry was handed over without protest. That does not sound like a traitor's doing.

And even canon shows us that there are other magical defences which can repel Voldemort and his cronies. The Tonks house manages to stop their entire force, and when Voldemort takes over, all Order defences fail (presumably also the Fidelius charms, or otherwise every Order member was an idiot).
