  Dumbledore gave him to his closest known living relatives in part because that's literally what you do with an orphaned toddler (or child of any kind).

No it isn't. I mean, it /is/ but it's not that simplistic

I know for a fact that, had I been orphaned as a minor, I was supposed to go to a family friend rather than either of my uncles. Why? Because it would have meant I stayed in the same town, at the same school and with people I knew - all of which were more important to my wellbeing than simple biological relation. One of my uncles was in New Zealand, the other one moved around a lot. Neither of them would have been in a good position to take me in. And the next closest chunk of family were something like my second-cousins-once-removed that I've only ever seen at weddings, funerals and on Facebook.

More importantly, in the normal course of things you can /decline/ to take the toddler/child regardless of how you're related to them. There might be pressure put on you to take the kid but you are allowed to refuse regardless of how good or bad your current situation is.
