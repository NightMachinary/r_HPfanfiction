Obviously there are edge cases involved with everything, but even in your case you likely would have been initially/temporarily left with clearly available, stabled, housed relatives in the literal same country (the size of the UK) unless there were documents granting your family friend legal guardianship. Especially if your parents were /murdered/ and said family friend was immediately and obviously implicated in the crime.
