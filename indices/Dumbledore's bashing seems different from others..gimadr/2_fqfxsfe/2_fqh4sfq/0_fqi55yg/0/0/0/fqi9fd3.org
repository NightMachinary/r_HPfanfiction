  Whether or not Dumbledore had the legal right to place Harry with the Dursleys, the way in which he went about it is undoubtedly wrong.

I wasn't even talking about legal right, nor was I saying he went about it the right way (this is literally the third time I'm going to say he should have checked up on him etc). I am talking about people who treat the sheer idea of giving him to his aunt as inherently malicious/manipulative and have Dumbledore just give him to [insert character they want to raise Harry] instead. I've seen hundreds of fics where e.g. he gives Harry to Snape to raise and like...what?
