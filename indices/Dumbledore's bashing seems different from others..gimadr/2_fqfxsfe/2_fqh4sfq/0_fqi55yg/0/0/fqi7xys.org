Said 'available, stable, housed relatives in the same country' would at least have been given a /choice/. Which was my point. And, while I don't pretend to be a lawyer, I would imagine that child who was a material witness (albeit not a very useful one) to a double murder would be more likely to end up in protective custody rather than be treated like someone whose parents died in a car-crash or something.

The Dursleys don't get much of a choice. Harry is left on their doorstep, not handed over to them. Could they have turned him over to the local authorities? Possibly. But then there might have been some investigation as to how the hell a child managed to get from a Godric's Hollow murder scene to a Surrey doorstep. That's assuming Harry is actually a legal entity in the muggle world - with a birth certificate and paperwork and whatnot. If he's not then that's an entirely different mess.

Whether or not Dumbledore had the legal right to place Harry with the Dursleys, the way in which he went about it is undoubtedly wrong.
