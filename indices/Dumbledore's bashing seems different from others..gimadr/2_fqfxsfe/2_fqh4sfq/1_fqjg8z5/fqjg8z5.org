Dumbledore placed Harry at the Dursleys by putting him in a basket on a doorstep in the middle of the night, over the objections of at least two people (McGonagall and Hagrid) who were both present when he did it.

He appears to have done this without any legal authority, probably before Sirius was arrested. Someone brought up the assumption that godparents are the same as guardians, but that's not actually an assumption anyone is making. It's in the text:

PoA Ch. 20:

“*But I'm also - I don't know if anyone ever told you - I'm your godfather.”

“Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry.

“Well... your parents appointed me your guardian,” said Sirius stiffly. “If anything ever happened to them...”*

Now, Dumbledore's motivations are open for debate on the topic, obviously. We don't see inside his head. But it seems clear to me that he took action as a political leader of a faction that Harry's parents had been a part of in securing the surviving child with guardians of his choosing, without reference to whether he had the legal authority to do so.

Now, sure, it's entirely possible that Harry would have ended up with his nearest relatives anyway, but that's not actually an inevitable placement for a child. Children may end up with a family friend, in a foster home, or with less closely related family members - and usually a legal placement involves at least some investigation into whether or not the family is somewhat suitable and also /willing/ to take the children in.

Now, this doesn't necessarily make him manipulative, but it does make Dumbledore /responsible./ However, the manipulative subtext /does/ exist in the text. Dumbledore's own stated motivation for keeping Harry there is not for his safety, but for the psychological value of having Harry not grow up knowing he's famous.

In the first chapter of the first book, Dumbledore talks to McGonagall, who is only present at number 4 because Hagrid told her where Dumbledore was going to be (and Hagrid knowing Harry's location undermines any argument about Harry's placement being super secret, btw).

Dumbledore: “/I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.”/

[McGonagall objects, Dumbledore says it's the best place for him, McGonagall says Harry will be famous...]

“*Exactly,” said Dumbledore [...]. “It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?” *

They then leave Harry on the doorstep, where he's woken up “/in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles.”/

There is no good evidence in canon that his location growing up was super secure and secret - the opposite, in fact. People from the wizarding world appear to have encountered Harry almost routinely.

PS, Ch. 2: /Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers on the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet too hat [...] A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green [...] A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word./

Book 5, Ch. 37, Dumbledore emphasizes his concern for Harry's safety... but he's talking /to Harry/, he's had more than a decade to build up a justification for his actions, and even here he cannot help but to mention the psychological aspect of his decision.

*”Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.”

Dumbledore tells Harry first that he knew that he was “condemning [Harry] to ten dark and difficult years”, but then that the flaw in his plans for Harry was that he cared /too much/ for Harry's happiness. Honestly, re-reading that chapter just now makes me eyeroll so hard I almost hurt myself.

Taking Dumbledore's actions at face value, crediting him with his own stated motivations, he is a character that acts according to his own counsel and without ever seeking the advice of people with different viewpoints who might disagree with him. Dumbledore thinks that what he is doing is right, and feels entirely justified when other people suffer while bearing the consequences of his choices.

Dumbledore has and exercises a lot of power in canon. Disclaiming his actions as inevitable, saying he didn't have any other choices, IMO does not jive with what the books actually say. That doesn't mean he's an evil, manipulative, mastermind chessmaster, necessarily, but his actions aren't above reproach either.

Dumbledore is a complex character who had a great deal of agency in the text. Exploring his actions and motivations is interesting precisely because he has so much influence on the other characters and the overall story.
