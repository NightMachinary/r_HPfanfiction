  Dumbledore was responsible for Harry's placement with the Dursleys initially, as well as his return there during summers.

Dumbledore is responsible for his return there during the summers, yes, but I've always found the idea in the fandom that Dumbledore was /responsible/ for his /placement/ with the Dursleys to be very weird indeed.

Dumbledore gave him to his closest known living relatives in part because that's literally what you do with an orphaned toddler (or child of any kind). It would be overstepping bounds in the extreme to do pretty much anything else, yet a good chunk of the fandom seems to think that kidnapping a child and giving them to some random person to raise (I've seen /Snape/ used here, ffs) would have been a more just thing to do and not an abuse of power at all.
