Thank you so much!! I really appreciate that, especially today. And no, I never did write about Sirius, I can't remember if was me or my cowriter who wanted to do that (I think it was her?), but she more or less quit reddit shortly after we posted the article. I love Sirius, though, but I admit I feel totally unqualified to write about him. I don't think I would do him justice!
