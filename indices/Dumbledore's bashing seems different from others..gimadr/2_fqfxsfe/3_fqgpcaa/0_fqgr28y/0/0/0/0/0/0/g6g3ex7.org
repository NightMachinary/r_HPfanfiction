I like your take on this, mostly because I find all character bashing to be somewhat tasteless...

Dumbledore is a man with flaws, but this doesn't make him a particularly bad person, he may have power, but he's still human. Humans make mistakes.

Plus most people always notice these things after the fact, and isn't that just the thing? Hindsight is 20/20 and all that...
