Thank you! I do feel that Grindelwald's function in the story is extremely crucial to not only understanding Dumbledore's characterization, but also the themes of love and death (and most particularly how our ability to love and accept death work together in a person).

I also realized that my essay did not specifically answer the question you originally wanted, how Dumbledore relates to theme (although perhaps my thoughts on that can be guessed after reading the essay). To give an extremely brief summary, I think the conflict between the main character and the main villain is the best way to discover the most prominent theme, which in the case of Harry and Voldemort is the ability to love and to accept death. The writer John Truby says in his book, /Anatomy of a Story/,

  Good writers express their moral vision slowly and subtly, primarily through the story structure and the way the hero deals with the particular situation. Your moral vision is communicated by how your hero pursues his goal while competing with one or more opponents and by what your hero learns, or fails to learn, over the course of his struggle.

Through Harry, we learn that love is powerful and that accepting death is crucial to living a productive life. Through Voldemort we learn that fear of our own mortality can be catastrophically and possibly even eternally crippling (depending on your belief system as a reader), through Snape we learn that we can use our grief productively, and through Dumbledore we learn that /not/ grieving in healthy ways is almost as catastrophic as fear of our own deaths. We can extend this theme to "smaller" characters too, like Nearly Headless Nick (who shows sadness and almost regret that he chose to become a ghost, and admits that he was too scared to "go on"), Lily Evans, Barty Crouch Sr, and on and on. Some of these did the "right" thing and some did the "wrong" thing.

Dumbledore understands that love is powerful and eternally good, but he did not understand this innately as Harry does. Dumbledore had to learn this hard way. He was not inherently cruel or violent like Grindelwald, but his happiness at finding a friend in Grindelwald clouded his judgement. It is good to love, of course, but in Dumbledore's case, it clouded his judgement. While for Harry, love always cleared his head. I would even argue that Dumbledore's own death cleared his head, like Galadriel when she denies the ring when Frodo offers, Dumbledore "took the test", but unlike Galadriel, he fails. His test is not as black and white as Galadriel's was, but he nevertheless failed, and I think knowing the ordeal was over gave him some mental clarity. I am extrapolating enormously here, but that's where this thought process has taken me.

Anyway, I suspect that Dumbledore intentionally lived a life void of emotionally intimate love because he feared the damage he would cause. Then, of course, the prophecy is made and Harry comes along. Dumbledore is tested, he knows he can't come to love Harry, and he thinks, well, I've realized this, so I think probably if I just make sure to not love Harry, then I won't. Well, of course, he does just that, and it takes him years to realize it. Aberforth's anger and Ariana's death was the slap in the face to make Dumbledore realize this flaw in himself, and Harry's anger and Sirius's death was the slap in the face to make Dumbledore realize he succumbed once again, despite his belief that he was in control of himself.

The Deathly Hallows add to this theme in an even more direct way. The introduction of a fairy tale story in a book that already draws a lot from fairy tales is brilliant. It allows the text to explore the theme on a small scale, which creates a map that the reader can use to apply it to the larger main story. The three Hallows, the one that makes fool of those who seek power and tricks them into dying, the one who makes fools of those who do grieve in unhealthy ways and tricks them into dying, and the one that death cannot find, and can't trick. Death felt cheated by these Brothers, so he made the tools specifically to kill them, and it worked only for the first two brothers. But the Third Brother's wisdom can be applied to the other brother's gifts too. If you do not seek the wand for its power, and if you use it to protect others rather than to enrich yourself, then it cannot have power over you, and you will be able to wield it effectively, and if you do not attempt to "steal" the dead back from Death, then the Stone will have no power over you. Dumbledore masters the Elder Wand because he did not seek it. He knew Grindelwald had the Wand for years, but Dumbledore did not go. His inability to accept his sister's death prevented him. In short, Dumbledore's greatest weakness is not power, he masters that, the wand isn't the Hallow that kills him. The Resurrection Stone did. His biggest weakness is his inability to accept the deaths of others.

So does he raise Harry like a pig for slaughter? It seems almost radical to say he didn't, because there is so much explanation behind why I feel the answer is no, so much explanation about Dumbledore characterization that is usually just... ignored, overlooked? Considered lies? I don't think Dumbledore believed in the prophecy either (although, actually, lots of Dumbledore essayists agree with me on this, across the love/hate spectrum). I also think Dumbledore despised the greater good philosophy. Imagine starting a comment with that?! I think the only other person who agrees with me on that is hpboy13 from Mugglenet.

I'm sure I could say more, but it's getting late and I think I got the gist of it. I hope you find it interesting. I was actually a pretty sad today because of this thread (as I type this, both our innocuous comments above are downvoted, but I'm actually starting to think they're an indiscriminate troll, and not actually reading the comments...), but your interest in my essay really lifted my spirits, so thank you so much, I can't tell you how much it means to me.
