  There's a real cognitive dissonance created when you try to ascribe a character's motivations to love, but also show that he didn't check on a small child for ten years. It just doesn't wash. Dumbledore's relationship with Harry is more notional than actual for much of the story - he says that he cares but his actions tell a different story.

I feel like this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the role love plays in this story and Dumbledore's role in presenting a more nuanced theme, both in revealing that love alone is not enough, but how our acceptance of death relates to our ability to love properly. There's Harry's cookie cutter prefect version of love, which saves the day, because he accepts death in all its forms, and Dumbledore's horribly misguided love which ruins the day, because he is not honest with himself about his failure to accept death (other people's, not his own).

I am not here to argue that Dumbledore is perfect, but I do feel there's a lot more to Dumbledore than stopping at "he's imperfect because he let Harry suffer". There's a world of exploring the precise emotional hangups that led to it. I feel like exploring Dumbledore's characterization made me see the entire series in a whole new way, helped me understand its total design.

I also tend to think it is a mistake to remove the books from their fairytale beginnings. That is to say, just because the whole story exists in the same universe, the earlier plots still exist in a fairy tale universe and the later books still exist in a more realistic one. To judge the plot of the first book as if it exists in the more realistic plot of the last (which itself is not realistic either) feels wrong to me. I would also argue that characters in general (but especially Harry) should not be judged as real psychological studies, but that is a much bigger conversation about how to read and analyze books, and perhaps is beyond the scope of this post.
