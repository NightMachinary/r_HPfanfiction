In the Hobbit, Gandalf is a wise figure who calls the protagonist into the adventure partly by being somewhat manipulative. He doesn't give anyone all of the available information and often acts according to his own motivations that the protagonist and the reader are not always aware of. However, both Bilbo and Frodo are adult characters that Gandalf is not responsible for in any meaningful way. Gandalf is wise and powerful, but the relationship between him and the other characters is on a much more equal footing - wise mentor and friend, /not/ teacher or guardian.

Dumbledore is something else. He serves a similar purpose in the narrative to Gandalf, but it doesn't work out quite the same. Harry is a child who Dumbledore has very real power over, and how he uses that power is problematic.

The Potter fandom is an interesting place. Many fans (myself included) started reading the books as children, but are now of an age to have children ourselves, and our perspectives on the narrative have changed as we've grown with the stories.

Dumbledore was responsible for Harry's placement with the Dursleys initially, as well as his return there during summers. The canon-level treatment of Harry is abusive and abuse has lifelong consequences. The idea of keeping a child safe, but unhappy, is untenable to me. Any reasonable person could come up with dozens of ways to make the situation more bearable - something as simple as regular welfare checks on the child could have made a real difference. Like, you know, not going ten years before noticing that the kid doesn't even get to sleep in a bedroom. There's a real cognitive dissonance created when you try to ascribe a character's motivations to love, but also show that he didn't check on a small child for ten years. It just doesn't wash. Dumbledore's relationship with Harry is more notional than actual for much of the story - he says that he cares but his actions tell a different story.

Dumbledore is not Harry's friend. He's Harry's school headmaster. He has a duty to care for the children in his school, and that duty should /not/ include placing children in abusive homes, hiring irresponsible and/or abusive teachers, or exposing children to life-threatening situations.

The HP series uses a number of common children's fiction tropes - the abused orphan, the wise old mentor, etc. Part of the problem with Dumbledore though is that the style of his portrayal in the books changes. The books grow with the protagonist in maturity - characters that are somewhat formulaic and one-dimensional in earlier books are given complexity in later ones. Dumbledore is wise and knowing in the first books, and his actions make sense in context of the children's book style of his portrayal, but later we discover that he had a relationship with Grindelwald, was partially responsible for the death of his own sister, etc. This added complexity and fallibility in his portrayal opens things up for the reader to reexamine their understanding of his character and actions in previous books, and to find him wanting.

The later books in the series are /not/ children's books in any meaningful sense, and a large part of the fandom are adults, and Dumbledore's character suffers significantly from that change in perspective.
