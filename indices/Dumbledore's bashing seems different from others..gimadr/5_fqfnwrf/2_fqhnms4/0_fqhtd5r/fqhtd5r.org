What possible trap that could affect Voldemort does Canon show?

Because as I see it Dumbledore confronting Quirrell possessed by Voldemort trapped in front of the mirror was the best chance they ever had of taking Voldemort out and it would have worked fine if Harry didn't fuck up by endangering the stone and killing Quirrell causing Voldemort to flee just as Dumbledore arrived.
