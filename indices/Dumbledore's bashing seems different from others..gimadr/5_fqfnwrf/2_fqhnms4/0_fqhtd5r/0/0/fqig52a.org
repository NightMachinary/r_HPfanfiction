The other methods bought Dumbledore time to get there before Voldemort escaped deeming the hunt for the stone a failure.

Also we dont know if it would work as a trap, Dumbledore is quite clear in canon that he doubt he could passively protect a place from Voldemort without Lily's sacrifice, i strongly doubt that Voldemort making an effort couldn't instruct Quirrell in how to escape.
