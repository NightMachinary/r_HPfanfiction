It's mostly everyone's wank of Dumbledore throughout the series. The strongest, most creative, smartest wizard of the last 100 years. A man that was able to orchestrate his own death. He was made a practical wizarding deity and so any mistake, failure, oversight, or flaw shows up even brighter especially with hindsight that newer fans had.

Old Potter heads need to understand that Dumbledore doesn't represent a wise old Gandalf anymore. He's looked at as a damaged old man with tons of baggage that basically threw the previous problems of the wizarding world onto the shoulders of Harry, half assed.

Manip (Boomer) Dumbledore will continually be used because of this, and he's more compelling to many to read and write about because of it.
