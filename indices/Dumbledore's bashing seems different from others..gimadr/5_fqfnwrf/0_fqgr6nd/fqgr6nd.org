Exactly, the world expect Dumbledore to be a God that he can actually change the rules of his universe to make his life more convenient. The fact he does not change how his universe functions is not a sign that he /can't/, but that he /chose not to/. This in turn makes him seem cold-hearted, which in turn justifies the theories that he would do anything to harm others to meet his allegedly self-serving goal of defeating Voldemort.

I feel strongly that books exist as a complete design, where characters, plot, tone, and theme all work together. I think that is the way most writers try to write and the way most books and stories work, and HP is no different. Consequently, Dumbledore's characterization and the plot surrounding his troubles are specifically designed to explore these ideas, so they absolutely must be the hardest decisions in order to explore it. His challenges are specifically designed to be the hardest challenges he can face, and his characterization is specifically designed to have trouble with these challenges. They work hand in hand, same with Harry and Voldemort. Their obstacles are specifically designed to be the hardest obastacles for them.
