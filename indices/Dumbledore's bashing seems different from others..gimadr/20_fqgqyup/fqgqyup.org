Dumbledore had a set of choices before him. One way led to ruin - Harry was dead, the world ends. The other, while worse for Harry, had a chance at defeating Voldemort.

That is the crux of his character.

Everyone here who says Manipulative Dumbledore is easily supported by canon seems too dumb to realize that this is the situation he was forced into. There were no better choices. Every other option would have led to ruin.

As for the manipulation? There's nothing of that in the books. Sure, he says he suspected Harry would sacrifice himself, but he didn't /groom/ him to do it. How the fuck do you do that anyway? Dumbledore doesn't talk with Harry all that often. Harry sacrifices himself out of love, not to make Dumbledore happy or some shit. I think people don't know what grooming means.

The other situations he supposedly "manipulated" into existence are based on so much random chance it's ludicrous.
