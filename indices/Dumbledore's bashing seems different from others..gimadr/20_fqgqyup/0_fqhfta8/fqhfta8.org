It can be easily construed Dumbledore was grooming Harry to be self-sacrificing. Yes, you can explain that it`s a BOOK, but if you look into it as a character study.

He was completely irresponsible in leaving Harry at the Dursley`s with no supervision, Mrs. Figg was useless, Harry was still physically and emotionally abused, any decent CS would have removed him from that house.

That whole situation of the Philosopher Stone can`t be explained any other way. That obstacle course was laughable.

The guy is 100+ years old, super smart, access to lots of books, Hermione has to figure out it`s a Basilisk. He then proceeds to only send Fawkes to help him, instead of himself.

Doesn`t announce Harry is innocent in both the CoS and GoF situation, letting him be isolated.

After GoF, he pulls that whole thing where he tells Ron and Hermione to not contact him via letters, so he spends his whole time alone being verbally abused by the Dursleys in an environment that`s not good for him. Had he been a real person he wouldn`t have left that situation unscathed.

He then spends a whole year ignoring students being tortured, letting the Ministry lambast Harry and a whole slew of stuff, while leaving Harry confused, angry and alone, he also makes Ron prefect(who is a lazy teenager) when Harry was much more appropriate and doesn`t explain himself, then giving the shittiest reason I`ve ever heard.

Oh, and later spends a whole year to show Harry a handful of memories that could have been shown in three days. Also gives Harry zero training.

So yes, he talks the talk but doesn`t walk the walk.
