That's the trouble with publishing series before they're completed. You can't always go back and fix inconsistencies between earlier and later works, and it can lead to readers getting a message that the author didn't intend.

Inconsistencies are tremendous fodder for fanfiction. Harry Potter has so much room for what if stories.

That said, I firmly believe in death of the author and that works deserve to stand on their own. I actually really dislike this habit that JK Rowling has of adding trivia to the universe that isn't actually present in the work itself. As far as I'm concerned, the books stand on their own. And the great thing about fanfiction is that I am free to ignore other sources of info when they contradict the information that's in the actual books (Fantastic Beasts is a fun romp, for instance, so long as I don't have to take the movies seriously as some sort of prequel to the actual Harry Potter series. There are too many issues between the two series for me to be able to reconcile them as occurring in the same reality).
