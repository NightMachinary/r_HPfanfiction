Not sure why so many folks are missing the point of fanfiction. It is the discretion of the author to pick and choose what canonical information to highlight (or avoid) to support their story, and twisting canon to fit their needs as appropriate is commonplace.

I, personally, do not think many of Dumbledore's actions throughout the series are justifiable /in retrospect/. This is not a condemnation of the character himself, it's an inevitable by-product of the series starting as a children's book and becoming more mature as the series progresses. Decisions made earlier in the series seem silly and whimsical by the time we reach later books where we need more sufficient explanations for character choices.

At the time Harry is sent to the Dursleys, the Fidelius Charm had not yet been invented by J.K. Rowling so he could hardly be hidden under one could he? And what would the point be in introducing it, if it were not yet relevant to the story? It is only in retrospect as more of the world is revealed (read: invented by JKR) that prior character choices seem ridiculous and harmful.

That, I think, is quite forgivable. J.K. Rowling did not know she was drafting the first book of the best-selling series of all-time, and that hundreds of thousands of people would nit-pick character decisions and develop alternate interpretations of her characters, therefore she did not need to "defend" her character's actions early on. She included the information relevant that benefitted the narrative without over-complicating the world-building. We don't need to know about deep sacrificial magical enchantments in book 1, but knowing that you tap on a wall to enter Diagon Alley is funny.

-- fuck it, I'm going on a tangent --

Long story short - the earlier books are childrens books with few rules governing magic. By the end of the series, more of the wizarding rules and abilities are revealed. The fan fiction community then uses Book 7 knowledge to interpret Book 1 problems and are left desiring a more sufficient explanation for now-defunct character choices. Therefore the fandom reinterprets character motivations to justify the discrepancy.

I enjoy a bit of bashing here and there tbh. It can be a refreshing take on the series. The fandom wouldn't be as large as it is if it wasn't for imaginative character interpretations.
