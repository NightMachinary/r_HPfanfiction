As already pointed out, if you closely examine Dumbledore's actions he's incompetent and/or evil because most people aren't going to step back and say 'okay, this is a children's book.' Also most people have Molly Weasley's (delusional) outlook when it comes to Harry.

Still some would argue, and be justified, in calling Dumbledore evil for 'ten dark and difficult years.' I am a big proponent of Harry living with the Dursleys, but Dumbledore also should have made certain he was more than just alive. It's also pretty clear Harry needn't have stayed with the Dursleys everyday for those 10 yrs.

Taure started a thread on DLP and here maybe on tearing down vs building canon up. Most of us here are looking to build canon up, but plenty of FFN writers prefer to point out plotholes (even those that aren't there) to rip JKR over them and they really hate these characters.
