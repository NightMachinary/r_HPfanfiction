In the case of Sirius, you can argue Dumbledore should have insisted on a fair trial, which is perfectly valid, but you can't say Dumbledore should have believed he was innocent. All the evidence pointed towards Sirius being guilty: Dumbledore didn't know the Potter changed the Secret Keeper and Sirius was literally seen blowing up a street full of muggles, saying "I killed them, I killed them" and laughing crazily.

And last but not the least, he knew Sirius was capable of murder because of the Shrieking Shack incident with Snape in their fifth year. At that time, he gave him a pass for some reason (probably to protect Remus) but there was no reason for much leeway in the aftermath of the war. People wanted blood so death eaters were hunted and trials half-assed - I'm not sure Dumbledore could have stopped it even if he wanted to. I'm sure Sirius was not the only one not getting a trial or getting imprisoned despite his innocence.
