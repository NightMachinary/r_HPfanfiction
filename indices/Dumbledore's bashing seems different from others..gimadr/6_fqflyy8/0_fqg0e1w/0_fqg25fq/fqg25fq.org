Hold on lol. We are told in PoA James Potter tells Dumbledore that Sirius is his Secret Keeper. We see in GoF that Barty Crouch Sr and the Council of Magical Law is in charge of Death Eater trials. Sirius himself places all blame on BCS.

And Dumbledore cannot prove Sirius' innocence without Pettigrew, especially /after/ Snape makes certain the Minister believes Harry and Hermione were confunded?

Dislike Dumbledore all you want, but I firmly believe he should be disliked for the many things he actually did. He's blameless in most of what happened to Sirius.
