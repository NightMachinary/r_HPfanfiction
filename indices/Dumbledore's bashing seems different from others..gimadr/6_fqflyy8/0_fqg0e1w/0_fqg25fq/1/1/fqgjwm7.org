I didn't say anything about Sirius' confession, but in the same scene we learn James tells Dumbledore Sirius is his Secret Keep, Flitwick says:

#+begin_quote
  “An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily, “involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting-room window!”

Why would it be dumb to trust the word of Barty Crouch Sr, and, again, how is Dumbledore supposed to prove Sirius' innocence without Peter Pettigrew?
