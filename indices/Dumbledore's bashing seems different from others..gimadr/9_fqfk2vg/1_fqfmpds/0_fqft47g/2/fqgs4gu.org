Dumbledore didn't tell /anybody/ that Harry was a Horcrux because it was Harry's /only chance/ of survival. Dumbledore did not trust such delicate information to anybody, because it would risk Harry dying. Dumbledore did not design magic and did not make Voldemort do the things he did. Dumbledore recognized the only way Harry could survive and put all his efforts into ensuring that happens (post-Department-of-Mysteries). Dumbledore's most extreme act to ensure Harry can survive is overwhelmingly interpreted as Dumbledore's biggest crime against Harry. I will never understand this.
