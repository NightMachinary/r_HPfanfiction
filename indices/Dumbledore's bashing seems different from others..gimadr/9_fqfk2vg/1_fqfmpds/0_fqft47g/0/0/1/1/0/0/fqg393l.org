Seems to be off by about 200 pages as that line comes up on page 333. Everything else is the same though. Totally forgot about that discussion the pair had. My apologies. However, Dumbledore merely confirms Harry's statement of Voldemort putting a piece of himself in Harry. He makes no mention of Horcruxes or splitting of souls.

It could be assumed that it's just Voldemort put some of his power in Harry rather than a literal piece of his soul.
