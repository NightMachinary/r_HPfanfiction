Not to a twelve year old. But Harry should have been told directly by Dumbledore before he died. What if Snape dies before Harry could reach him? Harry would never know that he was an horcrux without those memories. You expect Harry to piece together that he is an Horcrux by some information that was given to him when he was twelve? Based on information that is as vague as it gets? Even if he does how long would it take for him to do that?
