He /probably/ suspects that Voldemort has split his soul since before Harry's parents are even born (I can expand on why I think this if there's interest). But he did not expect Voldemort to have made more than one until CoS when he saw the diary. At this point he delves into memories and research and discoveries that he think Voldemort made six, and he makes his guesses about what they are. He is not able to confirm his theories before he dies, but his guesses did all turn out to be accurate.

Dumbledore knowing that Voldemort can't die until Harry does doe snot mean that it sits right with Dumbledore either. Dumbledore himself is disgusted at the decision he must make, and he notably fails. He tries to prioritize the greater good, and fails at it, and ends up prioritizing Harry instead. It is only when he utterly and completely risks the lives of countless people that he realizes he has no power to protect Harry, except this one slimmer of hope that he can survive because of Voldemort using his blood. Dumbledore tried to be the villain that most people in this thread see him as, and he failed at it, he was too human to handle the burden, and it caused him to risk the lives of the greater good. And his reward is that everybody thinks he's lying.
