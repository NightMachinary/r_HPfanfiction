I disagree. The manipulative Dumbledore (or a Dumbledore who is not as concerned with the individual) is easily supported by canon.

Dumbledore - I care about you too much. I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth...

Right he cared so much he knew he was condeming harry to 10 dark years in a place that he hated and was abused (and canon is quite clear he was mentally and emotionally abused (IMO physically as well). He completely cuts off all contact with harry and his friends after both cedric's and sirius' death. Which is what every teenage boy needs to be left in a place he hates and is abused as he deals with the guilt of people dying in front of him.

What training? Dumbledore was not teaching him spells, he did not tell him what items he suspected might be Horcruxes or where they might be. He took a full year to show memories of riddle when he could have shown all of them on two weekends with time to discuss.

In second and fourth year Dumbledore could have easily made an announcement that Harry was not the heir of Slytherin, and had not entered the tournament and was being forced to compete against his will. Instead he did nothing and allowed Harry to be bullied and picked on.

And really after Voldemort appears in first year Dumbledore's focus should have been in preparing Harry rather than platitudes that he wanted him to have a normal childhood. But he did nothing to truly help or train harry. And he made it worse by condoning Snape's bullying of any non-slytherin and favoritism of Slytherin.

So it's easy to think that Dumbledore really only cares for harry as a weapon.
