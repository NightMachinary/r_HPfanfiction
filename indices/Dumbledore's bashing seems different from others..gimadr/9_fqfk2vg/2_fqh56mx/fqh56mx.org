Let's just note that you have written:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore's focus should have been in preparing Harry
#+end_quote

and then immediately wrote:

#+begin_quote
  it's easy to think that Dumbledore really only cares for harry as a weapon.
#+end_quote

anyway.

These are not statements that coexist easily (if at all). You're saying that Dumbledore wasn't focussing on Harry as a weapon and then saying that's what he should have been doing. The solution, of course, is obvious:

#+begin_quote
  than platitudes that he wanted him to have a normal childhood
#+end_quote

This bit is a false assumption. They're not platitudes.
