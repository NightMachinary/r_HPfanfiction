  It should've been that Dumbledore only cares for Harry as a sacrifice. If he wanted a weapon he would've trained him.

Thank you! I feel so confused why everyone thinks Dumbledore trained Harry. Where is this training happening before HBP? If Harry is being secretly trained his entire life, then why is he so average at everything? I mean, some people have pointed to Harry being good a DADA, but that doesn't prove that Dumbledore /designed/ Harry to be good at DADA, and if Dumbledore did want Harry trained, he could have easily just given him extra lessons, why hide it? None of this training stuff makes any sense to me.

Dumbledore never says he loved Harry when Harry was a baby. He says he started to love Harry once Harry entered Hogwarts. So I would argue that Dumbledore's lack of love for Harry for those ten years does not disprove anything Dumbledore says in OotP. I would also argue that Dumbledore was trying very hard /not/ to love Harry, so it would inherently not appear as the loving intimate type of love a normal parent would have for a child. It would not make any sense based on the story for the love to appear the same.

Certainly it is not ideal, perfect love, but that is not the only type that exists. One can argue that Dumbledore didn't love Harry /very well/, but I don't think one can argue he didn't love Harry /at all/.
