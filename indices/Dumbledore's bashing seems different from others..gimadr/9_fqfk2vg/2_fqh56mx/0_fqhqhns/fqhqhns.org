I would say they are platitudes as Dumbledore's actions ensured that Harry's childhood was not normal. It's not normal for a child to be hated by everyone in the house he lives in. It's not normal for a child to never be hugged or told they are loved, it's not normal in a house with two kids to not have a single photo of one of them. It's not normal for a child to live in the storage space under the stairs when there are two unused bedrooms in the house. And final example it's not normal to say that a child is like a grandchild to you but to never in 10 years to see the child is ok.

On the other item bad wording on my part. It should've been that Dumbledore only cares for Harry as a sacrifice. If he wanted a weapon he would've trained him.
