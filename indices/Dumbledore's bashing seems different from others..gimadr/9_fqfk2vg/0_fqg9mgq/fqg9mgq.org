He was most definitely physically abused. Being locked in a cupboard does not help your development much. Especially when it is for days or even weeks at a time with barely a half hour out a day. Neither does starvation. Harry hunting was another. And there was at least one occasion where Dudley was encouraged by Vernon to hit him.

People discount the frying pan swipe Petunia took at him, but with how casually she seemed to do it, it reeked of familiarity.

Sure, they might not have beat him half to death all the time, but I can see Vernon or Dudley going too far one or two times.
