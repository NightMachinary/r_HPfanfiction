You can. That's literally my point. Inconsistencies like this don't have indicate some kind of hidden agenda the character is meant to have. If you view it through an in-universe lens then you have no choice but to try to create some kind of reasonable framework that would explain these things, but through a real-life lens you can understand that these are just inconsistencies in the author's writing.
