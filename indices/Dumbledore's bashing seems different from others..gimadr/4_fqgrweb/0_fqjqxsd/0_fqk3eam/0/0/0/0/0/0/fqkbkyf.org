  I was using that lens in our other thread, but you countered one of my points with "Rowling is inconsistent." Even though we were arguing with an in-universe lens.

We were specifically arguing about Dumbledore, not every other inconsistency, so when you bring up other ones that are mostly unrelated (in the sense that I have a developed understanding of the explanations commonly used for Dumbledore's actions, not Hermione's) I might not have an answer for you. This is part of the reason I prefer the real-life lens for Harry Potter. There's so much wrong with it that it just makes more sense from my perspective to admit that JKR is not a careful writer than it is to twist everything into knots trying to find a halfway sensible reason for things to have happened the way they did. Some things can be relatively easily explained away, but for others it would require such ridiculous lengths to explain in-universe that it just seems pointless to me. Inconsistencies will sometimes just tumble into an avalanche because they effect so many things which also need to be explained if you choose to try to explain the first one.

The problem with the in-universe lens is that there's always another inconsistency and one inconsistency existing doesn't justify another's existence or solve it. That is to say: Dumbledore not realizing something obvious is one inconsistency and Hermione not realizing that same obvious thing is another and the fact that they're both present doesn't mean the inconsistency isn't there. If you wish to use the in-universe and you want an answer, it's up to you to come up with some kind of sensible explanation.
