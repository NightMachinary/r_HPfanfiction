  Not obliviating Snape into a vegetable or killing him outright when he's discovered spying on the prophecy.

This part never made any sense to me in the books. Trelawney describes the door being opened and Snape being seen, but Snape only heard half the prophecy, which means this would've had to happen in the middle of the prophecy being given, in which case, Trelawney wouldn't have remembered it.
