The problem is that paternalism, as a moral philosophy, has way less prominence in real world society than utilitarianism. Frankly, a large part of this is because it's vastly less popular... I mean, it can easily veer towards compulsory euthanasia (it's for your own good). Thus, when people are confronted by a character whose actions are manipulative they're primed to think in terms of philosophies like utilitarianism (the ends justify the means) that are more familiar. If this character also exists in a book where the phrase the greater good comes up? Boom. Fanfic!Dumbledore in two easy steps.

Now... I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd willingly bash Dumbledore for being paternalistic (i.e. deciding that he knows Harry's best interests acting in pursuit of them). But when you're bashing paternalism the idea that you've got to grapple with is that paternalists actually do care about who they're manipulating. The whole point of paternalism is acting based on your idea of someone's best interests. It's a trick. It's not a lie. It's not secretly about serving someone's own ends. And the basher is now left with a tricky question... how to get the reader to decide a bad outcome is better because it was motivated by neglect, apathy, greed or whatever rather than legitimate concern?

The easiest answer, I think, is to say that Dumbledore doesn't go far enough or that he's not a utilitarian. But, of course, the problem people mostly have with Dumbledore is that he's manipulative or that he's utilitarian. And, frankly, I'm completely the wrong person to ask about why paternalism is bad.

That being said, I do think people are still trying to bash an exaggerated version of canon. It's just that they seize on the manipulation and in doing so tend to end up creating a character that manipulates others for totally different reasons than the canon one does.
