I don't see Dumbledore as 100% evil but I see him as a manipulative person. For the first year we don't know what the full extent of the traps where. My headcannon is Voldemort took down most of the overly dangerous things down before Harry and co got there. If Harry never showed would Voldemort be able to get the stone? Maybe Dumbledore had something planned but Harry Potter screwed it up. The second year while he could mention that Harry isn't responsible for the attacks but as far as Dumbledore knew Tom Riddle was the heir but had no proof of Voldemorts survival. Should be say Harry isn't responsible but Voldemort is? As far as Dumbledore knew only Voldemort knew where the chamber was. Dumbledore knew Myrtle was the one killed and could have assumed that was the entrance but Dumbledore isn't a Parselmouth and can't do anything about it. Even if he grabs Harry to open the chamber how would Dumbledore know of the Diary when non of Ginny's brother noticed she had a extra book or even have Hermione look in at her. Year 3 is the first red flag year about Dumbledore. If Sirius is innocent and Dumbledore didn't know then he had no right to dump Harry at his aunt's.(I don't think it's confirmed that Dumbledore isn't anything more than headmaster at the time) if Dumbledore knew he was innocent he didn't say anything. The only 3 people knew where Harry was and 2 are Dumbledore supporters (McGonagall and Hagrid) Ms figg was a squib and could have been happy that someone like Dumbledore needed her help.(she was a squib who would have listened to her) At the end of the school year other than Dumbledore the trio, Lupin and Snape knew Sirius was innocent.(was Snape knocked out before the reveal?) Fudge beloved the kids where confounded and believed Snape and Dumbledore didn't push it (at least not shown) Lupin is a werewolf and not listened to. Year 4 is when the whole not noticing the Moody thing. (Where Moody and Dumbledore close?) Year 5 was handled bad but Dumbledore could have been busy trying to get support and limit Voldemorts support to worry about Harry. He also had to deal with the ministry at Hogwarts. Year 6 Dumbledore should have trained him yes but he knew of the connection to Voldemort. He planned that Hermione and Ron go with him. He could have told Hermione about his thoughts on the Horcrouxs.

I think around year 4 or 5 Dumbledore figured Harry had to die. I don't know if that was the only choice or easiest choice. 5 year could have been Dumbledore trying to rationalize killing Harry and year 6 could have been Dumbledore trying to clear his mind before he had to die. Basically a last show of compassion for Harry not to become like Riddle.
