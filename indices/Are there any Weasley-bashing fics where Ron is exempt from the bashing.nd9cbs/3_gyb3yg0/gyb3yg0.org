How do you bash the weasleys but not Ron.... Like wut? Fred, George, bill and Charlie are all well liked characters with no flaws that are worth of bashing. Molly has some flaws that could easily be bashed, ginny is pretty neutral, not easy or hard to bash. Ron is easy to bash because he has such huge and glaring character flaws.

Not sure how anyone could write a Weasley bashing fic and /not/ bash Ron...
