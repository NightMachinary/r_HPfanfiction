Categories don't have to be the same throughout. Just because you write one character one way doesn't mean you can't write the others differently.

Also, character quality has no connection with how much you can bash them. Sure, it might make it easier or harder, but it's not like characters are completely solid. You can rewrite a story to make a terrible character good, and you could bash a character who was “perfect” in canon. It'd be out of character, but bashing doesn't care about being in character.

...

But hey here's a possible character rundown anyway:

Bill and Charlie are relatively unimportant to the plot and to be honest can be mostly overlooked and the story would still work. However, if you wanted to, you could still bash them pretty easily. Maybe they really want financial security so they can pursue their passions and they don't care how the money is obtained.

Fred and George are so easy to bash. Like seriously I'm surprised that they aren't bashed more often. Just make their pranking be overly cruel (tbh you only need to reframe their actions for this to work, not even change then much). Also, they sold love potions (basically date rape drugs) in their shop.

Percy is practically already bashed by canon at times but it wouldn't be hard to make it worse by making him stricter and more pedantic.

It's not directly towards Harry but Arthur's opinions on muggles being “silly” or whatever is super condescending and could easily be bashed.

Ginny and Molly already have pretty common bashed versions (love potions), so you could just use those.

Then you just... don't bash Ron? Write him as a good friend who chooses to help Harry over his family. If you think he's a bad person in canon, just make a new version where he's better. Clearly you have no issues changing characters if you're bashing people.

...

Also I feel like Ron is overly hated on by the fandom at times. What did he do that's so bad as to be bashed constantly?

He's sometimes jealous of his rich, famous, and more popular friend. That's hardly unexpected. I'd probably be jealous if my friends were far more popular than me and they never had to struggle with money while I had to use old, worn-down supplies.

He left Harry at the beginning of the TWT, but he returned later. Tell me you've never gotten into a fight with a friend over something dumb and then only made up with them later. He also left during the Horcrux hunt but that was /while under the influence of a Horcrux/, so hardly a normal situation.

He's a bit lazy about classwork, but a lot of kids are. Not everyone is going to have Hermione-like studiousness.

Sure, he holds some prejudices (against werewolves, against Slytherins, etc) but it's not like those are uncommon in the wizarding world. Canon constantly depicts the Slytherins as evil, and prejudices against groups like werewolves is implied to be far more common than acceptance.

The fandom seems completely willing to redeem Draco - who has done so much worse shit (insulting muggleborns for their blood, mocking Harry for stuff like passing out to a dementor or losing his parents, having Buckbeak executed, trying to kill Dumbledore, nearly killing multiple students, etc) - so why not Ron?
