Fred and George take the Pranking too far but instead of thinking it's wrong, they believe themself to be doing the right thing punishing those that have done them wrong with "pranks" that are more focused on the pain instead of the laughing aspect of the Prank.

There something to bash them for.

Don't know about Bill and Charlie because I haven't read the Potter books in a long time just seen the movies and they weren't really fleshed out in those.
