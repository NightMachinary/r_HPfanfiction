Can't remember what it's called, but there's a Timetravel fic where the prophecy got revealed because of a change, and Harry isn't seen as a saviour by a lot of people, and is treated like crap and hated by the Weasleys til Dumbledore literally forces them to see Harry's memories and grow the fuck up. Ron is on Harry's side the entire time, and I'm fairly sure Ginny is too, and they actively hated their family for a good part of it because of how Harry got treated.
