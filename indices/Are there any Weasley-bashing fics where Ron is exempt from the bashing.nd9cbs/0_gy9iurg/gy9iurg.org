I wouldn't say the Weasley's are 'shitty'. At least nowhere as bad as the Black family to Sirius.

It's more a case of 'too many children and too little cash'. There is still love, but attention is divided heavily and Molly and Arthur have a bad case of horrible priority.\\
They earn a ton of money in a random prize, and instead of being smart and saving it, or try to make money of that money, they spend it immediately on a vacation. On luxury.
