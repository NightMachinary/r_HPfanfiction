This is glorious. Both the idea and the prompt.

I've once read that a trick to writing the succesful crack fiction is to take one main event, quality or universal law and adopt it as the new normal. It's fine if it spirals out of control as a web of interactions grows, as long as no one questions the initial premise. I think the trainwreck you described fits in there pretty well.

Between people genuinely trying to protect their loved ones, the politicians, the schemers, and an army of impulsive, hormonal teenagers... Yessss.....

This looks tasty, and I'd absolutely read this. Gosh darn, I'd write the heck out of this if I thought I could do it justice.
