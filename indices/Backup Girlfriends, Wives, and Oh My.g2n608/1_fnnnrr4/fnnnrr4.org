I'd go one step further for the /extra/ crack. Like, if Ron dies Harry has to look after Hermione, but if Harry /also/ dies then Neville has to. And so on and so forth.

Leads to lots of flowcharts about who's looking after who in the event of people being dead.

Hermione: "Okay, according to this, if Ron, Harry, Neville, Dean, Luna, [...goes on for a bit...], are all dead, then Ginny is looked after by... Ginny. I think we need to rework this a bit."
