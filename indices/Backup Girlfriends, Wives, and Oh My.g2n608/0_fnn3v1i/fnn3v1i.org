I would read this. Purely for the Chaotic Comedy Crack factor.

I can see Harry walking around with a marble notebook, with each line being comprised of two names. Some teacher catching someone running up to him whispering at him, he whips it out and writes down a line and closes it. Then the questioning.

If we want to get really morbid, you could call it God Husband/Wife. Like God Parents, but weirder. And awkward.
