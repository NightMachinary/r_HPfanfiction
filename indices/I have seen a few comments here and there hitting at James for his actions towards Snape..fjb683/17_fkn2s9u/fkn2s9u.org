This topic is so dangerous in a way.Many people argue about Snape being recruited from an early age and so on. As I'm no expert here, I can't analyse this. What annoys me is that Rowling tels but not shows. If had something about James that proves his friends are telling the truth, it would be easier to discuss this.Snape also has a tragic backstory and nothing about what he did as a death eater so it can turn into him actually doing nothing particularly bad. At some point it begins to seem like Snape is meant to be a victim and his own choices don't matter. No matter what he does, it is either fine or look how stressed he is so it's all fine. Then Dumbledore is brought up and this turns into a vicious argument. I actually was surprised how rude and vicious his fans are.
