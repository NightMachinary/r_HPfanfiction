I'll be honest. I don't like Snape or James.

I don't like James because most of what we saw of him was someone who wasn't very likable. It makes sense, but we never actually got to see him change. On the other hand, we don't know what type of person he really was during Hogwarts. We know about him and the maruarders, I think it's canon that in 7th year he wised up? But other than that, all we've really seen of him is him being a bully. Take the whole pensive scene in the deathly hallows, where we see some of James. We see in first year that he pushes past people without care and shit (yes i know it was first year but i'm making a point about how little we know) We see him and Lilly in love, dancing around (presumably after Hogwarts) In the order of the phoenix however, we see him specifically going after Snape. No provocation at all as far as we know. We all know what happens next. It's horrible, James was horrible. But then there's the werewolf incident. I believe it was only Sirius who told Snape, and true it wasn't Sanpe's business, but Sirius was still way outta line. Here comes the tricky part, if I remember correctly, James saved Snape. That means everything and nothing. You can be a terrible person but still save someones life, it depends on the reasoning. It was believed by Snape that James only saved him because Remus would've been killed otherwise But, Snape wasn't exactly innocent either.

I think more people treat Snape like he's a better person because he's more sympathetic. He had the person he loved love the person who bullied him. I think it's pretty easy to imagine that Snape was susceptible to dark magic in Hogwarts. He was in Slytherin in the midst of a war, not to mention that he would've had to protect himself. It's logical I guess. I think the closest we got to Snape being worthy of the bullying, or torment was when he called Lilly a mudblood. Also, as a sidenote. It was subtly, but heavily emphasised that Snape was poor. James, being from a rich family (I think his family was rich??) and Sirius (the same situation) could've used that as ammunition. Also as another side note, that would explain the greasy hair. If you don't shower with shampoo, your hair looks greasy and shampoo might not of been a necessity for Snapes family, already being poor. And that shit becomes a habit, which is why it could've progressed into adulthood. That's not to say that they were like that in the end though.

Also, although Snape was a cunt to Harry and blinded by his hatred, he did also spy for Dumbledore. Doesn't make up for the fact, but he constantly risked his life to gain information for the order. Snape betrayed the Dark Lord because of the woman who rejected him. You can say what you want about either, but the truth is that we SAW Snape progression as a character and what he did, what he was like. We don't know what James would've been like. We don't really know enough about either character to say which was a better person or anything.
