Honestly, there's not really a single person in the Harry Potter universe (that's more than a name and a single character-trait buzzword, anyway) that isn't an utter twat in one respect or another. Dumbledore is enigmatic, McG is hands-off to the point of invisibility, Snape is a bitter wanker, James was a bully, Moony was a coward who abandoned his family, Sirius was mad, Ron was... Ron, Hermione was a nightmare, the Death Eaters are obvious, etc etc etc. They've all got good sides and bad sides and seeing any of them as 'canonically good' is inaccurate. About the only people who don't are Luna and Neville.

But really, it's just... you can appreciate a character having decent qualities while also acknowledging their faults. It's kind of a thing in this fandom - Rowling wrote a series that has some really good bits, some really bad bits, and some middling bits. The bad doesn't outweigh or eliminate the good and the good doesn't outweigh or eliminate the bad. Same with the characters. You can look at the whole picture and like a character even while acknowledging that they did bad things.

At the end of the day, Rowling just told us what people did and said and how Harry saw them and left us to make up our own minds otherwise. There's enough room in canon for any fanon headcanon interpretation you feel passionately enough about to find evidence for. James is a twat and a hero, Snape is a misunderstood kid who never grew up and a bitter old wanker who bullied children for a decade.
