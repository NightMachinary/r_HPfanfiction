Just to make it clear, I dislike both of them equally.

And oh, there's no doubt that Snape gave as good as he got. I think, it's just how the books were written that makes people see James in the worse light. The only memories we're shown of him are Snape's, they're hardly about to be complementary, both of them showing how James initiated a conflict. Ofc, Sirius and Lupin have good things to say, but saying and showing are different. A whole scene of James being a bully gives a more lasting impression on a reader then a few words said in passing.

And honestly, we /don't know/ how much he changed and if he did at all. We can only assume that if Lily started dating him, he must have became a more decent guy. Still though, it's entirely possible to love your family and be loyal to your friends and be an arsehole all around otherwise.

Btw why everyone here keep bringing up Snape's wrong actions? Snape being a bastard doesn't automatically makes James a good person.
