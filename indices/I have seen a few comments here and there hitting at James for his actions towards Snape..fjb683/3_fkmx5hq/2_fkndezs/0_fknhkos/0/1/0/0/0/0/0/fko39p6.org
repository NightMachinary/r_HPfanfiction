  That is how averages work
#+end_quote

& not how fiction works

i can't spell this out any more

#+begin_quote
  this is literally stated in the books with Harry, who didn't get an O. He managed to get in, but that is obviously a rare case.
#+end_quote

which is why i said 'before harry's year'.

everything you wrote is a nebulous hc on how many people get a certain grade, how many want to be aurors or healers, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Of those who got an EE and not an O, there are people who wanted to become aurors and healers
#+end_quote

so, hc. before harry's year, every single student who got an EE never wanted or was going to be an auror or healer, anyway. there was no meaningful negative influence to the number of aurors or healers during snape's time as a teacher

averages do not matter. it's fiction. you can conjure up any ability, or will. you can make an orphan the most powerful dark wizard to ever live
