  high, ergo less healers and aurors, ergo vulnerable society.

*this* is the headcanon

i can make up another hc: every single student that would have become an auror or healer, before harry's year, achieved the necessary grade to go on to become one, despite snape's teaching. nothing in canon contradicts this

this isn't about snape's behaviour. it's about a claim about a hard consequence of that behaviour, that's silly
