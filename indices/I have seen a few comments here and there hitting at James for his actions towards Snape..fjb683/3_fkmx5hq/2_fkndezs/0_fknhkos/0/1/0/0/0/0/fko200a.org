/That is how averages work/

That is literally how the world functions. The likelyhood to get a grade exists. Let's say, for posterity, that 40% of people get an O on their potions owl, while 60% get an EE. Therefore, with snape's restrictions, 40% of people get a potions newt. Of those 40%, let's say 20% want to become healers or aurors, while the other 20% did it because of academic interest or because they want to become potions masters.

Conversely, if 60% are accepted, because an EE is more likely than an O, that means more people do the potions newt and can therefore become aurors and healers.

Of those who got an EE and not an O, there are people who wanted to become aurors and healers, this is literally stated in the books with Harry, who didn't get an O. He managed to get in, but that is obviously a rare case. Therefore, less people became aurors or healers.

How much plainer do I have to state it? This is /MATH/. MATH IS UNIVERSAL. MATH WORKS LIKE THIS.
