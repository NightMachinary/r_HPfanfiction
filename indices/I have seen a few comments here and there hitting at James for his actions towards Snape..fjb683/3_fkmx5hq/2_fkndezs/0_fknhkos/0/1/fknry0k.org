This is basic fucking logic, my dude.

potions newt required grade -> low = more healers and aurors.

potions newt required grade -> high = less healers and aurors.

More healers and aurors = safe and protected society

Less healers and aurors = vulnerable and unsafe society

It's like you're willfully ignoring logic, maths, trends and averages.
