More mediocre healers and aurors, you mean.

Go protest the admissions standards in med schools. They're high too. Much more prohibitively high than Snape's.

Case in point: 10 out of 28 students in Harry's year, at least, got an O under Snape. That's over a third Proof: there are 10 students in Slughorn class and they all already had the textbook, so they knew they'll be taking the NEWTs.

Harry and Ron got an E in Potions despite being lazy and inattentive, and even Neville who was a disaster managed an A. Snape is an amazing teacher and your desperate argument that he's making society weaker and more vulnerable is truly astoundingly far fetched and irrelevant.
