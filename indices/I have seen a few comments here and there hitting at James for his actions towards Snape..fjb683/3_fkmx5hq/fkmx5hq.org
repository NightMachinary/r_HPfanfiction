I'm pretty sure the books at some point confirmed that Snape gave as good as he got. But as others have pointed out, James changed. Let's compare the two's /Post-Hogwarts/ actions:

*James Potter*

Joined the Order of the Phoenix to fight against a madman intent on bringing down the rightful government and placing himself as supreme overlord of Magical Britain.

More than likely provided funding for the Order as he came from a wealthy pureblood family since wars are not cheap and the Order of the Phoenix was essentially a group of vigilantes.

With his wife, Lily, defied the Dark Lord three times (presumably by going toe-to-toe with the bastard or scuppering one of his plots).

Died defending his wife and son from the Dark Lord.

*Severus Snape*

Joined the Death Eaters and the cause of pureblood supremacy which would have seen the woman he claims to love either murdered or used to provide 'entertainment' for the bored elite.

Overheard part of a prophecy which he then joyously reported to his Master.

Tried to arrange for protection for Lily, and ONLY Lily, from both Voldemort and Dumbledore, not caring what happened to the family of the woman he claimed to love.

Proceeded, over the course of the next 14-15 years, to sabotage the number of viable applicants for positions such as Healers and Aurors, leaving the wizarding world both defenseless and vulnerable.

While he may have covertly protected Harry Potter, he also did his level best to get a sick kind of revenge on James Potter by tormenting his son for the six years that he taught the boy.

Sidenote: no, putting on a show for the junior Death Eaters in Slytherin is /not/ a viable excuse as competent teaching and fair treatment of /all/ students could have been explained away as Dumbledore forcing him to be fair. Instead, Dumbledore allowed him these excesses, so the fault lies as much with Dumbledore as it does with Snape in this instance.

He certainly set the stage to help drive an emotionally-damaged and mentally-compromised man, namely Sirius Black, to recklessly go to the Ministry and later provided the intelligence necessary for the Death Eaters to kill a member of the Order of the Phoenix.

As others have pointed out, he allowed the Cruciatus Curse to be used as punishment on the students. He did not, as some have tried to claim, keep the students safe at any level from the depravities of the Carrows.

Finally, his only desire at the end was to look into the eyes of the boy he tormented because they were the same eyes as Lily, the woman who he was /obsessed/ with, not in love with.

*Conclusion*

James Potter was a bully in school, but he grew up to be a hero who stood against a tyrant and paid the ultimate price for those he loved.

Severus Snape, on the other hand, was not only a member of a group of bullies who targeted Muggle-borns at Hogwarts but eventually joined the Death Eaters, knowingly sent the Dark Lord after innocent families by telling him the prophecy, sabotaged the wizarding world's ability to defend itself and heal those injured over the course of a war, took out his vendetta against a dead man by proxy through Harry Potter and every student not in the House of Slytherin, and finally allowed children that were meant to be under his protection to be tortured by a sadistic pair of Death Eaters.

It's pretty easy to see which one was the better man in the end.
