A bully who is ready to risk his own life or someone they don't really like and who is willing to fight for a better world. Someone who is loyal to his friends.

that is the description of James at 15 before he changed and grew up. And the description of Snape at the very end of his life and 'redemption arc'.

People don't seem to like that James was objectively the better person.

But the thing is we see James at his very worst in action and it is a mundane kind of nastiness and 'evil' one people can understand and relate to. And that makes people emotionally connect to that 'badness'. People you didn't experience it can only rudimentary understand the terror of genocide. So we see and understand James at his worst, but only hear about his best.

With Snape it is the other way. We didn't see him at his worst when he was a devoted death eater, we only hear glims of it, how he is willing to sell out innocent children for prestige for example. But we only hear about it, we don't see it. But we are shown Snape at his best, when he fought for the good side.
