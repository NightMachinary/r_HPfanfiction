  And let's be honest there was some definitive evidence why Snape was a target.
#+end_quote

You're right, there is:

#+begin_quote
  “Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, *walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can* --- I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.” [...]

  “I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. *He was only fifteen* ---”

  *“I'm fifteen!” said Harry heatedly*. [...]

  “Yeah,” said Harry, “but *he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because --- well, just because you said you were bored*,” he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.

  “*I'm not proud of it*,” said Sirius quickly. [...]

  “Yeah,” said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently. “Well ... I thought he was a bit of an idiot.”

  “Of course *he was a bit of an idiot*!” said Sirius bracingly. “We were all idiots! Well --- not Moony so much,” he said fairly, looking at Lupin, but Lupin shook his head.

  “Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “*Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?*”

  “Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “*you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes*. ... That was something. ...”

  “And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!” “Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,” said Sirius, shrugging. “*He couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her*.” [...]

  “She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.

  “Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.

  “And *stopped hexing people just for the fun of it*,” said Lupin.

James bullied people, and used Dark Magic (hexes are DM, as per JKR) on them, for fun. He targeted Snape specifically because he wanted to get Lily's attention, because Sirius was bored, and, according to JKR, because he was jealous of Snape's friendship with Lily. Not even James's best friends and co-bullies try to excuse their actions. JKR has also explicitly said the Marauders "relentlessly bullied" Snape.

  And the fact that it's ridiculous to judge someone based on how they are as a teenager,
#+end_quote

How so? In the UK, the age of criminal responsibility is 10. In almost all other countries, it's somewhere under 16. Because teenagers are fully capable of understanding that it's wrong to beat up and sexually assault others.

Would you be comfortable being friends with someone who held a girl down, shoved soap down her throat, and forcibly removed her underwear, while the entire school was watching? Harry clearly wouldn't, and was appropriately disgusted upon seeing his father do that. He was still disgusted years later:

#+begin_quote
  Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; *he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again*...
