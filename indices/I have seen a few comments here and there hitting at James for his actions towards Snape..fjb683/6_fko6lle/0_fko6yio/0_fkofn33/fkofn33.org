But your entire OP focuses on excusing James's actions. The fact that someone did something worse does not mean James being a bully and a sexual assaulter is suddenly not a big deal, and not reason enough for people to loathe him. Especially since it's never suggested that he regretted his actions, or did anything to atone for them. He also had no reason to act like that, since he came from a loving family, was very rich, had loyal friends, and so on. All he had to do was... act like a normal human being, and he couldn't even do that.

Snape joining the Death Eaters was partially the consequence of his abusive childhood, and of James bullying him. Saying that James was better than his victim, that /he/ pushed to desperate measures, is... not good.

  J.K. Rowling: Well, that is Snape's tragedy. Given his time over again he would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people (like Wormtail) he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive.

  J.K. Rowling: James could have certainly been kinder to the boy who was a bit of an outcast. But he wasn't. These actions have consequences.

He joined the Death Eaters around the same age that James was bullying and assaulting people. You said "it's ridiculous to judge someone based on how they are as a teenager". The difference being that Snape joining the DEs was fueled by many social, psychological and economical factors, while James assaulted people...for fun.

Besides, that's false. As per his discussion with Dumbledore, Snape hadn't murdered anybody before the end of HBP; the fact that Voldemort sent him to get a job as a professor, right under Dumbledore's nose, and that Karkaroff had exactly zero information on Snape and his deeds, while he had plenty on other Death Eaters, suggests Snape's record was relatively clean.

And then he spent his entire adult life working to atone for having joined the Death Eaters at an age when he was too young to vote, or drink, depending on the country. He willingly submitted himself to torture and possible death every time he went to Voldemort, and he risked his life to save as many people as possible, including former bully Lupin.

So yes, of course someone who actually made sacrifices, with nothing to personally gain from them, will receive more sympathy than someone who assaulted people for fun, harassed girls, treated others with superiority (which was what definitively ruined Lily's and Petunia's relationship), decided to dismiss Dumbledore's advice, and trusted his boot-licking friend more than the friend who was the clear moral compass of the group, which led to his and his wife's death.
