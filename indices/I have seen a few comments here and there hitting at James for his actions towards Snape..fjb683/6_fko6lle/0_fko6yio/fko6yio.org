I'm not defending bullying I want to make that clear but when it comes to Snape he had done far FAR worse than anything James potter had done. Being a death eater and murdering and pillaging before he turned to support lily (just lily) compared to some still pretty aggressive bullying. Its not to see who did the greater evils despite both doing bad things.
