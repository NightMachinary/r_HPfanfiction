We have NO evidence that James changed. And we have substantial evidence that he did not. Of course he didn't change when he got everything he wanted. Why would he change?

James continued to torment and assault Severus regularly while lying to Lily about it. He had a surveilance device that let him corner Severus when he was vulnerable and a stealthing device that let him walk around unseen. He had three other boys to back him up. Creating an environment wherein Severus could never let his guard down.

There is also a one shot JKR wrote for charity about James and Sirius on a mission for the Order. In it, they bait some Muggles and act as arrogantly as ever.

I'm not sure where the fandom gets the idea that James changed his behaviour. And I'm not sure why the fandom is so hellbent on demonizing Severus. Yes, he was targeted and groomed by a cult, and then decided that the cult was the best place for him. And yes, he did some awful things that can never be undone.

But to imply that Severus is just an irredeemable monster is to just ignore canon. Read the third book if you need a refresher: Severus runs into a werewolf den in order to save three children, a place where he was almost murdered, a place that contains the man who tried to murder him and who favours explosively killing large groups (he thinks).

When Severus is knocked unconscious, Sirius continues to bash him about even though he's suffering a concussion, but when Severus comes upon an unconscious Sirius Black a short while later, Severus does not do the same. He attaches him to a stretcher and is not remotely violent towards him, the man who attempted to murder him and felt no remorse.

If we're going to judge them entirely on decisions they made as teenagers, then we cannot ignore that James commited sexual assault and then threatened to continue that sexual assault if Lily did not date him. He also said, 'Evans, don't make me hit you.'

Sorry, 'hex' you.

Also, please read this; it's a very thorough debunking of a lot of misconceptions.
