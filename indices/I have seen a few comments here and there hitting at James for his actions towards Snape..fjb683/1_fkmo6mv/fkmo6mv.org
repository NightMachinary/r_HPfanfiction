Honestly, this sub (and the majority of the fandom) is completely bonkers when it comes to James - they actually think Snape is a better person than James.

Apparently, Snape being a two-faced murderous little bastard who knew more Dark magic at 11 than most Slytherins at 17 and joining the Death Eaters (and committing all the crimes that come with being a Death Eater) is somehow redeemable, but James being a "bully" is not.

For fuck's sake, Snape is responsible for the murder of Emmeline Vance in 1996 - someone who he was on the same side with! Not to mention the fact that the Cruciatus Curse became an acceptable form of punishment in the school with Snape as headmaster.

I swear, every single thing about James has to revolve around bully. Bully, bully, bully..it's like a fucking broken record. I'm not sure if the majority of the fanbase comprises of teenagers who get bullied on a constant basis, but really, a bully is NOT worse than a murderer. Get your head straight!

James loathed Snape, but he risked his life to save Snape's worthless hide. I don't know anyone who would do this - I certainly wouldn't risk my life to save that of someone I despised. This speaks volumes about James as a character.

The vilification of James is insane. If James had somehow managed to kill Voldemort, these Snape apologists would start screaming about him being a murderer too.
