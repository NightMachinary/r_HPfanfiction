It's in the books, go read them. Properly, after removing your rose-Snape tinted lens.

#+begin_quote
  Even if that were true, you realise that would only be a sign that Snape grew up in an abusive environment?
#+end_quote

It's a damn good thing people like you don't get to decide laws, otherwise literally every other criminal would get off scot-free just because they had a less than stellar childhood.

Being abused doesn't give you a free pass to be a worthless piece of shit.

  How was Snape two-faced
#+end_quote

Have you ever read the books at all? Like seriously?

As a boy, Snape calls literally every other muggleborn other than Lily mudblood - all the while pretending to be a muggleborn's friend. That's the very definition of two-faced.

Then as an adult, he joins the Death Eaters who are bent upon exterminating muggleborn. Proof of his great "luuurv".

Snape is a Death Eater. He's got the mark to prove it. He's the one that overheard the prophecy and planted a target on two families.

Fun fact: If Lily wasn't involved in the picture, he wouldn't have his "redemption". If it was some other random woman, Snape would continue being a trigger happy Death Eater.

Death Eaters didn't get feared in the first war by hosting tea parties or picketing shops. Kidnapping, arson, torture, murder - these are part and parcel of being a Death Eater. Snape did not have an exalted position the first time around that he could shy away from doing the dirty work.

Not that he wanted to shy away. As a boy, dear Snape laughed off Dark magic attacks against fellow classmates, invented Sectumsempra, and was pals with those who would become future death eaters.

Of course, those who defend him will call this headcanon or whatever (and turn around and do the same thing themselves when they're criticising another character...hmmm, they're a lot like Snape that way, who would have guessed?)

  As per his discussion with Dumbledore, Snape hadn't murdered anybody before the end of HBP
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, we're not treated to a scene where Snape does an assessment of the crimes he does. He doesn't discuss jack with Dumbledore, he only wonders if staging Dumbledore's death will hurt his soul.

#+begin_quote
  Snape still had to respect Voldemort's orders, and act like he agreed with the curriculum and with punishing blood traitors. Maybe you missed the part where Voldemort casually tortured and murdered even his most faithful and useful followers, including Snape? Sending Neville&co to detention with Hagrid was, in itself, a gigantic hint regarding Snape's true allegiance.
#+end_quote

Believe it or not, if I run a school as principal/headmaster and a student gets hurt, it falls on my head. Not anyone else's.

Voldemort has been known to give Snape a large amount of leeway in several things - begging to spare Lily's life, appearing later than the rest of the Death Eaters, Malfoy's little plot, Harry's retrieval. Voldemort listens to Snape - his right hand man - not the Carrows. Voldemort also buys Snape's bullshit enough times - If Snape tells the Carrows to back off, they will and Voldemort will more or less respect Snape's decision.

Again, you will probably call it headcanon. Never mind the fact that you've used your own headcanon in the above comment. Whatever.

  Because it's all he does in canon :( That, and white-knight Lily, then try to pressure her into dating him, even when she's visibly disgusted with James and his actions. Even in the two post-canon stories that feature him, he still acts like shit, and further ruins Lily's relationship with Petunia.

  James being nice to his friends and protecting his own son means... nothing. The Dursleys and the Malfoys would have died for their children, and Dudley and Draco were nice to their friends.

  And the fact that James agreed to use Peter as Secret Keeper because he considered him worthless, while suspecting Lupin of being a traitor... means he was only truly a good friend to Sirius.
#+end_quote

In this post, I've seen James get compared to rapists and incels. Compared to that, your vilification needs a lot of work. You can do it! I know you can!

#+begin_quote
  And instead of that being a wake-up call for him, he continued to bully Snape and others, culminating with sexually assaulting Snape,
#+end_quote

Okay, I didn't see this at first. Good job!

Now, obviously, I have no interest in wasting my time arguing with the likes of you. Your arguments are --- actually, fuck it. Just go away and praise Snape in some other echo chamber.
