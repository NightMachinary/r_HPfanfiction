  It's in the books, go read them. Properly, after removing your rose-Snape tinted lens.
#+end_quote

No, please, point me to the evidence that Snape "knew more Dark magic at 11 than most Slytherins at 17". It should be easy enough, if it's in the books.

And you'll be shocked to hear that almost all countries have a minimum age of criminal responsibility, so an 11 y.o. "criminal" would " criminal would get off scot-free" almost anywhere in the world, with the exception of some totalitarian countries. You'll also be shocked to hear that mitigating circumstances are an ubiquitous concept, and being abused as a child (which actually affects brain development) would certainly qualify as such when judging said child for the crime of knowing Dark Magic, or a teenager for joining a cult/gang he was groomed for, for years.

But all of that is irrelevant - knowing Dark Magic is not, in itself, a crime in the Wizarding World. There's an entire street full of it, operating legally, and plenty of "Good Guys" use Dark Magic liberally.

You know who did use *illegal* Dark Magic?

  As a boy, Snape calls literally every other muggleborn other than Lily mudblood - all the while pretending to be a muggleborn's friend. That's the very definition of two-faced.
#+end_quote

No, that's not the definition of two-faced. Snape is publicly friends with Lily, and he is also publicly using the word Mudblood. The fact that he *openly* treats one person better than he does others... does not make him two-faced. At most, you can say he employs double standards. You know, like Snape haters do.

  Snape is a Death Eater. He's got the mark to prove it. He's the one that overheard the prophecy and planted a target on two families.
#+end_quote

Is that the only crime you found? Passing on some information, that Dumbledore allowed him, for some reason, to keep, instead of Obliviating him? The sort of information rational people, like Hermione (and Snape himself, who demonstrates a similar mindset to Hermione's, as seen from her comments in PS, regarding the puzzle) don't even take seriously?

#+begin_quote
  Fun fact: If Lily wasn't involved in the picture, he wouldn't have his "redemption". If it was some other random woman, Snape would continue being a trigger happy Death Eater.
#+end_quote

Fun fact: If Dumbledore hadn't possibly killed his own sister, while dueling his own brother using lethal spells, he wouldn't have stopped his plans of tyrannically ruling the Wizarding World with his genocidal boyfriend.

Fun fact: Most people don't really change their behaviour, unless they're personally affected. After all, you are using products made with slave labour - instead of protesting against the manufacturers, you are putting money in their pockets. If one of your relatives was forced into a sweatshop, I bet (or at least hope) you'd change your attitude pretty quickly. And that is JKR's point.

#+begin_quote
  Death Eaters didn't get feared in the first war by hosting tea parties or picketing shops. Kidnapping, arson, torture, murder - these are part and parcel of being a Death Eater. Snape did not have an exalted position the first time around that he could shy away from doing the dirty work.
#+end_quote

Are you arguing that Voldemort sent someone guilty of such crimes to get a job from Dumbledore? Dumbledore, who can use Legilimency on people?

Are you also arguing that Snape managed to somehow do all of that, without anybody knowing about it, not even other Death Eaters? Karkaroff didn't know, and other Death Eaters didn't even mention Snape, as per Sirius, who spent decades in Azkaban with them, heard their ramblings, but never once heard Snape's name mentioned.

#+begin_quote
  Not that he wanted to shy away. As a boy, dear Snape laughed off Dark magic attacks against fellow classmates, invented Sectumsempra, and was pals with those who would become future death eaters.
#+end_quote

In that same conversation, Lily dismissed the Marauders bullying people, despite the fact that they also used Dark Magic. So is using Dark Magic ok or not?

Snape invented Sectumsempra, "for enemies", after he'd almost been killed by a werewolf, the school authorities had covered the whole thing up, and the perps were continuing to target him. Someone who starts carrying a knife because he's constantly being attacked does not automatically =/= that person randomly attacking people and enjoying violence.

If anything, I challenge you to find evidence, in the books, of Snape being deliberately violent with people. I can provide you with evidence of McGonagall, Sirius, Lupin, Hagrid, Arthur Weasley, and even Trelawney being physically violent with children/students.

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't discuss jack with Dumbledore, he only wonders if staging Dumbledore's death will hurt his soul.
#+end_quote

Killing splits one's soul; Snape is worried that killing Dumbledore will split his soul => Snape's soul has not been split, yet = Snape hasn't killed. It's not rocket science.

Not to mention the fact that Karkaroff would have brought it up, and that Dumbledore would have had a much harder time getting Snape's name exonerated by the Wizengamot, if Snape was accused of serious crimes.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort also buys Snape's bullshit enough times - If Snape tells the Carrows to back off, they will and Voldemort will more or less respect Snape's decision.

  Again, you will probably call it headcanon. Never mind the fact that you've used your own headcanon in the above comment. Whatever.
#+end_quote

Voldemort trusts Snape because he thinks Snape is a true believer. If Snape suddenly starts protecting blood traitors and telling the Carrows to act nicely... Voldemort won't trust Snape anymore. It's not rocket science [2].

What headcanon did I use?

- Snape having to keep his cover, on Dumbledore's orders, is canon. Dumbledore literally (and, unlike you, I employ the word appropriately) tells him that.

- Voldemort torturing and even killing his loyal followers is canon. This is seen in GoF, OotP, and DH.

- Snape sending Neville, Luna, and Ginny to detention with Hagrid, for a very serious crime (breaking into the Headmaster's office and trying to steal Gryffindor's sword) is canon. If anything, Snape seriously risked his cover by giving them such a light punishment.

  In this post, I've seen James get compared to rapists and incels.
#+end_quote

Probably because his behaviour is reminiscent of exactly that. He starts harassing a girl's male friend out of jealousy and in order to get her attention, then, when she rejects him, he removes said male friend's underwear as revenge and humiliation. There's a reason Harry thought it possible that his own father had /forced/ his mother into marriage.

#+begin_quote
  Now, obviously, I have no interest in wasting my time arguing with the likes of you. Your arguments are --- actually, fuck it. Just go away and praise Snape in some other echo chamber.
#+end_quote

You sure wasted a lot of time writing down your headcanons instead of providing canon sources.

In any case, pulling the "I won't deign to answer your arguments" card seems to be your /modus operandi/, which suggests that you're perfectly aware you don't have any counter-arguments. So why don't you just admit you're wrong? You can wank to James fics even if he was a bully and a sexual assaulter, you know, it's not like the fandom police will descend on your house.
