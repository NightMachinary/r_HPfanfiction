Maybe it has something to do with the majority of fandom having read the books and understood them?

1) Source?

2) Even if that were true, you realise that would only be a sign that Snape grew up in an abusive environment?

3) How was Snape two-faced, when the excuse for James bullying him seems to be that he publicly supported anti-Muggle rhetoric? You know who /was/ two-faced and murderous, in varying degrees? The Marauders - James bullied people behind Lily's back, Lupin disagreed with his friends' actions but did nothing to stop them, while pretending to be a rule-abiding student (as per his own admission in PoA), Peter was... Peter, and Sirius actually attempted murder.

Source?

As per his discussion with Dumbledore, Snape hadn't murdered anybody before the end of HBP; the fact that Voldemort sent him to get a job as a professor, right under Dumbledore's nose, and that Karkaroff had exactly zero information on Snape and his deeds, while he had plenty on other Death Eaters, suggests Snape's record was relatively clean.

  For fuck's sake, Snape is responsible for the murder of Emmeline Vance in 1996
#+end_quote

That was... set up by Dumbledore. Did you stop reading after HBP, and think that Snape was telling Bellatrix the truth?

  Not to mention the fact that the Cruciatus Curse became an acceptable form of punishment in the school with Snape as headmaster.

If he wanted to keep his cover, as per Dumbledore's instructions, Snape still had to respect Voldemort's orders, and act like he agreed with the curriculum and with punishing blood traitors. Maybe you missed the part where Voldemort casually tortured and murdered even his most faithful and useful followers, including /Snape/? Sending Neville&co to detention with Hagrid was, in itself, a gigantic hint regarding Snape's true allegiance.

  I swear, every single thing about James has to revolve around bully.
#+end_quote

Because it's all he does in canon :( That, and white-knight Lily, then try to pressure her into dating him, even when she's visibly disgusted with James and his actions. Even in the two post-canon stories that feature him, he still acts like shit, and further ruins Lily's relationship with Petunia.

James being nice to his friends and protecting his own son means... nothing. The Dursleys and the Malfoys would have died for their children, and Dudley and Draco were nice to their friends.

And the fact that James agreed to use Peter as Secret Keeper because he considered him worthless, while suspecting Lupin of being a traitor... means he was only truly a good friend to Sirius.

#+begin_quote
  This speaks volumes about James as a character.
#+end_quote

He saved Snape in order to prevent his friends from suffering the consequences of becoming murderers. And instead of that being a wake-up call for him, he continued to bully Snape *and others*, culminating with sexually assaulting Snape, while ignoring the fact that the constant bullying could make Snape break and tell the truth about Lupin. Which brings us back to the fact that James only really seemed to care about Sirius.
