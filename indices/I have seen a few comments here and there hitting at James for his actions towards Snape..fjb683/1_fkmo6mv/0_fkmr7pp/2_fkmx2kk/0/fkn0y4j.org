The only thing I feel towards the "poor abused kid", who joined a death cult and brought about the death of so many, is disgust and hate.

Seriously, Snape isn't some innocent darling who made "a few bad mistakes" - he disliked muggles right from childhood, entered school knowing a lot of Dark curses, created spells to maim and kill as a youth, joined the Death Eaters and did everything that Death Eaters did, and only got cold feet when he finds out he inadvertently placed a target on the woman he lusted after.

After his "redemption", he goes around being a lowlife to orphans who lost their parents to the organisation he was part of, tries getting two innocent men killed and Pettigrew (who is incidentally also responsible for James and Lily's deaths) escapes. He then passes information that causes the death of Emmeline Vance. His information also gets Alastor Moody killed and George maimed.

All this pales in comparison to the fact that school children as young as 11 were punished with the Cruciatus curse when he was headmaster of the school. And no, don't give me the "but that was the Carrows!" BS. Snape is headmaster and Voldemort's Right Hand - the Carrows answer to him, not the other way around.

But of course, James is a "spoiled rich bully", and must therefore be the Antichrist reincarnate. That makes total sense. Of course.
