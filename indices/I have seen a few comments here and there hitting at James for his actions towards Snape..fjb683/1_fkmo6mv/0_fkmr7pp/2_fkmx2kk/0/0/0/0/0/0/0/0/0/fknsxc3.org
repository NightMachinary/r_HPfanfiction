Sibling rivalry and the fights that come along with it are part and parcel of normal familial interactions - you'd have to be completely ridiculous to call that bullying or abuse.

You're completely ridiculous.

Being "cruel" to Draco. The same Malfoy that calls for death to muggleborn and muggles?

Not sure what place you live in, but most normal people in the world don't take too kindly to someone who does the things Draco (and in a similar vein, Snape and his buddies) does. If you go around spouting the same stuff Draco does, you'd get the living daylights thrashed out of you /at the very least/. Rowling is being exceptionally unrealistic here when it comes to the student body's reaction towards the purists.

Again as I said before, it's quite pointless talking to you.
