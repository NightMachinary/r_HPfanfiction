  i don't see a problem calling the twins bullies. they bully percy

They do nothing of the sort. Either you don't have siblings, or don't know how to interact with them. The twins' behaviour with Percy is completely normal.

  depends on the context

You said it yourself, it depends on context. And since the only context we know of Snape's and Lily's (who is also biased towards Snape) until that point, all we have is an incredibly biased point of view.

Hermione punches Draco. To someone watching from a distance, it looks like she's totally out of order. Take a closer look, and you see that Draco is a sadistic little shit. James and Sirius suffer the same thing - you only get one PoV, which is biased as hell.
