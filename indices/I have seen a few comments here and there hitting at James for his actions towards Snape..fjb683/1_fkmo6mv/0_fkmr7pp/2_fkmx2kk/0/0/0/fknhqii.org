  I'm sure having an abusive father had nothing to do with it.

There are a lot of people who've had less than stellar childhoods. Few of them decide to go on and join murderous cults. Being poor or abused does not give you a free pass to be a piece of shit - laughing off Dark magic used on a classmate definitely classifies as being a piece of shit.

  From where?
#+end_quote

This isn't stated. It's said that he knew more curses as a first year than most seventh years - it could be an exaggeration, but it clearly means he knew more curses than any of his peers.

Maybe he read when his father was not in the house - this is up to the reader's imagination to figure out how he knew.

  Citation(s) needed.

He's a Death Eater. Albus mentions that it is a death eater that overheard the prophecy, and it turned out to be Snape. He's got the mark to prove it as well.

As for doing what Death Eaters do, what do you think they were doing that made them so feared? Hosting tea parties?

Kidnapping, murder, torture, arson - these are part and parcel of being a Death Eater. Snape shows in school that he isn't averse to using dark or lethal curses (laughing off a dark magic attack on a classmate/peer, developing Sectumsempra before or during the age of 16). He doesn't have an exalted position among the Death Eaters that he can shy away from the dirty work either.

  True, but again, this isn't part of the timeline OP is asking for.

I'm talking about the "evoking sympathy" that you said. Snape's actions do not evoke any sympathy from me, and never will.

I've known people who've grown up in poverty and hardship and made something out of themselves, my grandfather and uncle included - the very idea of sympathising with someone just because they were poor while being a complete scumbag is absolutely revolting to me.

See, this is where you're off. You have this idea of James that is so negative that you honestly believe that James is some sort of caricature like character that went on hexing everything in sight (including his best friend) like a delinquent. You're part of the meme I put up in my original comment - you're literally judging the man from one scene and one scene only.
