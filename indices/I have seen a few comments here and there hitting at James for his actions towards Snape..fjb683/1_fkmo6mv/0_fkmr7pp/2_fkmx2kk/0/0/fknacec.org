  Snape isn't some innocent darling who made "a few bad mistakes"
#+end_quote

I never said that. The OP is literally talking about their Hogwarts years, not anything after.

#+begin_quote
  he disliked muggles right from childhood,
#+end_quote

I'm sure having an abusive father had nothing to do with it.

#+begin_quote
  entered school knowing a lot of Dark curses
#+end_quote

From where? His mum that wouldn't/couldn't leave her abusive husband? Old potions or dark art books? Was Snape even allowed to use magic at home? Was his mum using magic?

#+begin_quote
  joined the Death Eaters and did everything that Death Eaters did
#+end_quote

Citation(s) needed.

#+begin_quote
  only got cold feet when he finds out he inadvertently placed a target on the woman he lusted after.
#+end_quote

Congrats, kudos to you! A decent point is made!

  After his "redemption", he goes around being a lowlife to orphans who lost their parents to the organisation he was part of, tries getting two innocent men killed and Pettigrew (who is incidentally also responsible for James and Lily's deaths) escapes. He then passes information that causes the death of Emmeline Vance. His information also gets Alastor Moody killed and George maimed.
#+end_quote

True, but again, this isn't part of the timeline OP is asking for.

#+begin_quote
  All this pales in comparison to the fact that school children as young as 11 were punished with the Cruciatus curse when he was headmaster of the school. And no, don't give me the "but that was the Carrows!" BS. Snape is headmaster and Voldemort's Right Hand - the Carrows answer to him, not the other way around.
#+end_quote

See previous.

#+begin_quote
  But of course, James is a "spoiled rich bully", and must *therefore be the Antichrist reincarnate*. That makes total sense. Of course.
#+end_quote

Again, when did I say this?

If this was Snape vs Sirius or Remus or Peter, I would say they are on an even keel in terms of how difficult their childhood and teen years were. Sirius had abusive parents, Remus was dealing with his lycanthropy, and Peter was trying to avoid being James' next victim. But James was a spoiled rich prick with loving parents and everything he could want. How am I supposed to feel sorry for that? Asking me to feel sorry for him is like asking me to feel sorry for the strongest, most well-fed lion in the savanna. It just doesn't work.
