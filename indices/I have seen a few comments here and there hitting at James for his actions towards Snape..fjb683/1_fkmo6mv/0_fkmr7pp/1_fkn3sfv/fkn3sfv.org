Unfortunately, a good many people are able to identify with having an abusive childhood and making some bad choices growing up due to that.

James is basically seen as a Brock Turner or the Afluenza drunk driving kid, or the yuppie bully in a bad 80's movie. People resent spoiled preps who have a happy home and rich parents who adore them and yet look down on everyone else who isn't as lucky. He has no real reason to be a dick, he just /chooses/ to be.
