I recently saw a Snape/Lily fic where Snape makes an unbreakable vow not to join the death eaters. True to form, the author demonises James and Sirius.

It's insane - the author thinks that they're redeeming Snape, but it's even worse. In the author's mind, Snape has to have a magical noose around his neck to stop him from being a completely despicable piece of shit. This is how pathetic Snape apologists are.
