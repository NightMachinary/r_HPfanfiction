  I'm not sure how to respond to this. The rest of your comment follows along the same vein of apologism, which means I have zero interest in continuing this thread.

Just cite examples of Snape's crimes. Since you haven't made them up, it should be easy for you.

  Yes indeed. Exposure to the cruciatus is good at a young age because it helps builds resistance to it. taps forehead

But when SNAPE set anyone punishment, it was a covert pat on the back in the form of sending the silver trio to Hagrid, thus basically setting up a meeting of the Harry Potter fan club. You appear to be under the impression that Voldemort would have let Snape get away with continuing to run the school like Dumbledore did.

In the 6 years prior to that, Snape gives students lines and makes them scrub cauldrons; it is Minerva who sends 1st years to help Hagrid find a unicorn killing horror and locks Neville out of the common room when a mass murderer is on the loose.
