  Apparently, Snape being a two-faced murderous little bastard who knew more Dark magic at 11 than most Slytherins at 17 and joining the Death Eaters (and committing all the crimes that come with being a Death Eater) is somehow redeemable, but James being a "bully" is not.

Because James is a bully on page and Snape is a violent criminal in your imagination, so he only needs to be redeemed of his many crimes in your head.

  For fuck's sake, Snape is responsible for the murder of Emmeline Vance in 1996 - someone who he was on the same side with! Not to mention the fact that the Cruciatus Curse became an acceptable form of punishment in the school with Snape as headmaster.

He takes credit for Sirius's murder in the same sentence, a murder he tried to prevent. Headmaster Snape was playacting as Voldemort's servant. His own punishments were (and always have been) very safe and mild.

  James loathed Snape, but he risked his life to save Snape's worthless hide. I don't know anyone who would do this - I certainly wouldn't risk my life to save that of someone I despised. This speaks volumes about James as a character.

James saved Snape because if a student had died on the full moon he and his friends would have been expelled and who knows what would have happened to Lupin. He absolutely was not acting out of moral conviction. Snape tried to keep Sirius from going to the DOM, and tried to save help Lupin in the 7 Potters battle, at risk to his cover and his life, and with no benefit to himself.
