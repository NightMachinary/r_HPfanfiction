The posts in this thread read like they were written by Brock Turner and Bill Cosby's lawyers, if they also happened to be Flat Earthers.

"Who here /hasn't/ sexually assaulted someone when they were young???"

"If the perpetrator had good grades and was popular, how could he be a rapist???"

"Clearly James was a good person, because his friends say so, and his victim +was a slut+ knew Dark Magic from the age of 11" [we'll ignore the fact that an 11 y.o. child knowing a lot about how to cause harm is one of the first and most important signs that the child is being abused at home; no, clearly, it's sign that he was Born Evil]

"I am free from the constraints of canon and authorial intent! I can see with my Mind's Eye that James was bullying Snape because he associated with Death Eaters, and he, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily were all lying when they said James bullied Snape and others for fun"

Jesus wept.
