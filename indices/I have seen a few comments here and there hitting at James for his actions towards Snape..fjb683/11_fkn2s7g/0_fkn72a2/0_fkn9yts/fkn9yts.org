Not in canon, but it's a very common theme in fics and in requests on this sub. Everyone wants their power and revenge fantasies, without too much constraint from pesky things like morals.

I didn't talk about what Snape did during the war, just how he got to that point, because that's where James is relevant. I agree he does some very bad things and that he remains responsible for them no matter what. But he still changed sides, and for the sake of someone other than himself. And then he stays with that choice, despite that Lily is dead and he has everything to gain by going back to the Death Eaters. He's not naturally predisposed to evil and selfishness, like Voldemort, he's a realistic person with both good and bad qualities. His childhood and teenage years greatly encouraged him towards the bad qualities. A few small changes in that period, though, would not only make him redeemable, but he wouldn't need to be redeemed at all.

Imagine if they'd gone to school when there hadn't been a war brewing. Snape would still have been awkward and greasy, James would still have been a bully. But Snape wouldn't have been radicalised, while James wouldn't have had any opportunities to be a hero. Opinions of the two might be completely reversed and I might be here talking about how James is a complex and redeemable character.

Ultimately, I think a big part of the problem is that both James and Snape can be bad, and both of them can be good. You can write it however you want. But the culture of fanfiction has a lot of bashing - if you want to show one person as good, you justify that by showing their enemy as awful, and vice versa. Fic authors need to treat each character on their own merits, as written, not link that to other characters.
