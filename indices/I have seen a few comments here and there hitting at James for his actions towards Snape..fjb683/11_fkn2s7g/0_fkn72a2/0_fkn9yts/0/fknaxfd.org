I think its because we dont see the full scope of it. We see James do a horrible thing and then are told that he changed but we dont see it which is what leads many to think he was still a horrible bully and got away with it

​

Snape its the reverse we see his bad home life and being bullied but we dont see what he have done in Voldermorts name so this lets it screw to far to either side either hes a complete victim and any one who dosent like him is a victim blamer OR hes a complete weirdo who never deserved forgiveness

​

I think if we had seen more from either of them James being kinder to others or Snape being a devoted DE or being devoted but remorseful in private I think could balance things out a bit in the eyes of the fandom
