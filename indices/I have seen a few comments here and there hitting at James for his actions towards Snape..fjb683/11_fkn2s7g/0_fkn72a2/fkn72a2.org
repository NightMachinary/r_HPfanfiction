I think for people who say that imake the distinction Harry had a rough childhood he never did anything like Snape did. He gave his master a prophecy that he knew would lead to the death of an innocent child. Then when he discovers that its Lilly he tries to save her alone and was still okay with LV killing a baby

​

Then when that fails he goes to Dumbledore and then when chastised goes "hide them all then"

​

Thats what rubs people the wrong..........its the lack of empathy. Hes not horrified that he has doomed a family. He only cares about Lilly

​

Ive seen a lot of people point out that lots of people have a bad child and they dont resort to aiding in child murder.............as they say on crime documentaries just because you had a bad life dosent givve you the right to hurt others
