The difficulty I have with people's reactions to Snape is that the same people who are quite happy to justify Harry doing virtually anything as a result of his upbringing, will nonetheless condemn Snape in spite of his, which was obviously much worse. Whereas Harry left his abusive home and found welcome and friendship and praise at Hogwarts, Snape came there and continued to be bullied and ostracised. He was at best ignored by non-Slytherins because they all distrusted Slytherins, and there's no way the Slytherin purebloods would welcome someone whose dad was a Muggle. We know that his only friend was Lily - he was ostracised.

The same people seem to think Snape and the Marauders only met in their 5th year - which was when Snape became friends with the junior Death Eaters - and there was no history before then. Snape was an easy target, and like all bullies, the Marauders love to go for the easy targets. Someone socially awkward with no friends to defend him.

Yes, of course he joined the DEs and called Lily a mudblood, but as I said, it wasn't until his 5th year. The fact that she was willing to be his close friend until then is another indication he wasn't particularly bad previously, just ugly/greasy and socially awkward. Presumably the DEs noticed by then that he was intelligent and useful, and also primed for radicalisation. He'd been made powerless and alone by the constant bullying and ostracisation, and was offered a golden opportunity to become powerful himself and to belong to a group of people. Of course he took it.

I don't think James is unredeemable or should be vilified as much as he is, but I also think you make far too little attempt to understand Snape or why he acted the way he did. I also don't see him as unredeemable in the right fic
