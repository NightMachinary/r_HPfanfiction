by *no* account does he give as good as he got. /lupin/ made them feel ashamed of themselves for their abuse of snape

lily says snape is friends with avery and mulciber, in fifth year, but what we have no actual idea what their dynamic is like. no one came to his defense, save lily, in SWM. your headcanon that they're some kind of pack who regularly come to blows with the marauders is exactly that- a baseless hc
