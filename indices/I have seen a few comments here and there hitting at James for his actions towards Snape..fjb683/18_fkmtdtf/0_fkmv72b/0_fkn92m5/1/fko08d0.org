These people sound like they're in a cult, with the way they all parrot the "gave as good as he got" line, which appears nowhere in the text.

Dismissing the text itself, which presents a very clear image, and Word of God on top of it, while conjuring excuses for why James was a good person out of thin air and then ask us to justify the violence they made up.

This on top of the usual way they use adult Snape's demeanor as a justification for how teen James treated teen Snape as though James was a fucking Seer and not part of the reason Snape turned out the way that he did. This is putting a lot of faith in the moral judgement of someone who was not only a total piece of shit, but who also trusted Sirius, an attemped murderer and elf-abuser, and PETER, an actual mass murderer.

Then Snape fans are accused of being unpleasant or whatever the fuck that was.

You are my absolute hero.
