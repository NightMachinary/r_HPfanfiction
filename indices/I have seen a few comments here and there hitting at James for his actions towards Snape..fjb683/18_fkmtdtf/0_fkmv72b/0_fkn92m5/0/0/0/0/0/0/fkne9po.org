even if you want to stick your fingers in your ears re:jkr, lupin's words are right there. it happened multiple times, sometimes he was brave enough to tell james and sirius to fuck off, sometimes he wasn't. lupin, snape's own victim, thought their actions were unscrupulous enough to hold them accountable. harry pushes that they attacked snape for no good reason, &sirius 1. doesn't deny it 2. says he isn't proud of it
