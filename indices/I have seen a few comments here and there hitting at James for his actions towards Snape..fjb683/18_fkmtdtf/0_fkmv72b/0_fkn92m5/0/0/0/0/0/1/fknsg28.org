#+begin_quote
  Death of the Author means that the author's intent is irrelevant to interpretation. They can opine on their own interpretation of the text they wrote, but that does not inherently make it valid.
#+end_quote

In particular those intents expressed after the story is written and published. In essence, it means that the author is dead and the author attempting to retcon should be seen as a random person attempting to retcon.
