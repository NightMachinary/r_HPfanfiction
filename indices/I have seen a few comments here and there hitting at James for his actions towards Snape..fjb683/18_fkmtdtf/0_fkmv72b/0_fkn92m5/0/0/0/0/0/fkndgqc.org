Death of the Author means that the author's intent is irrelevant to interpretation. They can opine on their own interpretation of the text they wrote, but that does not inherently make it valid.

The books clearly portray him as somebody who relishes in the pain of others, who knew a great deal of dark magic and has no qualms at all about the use of it on other students. A single scene does not a trend make, especially when contrasted with all his other behaviours.
