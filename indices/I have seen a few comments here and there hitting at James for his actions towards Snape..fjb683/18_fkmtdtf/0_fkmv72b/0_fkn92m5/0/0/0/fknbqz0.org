Death of the Author. Anything that is not within the text is irrelevant. From what we see in the text, Snape was a cruel ex-terrorist bully in adulthood, who hung around cruel proto-terrorist bullies when he was at school. He demonstrates a disdain and cruelty towards others who are not Lily before he even set foot in Hogwarts. There is plenty of evidence to support that Snape was just as much of a shithead, if not more, than the Marauders.
