it isn't a retcon, lol. it's an elaboration of canon that you dislike, that's entirely coherent within canon, and...everything the characters say.

but you realise how impossible you're being, surely. by your own words, all accounts we have within canon are biased. the only way to know what really happened is for jkr to give an overview. which she did. it's the same one she's consistently given within and without the series. it's just not the one you want to see. tough
