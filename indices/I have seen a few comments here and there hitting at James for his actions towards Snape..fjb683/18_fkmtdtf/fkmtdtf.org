ok James is a known bully in canon there are literal records of his "pranks" we only ever hear lily say snape was potentially involved in some blood purist stuff no he did not know a heap of dark magic at 11, you idiots he is a half-blood I can't remember if it was confirmed whether his father was abusive or not but a lot of fanfiction suggests he does have an abusive father looking at it snape was a bit of a loner whereas James had three friends to back him up do you actually think that snape went after James for gods sakes James' pranks were not pranks they were bullying his "pranks" often focused on humiliating one or a small group of people rather than doing something that wouldn't upset anyone like Fred and George if I were Snape id be more than a little bitter about the situation and no I wouldn't verbally abuse a kid but have you seen snape teach I sincerely doubt he wants to be a teacher it's not like he ever physically abused a kid
