Aside from the fact that Lily ended up with him there seems little textual evidence to me that James "changed" at all, and you know, you always hear people ranting about girls choosing the "bad boy" or the jerk ahead of the "nice guy".

The flat out truth is the text is going to be viewed through the lens of the reader's own experiences which is why people get so entrenched in their own view and struggle to comprehend the stance of those with an opposing viewpoint.

Both are right, neither is right. Root for whomever you want just don't bitch at others for holding a different character to heart.
