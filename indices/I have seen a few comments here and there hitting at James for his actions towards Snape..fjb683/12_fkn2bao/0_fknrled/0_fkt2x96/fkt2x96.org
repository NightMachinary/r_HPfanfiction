At this point, I'm convinced that if Snape had somehow murdered the families of everyone who had so much as looked at him wrong, these people would find ways to justify that as well.

But the incel thing...I dunno, Snape might come off as an incel if you look at him real hard. Maybe these Snape apologists see so much of Snape in themselves, maybe that's why they defend him so fanatically.

You know, I think I'll do one of those Bingo posts, that were a hit a few months back, with Snape apologism 101 as the theme.
