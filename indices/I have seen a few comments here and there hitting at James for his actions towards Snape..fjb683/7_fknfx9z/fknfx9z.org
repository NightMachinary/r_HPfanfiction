I'm seeing a fair bit of "you can't expect me to feel sorry for James" and I don't think anybody is asking for that? He's not really pitiable, you're absolutely right. That doesn't mean he's bad and Snape is good, though.

IIRC James starts the feud with Snape over Snape wanting to be sorted into Slytherin, in a post-Voldemort world. I don't think it's a stretch to say that James' targeting of Snape is modern-day Nazi punching: kind of crass, but morally defensible. Singling him out is kind of shitty when the band could have been a kind of Freedom Fighters throughout the school, but they were standing up to somebody who stood for the terrorizing of their Muggleborn classmates. Also, exposing his underwear is way too far, definitely!!! But, having been in high school in the early 2010's, guys pantsing guys was a common thing. Reprehensible and possibly traumatic, but also not indicative of the mind of a sexual assaulter so much as a young teenager without a developed empathy. The Brock Turner comparison is patently insane.
