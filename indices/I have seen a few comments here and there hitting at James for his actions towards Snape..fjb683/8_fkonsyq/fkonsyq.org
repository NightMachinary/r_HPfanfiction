  James CHANGED.
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, as with evey bully, by the time he changed, he had already done a lot of damage. It is easier to grow up and stop being a bully than deal with the effects of it as a victim. It is a shame that victims are not left in peace to "grow up" instead of being emotionally stunted and traumatised.

  And let's be honest there was some definitive evidence why Snape was a target.(Racist kids get treated badly in most schools, although I don't know if Snape gave off any of those comments before him and lily fought.)
#+end_quote

You are referring to now in a society where racism is challenegd more openly...or it should be. They were at school in 70's UK where attitudes were very different. That doesn't make it right, but society was not as progressive back then as it is now... and even now we still have issues with it. We are also told that during the first war with Voldenort the order were outnumbered 20-1 and there were a lot of people who agreed with Voldemort.

Further, James was asked why he would not leave Snape alone and he said "it is more the fact he exists". JKR has also confirmed that his bullying of Snape was relentless and that bullying has consequences. It was also borne out of the fact that Snape was friends with Lily, which I think SWM highlights clearly. James and Sirius also picked on others just because they could. It wasn't just Snape.

  And the fact that it's ridiculous to judge someone based on how they are as a teenager, I look back on how I was when I was younger and cringe (despite never being a bully)
#+end_quote

I imagine most people do.

People should be given room to change, absolutely. What I find difficult to swallow is the attitude to victims I.e. "get over it" which is on display on this sub constantly. It is infuriating, insulting and ignorant. Victims who struggle to overcome are effectively dismissed and treated worse than their aggressors, who are allowed to "change" and "grow up".

  and Snape was not a weak little boy that made James feel powerful like many bullies, I find it hard to believe that Snape didn't stir the confrontations and gave as good as he got.
#+end_quote

Despite Lily saying "why won't you leave him alone? What's he ever done to you?" And James responding with that line about him existing.

Even Lupin and Sirius don't try and tell Harry they picked on him because he started it or he was a racist. Lupin strongly implies that Snape only started fighting back, starting it, however you want to frame it, after 5th year. Considering what happened in 5th year with it being made very clear to Snape by Dumbledore that he would not protect him, I can't say I am surprised...

  just want to confirm for certain that bullying is wrong and James' actions were wrong. (As we lack the evidence to say it was 'justified')
#+end_quote

Bullying should not be justified. If there is a child displaying unacceptable behaviour then adults should deal with it. For example, Sirius' half heartedly tries to use Snape's "love" of the dark arts as an excuse, but firstly, that could be an exaggeration by Sirius, and secondly we do not know enough about the dark arts to form an opinion ourselves. For example, Harry is not the only one of the "good guys" to use recognisable dark arts.

James hating them as much as Sirius says he did is most likely the result of what his parents taught him (despite the marauders map being full of dark magic). Just as Snape apparently knowing dark arts at a young age must have come from his mother. What you have there is parents with two different views on a certain type of magic. It is not up to James or any child to dish out perceived "justice" (but James was not doing that. He was in Sirius' own words an arrogant berk). If there were concerns over Snape and the dark arts, a teacher should have been dealing with it and taking it up with his mother...perhaps if they had bothered Snape might have had a chance. There is a reason JKR highlighted the clear neglect Snape has in his life in comparison to pampered James...but again, James was asked why he was bullying Snape and he responded because he exists.
