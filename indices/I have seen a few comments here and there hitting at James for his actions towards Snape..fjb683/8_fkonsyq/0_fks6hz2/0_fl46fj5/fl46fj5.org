Prisoner of Azkaban. Lupin tried to down play it as a joke product from Zonkos, but we, Snape and Lupin know it is no joke product from Zonkos...Lupin knows full well Snape is on the right track, but is trying to deflect attention not only from Harry, but himself...as if he could when "Mr Moony" had just insulted Snape.

The dark arts are never fully or properly defined in the books, but it seems even without Snape and Lupin's comments in PoA that an object which allows surveillance of people against their will or knowledge would require dark magic.
