Not OP but I have a headcanon that Sirius really loved making models and charming them into things that would give Arthur Weasley a field day at work. Some of them, like the motrobike are for his own use. Others might be for defensive magic, used as protection for the Order and his house. Some of them might even be little trinkets and gifts he might give his mates. I also like to think he loved hanging around animals (his friends in canon were 1/3 animals). And as you said, the crossword obviously. I like to think that for Order work, he would sneak secret codes into the crosswords that would be the passwords to gain entry into Headquarters.
