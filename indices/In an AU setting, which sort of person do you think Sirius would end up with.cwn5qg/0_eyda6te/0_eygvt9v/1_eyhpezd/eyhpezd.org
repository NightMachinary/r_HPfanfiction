Anything you want! In canon, he doesn't have a whole hell of a lot of time for hobbies so we don't know much. You can read between the lines a bit...

Crosswords.

The motorcycle is another obvious one. The posters. Hagrid, who refers to him distantly as “young Sirius Black” still knew that he “loved that thing.” But more than that, he charmed it, and we know muggle electronics and magic don't mix. There are manuals around his room. Combine that with his restless personality and the success of the Marauder's inventions, and I completely agree with [[/u/Bookwork_Potterhead][u/Bookwork_Potterhead]]'s headcanon. Sirius was probably the “tinkerer” of the group. James would come up with the crazy ideas and he'd figure it out.

Quidditch. No canon evidence that he played (or not), but he knew Ludo Bagman by his reputation as a beater. He risked getting his soul sucked to watch Harry fly. James ‘Quidditch Captain' Potter is his favorite person.

He seems to be an animal lover and has a good relationship with them. He probably took CoMC as his elective (/oh, getting past dragons is simple/). Freedom loving guy, who grew up in a darkened, decaying town house---I figure he's outdoorsy or likes to spend time in fresh air, as unlike his childhood as possible.

Politics/current events, see especially the GoF cave scene when he is the info dump. He's pretty openly disdainful of hypocritical sources of power: Barty Crouch Sr. (who, to be fair, ruined his life) and even the way he drags his grandfather for his Order of Merlin (“it means he just gave them a load of gold”). He fought in a rebel organization. He left his family over political differences, essentially.

Music. Would love to know if God Rest Ye Merry Hippogriffs is a wizard Christmas classic or if he made it up. I think there's a piano in Grimmauld Place, but I may be confusing the movies and books. It's my personal headcanon that the Stubby Boardman/Sirius Black rumors came from /somewhere/.

+Fanon Sirius Black really cares about his flowing locks.+

I didn't meant to suggest that your OC should mirror him (unless you want to write that, of course!) More that, he'd look for someone who can at least enjoy his interests as a way to spend quality time, rather like a friend would. So maybe not a mechanic but not someone who can feign interest when he begins to talk about bench seats on a Bonneville.
