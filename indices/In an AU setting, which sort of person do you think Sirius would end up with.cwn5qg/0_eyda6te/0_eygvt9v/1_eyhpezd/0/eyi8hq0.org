I'm definitely not interested in creating a carbon copy of Sirius. In fact I really hate the 'carbon copy' that's in fact just a misinterpretation of Canon!Sirius to have him be a boisterous, goofy and flirtatious guy who also obviously smokes. Basically why I pretty much most Marlene/Sirius. I think Sirius was a pretty moody guy at times and based off the little we have if him in canon he shuts himself completely out when he's upset and he doesn't need an equally moody, passive aggressive person. I believe that'd be a disfunctional relationship. The thing is, this OC will play a huge role in the story as a side plot later on and since Remus is dead, James is already married and in hiding and Peter is abroad, that leaves them.

In this fic, Sirius barely sees his friends for the above reasons, although he and James try as hard as they can to meet up, especially when Peter is around. He obviously relies on him a lot and I'm not undermining how much James matters to him in this story since I love the James/Sirius bromance. I think he completely trusts them as well, and they trust him back. I also believe they'd have friends that Sirius would notice how loyal they are to, and since he would like them to be at the very least friendly with James, he'd have to be friendly with their friends as well. Strangely enough, I already fleshed out two of these character's best friends and they have names, background stories and all. Which is odd, come to think of it. They're on the light side of the war and I'm pretty settled on Slytherin rather than Ravenclaw although that could easily change.

I'm just unsure what the core traits of their characters could be. I sometimes refer to MBTI types, although they're not exactly reliable but give me vague ideas. I think Sirius is ENTP (although, is he in fact as extroverted as we'd like to believe? He isn't very open with a lot of people, even when young and I don't see him being the planner of every single party or even a regular participant). I don't like to believe that oh since he's ENTP, then they have to also match that. I also look at patronuses (Lily and James are a stag and a doe, Ron and Hermione's compliment each other, Harry and Ginny are both animals that are associated with being free and wild while Tonks shifted to Lupin). Sirius is a grim but I can't think of many other animals other than wolves that are associated with loyalty, aside from wolves (and Remus is dead for plot reasons and I don't want them to resemble him too much). I looked at the death and impending doom factor and came up with a thestral, although that's a magical animal and too many Mary Sues to my taste have thestral patronuses. Although they are not a central character. Do you have any ideas? There's also the 'opposites attract' thing and a cat is a thought that I've entertained.

What patronus would you pick as a starting point to flesh out their personality? What fits with a big, black dog?

I also believe that the softer, more thoughtful and gentle side of Sirius we see with James, Buckbeak and Crookshanks would come out, although what would bring it out other than complete trust and acceptance? Remus and Peter loved and accepted him, but he always went back to James, why?

Another question relating to hobbies and the like: would you see Sirius taking Arithmancy/ancient runes/alchemy or just settle for the old divination + COMC? I know he's intelligent but is he really the studious type? For what's it worth, he's also an auror in this fanfiction and goes out on private missions of his own that relate to curse-breaking. Can you also see him reading as a hobby ?
