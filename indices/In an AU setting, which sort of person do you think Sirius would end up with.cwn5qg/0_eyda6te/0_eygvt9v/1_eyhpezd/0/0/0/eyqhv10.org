Thank you for the wishes.i'm currently fleshing out the characters and the plot and I think I'm starting soon.

I think in canon once James started dating Lily and spending more time around her, Sirius was happy for them both and became a sort of brotherly figure to Lily but he was still feeling kind of not let in on a part of James's life that he knew he could never be involved in. I think this also increased when he went into hiding. While he feels happy, for them truly he's also a bit upset, unfairly at that and he recognises it so he just shuts it off but James always takes notice and he's the only one to.

Do you have reason to think Sirius would take divination because I am confused by the common perception that he took it 100%. I also can see that at a time where the population was higher and with a year as talented as his, they didn't need time turners. Since he's a cursebreaker as a side job, I think being well versed in Arithmancy is necessary to him. I like the idea of ancient runes and Sirius, reminds me a bit of Blackpool. I'm pretty confident in Muggle studies and COMC but if he takes two more then he would need a time turner unless it was a side subject. I don't see him very studious.

What do you think of a Sirius paired up with a more grounded and sensible version of Luna Lovegood? Basically, a mashup of Luna and Lupin, where she has the subtle humor (I think I've settled on a she) of Lupin, as well as his perceptive nature and compassion with a sprinkle of his common sense but also Luna's creativity and imagination, not being afraid to stand out in the crowd and being very ambitious about seemingly outlandish ideas that, unlike Luna, actually do have a basis in fact. She can have a bit of an offbeat sense of humour like Luna's, though. Her bluntness is intentional, unlike her but also a bit embarrassing especially when it's snuck it with the subtlety of Remus. Most importantly has the ambition to prove herself and is driven by very personal goals.

Can you also see Sirius paired up with a Snape-type of spy? Not the personality is Snape, just his position as a spy. I see Sirius as a very confrontational person and someone who is a spy would let him see that fighting the war isn't just about being on the front lines and doing recon work. If I do adopt the plot line of Sirius and Snape forced to work together later on, he'd think a bit more maturely about Snape as a spy, through her, although she'd have to stop being an Unspeakable because that's too much. Maybe working in Flourish and Blotts.

I was also thinking about a Newt Scamander type of job, I think that while it provides the thrill of adventure it doesn't give him the satisfaction of a good mystery to solve, or some ominous things with a sense of danger. On a similar note, I actually see Sirius's animagus form as a grim. Not a big black dog of a typical breed but an actual grim. What makes him look not like one is because his form has pale eyes instead of red ones. Is that plausible? I like a swan so far, especially because black swans are sometimes associated with death which lines up nicely with Sirius's form. I can also think of a coyote, although I don't know if they're considered particularly loyal.

I'm also sorry for the late reply.
