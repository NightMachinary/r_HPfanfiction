Your story sounds interesting. Good luck with writing it and I hope you'll post it here when finished!

You mentioned the boisterous Sirius that reads more fanon than canon, and wondered whether he's an “E”. (I love MBTI too. I always get, like, 49/51 at the E/I divide, so I also understand the personality type that can appear really outgoing but considers themselves an introvert at heart.) I think he probably /is/ more of an “E” type, but I do wonder how much of that is because the bits we get in canon, he is so lonely. It's kind of a skewed perception. He does tend to close up when he's upset, he needs his space, the entire year he was on the run he did so without help. I agree with you that he‘s more reserved than people tend to write him. He's got a really good mask. Also, James is sort of a special case, where he seemed to want to be around him all the time. But their relationship seems like the exception, not the rule. In either event, I would bet a partner who is more of “E” herself would be more complimentary.

I pegged him for COMC and divination, probably ancient runes. I know the tattoos are movie canon +and honestly so stupid that he “got them in Azkaban” like holy fuck have the producers even read these books+, but I totally love the tattooed Sirius with his magic enhancing runes trope. They're deeply magical and intuitive and no one really knows how to control them; that's very much up his alley. Arithmancy is just math, right? If you push the mechanical brain, with the motorcycle etc., then he probably enjoyed that to a small degree. Muggle Studies for damn sure. The thing is, Sirius tried to act all cool about not studying in Snape's Worst Memory, and like---been there, done that. But, BCJr. gets twelve OWLs. Hermione does too, I think. So do the elder Weasleys. That's more OWLs than there are slots for classes (Rowling's math is so hilarious to me. Same, girl.) Assuming that the year containing Snape, Lily---Slughorn's favorite potion's student, and the Marauders is not below average (it ain't), then James and Sirius had to get around a dozen too to be among the top students in their year. Maybe he didn't take all those electives, but he probably at least sat the test +just to show off+. I wouldn't call him studious, but someone naturally curious, who would go deep into anything that meets that sweet spot of interesting and challenging. I could very much see him as a reader for things that stimulate him in that way, just not the sort who will devote four hours to a bullshit essay for the sake of it.

I love that you have him a curse-breaker, by the way. I figure that or a Newt Scamander sort for him, if he ever had the opportunity to have a job.

Have you looked at other loyal animals, like horses, swans, eagles? It's not just compatibility but happy memories; so your patronus frequently takes a similar form because your partner is your source of many happy memories. Personally, I wouldn't worry too much about having them complimentary to start; they may well end up there down the line.
