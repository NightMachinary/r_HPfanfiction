This AU is before Azkaban and before the death of James? You have a pretty different person before and after.

I think the fundamental thing is acceptance. He didn't have it at home. He does for perhaps the first time with James, and it inspired lifelong loyalty. The one time he got a little nasty with Harry (hanging up the Floo call), it's because "he" is "rejected," even if Harry was only concerned about his safety. He is who he is, and he's not going to change himself for a relationship that he doesn't really need when he has such a tight bond with his friends.

(This is why I've never enjoyed Hermione/Sirius; I think she's too controlling and nitpicky to make for a really natural pairing with him.)

Someone: * politically and morally aligned. He walked out on his family over differences here, it's non negotiable. * with shared interests and a similar personality, so there's an undercurrent of friendship, even if they don't begin that way. Those have been the most positive relationships in his life and what he'd (subconsciously or not) model. * emotionally open, and patient, and trustworthy. Even if this is before the worst of it for him, he'd already had a rough go of it, and his natural inclination is to brood and close up. So a person who can break him out of that, but not force it.

Definitely not a 'enemies to lovers' trope. Once he's got your number (/Snape/) he's so done with you. It would be Herculean to change his mind.

For the love of all of fanfic, the world doesn't need another idiot!Sirius to build up his partner's intelligence. Keep him in canon. His first magic in thirteen years is to conjure manacles from thin air with his /enemy's wand/. He basically guesses the GoF plot from a couple bits of gossip and a newspaper. It's possible for two people to be smart in a relationship, despite every single fanfic written to the contrary.

Is he young and fighting the war here? If so, I think you have the added challenge of building an OC that gives him something his mates cannot. (And not just sex; Sirius is notably good looking and charismatic. He could get just the physical bits without much issue, I'd imagine.) Anyone who comes into his orbit during the first war is another potential person he's got to protect, needs to fear for, who might be hurt by his death, takes time away from the Order, etc. I'd think sparks need to fly and quick, or he's not going to bother.
