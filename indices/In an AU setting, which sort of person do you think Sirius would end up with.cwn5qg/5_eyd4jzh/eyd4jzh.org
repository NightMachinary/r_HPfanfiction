Personally, I find Sirius to be incredibly mentally broken after Azkaban and a LOT of his 'intelligence' in long gone. Soul sucking will do that to you.

Sirius needs someone to take care of his broken ass and to help him come to terms with 12 years of violence against him.

Also, Sirius really doesn't seem to grasp that Harry is, well, HARRY, and not just James from his youth, seeing as Sirius wasn't all that old when he lost his best friend and then was mentally raped for 12 years. I dunno, there's just something about how he calls Harry 'James' and really acts as though Harry is his friend, not his godson.

TBH, if he hadn't died, he would be with Remus. Wolfstar all the way. Remus is his balance and understands Sirius as well as knowing how to cope with him.

Edit: Good sweet sparkly fuzz, ya'll, I'm just stating my bloody opinion. Why do ya'll downvote people so much? Yeesh.
