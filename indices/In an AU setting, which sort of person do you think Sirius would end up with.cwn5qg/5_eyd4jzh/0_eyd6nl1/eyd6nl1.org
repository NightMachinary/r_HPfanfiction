This brings up the old book canon versus movie canon debate. Book Sirius never calls Harry “James” and is openly offended by the suggestion that he's confused. Plus, rather than acting like Harry is his buddy, Sirius spends so much of GOF warning Harry to be careful that Harry gets annoyed, knowing that Sirius was reckless in his own youth.

I also disagree about Sirius' intelligence being gone. He comes very close to unraveling the entire GOF mystery while sitting in a cave with almost no information.

So as to the original question about who Sirius would be with... you'll never get even close to a fandom consensus. Fandom can't agree on the most basic tenants of who Sirius is, or even whether he's gay/straight/bisexual/asexual.

(My opinion? Someone smart who has the approval of his surviving friends. Someone brave enough to balance him out when he's worked up about something. Probably not a pure blood because he has so many negative associations with the whole concept. And perhaps someone quiet/unassuming he would have overlooked as a very young man.)
