I like reading first wizarding war stories so I hope you do write this!

My gut feeling would be that the only people he ever got close to/loved during this time (in canon) were the other marauders and maybe Lily. Remus seems like the obvious choice for romance. He's not a pureblood and he's a werewolf, which Sirius the rebellious teenager would prize highly. Personalitywise with those two you can either go with opposites attract, or you can argue that they're very similar (courageous, good fighters, strong beliefs, need to overthrow the Death Eaters because of their beliefs, mischief makers and the fact that Sirius's animagus is a canine, which could be seen as JKR's nod to the perfect partner for a werewolf).

I've seen a few stories that use a James/Lily/Sirius ship, which I think has potential in theory but I've not read one that's well-written.

Creating an OC for the time you're thinking might work really well. I'd decide how Sirius has developed during the war first to decide on what sort of person to match him with. Is he still fun-loving, overly arrogant etc or has he become more focused and serious? During the canon first war he most likely either slept around a lot and never formed attachments, or didn't do any type of relationships at all outside of the Marauders and possibly the Order. I believe JKR was asked on twitter why he never married before Azkaban, and her reply was that he was too busy being a rebel. I think it makes sense that he spent all his effort on fighting for the Order and whatever was left over with James and the others.

From what you write about your story, it maybe could be someone he's been seeing casually to let off steam with and then there's some sort of dramatic event that means they end up closer together? Maybe Lupin's death could be that. Or could be Marlene McKinnon's sibling who is the only one saved when the rest of the family is killed by the Death Eaters, and they look for revenge together? Whoever the love-interest is, they would probably have to be in the Order with Sirius for him to have time for them. Whoever it is would have to get along really well with James, I think that would be Sirius's first requirement. Maybe it could be another werewolf, or maybe a muggle or squib?
