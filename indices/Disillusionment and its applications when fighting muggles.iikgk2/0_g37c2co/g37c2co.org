  So the disillusionment charm works by taking light, bending it around someone, and then continuing it on its previous course.

This seems to be contradicted by canon. Magic in canon is conceptual. A killing curse kills (without a mechanism explainable by muggle forensic science), a fidelius is the storage of a secret in a soul, and love is a force of nature, not a biochemical phenomenon. The disillusionment charm hides things (Hermione casts it on their camp in DH). This is probably conceptual. A worse disillusionment charm might not be as good as one cast by Dumbledore, but it hides someone.

Magic overrides mundane nature. What I think would happen is that the light would simply be changed by the charm to be what is needed to hide the disillusioned object or person. This would be similar to how the unplottable charm means that a place becomes untraceable. Magic isn't limited by physical laws.

  /Just as wizards can make buildings unplottable, they can also make themselves untraceable. Voldemort would have been found long ago if it had been as simple as sending him an owl!/

To protect against radiation, I'd be willing to bet a wizard could also cast an imperturbable or impervious charm. I'm not even sure they'd need to, however. Wizards possess great physical resiliency and resistance to toxins.

Edit: To add my thoughts on wizards vs muggles. First of all, wizards literally control the phone calls of the prime minister of the UK. They've won already from that.

Wizards can also conjure matter and override nature. Wizards can control minds, become untraceable, and kill with a thought. An imperturbable charm repels objects, a shield charm protects against harm, and wizards can also just teleport. Wizards can set up nation-wide surveillance systems, repel muggles from an area, transfigure objects in an area (age line), and wipe memories. Wizards have access to mandrakes and Nundu's breath (potent bioweapon) that can kill wizards, to say the least of muggles who can't even mend bones in an instant and can't even cure mundane illnesses (pepper-up for the cold anyone?).

Edit 2: Read through the science, instead of just skimming over it. Alpha particles and beta particles have mass and are also ionizing particles that are harmful, though they do have less penetrating power. Still though, a good shield or impervious charm and wizards would be fine.
