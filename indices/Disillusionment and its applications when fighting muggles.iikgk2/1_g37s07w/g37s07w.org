Wizards don't live in a seperate country, they live among muggles. I don't know how can you nuke Diagon Alley or Ministry without wiping out London?

And wizards can control minds with imperius and so they can access every muggle weapons.

And coming your disillusionment charm, I think simple thermal imaging will work. Even if it did, they can essily change body temps.
