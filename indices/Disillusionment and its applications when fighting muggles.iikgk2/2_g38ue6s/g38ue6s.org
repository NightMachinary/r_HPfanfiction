One thing that sometimes fails to come up is the respective war readiness and 'warmindedness'.

Many of the more useful feats attributed to wizards are performed by specialists or outliers like LV, Harry or Dumbledore. A normal wizard doesn't really face problems from his fellow humans, and usually only knows/remembers a few basic spells from general education, a few spells they use regularly at work and a household charm or two. Furthermore, the reaction to a new obstacle is to find a magical solution to it AKA learning a new specific spell.

Muggles in contrast are outclassed in every way in any remotely fair scenario. But there is a difference in mindset that would allow them to do significant damage or even win a total war, because most wizards, even the Light sided, would think they were fighting ants. Muggles would be aware they're fighting Chtulhu.

Add in that you can theoretically have someone putting bullets in a target and seeking cover in a few days, if Muggles managed to gain entry, there would be many dead wizards.

Just as muggles can't use nukes nilly willy, most wizards do not know disillusionment, fiendfyre, fidelius... Even a good stunner. They know shields and disarmers... But most lack proficiency.

A fully realized wizard (composite) could wage a one-man war and win unless he got hit by a lucky shot. But as things are shown in canon? It seems like there would be a high death toll on both sides, but muggles have a better chance to recover - and potentially recruit muggleborn old and new to tip the scales.

Going back to Disillusionment - unless they're an outlier or they've had a lot of practice with the spell, it's only a chameleon effect... And inferior to the rare, expensive invisibility cloaks.
