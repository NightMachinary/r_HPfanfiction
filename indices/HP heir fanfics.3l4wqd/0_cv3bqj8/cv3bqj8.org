Fics that include the 'lord too many names' trope tend to be bad, so finding a good one can be really hard, if not impossible.

Anyway, I will name one that I found amusing.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Four Founders by Darth Marrs)

It has the usual scratch-head-worthy elements (on top of everything , Harry is named Lord Hogwarts) but the writing is good. If you are into this kind of thing, I think you might like it.
