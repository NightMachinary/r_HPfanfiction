As someone dipping their toes into fan fiction, this is depressingly true. Admittedly, I already write smut so I feel even worse for those people trying to share their non-romantic fan fiction.

Seeing the response to anything which doesn't involve Harry/Hermione is turning me off from writing anymore fanfic. Stories with other pairings are ignored in favour of those stories.
