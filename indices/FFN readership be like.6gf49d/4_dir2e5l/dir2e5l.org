You mean you don't want another fic where Dumbledore cackles maniacally while offering students veritaserum-soaked lemon drops, Dursleys beat Harry to a pulp every day, Weasleys are masters of manipulation that control him from the first meeting at the Hogwarts Express, Malfoys are poor misunderstood dindunuffins, and Goblins become your best friends when you act polite? Geez, talk about high standards.
