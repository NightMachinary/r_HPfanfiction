  A) there's nothing wrong with harem fics, or manipulative Dumbledore, even together. They're not all I want to read, but you guys complain a lot about them.

Have you actually ever found a good fic with the first or both tropes in an unironic take (eg. /not/ Dimension Hopping for Beginners)? I sure as fuck haven't. Manipulative Dumbledore can go either way, generally speaking the more benevolent versions similar to canon are written fairly well. Pretty much all Evil Dumbledore fics are trash.

  B) A harem fanfic getting to 521k words is damn impressive when it happens. Short fics <5k with grand ideals that are abandoned years ago are a more normal thing.

The only difference between 5k words of shit and 500k words of shit is how long it takes you to get through it.
