  there's nothing wrong with harem fics, or manipulative Dumbledore, even together. They're not all I want to read, but you guys complain a lot about them.

There's nothing wrong with the idea, but the execution of said idea often leaves a lot to be desired. I've personally never read a harem fic that I've liked. My problem with harem fics is the same one that I have with most other romance-oriented fics -- the shipping eventually displaces the plot, (assuming there was any to begin with).
