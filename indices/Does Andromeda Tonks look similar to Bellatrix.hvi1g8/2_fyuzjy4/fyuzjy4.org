Here's what canon say about their resemblance (Harry Potter 7, Chapter 5) :

#+begin_quote
  /As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's exclamation./
#+end_quote

Harry first reflex when he saw her was to try to go for his wand, so it's understandable that a lot of author use this scene in their fic. But Bellatrix and Andromeda only look alike like Sirius and Regulus look alike. You can't deny the family link, and /may/ be able to fool a stranger (especially in a dimly lighted room), but anyone truly knowing one of them would instantly see the differences.
