I read a Naruto/Harry Potter crossover where Lily had become an egg donor before having Harry and donated out of country so she wouldn't run into the kid, so Harry's half brother was Gaara of the Sand (green eyes, red hair). It's set at a point where Gaara is desperate to connect with other people and learns he has a genetic half brother out there. The writing is actually pretty good.
