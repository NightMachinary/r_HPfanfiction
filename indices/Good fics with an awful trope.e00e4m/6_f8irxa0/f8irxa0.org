In the Firebird trilogy, harems and soul bonds are the norm, not just a one-off thing for Harry. It's set in a massive and well thought out AU where everything relating to the changes is well explained. It's the only harem fic I can legitimately say is good, because the harems and bonds are seen as a dystopian element - the witches use them to establish control over wizards. The story is about Harry and friends bringing down the system.

I'll admit, the first few chapters being so AU was hard for me to read the first time, so it took a few tries to get into it. So give it a go, stomach your way through until you understand what's going on, and I promise you that there's a brilliant story to read.

First one: Linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy)
