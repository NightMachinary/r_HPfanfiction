[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13092314/1/The-Gates-of-Azkaban]] is a great fic with the following: Marriage law Mild bashing (of the potter parents and Ron) And super smart Hermione

That being said the author is damn good and the fic is a sequel to a fic that's really good. There bashing feels justified by canon, the marriage law is treated with horror, and Hermione has flaws. It's set in an au where snape lives. Highly recommend.
