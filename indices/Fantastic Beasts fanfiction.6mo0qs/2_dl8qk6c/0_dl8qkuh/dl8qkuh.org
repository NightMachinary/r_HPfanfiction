  Apparently even Gellert Grindelwald isn't immune to a niffler's sticky paws. (In which Newt was not expecting to find Percival Graves in a stolen cigarette case.)

#+begin_quote
  Newt Scamander and the people (creatures, beasts, I'm pretty sure I can put anything sentient here) that get drawn into his life. A series of ficlets from different character's point of view that may, at some point, be connected or have a plot but as yet do not. Also Pickett. Quite a bit of Pickett.

  Newt and Tina. Tina and Newt. Magical adventures. But, no matter how far they go or how much they see, they still have to answer to their Ministries. London is always waiting. With the drizzle. Tina doesn't appreciate the drizzle.Newtina. Jacoweenie. Slowburn and super fluffy.

#+begin_quote
  Newt Scamander has never really had a group of friends before. Now that he has, he's realizing that humans can be just as beautiful and complex as the magical creatures he cares for. Each with their own unique traits that can be both positive and negative. It's rather confusing to be honest.Here are a few of his observations, along with the stories behind them.
