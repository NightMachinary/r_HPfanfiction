When the movie was released, I kind of read every single fic of this fandom (there wasn't much then. But it was fun to watch the fandom being built). So I can tell that not every single Fantastic Beasts fanfiction is slash. A lot are, but not all. It's been a while since I've read them but here are some good non-slash works:

The Across the North Atlantic series is a story directly told after the event of the movies. It transcripts the letter exchange and the development of Tina/Newt relationship.

Tina/Newt. I don't remember much about it, to be honest but I remember reading it in one go, so it must have been good...

One chapter is the point of view of one character about Newt. It starts with Grindelwald, then Pickett, and so on. The chapters are basically one-shot and are inequal, some are really good, some are "meh" but it's a fun read.

It's not finished but the author starts uploading again, so here we are. It's Newt's point of view about strange things he notices about this curious species named humans. It does rely a lot on the Socially-Awkward!Newt trope.

The Cigarette's Case is an interesting take on what may happen to the real Mr Graves since Grindelwald have taken his place but we know from Mad-Eye example that you need the original alive and around when you're an impostor... (not slash. But people may interpret it that way)

If I spend more time on it, I could find you some more, but those are the ones I remember without searching much about it. But it's a start.
