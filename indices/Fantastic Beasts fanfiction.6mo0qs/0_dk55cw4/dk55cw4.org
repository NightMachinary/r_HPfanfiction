Most of the stories are slash indeed, at least on AO3 but not poorly written. Sort by kudos or hits, *read the tags and ratings* before clicking on something and everything will be good and happy in the world. Personally I avoid anything shipping Credence. I know the actor is in his 20's and gorgeous as hell, but in the movie the character is young, vulnerable, abused and manipulated and I just can't.
