Shameless self-promo: I'm jalapeno_eye_popper on AO3 and multiple readers have told me they cried at /My Whole Existence is Flawed/ which I'm not sure I can link due to subreddit rules. It's a one-shot canon-compliant tragedy from Snape's POV. One of the tags is "everyone cries" and it's not a joke.
