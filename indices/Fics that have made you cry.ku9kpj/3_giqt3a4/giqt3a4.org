I just finished Broken by inadaze22 (ffn & ao3) Its extremely long, when I say slow burn I mean slow burn. Each chapter took me half an hour to read. It made me cry so much, which is saying a lot, believe me. I can't give you a summary because it would defeat the whole point. The plot is just a big twist. But I will say this: when I saw the title my first thought was: “How basic. How many times haven't I read a fic where the characters could be described as broken beyond repair? And there was never the need to title them as Broken” But I was so wrong. It's called Broken for a reason. If you think you've read a broken Hermione... it will not compare. Not in the same way.
