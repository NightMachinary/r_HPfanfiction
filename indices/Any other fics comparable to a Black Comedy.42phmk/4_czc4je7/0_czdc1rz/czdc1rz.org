Rorschach has always been an idea guy, and honestly almost all of his ideas are amazing. Recently his writing (perhaps his editors') quality has increased greatly (see his latest) and I can't imagine how awesome Make A Wish would have been had he had that quality then. His story is one of the very few (and only off the top of my head) that gives Harry a box of tools to tackle any problem yet doesn't come off as Gary Stu Destroys the World.

The plot happens around Harry as he explores an interesting and exciting magical history that Rorschach and the Yahoo group integrated very well with real life historical events. While the multiple author/omake format can be frustrating and/or confusing, I think it works out okay. The best part of the whole thing is that no matter what The Professor and Henchgirl come up with, absolutely nobody asks if they can really do that with magic. They just do it. And it's cool.
