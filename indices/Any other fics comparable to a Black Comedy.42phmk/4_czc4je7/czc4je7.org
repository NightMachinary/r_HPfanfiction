A lot of stuff by Rorschach's Blot is enjoyable. He's not the best technical writer, but he has great ideas.

linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot) is probably his most well known and is the beginning of a series of fics. linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is by the same author as A Black Comedy and quite good as well. Firefly crossover, so be forewarned.
