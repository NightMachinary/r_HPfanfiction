If you ignore the Hat in TLIL, the story has no actual humor at all, unless you laugh at how badly it has aged, which I admit, is hilarious.

Anyways, I digress. The funniest fic I've ever read is linkffn(whatever happened to bromance). While it's only 3 short chapters, it's chock full of amazing one-liners.

Something a bit longer that I found amusing: linkffn(8197451)
