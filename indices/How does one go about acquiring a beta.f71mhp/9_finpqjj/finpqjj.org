This is one of the great mysteries of the universe. Unfortunately, it's rather difficult to find free editing of any type, and virtually impossible to find people willing to commit to reading new stuff if they aren't already familiar with your work. I've taken to publishing scenes from my work on AO3 in the hope of attracting people interested in beta reading.

I wonder if it would work to make an open beta reading sub in which people could post pre-publication works for open review.
