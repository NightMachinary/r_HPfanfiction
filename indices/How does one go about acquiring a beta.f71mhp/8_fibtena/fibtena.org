I have been active in the fanfiction community since the late 1990s, I have written my own stories and have been a beta reader a few times.

I can tell you it can make sense to have more than one beta-reader. Maybe somebody is great with plot while another is good with brit-picking while yet another is good with spelling and grammar.

I would be willing to beta-read for you, but I am not a native speaker so I am not the best candidate if you want somebody to check your grammar.
