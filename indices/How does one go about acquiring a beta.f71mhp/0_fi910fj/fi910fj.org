Well the comments here aren't very helpful at all. A lot of people find betas through their readers. But you seem to want a beta before posting anything so things are different.....

Here is what I suggest: find a fanfiction group geared towards what genre/pairing/ type of hp fanfiction you like. It could be a discord group for your pairing, it could be one of the harry potter writing groups on facebook, etc. Where you find like minded people, they will be more willing to read your work and beta, and if you join a writing group that has beta trades or beta forms, people are probably willing to help there too.
