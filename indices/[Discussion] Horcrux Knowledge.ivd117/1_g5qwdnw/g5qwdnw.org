Maybe the room of requirements had a book on them? We know that riddle had access to the room and could have found a book there. For Slughorn just because he's a potion professor doesn't mean he doesn't know about the dark arts. I'm curious if it's actually illegal to learn anything about the dark arts or just discouraged to learn by the general population.
