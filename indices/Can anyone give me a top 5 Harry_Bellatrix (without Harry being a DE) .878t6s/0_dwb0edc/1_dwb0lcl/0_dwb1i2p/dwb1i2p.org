WInd Shear - Starts off in a very interesting manner, has excellent Volderort, rampages - shows what Voldermort can be capable of, but begin to drag after some chapters, I haven't read Angry Harry completely, but it more resembles Honor thy blood. Little Death - Slow going - as in slow updates - or story if slow paced. It has slow updates, sometimes taking months. Its reasonably fast paced - in that he faces Voldemort in a very short time.
