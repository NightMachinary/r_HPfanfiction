Lol. Yeah, I'd say its just a bit faster... But tbh, I don't mind slow pace as long as the story is either finished or not abandoned. I hate when its slow paced and the dude just up and leave just as it was about to get good. Like Black Bond or HP and 5th Element (both are over 1.3m words, but BB only covers the first 3 years, with BB II being just the start of the 4th year, and 5th Element in ONLY for Harry's 6th year. 1.3m words for only 1 year. Sometimes I'm still impressed that I actually read it through all that. Although its really really good, if you have the patience.)
