It's a short one, after all of LoTR has happened. No action or such. The final goodbye between Legolas and Gimli in the Undying lands, when Gimli as the last mortal of the fellowship passes on. I think it's a beautiful tribute to their friendship, and it's written in such a way that I would not find it out of place if it was an extract from the very end the actual books - and that's high praise.
