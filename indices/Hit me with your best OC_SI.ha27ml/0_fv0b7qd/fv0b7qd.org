Imo, the two best SIs in the fandom are What's her Name in Hufflepuff and Faith and the Devil.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]]) has amazing worldbuilding, great humor and an interesting plot.

And Faith and Devil is by Tozette, but I can't seem to find a link right now.
