I've been diving into Ghost of Privet Drive and I'm absolutely floored at how quintessentially British the prose is. My usual standards for a fic being sufficiently British is if the characters remember to call their moms "mum" and say "bloody hell" a lot - it's quite refreshing to see a fic that so immerses itself in British dialect (note: I'm a Yank, so it may be an utter caricature and I'm as woefully ignorant as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron).
