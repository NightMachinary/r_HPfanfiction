The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir Series]] by mad_fairy addresses climate change somewhat. It has the magical community realizing that muggles are destroying the planet and that they are better off getting away before it's too late. Harry and his friends also start a project where they are collecting litter from rivers and recycling it into usable ressources.

It's a Marvel crossover, but I have no knowledge of Marvel/Loki/Thor and could read and understand it anyway.
