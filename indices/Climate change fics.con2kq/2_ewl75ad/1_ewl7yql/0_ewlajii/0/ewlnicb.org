It's mostly a documentary of the political situation after Harry accidentally exposes the magical world to muggles. International politics with hidden magical nations, domestic problems with anti-wizard hate groups (think Westboro Baptist Church), Al-Qaida hiring wizards for magical terror attacks, Voldemort's trying to take over multiple muggle countries including North Korea, WW3 almost happens, Arthur Weasley gets hired by Bentley to make flying cars, NASA starts portkeying astronauts around the solar system, et cetera. The whole Hogwarts story is more of a subplot, although Hermione gets really famous after saving a lot of muggles.
