  I too am not sure being Minister was the best fit for her in canon

The fact that Voldemort installs a puppet minister shows how useless that position is. It's just a glorified figurehead. Hermione's talents would be totally wasted there, any moron can do the job. Almost anything would be better for her: Being a healer (and finding a cure for Lycanthropy), becoming a Potions Master, inventing new spells, joining the Unspeakables or just becoming her own kind of Lucius Malfoy, telling the Minister what he should do, instead of wasting her time with press interviews and all the other types of time wasting that job involves.
