Thanks a bunch, I'll take a look at the small things in detail.

For the overall things, for exposition, do you mean things like the wand talk and other stuff like that, or is it his thoughts? I thought most of the stuff that wasn't dialogue or action was his thinking about how afraid he was, but maybe I'm wrong. I'll look back through and see if I can find what you're talking about though. I mostly didn't want it to be too centered on dialogue.

For the dialogue, is it the abundance of things I attach to the dialogue? Is that what you mean by crowded? I maybe got a bit too eager to use dialogue tags, because I used to use basically none. I'll look back through and try to make some of the things said more in character. Also try to keep the point of view more stuck on Albus. The scene at the train station is scrambled partially because I was integrating it with the Epilogue of DH. It turned out pretty messily. I'll work on that.

I'll work on Cecelia. It's because I have this plan for her character in the future, which bled over into her present character in my head a little too much I think.

The first chapter the scenes with so many characters I got lost in. I don't blame you if you did, given that I was having a hard time keeping track of everybody and making sure everybody participated or at least was noticeably present. Hell, I had to draw a map of the seating at the table. Calling him Harry instead of his dad was just something that started when I thought having "his dad" over and over was awkward. I can change it back though.

I'll expand (?) on the car trip. It wasn't meant to be a scene originally, but just happened as I was writing.

Is the use of "you guys", which you commented on in Ron and Ginny's dialogue more of an American thing or something? I can imagine all my aunts and uncles saying it.

On the train, the prefect was meant to be talking ridiculously pompously. Like an extra affected thing to impress them or something like that. I changed that last line of the second chapter a little, but you still might not like it.

I'll look at the pacing. I feel, when I'm writing, that my conversations can go on forever, but maybe I'm imagining things. Cecelia's physical traits are being hyped up in his head by Albus. Her manipulative aspect I'll tone down some. I didn't mean for Matthew when Rose says their names are close to us. She's talking about Scorpius and Cecelia. I'll have her say she doesn't know Matthew's name or something like that.

Thanks for all your feedback. If you need anything reviewed I'd be happy to take a look at it.
