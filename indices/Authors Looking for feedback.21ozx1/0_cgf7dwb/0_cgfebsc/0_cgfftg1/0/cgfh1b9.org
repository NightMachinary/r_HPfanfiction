*For the overall things, for exposition, do you mean things like the wand talk and other stuff like that, or is it his thoughts?*

I meant the wand talks and things like that. You talk about mundane things, like how the public views Albus as a Squib, the wands, family traditions, luggage appearing on the express, things like that, and while it isn't everywhere, it is there enough that it is noticeable. It's commonplace for Albus, and should really only be noted when something differs or is new.

It isn't that big of an issue though, just odd when it crops up.

I actually found the whole speculation on Albus being a squib interesting. It just would have been far more interesting if you had hidden it in the little things, like whispers of confusion when he's getting sorted, or a Daily Prophet paper speculating on it that's mentioned in passing.

*For the dialogue, is it the abundance of things I attach to the dialogue?*

For the dialogue, it is the abundance of things. It was incredibly prominent in the game scene, with everyone doing all these different little actions, but it crops up here and there. The train ride, for example, has things like:

#+begin_quote
  "...,"Scorpius imposed himself, coming to Rose's defense,"..."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  Now it was Rose's turn to protect Albus. "..."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "...," she said apologetically, tone much calmer than before.
#+end_quote

Like I said, it's pertinent, and it isn't out of place, it's just that the dialogue stands perfectly fine without it.

For banter, like in the train and in the gathering, less is always more. You're breaking it up with all these little actions very frequently, and I sometimes lost track of what was said prior because there were 2+ paragraphs of thought in between lines of text.

*I also try to keep the point of view more stuck on Albus.*

The train scene in terms of PoV wasn't the only place. I think the issue is you sometimes say things in absolutes, like "James was annoyed." There's a lot of little clues for this, and you usually show them, but then you sometimes flat out say how they're feeling, and it sometimes feels like a PoV change.

*Is the use of "you guys", which you commented on in Ron and Ginny's dialogue more of an American thing or something?*

"You guys," might be more of an American thing. I usually imagine them saying "You all," or "You lot," because that's the way JKR writes it, but "You guys" isn't wrong, just your own writing style.

#+begin_quote
  "Can't you guys keep it together for an hour in the car?"
#+end_quote

It just sounds more British as:

#+begin_quote
  "Can't you lot keep it together for an hour in the car?"
#+end_quote

*Calling him Harry instead of his dad was just something that started when I thought having "his dad" over and over was awkward.*

His dad over and over is awkward, yes, but since it's limited PoV, you can just call him Dad. Harry always refers to Vernon and Petunia as Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, and that usually feels fairly natural.

*I mostly didn't want it to be too centered on dialogue.*

You did very well on this, and there was a nice mix, just not in the first chapter. The first chapter was him monologuing for a while, and the dialogue was sparse. The first chapter was, honestly, a little boring. Most of the conflict is internal, and it didn't really hook me.

Perhaps starting in media res?

*It's because I have this plan for [Cecelia] in the future, which bled over into her present character in my head a little too much I think.*

That's always an issue. I like writing little summaries for each character, detailing how they change over the course of the story, and contrasting the start and end.

*I didn't mean for Matthew when Rose says their names are close to us.*

Looking back it was a dumb nitpick. Saying she doesn't know Matthew's name just feels like trying to fill in a plot hole, rather than acknowledging people make mistakes.

*I changed that last line of the second chapter a little, but you still might not like it.*

Honestly, I'd strongly advise just cutting it. It's a really big break in viewpoint, and "She smiled back at him, and sat back in her seat." works fine as an ending line.

You don't need to have a buildup for the next chapter. When the work's taken as a whole rather than sequentially it just feels odd, like a sort of /Next time, on Pokemon!/ thing.

*On the train, the prefect was meant to be talking ridiculously pompously.*

Then this is more funny than anything, and I like it a lot.
