Thanks for the clarifications.

Just wanted to say one more thing, about the starting with a chapter mostly full of boring exposition and even more normal things happening than my other two chapters: I always do this, and it's a problem. I don't think I've ever started a story that manages to start in the middle of something and not have a large bout of exposition close to the beginning. I also have a penchant for showing exceedingly normal life in a first chapter. This has happened in many things that I've started. In the previous thing I wrote, I just ended up cutting out the first chapter and merged it with the second, and still ended up with 5k boring words, but it was better than 10. Here, I have no fucking clue what I'll do, or if I'll do anything. W/e, it's fanfiction, wish fulfillment, for fun.
