Changing it up, that's good.

I didn't really like the epilogue, personally, and I agree that that's unrealistic. Mainly it's because I hate the names. James, Lily, Albus Severus? Fred? I liked Rose, but Hugo Weasley?

It always felt to me like Harry was internalizing some kind of trauma, to name all of his children after the dead.

I'm torn on whether the kids would be /that/ famous. Harry of course is, but for his children? It's like most celebrity children, they have a few minutes of fame with baby names and stuff, but past that they're only noticeable when they're with their parents.

Though, the wizarding world is extremely small. Maybe it would be different.
