I hated that dinner table. I felt claustrophobic just writing about it. I don't know why, since I have real family dinners with that many people. Maybe because I'm one of the older ones while Albus is pretty young and isolated, I don't know. I had a really hard time handling that many characters at the table, so I'd rather not attempt to mess with that. I'll try a few different things though.

Now about the epilogue. It seems many people interpret it as the first time Albus learns about his name, the first time the cousins actually learn their famous, but I don't like them not knowing anything about their past because I think it's extremely unrealistic. So that's mostly just a different interpretation of that scene, based on what I think would happen if it was real life.
