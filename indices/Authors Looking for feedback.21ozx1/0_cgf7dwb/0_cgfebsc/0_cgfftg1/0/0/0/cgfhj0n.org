Since the major conflict revolves around his sorting for the first three chapters, why not just start him smack in the middle of his sorting, whispers around him, and then he puts the hat on? That's a hook, a bit cliche in fanfic mind, but it all depends on how well it's done.

After that, then cut to the day before.

Or, just cut the start and start at the party. There's a lot of room to expand on the dinner conversation, maybe talking about the adult's gripes, the kid's at the kid table, things like that. The prank, while important contextually, could be revealed so much more elegantly.

One thing I forgot to mention in the original post is that you said Harry and Hermione always mentioned that Slytherin wasn't bad. But the epilogue kind of left me feeling like this was the first time Albus learned of his namesake, and it is definitely a much more touching moment if its the first time he learns of it.

I don't know though.

The only advice pertaining to the first chapter I could give is try a bunch of things and find what works for your story.
