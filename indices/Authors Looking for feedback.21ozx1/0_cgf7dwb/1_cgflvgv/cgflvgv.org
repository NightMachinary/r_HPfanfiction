I won't go through and point out all of the small grammar and wordy stuff. Just know that a beta is immensely useful. The couple things I would focus on is crunching down a lot of the wordier sentences and considering your POV and dialogue.

It is easy to get caught up in the poetry of writing. We all do it. When you're in a heavy exposition, it's better to get rid of all the flowery stuff in order to convey the important plot points. It's a matter of style how much you want to dress up the prose, but less is more as my beta constantly reminds me.

The other thing I would keep in mind is to watch how Albus describes things. He is still an 11 year old boy and seeing as how this is written in limited POV, there are general passages and verbiage that he would simply not use. Same goes for the dialogue. It's hard to try and dumb it down sometimes, but these kids aren't going to use some of the phrases you've written so far. I have always found this to be the most difficult part of writing kids this age (and have subsequently avoided it!)

But congratulations on starting your first story. You have a good base and a natural talent for character development. Don't forget the plot along the way!
