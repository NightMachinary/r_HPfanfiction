Thanks for your review. I'll try to limit the vocabulary used in dialogue and descriptions. It's hard to not make kids sound stupid while also not expanding their vocabularies too much. I'll take another look through though and keep that in mind for the future. Part of the use in descriptions is that I think of scenery descriptions as more impersonal, less what he's seeing and more what's seen. So that makes them different than they otherwise would be.

And Hogwarts Battle School is one of my favorite stories, thank you for writing it. As well as for this feedback of course.
