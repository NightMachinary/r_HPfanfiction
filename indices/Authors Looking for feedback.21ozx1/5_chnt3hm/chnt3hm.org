I've got two stories set in the Harry Potter continuity right now, both of which are crossovers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7325453/1/Nanoha-Takamachi-and-the-Horrors-of-Ineptitude][Nanoha Takamachi and the Horrors of Ineptitude]] is my primary story at the moment and features Nanoha and Fate (from Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha) enrolling in Hogwarts during OOTP.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10365494/1/Revenge-is-a-Dish-Best-Served-at-Body-Temperature][Revenge is a Dish Best Served at Body Temperature]] is a HP/Hellsing story I just started posting which revolves around post-DH Hermione becoming a vampire. Note: Rated M for mature situations and impending graphic violence.

Any feedback would be welcomed.
