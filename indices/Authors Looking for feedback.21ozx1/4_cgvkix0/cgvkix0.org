I have a few stories up, but I would especially like feedback on this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6087977/1/Joint-Custody][Joint Custody]]

It does have a sequel as well but I'm aware that there's a lot to read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7210757/1/The-Fine-Print][The Fine Print]]

I'm interested in writing a third to help bring things to a conclusion but find myself wanting to know if I shouldn't be editing and/or keeping things in mind before I do so.

I can also help with reviews if needed!
