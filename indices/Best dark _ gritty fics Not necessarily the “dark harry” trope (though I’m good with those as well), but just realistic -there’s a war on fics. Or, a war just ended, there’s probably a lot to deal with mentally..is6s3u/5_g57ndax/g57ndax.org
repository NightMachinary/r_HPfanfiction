I am going to get a lot of hate for recommending these two:

"DA and the Year of Darkness" used to be quite popular around here until the author turned out to be a dick but you have to give credit where credit is due because he is quite capable of writing young people forced to grow throughout a war.

"A Difference in the Family" is a Snape biography from his birth to his death. Snape is quite a hated character around here but the story makes you sympathetic with him and it remains canon compliant to the very last word. It portrays Snape's insecurities as the Death Eaters try to recruit him, his fear that what he's doing is not entirely right during the First War, his post-wars scars and determination to avenge Lily, his frustration with Harry, the Machiavellian battles in the Death Eater circles and ultimately how alone and hated by both sides he ends up. It's quite tragic but human emotions are written realistically in those circumstances.

I don't know how to put links but if you google the titles you should find them quite quickly.
