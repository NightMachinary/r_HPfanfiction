Long fic. Not marked as complete but it is. Tom and Harry leave to hunt horcruxes without Hermione, so she's just another soldier in the war (albeit a clever one). Excellent use of safehouses IMO.

Excerpt:

“Ron is the first to go fight, and all by chance because he was at the Ministry when the Aurors received the alert. Arthur said he had been excited to go, and would return in a few short hours.

Ron is gone for two days, and it is on the third day that he comes back to the Burrow. His feet are heavy and his voice silent, and the door to his bedroom clicks behind him before he answers any of them.

He does not come out for four days.”
