Behind Blue Eyes is probably the best 'there's a war on' type gritty fic I know. Great fic, really interesting relationship between Harry and an emo-chav OC (one of my favourite OCs in any fandom, actually), and does Angry Sad Harry in a really interesting way, while keeping that wartime grit and stress on (more Anne Frank than Saving Private Ryan).

Warning in advance, it's also really, really, really fucking bleak. Still great, though. It's got a delicious Positive Nihilism to the later chapters that I utterly adore. Put it this way - it's a four-hundred thousand word fic that's worth the time it takes to read it. In my opinion, anyway. :)
