AU. Long one shot. Snape never repeats the prophecy, Sirius is the Potter's secret keeper, but it's not a happy story. Voldemort wins. Strong holocaust vibes. Made me cry despite there being only one major character death. It's just so fucking bleak knowing that people actually went through this IRL.
