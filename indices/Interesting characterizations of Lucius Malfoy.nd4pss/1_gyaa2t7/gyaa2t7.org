Yes! I recommended these a while back on a different thread looking for Lucius/Narcissa stories but I think they all fit the bill of what you're looking for.

Under Obligation would be a good one to start with, it's one of the oldest and most popular Lucissa stories. It was written before HBP and the Black Family tree came out so some of the details are no longer canon (age order of the Black sisters, extended family names, etc) but I still think it holds up well. A lot of Lucissa seems inspired by this story in some way or another. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2078117/1/Under-Obligation]]

If you enjoy that but would like something lighter or, conversely, more serious, the authors who collaborated on Under Obligation each wrote their own really excellent stories. Tainted Love is darker and more complex but incomplete, and Lessons is fluffier and finished.

A more recent, canon-compliant story is Vacillation. A lot of Bellatrix and Rodolphus in the story as well. It's very long and in-depth about their feelings towards each other growing over the years, bit of a commitment.

If you're looking for something brief but beautiful, Goodnight Little Dragon is probably my favorite one-shot of the family. So sweet and touching.

Again on the flip side if you'd like a truly, deeply disturbing one-shot... got that for ya too in Paterfamilias. It's only rated T but it will mess you up and you'll need to read through it twice to bring all the pieces together... be warned!

Enjoy!!
