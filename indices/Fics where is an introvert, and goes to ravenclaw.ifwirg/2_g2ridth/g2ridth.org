Hmm, Harry is almost always an introvert. There are a lot of fics where Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw for him to make his ultimate bid to power, to end up networking a lot and find friends despite not searching.

But if youâ€˜re looking for the ultimate, adorable and introspective wallflower Harry, search no further:

Linkffn(The Life He Leads)

He is in Gryffindor though. Which helps the story, because his loneliness is greatly exacerbated by avoiding, yet living among people who do socialice and, well, talk to each other.
