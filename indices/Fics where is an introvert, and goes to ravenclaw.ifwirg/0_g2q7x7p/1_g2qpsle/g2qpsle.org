Okay, before you give this story a hard pass because it does have yaoi, let me just say that I read this today not even two hours ago and I loved it. It's on the shorter side and does kind of sweep a lot of details under the rug, but it's great and the yaoi component to it is essentially two segments, one of which can be easily skipped in chapter 7. It's a great story about Harry focusing down on a singular subject and being fucking awesome at it.
