Anyways, ngl, the only reason I read it was because someone else recommended it in a different thread, and I noticed it was written by Lomonaaeren, who wrote A Brother To Basilisks, which last I read was a pretty cool fanfic and is now finished I believe, as well as The Art of Self-Fashioning, which is an another amazing Ravenclaw Harry fanfic, but it gets a bit dark if I remember correctly.

Also, it's abandoned now I think, but have you checked out Worthy of Magic by Sage Ra? It's pretty dark, and Harry has a lack of friends solely because of his... personality? I feel like that's the wrong word, but it was an interesting story, I have no idea why Sage Ra decided to abandon it.

​

Because I feel the need to recommend it often, check out Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7. It's a fucked up story that I think is amazing. That's all I'm going to describe it with, read the description for more.
