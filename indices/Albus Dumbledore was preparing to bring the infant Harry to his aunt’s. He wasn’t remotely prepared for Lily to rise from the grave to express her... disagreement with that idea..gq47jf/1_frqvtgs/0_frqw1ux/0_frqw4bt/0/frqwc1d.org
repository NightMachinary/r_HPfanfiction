Also, you got the title wrong, so I don't know if the bot will pick it up it's /Harry Potter, Squatter/ with a comma, not a period, and it's capitalized(don't know if the bot's case sensitive).

These days, I just describe all the fanfics I'm listing and use linkffn(13274956) or whatever the ID is for the fanfic at the end of the comment.
