I doubt there would be any consequences. It was self defense for one; Quirrel was definitely gonna kill Harry at Voldemort's command. Harry also stopped Voldemort from regaining a body, which is something the bast majority of people want, including the Minister of Magic. If a detail like that came out he'd probably get an Order of Merlin, and it would get out if anyone insisted on charging Harry for Quirrel's death.

This is also a point in Harry's life where people love him. If it were Year 5 I definitely see Fudge and Umbridge salivating at the thought of charging Harry for murder, but not Year 1.

There's also the lack of information on what killed Quirrel. We know it was Lily's blood protection, but I doubt that's admissible in a court of law, even a magic one.
