It was self defense. I could see Lucius talking Fudge/Umbridge/both to try to arrest Harry for that to get him out of the way. It would be nice to see more courtroom drama in the fanfic community.

I can see it going to court > truth coming out > Death Eaters pulled out of Azkaban for veritaserum questioning > Sirius being found innocent > Chaos happening.

That's how it happened in this fanfiction: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9643914/1/][Trouble]].
