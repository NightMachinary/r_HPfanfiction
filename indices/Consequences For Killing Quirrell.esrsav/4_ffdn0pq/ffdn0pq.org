I mean the dude provably drank unicorn blood and disintegrated into actual ash, and /the/ dumbledore was there and witnessed a dark spirit emerging from the corpse - not to mention veritaserium ('what happened in the chamber?' - 'dude had a face in the back of his head and then he touched me and burned for some reason, crazy right') exists and is used to establish exactly these kinds of questions.

Not sure anything would happen without a cartoonishly evil dumbledore who pins blame noone actually has to take on harry for no reason.
