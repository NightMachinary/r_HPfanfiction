It's certainly self-defense... but the wizarding world is corrupt enough that it's /just/ plausible enough that someone with the power/influence that Malfoy has (or a fanfiction version that bumps up that influence a bit more) could maneuver things through so that Harry gets some consequences - or even rather dire ones.

The WW might also consider what happened to be excessive - again, that's not supported by the situation in canon/the text, but he /did/ end up dead - which is enough to start throwing some considerations around about it being fishy...
