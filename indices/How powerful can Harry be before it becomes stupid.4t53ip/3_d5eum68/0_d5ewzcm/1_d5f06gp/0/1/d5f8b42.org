Still, that doesn't indicate that Harry is a great wizard. I'd expect a great wizard to be able to accomplish a few things of great magnitude, or a variety of things of well above average magnitude, or to have an unusually deep understanding of magic, or to be unusually deft with magic, or to know many more spells than pretty much anyone else, or...

Harry having an ability that only shows up in one constrained situation -- one that he can't encounter after 1998 -- seems to miss the mark of greatness by a rather large margin.
