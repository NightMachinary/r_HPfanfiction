No. The Dark Lord "marked him as his equal". That doesn't mean that Harry actually /is/ Voldemort's equal in any particular way. Map vs. Territory, and all that.

For that matter, Harry is Voldemort's /superior/ in many ways. For example, he is not a psychopath, has a whole soul, and risks his life to saves people when he can, rather than killing them to prolong his own life.

In the context of the prophecy, it's more likely that that line was referring to either the act of Voldemort /choosing/ to treat Harry as a threat requiring his personal attention the way Dumbledore might, or the the more literal act of giving him the lightning-shaped scar. If Voldemort had chosen Neville, he would have marked Neville as his equal. Would that automatically give Neville magical power?
