  It's canon that Harry is a great wizard

It is?

  What's a perfect middle ground in your eyes?

It's not quite that simple. The essential parts are:

- The protagonist must struggle in their main conflict.
- The protagonist must fail before they succeed.

In a story like Harry Potter, where the protagonist must defeat Voldemort, you must not make Harry so strong as to make the final confrontation seem easy. But you can accomplish that by making your Harry stronger than canon Voldemort, then making Voldemort more powerful still.

By way of example, I'm currently reading /Emperor/ by Marquis Black. Harry doesn't fail on his own merits in the first four hundred pages. It's not that he's too powerful, precisely; it's more like situations conspire in his favor. There are no "oh shit" moments where he realizes he's fucked up or that he's facing off against someone too strong for him.
