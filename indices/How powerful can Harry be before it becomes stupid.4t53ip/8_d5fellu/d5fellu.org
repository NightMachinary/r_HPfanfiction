A character's power is always relative to that of the other characters, settings, and the conflict.

For example, suppose that, in fact, Harry can "can summon magical demons to do his bidding or defeat everyone in his path with the click of his fingers".

But, in that AU, /everyone/ has demons at their command --- The Sorting Hat is actually an artifact to contact the demons' realm and help the students negotiate their first demon contract, and Diabolism is a mandatory subject at Hogwarts. Different breeds and clans of demons have different abilities and capabilities, strengths and weaknesses, and they demand different prices for their services.

Nor are they particularly benevolent, always trying to get the summoner to compromise themselves, to fail to fulfill their side of the bargain to invoke the penalty clause, to bargain away more and more, and some summoners would envy Voldemort's Horcrux-crippled afterlife when it comes to what happens to them when they die.

So, would DemonSummoner!Harry powerful? Of course. But, to paraphrase the immortal words of then-former Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, "The trouble is, the other side can summon demons too, Prime Minister."
