It's canon that Harry is a wizard. Anything else is subjective there.

That said, you could make any character infinitely powerful and still not have it be stupid for as long as there was conflict (of any kind) that causes this character difficulties and requires them to put in the effort. For example, you could have an almost infinitely powerful Harry who is also immortal and tries not to be, and if you play it well you could have it be quite a gripping tale that is not at all stupid regardless of the fact that Harry would likely be able to defeat anyone without difficulties; but, in such a story “conflict” would be not about fighting but rather about becoming mortal and with /that/ Harry would struggle.

It's all about /how/ you play it, really, not about /what/ you play. So many people forget about this.
