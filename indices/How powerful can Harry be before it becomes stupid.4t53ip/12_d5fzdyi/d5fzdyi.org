When the plot is not kept stable by gross inefficiency.

Like he can summon the earth of his enemy but doesn't do so for silly reason.

Basically the power he has if it is setting-breaking it has to break the setting and we have to see the consequences, while not becoming boring.

One fic which kinda does it half right half wrong, but is still acceptable because of the cracky undercurrent is Core Threads. Beware of bad random CAPITALIZATION OF "IMPORTANT WORDS" and bad sentence structure.
