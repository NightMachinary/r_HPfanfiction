I wouldn't go any further then Cord Threads ffn(10136172), if you're going to have an insanely OP character you gotta have some humour about it. Actually I think I normally prefer about 75% less then Core Threads since you have to get the humor right or else it just seems inane and silly. I think when an OP Harry has the insane powerful wizard trope (cough cough Dumbledore), it helps too. An uber serious OP Harry doesn't work too well unless it's around Dumbledore/Voldemort level, more then that it's a kid stepping on ants situation.
