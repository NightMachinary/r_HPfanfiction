Depends like everyone is saying, but for a fic that means to feel close to how powerful he is in canon, then there is a line for me.

For me, his immense power was largely tied up between him and Voldemort. Lily's sacrifice no longer keeps him alive, he can't see into anyone's mind anymore, his Phoenix feather wand no longer has a mortal enemy, and he's not using the Elder Wand so that's kind of a moot point.

/But/ his wand did still absorb Voldemort's enormous power in the graveyard. /And/ Harry's wand (if your read up on phoenix feather and holly wood) is extremely loyal to him. So I wouldn't at all be surprised if his wand defended him in some way in the future in a very impressive way.

And I do think that with a match like Harry and his wand, that they /would/ grow increasingly more powerful together until he's probably as good at dueling as Dumbledore was eventually - but not at 17, and probably not at 30, but maybe at 50 years old and beyond.

But again, I don't /really/ care if it deviates from this so long as his power is a main part of the story and entertaining.
