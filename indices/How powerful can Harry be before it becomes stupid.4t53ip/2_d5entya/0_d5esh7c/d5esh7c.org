Sometimes when I want to overpower my characters, I'll min-max them instead. One of my fem!Harry's/OC main character can't do conventional magic at all, so it's ridiculously easy to put her down in a fight. But give her an hour to get going, and she can literally cover a square kilometer in a firestorm.
