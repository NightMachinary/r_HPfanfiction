currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7665632/1/Potter-s-Protector][Potter's Protector by mjimeyg]] where Harry is not only the Master of Magic, as well as The Master of Death, completely invulnerable where he looses limbs or is decapitated and is unaffected. Bonus, he has Xander as his adopted father who is Lord Hogwarts AND King of the Goblins, and lets not forget Neville who is a magical magus, a Phoenix and immortal as well. Lets just say this story is just a bit over the top...
