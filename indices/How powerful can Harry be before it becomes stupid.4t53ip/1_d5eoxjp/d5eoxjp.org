I think the cap is pretty high because of the very nature of the "magic background" of HP. As others have said, its fairly easy to "scale up" his conflict or surroundings as needed.

If I had to put a cap on it, I would say its where Harry could be considered a "god", or strains the boundaries of "mortality". For example, Flamel is still mortal, even if hes lived for hundreds of years. Mortal simply means they can be killed in some way.

I think a good middle ground is when the power is focused in a particular area. Like political/financial power, or actual magical power, or influential power, and so on. Too much power in too many areas and it starts to become overwhelming.
