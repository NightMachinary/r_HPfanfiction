This is all correct.. and indicative of a real issue in both fan fiction and cannon, specifically, there is a world of magic and it is not important to the plot or even relevant in the end. It is instead the devices of God that win the day. Where most powerful fics fail is in their lack of plot, an inverse relay bishop to jk's failure to fully realize the magic of her own world. Powerful Harry stories don't work because they don't have a plan other than "well the magic could be so much better".

Have a plan, a sacrifice or loss, a triumph over insurmountable odds, or even something original and thought provoking, and your powerful Harry will go down in history.

My 2 cents... NoExit hits it on the nose, conflict or a lack thereof, can make or break a story.
