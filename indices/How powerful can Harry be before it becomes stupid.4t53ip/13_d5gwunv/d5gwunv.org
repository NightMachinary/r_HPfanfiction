I'm just rereading linkffn(Harry potter and the summer of change by lorddwar) , probably one of my favourite honks fics ever, and I really like Harry's power in this one and the way it explains it. He's really magically powerful, but he has other faults, like tunnel vision, poor planning, or a lack of knowledge. Also it's not just "Harry bought a bunch of books and now can use all these really cool spells" he actually works to get better. I also really like the explanations of magic and intent, as well as the take on occulemency(sp?) and wandless magic. Anyone else have anything similar? Especially the DoM parts, I'd like to read something else like that.
