I know. Ten chapters, barely out of the prologue and into Act 1, and it's nailing John and the horror of there suddenly being terrorism again in wizarding Britain and it's /exactly/ the kind of black comedy you get when the grimdark of Hellblazer meets the whimsy of the Potterverse and it just. Fucking. Stops.

It's the lit'ry equivalent of blue balls.
