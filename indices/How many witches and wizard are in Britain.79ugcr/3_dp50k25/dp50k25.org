There's no satisfying conclusion from canon. Even if Harry's year is smaller than the other ones due to the war, I think the average year at Hogwarts has a maximum of 60 students per year (otherwise it would need more teachers), which would put the number of Hogwarts students around 400, not 1000, which would mean there are merely 6000 wizards and witches in Britain if Hogwarts were the only school.

The economical and administratorial infrastructure we see in the series implies a much larger community however, closer to the population of a mid-sized town, or a microstate like Liechtenstein or Andorra.

For my personal headcanon, I go for something in between, around 20,000 wizards and witches. That's enough to explain the infrastructure, but few enough to justify the prevalence of Hogwarts-educated wizards and witches in Britain.
