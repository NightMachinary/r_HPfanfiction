For my headcanon, I go with 200k since we know that there are multiple schools in Britain (if Hogwarts is the best there have to be others) and fewer people make it difficult to base an economy. There are at least one hundred shops in magical London and each has to be supplied, whether with products or resources. Not every one of those 200k is fully integrated into the magical society however, especially after the last muggleborn cleansings under Voldemort. Just because you have a wand does not mean that you are forbidden to work in a bank or sell Fish and Chips. And not everyone uses Gringotts for the same reason.
