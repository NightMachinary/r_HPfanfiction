The main argumens here are:

- the education capacity angle. Hogwarts would be secondary education, and is implied to be the only institution of its kind in the UK, the alternatives are homeschooling, studying abroad or some kind of vocational training. The stated capacity is 1000 students, which might be a case of writer sucking at giving things a scale, but is actually fairly large for what it is (for comparison a typical central European gymnasium that isn't located in a metropolitan area has about half of that number). Honestly, shopkeepers and such probably don't need the sort of academic education Hogwarts offer, and the headmaster has a status comparable to high government official (minister etc)

- There's an entire government with executive and judicial branches

- There's media and professional-ish sport league as well, suggesting population large enough to sustain them

- There's no stated upper limit of how old a wizard can get (apart from "considerably higher age than muggles") which can skew the perception somewhat

My own guess would be a population in the 20-60K range with the most likely figure in the low 30Ks, or about 0,005% of UK's population (1 in 20K). This figure is roughly comparable to San Marino, for further comparison Liechtenstein and Monaco both have a bit under 40K citizens, Andorra has something like 75K etc..
