Messing around with canon clues gave me an upper bracket of 50,000 people. I believe I used the following (but this was a while ago and I may have forgotten something):

- number of students in Hogwarts

- online demographic statistics to get a rough % of 11-18 year olds in the British population

- checking out other demographic statistics with different average lifespans and extrapolating the 11-18y/o percentages to account for this

I doubled this for my own fic, on the following reasoning:

- I wanted to include some kind of wizarding agricultural economy

- I had ideas for other wizarding settlements

- I wanted to ensure that the governmental structure wasn't too top-heavy for the population size
