I'd say something north of 10,000, and even that is pushing it. Anything larger than that, and Voldemort wouldn't have been nearly as powerful, with an inner circle of - what was it? - a dozen and a half?

As for Hogwarts, something like 300 seems like a more realistic figure for the 90's, caused by war, a steadily decreasing, and mostly elderly population - not to mention the emigration in the late ~'75-'81 and '97-'98. Another 300 make up those going abroad, home-schooled children, those who aren't allowed (Lupin was a special case), can't afford going there, or those who don't get an education at all, like Merope Gaunt.

In my headcanon, the population peaked at about 40,000 some 150 years before Harry was born, but by the turn of the 20th century, it had halfed and it kept decreasing. It didn't start to recover before Voldemort's fall in 1998.

The idea of huge wizarding populations, battlefields with three-figure losses thrown around with reckless abandon, seems unappealing and very unrealistic to me. Both the order and Voldemort's inner circle seemed very small, and they were essentially the "armies" of their times. Even the second war (when the ministry was under Voldemort's control) didn't break the SoS.

I imagine other, more sparsely populated countries like Russia, Canada and the Scandinavian countries, having a larger "wizard density" though.
