You can say that again. There's certain aspects of their society that seem more fitting for a size of at least 200k, then there's Hogwarts and other interaction which point towards a size more around 5k.

I don't hate the idea of there being other less prestigious schools where the bulk of the population attend, but for a multitude of reasons that only really works in an AU... nothing in canon really reflects this (everyone seems to assume that people go to Hogwarts).

It kinda annoys me when people write that there's all these other schools, making their population as big as the Wizengamot, pop-stars and Quidditch World Cups suggest, yet don't really show people everywhere (!) who didn't attend Hogwarts and don't really care about Gryffindor, Dumbledore or Hogsmeade (should be at least 97% of the population). Also, please explain why Hermione *and* the Weasleys attend Hogwarts.
