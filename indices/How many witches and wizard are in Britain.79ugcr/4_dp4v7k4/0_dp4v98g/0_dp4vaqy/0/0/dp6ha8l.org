Which is an intriguing theory. I can think of two reaons for it;

1) Everyone was scared and depressed and didn't want to have a baby /right then/

2) A significant percentage of the wizarding world died.

I vaguely remember Molly saying that during the war everyone was actually more desperate to love and marry each other while they still could so that kinda leaves the second one.

Which would imply that if there are 1000 people at Hogwarts, and 42 in Harrys year, that at least 70% of the population either died or fled the country.

What the hell dude?
