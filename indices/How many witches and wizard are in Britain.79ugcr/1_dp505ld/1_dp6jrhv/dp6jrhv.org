Some of these are I think fairly tenuous evidence for a large population. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Book signings
#+end_quote

Doesn't really say anything about population. You get book signings for all sorts of niche areas with very limited audiences, especially in academia. All you need for a book signing is a temporary concentration of, say, 20+ people who are interested in the author/book.

#+begin_quote
  Specialty stores and brands
#+end_quote

Again, doesn't say much about the population, especially given the very different nature of production in the wizarding world. Wizards do not require large scale manufacturing, complex supply chains etc. With a few notable exceptions (books, brooms), most shops probably sell items made by the shopkeeper.

#+begin_quote
  Highly attended sporting events
#+end_quote

This can be a function of enthusiasm and ease of attendance as much as numbers. See: attendance in small town America at high school football games. The Quidditch world cup can't really be used to determine British wizarding population because it's a global event and magic made travel to Britain extremely easy. There could easily have been a substantial portion of the global population of wizards in attendance.

#+begin_quote
  A very large and inefficient government.
#+end_quote

Well, a very officious government. But I wouldn't say inefficient. We've seen throughout the books that actually the wizarding government uses a large amount of executive power which is a lot more direct/efficient (at the cost of democratic checks) than Muggle government IRL. We also don't really have any strong idea for the size of the Ministry. We know there are lots of departments, but many of the departments could easily have 1-2 people in them, like Arthur Weasley's. Even the bigger ones are likely smaller than the fandom frequently presents. For example it seems unlikely that there are more than 15-25 Aurors.
