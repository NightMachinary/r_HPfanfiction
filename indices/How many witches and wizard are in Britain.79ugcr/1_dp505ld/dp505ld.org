Evidence in favour of a smaller wizarding world mostly comes from JK Rowling:

- Hogwarts is the only British school of magic in the UK
- Only 1000 students in Hogwarts

However, the books themselves imply a larger wizarding world. Wizarding Britain is large enough to have:

- Book signings
- Specialty stores and brands
- Highly attended sporting events
- A very large and inefficient government.

And these things are simply not possible with only a few thousand people.

In the end, you have a bit of leeway. If you go off JKR's figures (ever a dangerous exercise), you get 12K to 20K people. But the books imply a larger population a larger population at points (I'd say around 100K, one fifth the population of Luxembourg and a fraction of muggle London). It's up to you.
