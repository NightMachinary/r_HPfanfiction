I had run some numbers because I was curious - oversimplified as they were probably - and the number I got in Britain was something like 53,000 wizards, assuming roughly 5 million wizards worldwide (which at the time of Harry's entering Hogwarts would be 1 in 1000 being a wizard, globally).

I think that's a decent number to maintain a somewhat complex secret world. That number isn't accounting for sentient magical creatures or squibs though, so add those in and it seems reasonable-ish to me.
