I'm literally just googling how many people work in a given field in Britain and setting up the proportion XD But these two fields are kinda exceptions, I think.

I don't think farming is a thing in the wizarding world - Hermione states that you can increase the amount of food you have if you already have some, so basically all you'd need is a loaf of bread and you could duplicate it ad infinitum provided you're skilled at transfiguration. I'm pretty sure they feed themselves through a society-wide Jesus-like multiplication of the loaves and fishes, with those who can't duplicate food buying it off of those who can.

For healthcare, all that we know exists is St. Mungo's and then Pomfrey, and honestly with a population this size I don't see a need for much else. Maybe there'd be a few private healers working for rich houses or catering to the criminal underclass, but for the most part one hospital seems good for a population capable of healing most injuries on their own.

One prison works, too, especially if guarded by eldritch horrors. One newspaper is about what you'd expect with this population (after comparing to Ithaca, NY, which apparently has roughly 54k people) plus a few niche things like the Quibbler. I'm actually kinda surprised by how well this pop is fitting, the more I look...
