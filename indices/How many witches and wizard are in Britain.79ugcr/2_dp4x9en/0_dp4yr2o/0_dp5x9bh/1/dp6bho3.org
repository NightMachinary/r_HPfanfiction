Using the Hogwarts year sizes aren't very accurate for painting the bigger picture though. While it may work for Magical Britain, other countries ought to have a fair amount more children per year, adjusted for the ratio of population sizes. We know that the Death Eaters murdered a large number of people, many of them close or at the age to have children. Outside of Europe, which may have had reduced populations due to Grindelwald too, populations may be even higher, though we don't know of the frequency of large-scale magical conflicts.
