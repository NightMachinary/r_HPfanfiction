Basically I took a guesstimate of how many wizards there could be worldwide - it had to be reasonable enough to maintain a society of some complexity but also not be noticeable to Muggles. 1 in 1000 being a wizard sounded about good to me.

In 1990, that would mean roughly 5 million wizards globally. At the same time, Britain's population (sayeth Google) was 57.25 million, and global was 5310 million. Assuming Britain's wizarding population is proportional to how much of the world population it had then it would have roughly 53,000-54,000 wizards in it. Been a while since I did proportions, might have got it wrong idk, but I like this number because of the following:

With a growth rate of 0.1% yearly (Britain in 1980), you'd get (0.1/100)*54000 = 54 kids yearly, which is 14 more than Harry's incoming Hogwarts class size (40 kids, 10 per House). As Draco was almost sent to Durmstrang, you can clearly choose to attend other schools, and some of those births would be squibs probably - so 54 kids a year or so would cover the Hogwarts class size for Harry quite nicely and sprinkle about some special cases too.

Alternately, maybe the extra 14 all just got murdered by various magical bullshit in their childhood. Strangled by gnomes or cursed into topiaries or purged by Death Eaters, idk, something. Or maybe they're Weasleys. Point is, they can be accounted for, and thus this population size covers Hogwarts near-perfectly, and Hogwarts covers this population size near-perfectly without a need for inventing other schools to pick up the slack.

I never intended this to be rigorous so there's a lot of fuzzy bits and I forgot where I stuck the paper I wrote most of this down on so this is a reconstruction. But I think it works. And yeah, feel free to use the number if you want!

EDIT: Doing more math with proportions, Wizarding Britain would have about 120 law enforcement agents - so, Aurors and Hit Wizards combined. There is no wizarding British army - or the Aurors act as it perhaps - so that's the government's sum total of combat troops basically. Counting the names of the Death Eaters on the wiki, Voldemort had 33 confirmed followers, plus however many werewolves Fenrir brought, plus the Snatchers, plus other lesser Death Eaters...his rebellion very well could have straight outnumbered the British Ministry's combat forces at its height, with this population. So at 54,000 British wizards, Voldemort's army is a genuine, massive threat to the wizarding government.
