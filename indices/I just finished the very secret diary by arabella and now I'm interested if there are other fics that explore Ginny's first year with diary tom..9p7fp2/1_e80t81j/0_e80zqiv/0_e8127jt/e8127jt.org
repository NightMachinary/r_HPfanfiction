More than the diary? She certainly has. More recent stuff? Nope, nothing since... I dunno, 2004 maybe.

Edit: here's a link to [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=profile&id=1][her Sugar Quill page.]]

Not As A Last Resort was my absolute favourite R/Hr fic during the three year summer.

The More is My Unrest is the only Draco/Ginny I've loved - sort of Draco/Ginny anyway. She co-wrote a sequel called Rising from Ashes that is very Draco/Ginny and was only available through a Yahoo! group.

Hermione, Queen of Witches was a classic back then. I still love Gwen.
