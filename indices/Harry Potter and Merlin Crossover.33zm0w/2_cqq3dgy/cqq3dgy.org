[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=harry+potter+merlin][This is not is a list of recommendations (I haven't read any of these) but it is a link to the Harry Potter/Merlin crossover fanfics on this website. I hope it works.]]

This is a shameless plug - I'm writing a fanfic that isn't a crossover with BBC's Merlin but contains a lot of the same source material and works with concepts like the Otherworld, Avalon and Morgana and Merlin. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3705335][It's called Ynys Afal: The Island of Apples and I am currently on chapter four (42000 words).]] I'd like you to check it out (of course I would, I wrote it!) but I think even though it isn't exactly what you wanted you might end up enjoying where it goes anyway.

Hope the first link was helpful - it should work even if you don't have an account there. If it doesn't I'll link the best-rated fics individually!
