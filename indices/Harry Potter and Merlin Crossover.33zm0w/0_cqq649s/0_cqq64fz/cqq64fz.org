  */Merlin/* is a television [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries][miniseries]] which originally aired in 1998 on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC][NBC]] that retells the legend of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur][King Arthur]] from the perspective of the wizard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(wizard)][Merlin]]. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Neill][Sam Neill]] stars in the title role in a story that covers not only the rise and fall of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot][Camelot]] but also the phase in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_of_Britain][legendary history]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain][Britain]] that precedes it.

  The film deviates from more traditional versions of the legend, notably by including new characters such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mab][Queen Mab]] and by keeping Merlin through the whole reign of King Arthur over Britain (whereas in older versions Merlin left earlier on in the king's reign). The film was followed by a sequel in 2006, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin%27s_Apprentice][Merlin's Apprentice]]/, which was more loosely connected with traditional [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthurian_legend][Arthurian legend]].
