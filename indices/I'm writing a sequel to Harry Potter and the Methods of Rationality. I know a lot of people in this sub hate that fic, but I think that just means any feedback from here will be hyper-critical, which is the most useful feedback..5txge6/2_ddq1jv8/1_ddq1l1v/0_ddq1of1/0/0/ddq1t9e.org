I believe the requirement is 5 posts on the forum to get access to the WIP section (this was done to stop people making new accounts just to scan that section and post it as their own). You could probably just pm an admin if you /really/ wanted to, and they'd likely give you access.

If you just want to post, just go through the sections and find stuff you're interested in. Avoid reviving old library threads with hundreds of responses, that's pretty blatant post whoring.

Everything else is open game for the most part, and people can be pretty friendly there.
