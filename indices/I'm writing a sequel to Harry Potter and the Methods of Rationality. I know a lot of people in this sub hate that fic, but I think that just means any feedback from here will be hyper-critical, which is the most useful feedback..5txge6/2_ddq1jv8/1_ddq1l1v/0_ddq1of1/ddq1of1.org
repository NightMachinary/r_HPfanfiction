Oh sorry, figured anyone on this sub would know it. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP]] is one of the few surviving HP fandom forums left, and is very well known for being critical of work.

If you post a few times you get access to the WIP section, which includes many stories posted by authors asking for help (most well know are the extra 5 or so chapters of Harry Potter & The Boy Who Lived). People will go through your fic line by line, correcting spelling, punctuation, and writing in general.
