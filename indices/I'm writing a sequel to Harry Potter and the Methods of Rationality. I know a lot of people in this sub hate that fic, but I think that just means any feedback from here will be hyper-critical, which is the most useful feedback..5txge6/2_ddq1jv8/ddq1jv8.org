Head over to DLP and submit it at the WIP section. Make sure your skin is thick there however, as not only was the original fic very contentious (The author endangered the entire fandom with his bullshit, so that's expected), but the writing was...decent at best.

If you /really/ want critical responses that will tear your writing to shreds, DLP is the place to go.
