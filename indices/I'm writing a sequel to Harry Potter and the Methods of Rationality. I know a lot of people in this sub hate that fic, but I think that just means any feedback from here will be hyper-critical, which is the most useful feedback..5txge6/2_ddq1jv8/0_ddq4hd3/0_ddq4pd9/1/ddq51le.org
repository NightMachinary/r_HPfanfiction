Well, certainly on mainstream websites like FF or AO3 or Wattpad or the small decently known ones like Ashwinder that are run off a server they can hunt down and shut down. I suppose, then, that Warner Bros. certainly has the resources for it. The, err, most likely scenario would be that fic being made a public example of - the authors real name was there, after all. I would think that there are too many HPFF fans to ruin the thing completely and, even if JK got it in her head to do so, I'm fairly certain that would remove a large part of the community from her dominion - even if only during the intermittent period where a site was set up via owl post and enchanted paper spelled for certain individuals to read.
