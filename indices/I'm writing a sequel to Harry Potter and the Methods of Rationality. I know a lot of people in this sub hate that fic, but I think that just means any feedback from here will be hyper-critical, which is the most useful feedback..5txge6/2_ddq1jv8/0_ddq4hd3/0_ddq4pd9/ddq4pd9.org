The author for a time would ask for donations to a non profit in order to post more chapters/faster. He also happened to work at this non profit. In effect, he was asking for direct money in order to release his fanfiction.

The HP fanfiction world only exists at the pleasure of JKR and companies like Warner Bros that own certain rights to it. Sure it would exist if the owners of the source material tried to crack down, but certainly not as it does now. It would be far smaller and not on popular websites like FFN.

If rights holders got wind of someone actively charging people to write his fanfiction, that he was in effect seeking a profit, they could very well come down hard upon the whole fandom.

JKR has specifically said she approves of fanfiction as long as it's not for profit for example, if she got pissed about that sort of thing, she could personally destroy the mainstream HPFF community.

If you think I'm being over dramatic. You can remember Anne Mccaffrey, who single handedly kept FF of her works off mainstream sites like FF.net for /years/, and have only allowed it recently. You think JKR or some head at Warner Bros couldn't do that?
