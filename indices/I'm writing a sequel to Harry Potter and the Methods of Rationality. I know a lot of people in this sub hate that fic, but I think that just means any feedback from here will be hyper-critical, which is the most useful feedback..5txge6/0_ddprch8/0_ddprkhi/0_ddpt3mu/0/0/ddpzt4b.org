You have no other stories, you're continuing a fic I DESPISE, and of the many multiverse fics I've read, there's three that were good. So I'm not going to look at it because the numbers are against you. Now, had you announced a multiverse fic that didn't continue a fic that annoyed me to no ends, then I might've checked it out depending on various elements within.

Edit: Also, I stopped reading it somewhere like chapter fifty? Which means to know what's going on in your story, i'd have to reread a story I never finished and HATED.
