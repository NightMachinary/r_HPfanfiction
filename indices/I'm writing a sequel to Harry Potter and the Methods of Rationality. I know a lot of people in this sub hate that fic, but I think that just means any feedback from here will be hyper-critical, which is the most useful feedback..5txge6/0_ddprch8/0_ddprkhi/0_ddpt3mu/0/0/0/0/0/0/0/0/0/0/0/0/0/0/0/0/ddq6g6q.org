Mature of you.

Honest advice; why does it have to be a sequel? If you want to improve on HPMOR why don't you just do a rewrite or take inspiration from it?

Edit: to answer your edit on purple prose, your entire third paragraph. You know, Harry's soul on fire, the core of his being, the warmth emulating from Hermione's cheek blah blah blah. And yet here you go again, I gave you criticism and you defensively denied it and demanded precise evidence.
