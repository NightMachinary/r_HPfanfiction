Criticism is not trolling. Criticising the concept of something without having read it isn't great, but that's what you get when you ask a bunch of Internet strangers. I haven't watched or read 50 shades of grey or Mein Kampf but I know enough about them to know that I am not going to be interested in their concepts and themes.

More to the point, the criticism I gave you was directly from your writing, and yet you still said "no but" and completely disregarded it, continuing to throw personal insults. Learning to take feedback is really important if you want to develop your writing, especially if you have specifically requested harsh critique.
