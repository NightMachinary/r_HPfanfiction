If you're not going to look at it then why the hell are you here in the first place? Your opinion is literally worthless.

EDIT:

I mean, downvote if you want but his opinion is /literally/ worthless. This thread is *specifically* looking for feedback on a fic and he's just telling me why he's refusing to read the fic.

"/Please don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion./"

That's what the official reddiquette guide has to say on the issue. [[/u/viol8er][u/viol8er]] is unequivocally in the wrong here, and a bunch of bitches upvoting his posts and downvoting mine doesn't magically make him right.
