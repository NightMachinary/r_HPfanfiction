I don't know how many times I have to repeat to you that you yourself specifically sought out people who don't like HPMOR and asked for hyper critical feedback, because you believe it to be the most useful. But instead of finding it useful and taking it on board, even if you disagree, you have argued back, flung childish insults, insisted that your work is technically perfect, and expected everyone to have read all 122 chapters of HPMOR even if they didn't like it. What on earth were you expecting from people?
