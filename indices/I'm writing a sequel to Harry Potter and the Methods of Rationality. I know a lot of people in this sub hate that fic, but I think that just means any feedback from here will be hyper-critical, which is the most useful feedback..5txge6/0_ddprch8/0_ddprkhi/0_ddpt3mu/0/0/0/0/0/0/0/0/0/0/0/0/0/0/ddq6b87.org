You talked about how much you liked HPMOR and the author.

Look, what is the point of all this? I'm sorry that your feelings were hurt when people said they didn't like the idea of your fic and I'm sorry that people reacted negatively to the temper tantrum that you then threw (as it happens, I've been careful to criticise your behaviour in the thread and said nothing about you as a person, it's a shame you couldn't do the same for me and others here). For the record, I glanced over your work and saw loads of purple prose, awkward dialogue with over-use of names, soppy shipping and above all, the very thing that people were trying to point out to you - the concept itself is not going to appeal to people here. You already accept that it's not a popular fix in this community, so why would we want to read this? It's completely ok to hear the concept of something and say "doesn't sound like something I would enjoy and here's why". Perhaps you could have persuaded some of us to give it a shot, but why should we after the way you have responded?
