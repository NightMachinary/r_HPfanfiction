My interpretation of purple prose is when it's so melodramatic and flowery that it breaks my immersion and makes me roll my eyes, which that paragraph absolutely did. Your explanation of it means nothing to me because I couldn't get past the first few chapters of HPMOR specifically because of that sort if ridiculous shit. If you actively seeking out people who hate HPMOR that's what the reaction will be.
