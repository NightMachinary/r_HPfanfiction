It's a "response" of sorts to HPMOR, in the Menippean sense. It wouldn't work as anything other than a sequel.

And yeah, that was kinda deliberate. Your usage disagrees with TV Tropes' definition (using descriptive words and talking about emotions doesn't automatically make something "purple prose"), but if that's what you call "purple prose" then chapter 122 of HPMOR ends with a bit of it.

Also, near the end of HPMOR, Voldemort murdered Hermione and because of complicated reasons was forced to bring her back to life and he also imbued her with the essence of a troll and of a unicorn and then made a horcrux for her. Her "aura" is a legitimate physical thing resulting from being imbued with the essence of a unicorn, it's not flowery description.
