  That won't work well. Those who like HPMoR won't like the changes, and those who don't like it will never read it.

Ah, but the first three chapters are designed to retain the same feeling as HPMOR (in the sense of the prose, not the narrative), and the narrative contains subtle jabs at HPMOR.

If you're familiar with HPMOR, this chapter is only 11 pages long, why not give it a look? If nothing else, you'll be able to have something specific to yell at me about.
