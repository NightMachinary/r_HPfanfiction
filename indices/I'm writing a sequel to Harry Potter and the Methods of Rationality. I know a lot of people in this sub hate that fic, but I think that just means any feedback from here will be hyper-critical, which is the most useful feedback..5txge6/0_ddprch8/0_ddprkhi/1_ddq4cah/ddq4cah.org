  It's incredibly different.

That won't work well. Those who like HPMoR won't like the changes, and those who don't like it will never read it.

I'd love to read a rationality-based fanfic, but without the arrogance, pretentiousness, mind-bending irrelevant plot points, philosophical contortions, and the solve-all-the-world's-problems logical constructs.

Basically, a completely different story.

I laud the author for persevering and giving it his best effort. On the other hand, so did Hitler.
