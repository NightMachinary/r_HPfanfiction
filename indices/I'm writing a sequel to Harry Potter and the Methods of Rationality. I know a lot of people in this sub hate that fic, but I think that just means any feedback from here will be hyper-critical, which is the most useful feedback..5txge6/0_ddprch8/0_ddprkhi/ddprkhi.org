It's incredibly different. A spoiler: I negated the entirety of the last 20 or so chapters because I was so incredibly disappointed with the ending, and this is going to turn into a Massively Multiplayer Crossover fic where we end up traipsing through the multiverse and going to different "worlds" from other books and videogames and such.

Also, people love to hate things. It's only about 11 pages long, why not take a look and explain to me why it's terrible? I /really/ want this thing torn to shreds.

Also also, I /love/ HPMOR and I think Eliezer Yudkowsky is a brilliant man who has many correct thoughts, but I still think the story has some major flaws, and that Yudkowsky is noticeably arrogant, and I have problems with certain aspects of his personal philosophy, and this fic will reflect that.
