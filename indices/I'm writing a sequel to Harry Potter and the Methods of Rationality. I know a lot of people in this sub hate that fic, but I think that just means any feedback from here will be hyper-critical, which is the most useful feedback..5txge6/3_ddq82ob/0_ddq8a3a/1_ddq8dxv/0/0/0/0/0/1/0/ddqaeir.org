You are just embarrassing yourself. Stop. Yet again you are being patronising and condescending. I didn't ask for your critique in my work, and I don't need you to explain simple concepts to me. It is arrogant to say that your writing is technically perfect. It just is. Sorry. By saying that you are saying that there is no chance that there could be a technical mistake. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and that's ok. When you ask for feedback, you should be prepared for the possibility of there being mistakes. I don't pretend my work is perfect, because I know it can be improved on and that's what I try to do. When people have offered criticisms, like purple prose, over use of italics, or ham fisted explanations of "complex" things, you have repeatedly said "where? Quote me. Show proof." No, fuck you. Any criticism is a favour, even if you think it's worthless, even if you think it's a waste of time, even if you think they have misunderstood or just need to read a bit more or don't get it because they haven't read 122 chapters of pure shit. Just say thank you. It's not hard. I'm sorry they didn't wrap it up in sunshine and rainbows but people here have been trying to help, and you've thrown it all back in their faces. When someone offers you feedback you should be grateful, not aggressively demand more.
