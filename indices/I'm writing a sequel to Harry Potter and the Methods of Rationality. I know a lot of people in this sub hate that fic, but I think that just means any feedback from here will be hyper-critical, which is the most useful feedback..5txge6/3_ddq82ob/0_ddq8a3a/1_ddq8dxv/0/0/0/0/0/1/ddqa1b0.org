  It is arrogant to say that your writing is technically perfect. It is highly unlikely that this is the case unless you have been professionally edited.
#+end_quote

It's really not that difficult. I read through /The Moon and the Sea/ and a bit of /The Colour of Everything./ Whether you're aware of the technical name for "the pattern" or not, your writing still conforms to "the pattern." Action, reaction. Mixes between dialogue tags and action beats. Saying "it's technically perfect" doesn't mean the words themselves are perfect, just that they perfectly conform to "the pattern."

#+begin_quote
  It is immature and the sign of an inexperienced writer to argue when people give you feedback, even if you disagree.
#+end_quote

We've had this argument several times. When someone says "I'm not going to bother looking at your work, but that's not going to stop me from explaining to you why it probably sucks," that might /technically/ be a form of feedback, but it /certainly/ isn't worthy of the word "critique."

#+begin_quote
  It is unreasonable to say that you want line by line deconstruction of your fic when you have not accepted any criticism given to you.
#+end_quote

I did not ask for that here. Someone else told me Dark Lord Potter would give me a line by line deconstruction, and I enthusiastically expressed the fact that a line by line deconstruction was something I was interested in. Again, /I did not ask for that here on this thread, I did not expect anything of the sort from anyone here and I did not express any sentiment along those lines and for you to repeatedly assert that I did so is disingenuous./

#+begin_quote
  The one example I can see of you accepting critique, you give an excuse about being tired and it not being a final draft...
#+end_quote

That wasn't an excuse, it was an explanation. In retrospect, I should've left the chapter as it was until I could finish it, but I added more than 500 words in that session and I wasn't sure at that point what was published and what wasn't and I erred on the side of making sure the plot was clear.

#+begin_quote
  ... then say obviously that nonsense won't be in the final draft. This is rude and unreasonable.
#+end_quote

Rude? You're absurd.

#+begin_quote
  You asked for a line by line deconstruction...
#+end_quote

Haha, right, /that/ again.

#+begin_quote
  It is completely rude to call people stupid when you are also asking them to put a lot of time and effort into helping you.
#+end_quote

Quote me, liar. Someone specifically took the time to tell me that my story probably sucked, and further clarified that they had not even looked at my story before arriving at this conclusion. That is worthless feedback, and a waste of time for everyone involved. EDIT: I told them exactly that, and did not call anyone "stupid."

#+begin_quote
  It is childish to come up with cringey little nicknames, to accuse people of psychological abuse, and to accuse people of lying or being trolls when you disagree with their opinion.
#+end_quote

I call you a gaslighter and a liar and a troll because you /consistently/ misquote me and misconstrue my words. Want proof? See above.

#+begin_quote
  It is bizarre and unreasonable to expect people who hate a work to have read all 122 chapters...
#+end_quote

Where do you see any statement which remotely resembles what you've said?

#+begin_quote
  I am sorry you didn't get all the adoration and praise you so clearly wanted.
#+end_quote

Are we in the same universe, observing the same conversation?
