OK. Here is me calling you out on your specific behaviour in the thread:

It is arrogant to say that your writing is technically perfect. It is highly unlikely that this is the case unless you have been professionally edited.

It is immature and the sign of an inexperienced writer to argue when people give you feedback, even if you disagree. This is something I myself have struggled with in the past (some people here will remember my Great Veritaserum Debate) but it's something that you must learn and stick with even when it hurts, especially if you have requested harsh critique.

It is unreasonable to say that you want line by line deconstruction of your fic when you have not accepted any criticism given to you. You can't say that you want it torn to shreds and then aggressively demand evidence/deny criticism given to you.

The one example I can see of you accepting critique, you give an excuse about being tired and it not being a final draft, then say obviously that nonsense won't be in the final draft. This is rude and unreasonable. We don't know that it is a draft, you have published it. You asked for a line by line deconstruction, we don't want to hear all your excuses and condescending "well OBVIOUSLY" responses. Just say thank you for the feedback and make the changes or move on.

It is completely rude to call people stupid when you are also asking them to put a lot of time and effort into helping you. It is childish to come up with cringey little nicknames, to accuse people of psychological abuse, and to accuse people of lying or being trolls when you disagree with their opinion.

It is bizarre and unreasonable to expect people who hate a work to have read all 122 chapters and then read a sequel, even if you do insist it's different (which I saw no evidence of).

Edit: ooh, almost forgot, it is completely fucking HILARIOUS that you got into an argument about who was the oldest. I shouldn't have to explain why that is childish.

I am sorry you didn't get all the adoration and praise you so clearly wanted. Best of luck with your story, hopefully the feedback you get from people on DLP will be constructive to you.
