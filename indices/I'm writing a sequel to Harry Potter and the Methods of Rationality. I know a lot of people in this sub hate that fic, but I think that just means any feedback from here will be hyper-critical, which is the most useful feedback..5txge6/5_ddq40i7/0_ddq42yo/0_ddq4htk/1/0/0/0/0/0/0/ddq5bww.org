Hmm... I don't know about that. It doesn't really make sense for you to come back a full hour later to comment. Giving you the benefit of the doubt, even though the view counter hasn't lagged in my own personal experience, your "criticism" sounds a lot like cold-reading, like you made a bunch of assumptions about what the fic would be like based on your opinions of HPMOR.
