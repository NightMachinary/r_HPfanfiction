I'm not one of those who hates HPMOR with every fibre of my being, probably cause I read it early on, and reread parts as well. What I enjoyed most about it was the humour, and it is too early to tell whether or not your fic will draw me in with humour.

The good part: You've got your eye on the endgame, unlike Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence.

The bad: The final part is a bit chaotic, and Voldemort destroying reality? Couldn't help but roll my eyes. This is a common problem with looping back, so I hope the rest of your fic leads up to it in a coherent and believable manner.

Most importantly, I'd love a rational fic, not a rationalist fic. I'm sure a lot of others here would agree. If you've read the Naruto fanfic The Waves Arisen, that is the upper limit of exposition that I can tolerate.
