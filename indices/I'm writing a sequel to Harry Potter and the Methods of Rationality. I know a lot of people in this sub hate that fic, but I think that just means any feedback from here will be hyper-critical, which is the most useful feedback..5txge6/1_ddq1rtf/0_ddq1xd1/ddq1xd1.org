On the contrary. If I were an editor and HPMOR arrived on my desk, the first thing I would do would be to cross out literally every monologue on the minutia of scientific concepts. If they were deemed /absolutely necessary/, I would require them to be relegated to a footnotes section. Harry already knows about the Robber's Cave experiment and the Milgram experiment, it's bad literary form for him to think to himself about things he's already aware of. That's just as bad as two characters having a conversation about information they both already know about.

EDIT:

I understand why he did it that way, because part of the purpose of the story was to "teach the readers about the methods of rationality." I can assure you, I have no such goals.
