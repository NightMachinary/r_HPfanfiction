Do... do you even know the definitions of the word? Do you even know proper prescriptive, or even descriptive grammar? Do you even english? You can't just arbitrarily use a word "to make an impact" and subsequently ignore its definition.

You are not "racist" against women, you are sexist.

You are not racist againt gays, you are homophobist.

You are not racist against aged people, you are ageist.

You are not racist against disabilities, you are ableist.

You are not racist against religion, you are religiously intolerant.

Prejudice would actually encompass everything, racism is specific to an ethnic prejudice.

"Did I not explain my reasoning for my slightly cockeyed use of the word"

That's putting it mildly for blatantly wrong use of a word. You did explain your reasoning. I laughed a lot.
