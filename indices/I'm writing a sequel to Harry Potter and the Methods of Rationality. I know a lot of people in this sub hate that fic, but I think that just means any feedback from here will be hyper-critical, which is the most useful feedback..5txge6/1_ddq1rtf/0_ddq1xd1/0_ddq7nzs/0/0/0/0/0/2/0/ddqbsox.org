Is this THAT fucking difficult to understand?

Racism is prejudice/discrimination against other races.

Sexism is prejudice/discrimination against the opposite sex.

Homophobia is prejudice/discrimination against gays.

Ageism is prejudice/discrimination against the elderly.

Ableism is prejudice/discrimination against the disabled.

No one bats an eye if you ask someone "isn't that kind of sexist" because not all forms of prejudice are considered equally bad in society. This usage is not complicated, and I'm pretty sure you people are being purposefully dense.
