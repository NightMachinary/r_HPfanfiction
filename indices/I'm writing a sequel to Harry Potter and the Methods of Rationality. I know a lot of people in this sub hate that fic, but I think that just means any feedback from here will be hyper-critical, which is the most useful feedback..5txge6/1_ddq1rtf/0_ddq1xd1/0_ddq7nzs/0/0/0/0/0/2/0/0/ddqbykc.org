WOW you can repeat what I said! that's so amazing! I already knew that, as it's exactly what I said on the parent comment of yours. You're not making your case any better.

I'd ask someone "isn't that kind of sexist" if it pertained to a gender issue. Also, I'm not the one who used racist in the wrong context and pretended it was alright and ok and a synonym of the word prejudice. Which is not, by the way. So really, the question about who is dense, here, is really open.
