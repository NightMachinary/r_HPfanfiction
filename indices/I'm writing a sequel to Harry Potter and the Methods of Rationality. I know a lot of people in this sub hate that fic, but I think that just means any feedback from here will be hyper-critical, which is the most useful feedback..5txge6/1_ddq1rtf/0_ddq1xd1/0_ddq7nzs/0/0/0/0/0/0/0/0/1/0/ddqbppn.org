And you're wrong. You can't just disregard a dictionnary's meaning of a word because you feel like it.

"Oh, I wanted to make a strong effect so I used a blatantly wrong word in the wrong context and attempt at justifying it through half-assed reasoning that does not make sense no matter which end you take it."

Well it did have a strong effect, I'll grant you that. I mean, unless you consider MoR to be a race. If that's the case you have much bigger issues.
