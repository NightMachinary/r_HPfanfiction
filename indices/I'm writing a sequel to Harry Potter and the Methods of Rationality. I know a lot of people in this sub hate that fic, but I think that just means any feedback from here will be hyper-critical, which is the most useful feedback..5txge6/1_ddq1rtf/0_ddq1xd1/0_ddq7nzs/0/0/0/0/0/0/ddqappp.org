It's not though. The word you are looking for is prejudice. Race is a specific social construct based on the ethnicity and nationality, usually involving the colour of skin or other physical features that signal what area of the world you're from. Women aren't a separate race. Guys aren't a separate race. I can't believe I am saying this but HPMOR isn't a race.

I guess your writing isn't technically perfect after all.
