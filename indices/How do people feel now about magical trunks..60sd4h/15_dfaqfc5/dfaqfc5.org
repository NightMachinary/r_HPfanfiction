I never have read anything that ever used it in an interesting way...and I hate how often they get used. They also have an ungodly amount of time spent describing it.

In fact the only time I've ever seen one of those done well in anything is the Sapient Pearwood Luggage from Discworld.

I haven't seen or read Fantastic Beasts, but knowing he had a zoo/lab doesn't bother me. It even makes sense for an exploring character whom presumably is moving a lot. A school kid it doesn't.
