I think you're closer, but not quite there.

I think people don't live in trunks simply because tents are a thing. If you look at what is happening at a broader level, a person living in a trunk is a person living in a trunk, which isn't something you would do. People in the wizarding world wouldn't really care that the trunk has a fully furnished apartment in it, it's still a trunk and why use a trunk when you have a perfectly good tent.

In a world where belief and symbols mean a great deal to magic, the purpose of objects themselves would mean a great deal to the people living in it. Trunks are for storing objects, tents are for a place to stay while away from home, and a house is where you make a home. Anything less than that would seem weird and unusual, no matter how 'functional' it would be.
