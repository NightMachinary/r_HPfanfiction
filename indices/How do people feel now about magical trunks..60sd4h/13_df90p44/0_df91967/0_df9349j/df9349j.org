I searched "Trunk" out, yes that I feel is the perfect way to handle a trunk, it's a storage multitool/mobile command center but nothing more, it's not a home or place to sleep. When you need it it becomes a desk, it becomes a nice wardrobe to hold your clothing, it has a small cooking/storage station for your potions, it has a small magically expanded bookshelf, shit like that I like
