I never hated the idea of a magical trunk with a mansion or other such large location within because expanded trunks were cannon, and there was NEVER a "limit" on it.

So all Fantastic Beasts did was confirm that such a thing is reasonable and possible within the context of the magical world.

That said, they are rarely used all that well in fan fiction and that may be the issue.
