I'm fine with it as long as it's not some weird ass training chest where he climbs down stairs and has a kitchen and a bedroom and a training room. That's not how it works. Newt was able to do that because he was a fucking prodigy at charms. You can't just find a chest like that in a random store for a hundred galleons or whatever the fuck amount of money it is.
