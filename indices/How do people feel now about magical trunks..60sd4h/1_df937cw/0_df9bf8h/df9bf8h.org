C is probably my worst peeve ever. A and B I can forgive, because at least the author is trying to shoehorn it somewhere in his story.

C is just blatant self-insert and wish-fulfillment. Author gave MC a trunk because he find it really cool, but it serves no purpose to the plot at all... why bother then?
