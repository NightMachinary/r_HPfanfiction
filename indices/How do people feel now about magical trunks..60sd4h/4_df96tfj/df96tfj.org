I'm fine with them, but only if there's a good explanation for why more people don't make use of them.

Maybe there are a limited number of magical trunks in circulation, or maybe they're extremely expensive. Maybe they're regulated - after all, if the trunk breaks and dumps the mansion that was once inside back out into real space, that could endanger the statue of secrecy. Or maybe living in a trunk is just seen as tacky. But if magical trunks are depicted as better than traditional housing and storage, with no downsides...

And don't get me started on time dilating magical trunks.
