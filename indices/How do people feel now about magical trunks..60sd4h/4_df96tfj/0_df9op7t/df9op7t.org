  I'm fine with them, but only if there's a good explanation for why more people don't make use of them.

Does “Newt was really darn good at charms so his chest is pimped out but don't expect such quality from generic store-bought stuff” count as a good explanation?

Because as far as I know it was made fairly clear that Newt Scamander really is quite good at charms and charmed his own “trunk”, so it being all that great doesn't mean every other trunk will be just as good.

Though, obviously, some fanfics do have things of this kind that are just nonsense.
