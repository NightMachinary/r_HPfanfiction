They're oddly annoying in fanfics still, maybe it's just that they're treated like a revolutionary idea when wizards are always making use of their bigger on the inside technology, such as their magical tent, Hermione's bag the ford anglia's car boot and other ministry cars. I wouldn't be surprised if much of the wizarding world hides in small spaces.

The really annoying plot device that is regrettably canon (which I don't mind so much in canon) is the room of requirement, the room that gives you whatever you want.
