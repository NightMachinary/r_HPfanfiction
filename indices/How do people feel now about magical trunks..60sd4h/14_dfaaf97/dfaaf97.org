I don't have a problem with them, because honestly it fits into the world even before fantastic beasts. If you can enchant/charm a tent to hold the eight people they brought to the world cup, and it might not be top-of-the-line, but it might be, since it was lent to them by Perkins who was an employee in the Misuse of Muggle artefacts office.\\
Though just because something is in Canon doesn't mean I like it, but I do like magical trunks, I would just have them be expensive (Which would make sense why everyone doesn't have one).
