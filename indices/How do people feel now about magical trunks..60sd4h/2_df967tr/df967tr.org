I think that live-in trunks get a bad name not because of what they do but because of how the fic writers use them. The way they use them tends to be about showing off how "independent" and clever and practical their protagonist is; how bumbling the antagonists (such as the Manipulative!Dumbledore) are, losing track of him like that; and they end up isolating their protagonist from other characters, so that he could "train", rather than actually do anything interesting.

It is often the case that once the protagonist finally emerges from his trunk, powerful and independent, the story cuts off abruptly, since the protagonist then has no clue what to do with all that power and independence.

My favorite use of live-in trunks is linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes), which is a spoof of this concept, because Harrymort is, in fact, rather paranoid and misanthropic; and his trunk keeps getting knocked over, spoiling the potions he's trying to brew inside.
