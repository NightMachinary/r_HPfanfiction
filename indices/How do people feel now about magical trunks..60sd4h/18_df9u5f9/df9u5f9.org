From a world building perspective I consider a nice kludge to better understand the economics of the world. The current exchange seems totally borked, so its hard to make sense of some things. But maybe urban dwellers can purchase tiny little flats and really make them nice with magic trunks for storage, not to mention just expanded rooms.

From a fanfic thing, its a good way to give the character some much needed privacy and a place to get things done. I bet nearly every canon rehash has to abuse one of: Room of Requirement; Chamber of Secrets; or a magical trunk. You just gotta have a dojo somewhere!
