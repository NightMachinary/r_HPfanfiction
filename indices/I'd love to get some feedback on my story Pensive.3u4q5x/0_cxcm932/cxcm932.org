Let's get you out of some bad habits.

Here's a good article on how to punctuate your dialogue: [[http://www.be-a-better-writer.com/punctuate-dialogue.html]]

When the character performs an action instead of a dialogue tag, you want a period.

Incorrect

#+begin_quote
  "We brought you *something" Remus* grinned.
#+end_quote

Correct

#+begin_quote
  "We brought you *something." Remus* grinned.
#+end_quote

When the character has a dialogue tag, you want to have a comma before the dialogue quote.

Incorrect

#+begin_quote
  "It's called *Pop" Remus* explained
#+end_quote

Correct

#+begin_quote
  "It's called *Pop," Remus* explained
#+end_quote

If you have a dialogue tag in between two quotes, then you want a comma before the first quote and a comma *before* the second quote.

Incorrect

#+begin_quote
  *"Yes" he whispered*, patting his pocket with *triumph "but* wipe that smirk off your face, or they're going to get suspicious."
#+end_quote

Correct

#+begin_quote
  *"Yes," he* whispered, patting his pocket with *triumph, "but* wipe that smirk off your face, or they're going to get suspicious."
#+end_quote

Just keep writing. The more you write, the more you learn.
