I like it, good, sensible idea for a prank and good pacing in the story.

Two (small) issues:\\
/The carbonation got everywhere, shooting up to the ceiling, making sure to splash across the window's and dowsing their trunks as well./\\
Not sure how carbonation can make sure to splash anywhere, unless this is sentient magic soda?

/not having been saved so dripping as much as them,/\\
That doesn't make sense. Maybe you should cut this massive sentence into multiple onces to clean it up a bit.
