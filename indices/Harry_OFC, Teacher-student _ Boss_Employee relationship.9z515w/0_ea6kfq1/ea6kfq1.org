Harry and my OC are never going to get together but that upset a lot of people and I often receive PMs telling me they have good chemistry. She starts in linkffn(The Aurors) being very niave but eager, and by the sequel linkffn(Hollow Ash) she's more mature and resilient, but still looks to Harry as a mentor.
