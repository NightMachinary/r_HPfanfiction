#+begin_quote
  Secrets have surrounded Miranda her whole life. Haunted her even, and every single one of them followed her through time from 1944. Harry Potter is absolutely the best thing to ever happen to her, and most definitely the worst. Because her secrets are bound to destroy them both. After all, the boy she loves is destined to kill her twin brother, Tom Riddle. Harry/OC Rewrite

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, & Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Eventual Dark Harry/OC
