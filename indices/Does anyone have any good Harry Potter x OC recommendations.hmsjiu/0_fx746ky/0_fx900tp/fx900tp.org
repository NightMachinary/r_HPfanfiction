Grow Young With Me is an excellent recommendation, but you can't just leave it to the bot! It has a really really misleading summary, after all. People should just forget about the summary and read chapter 1 to decide if they like Abby. If you like Abby, you'll like the story.

More useful summary: Harry is widowed and raising his three children alone, but struggling to cope after losing the love of his life. A quirky, fun-loving Muggle waitress takes it on herself to draw him out of his shell, and he starts to heal and let himself love again - but there are more barriers between them than she knows.
