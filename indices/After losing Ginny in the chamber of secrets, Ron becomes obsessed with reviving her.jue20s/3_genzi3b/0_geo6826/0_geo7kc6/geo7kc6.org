Well Ron using a Black Ring to resurrect Ginny is actually original, afaik. The actual idea of "Harry Potter, but with Black Lanterns" is in a few fics, like "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8187641/1/Death-s-Knight][Death's Knight]]" which, which I remember as being pretty good, it was never completed, and then it was taken over by another author, who [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11648412/1/Death-s-Knight-Revisited][also didn't finish it.]] There's also "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5273484/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blackest-Night][Harry Potter and The Blackest Night]]" which I read so long ago that I know basically nothing about it, other than the resurrection stone was a Black Lantern Ring.
