That is definetly an interesting prompt, though I think that Hufflepuffs being seen as "the useless" house mostly stemms from the fanbase not canon. (Additionally the song is brilliant)

Of course we see Draco complain in the first book but his predjudice obviously comes from his parents. Cedric, I think is one of the most fleshed-out Hufflepuffs we have and he was said to be very popular even before he became the Hogwarts champion. Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchly, Hannah Abbot and Susan Bones were all in the DA. Overall in Harry's environment, the people who stand out as "Losers" are Luna amd Neville, neither of which are Hufflepuff
