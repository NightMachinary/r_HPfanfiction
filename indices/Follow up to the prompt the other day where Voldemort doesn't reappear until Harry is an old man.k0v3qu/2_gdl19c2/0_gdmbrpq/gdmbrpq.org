He's still known as the-boy-who-lived but with no Voldemort appearing from the time he was a one year old until he is an old man, that, and being the last apprentice of Albus Dumbledore are the only things he's known for because there wasn't any opportunity for heroics during his Hogwarts years.

I imagined a Harry who lived this kind of life to really want to be "just Harry" so he doesn't go into politics and chooses to be a Transfiguration teacher. I don't think the papers would demonize him; where did that come from?
