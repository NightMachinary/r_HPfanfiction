Well, JKR is really fond of the "lucky hero" trope.

Grindelwald in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), qualifies to a certain degree, although it's debatable whether he is "being murderous crazy" or not. But as the title says, he is "really trying" not to be one.
