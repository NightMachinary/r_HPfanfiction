  The idea that Harry and friends can fight death eaters in a 1v2 odds fight and come out with like no injuries really irritates me because these are the people everyone is terrified of.

It was less 'fighting' more 'running away like hell was after them, with occasional attacks back' and even then, there's a couple of points

1. The DEs were after the prophecy orb, as long as they didn't know who had it they had to be careful about which spells they used to try to avoid breaking it so that took some of their arsenal away, mainly AoE or break everything in their path type ones
2. They might also have wanted to try living hostages at one point, I know the film had that occur just before the Order showed, don't recall in the book
3. Even when the Ministry Six as some call them did knock a DE down, it rarely did anything worth while as others would get them back up PDQ
4. Up to the point of the Order showing up, there were at least 3-4 moderate to major injuries sustained by the kids - broken node for Nevil, Ron being mauled by the cognivores (brains), broken ankle for Luna or Ginny and slashed open shoulder to hip for Hermione that I recall
5. It probably took the DEs a minute to sort themselves out after having several shelves of prophecies dropped on them by the kids, the shock from the spell used to bring them down and the effect of any protections on the orbs

That's not saying that the group weren't damned lucky, but there were other factors at play, including potentially over confidence on the DEs part, since they likely weren't expecting teens to lob spells around that likely were higher level, especially if their own kids downplayed the sextet's abilities initially.
