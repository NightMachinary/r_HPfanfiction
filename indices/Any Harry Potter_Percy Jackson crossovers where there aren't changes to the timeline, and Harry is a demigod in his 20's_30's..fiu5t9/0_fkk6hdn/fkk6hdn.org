Honestly I'd love this, but I've spent hours searching for something exactly like this and I've come to find very minimal results.

There are two massive problems however with this

1) Demigods dont live for long, this is cannon especially as they cant use technology and to work you need to use technology (high paying jobs) so... rip. Also they are dyslexic and have ADHD which limits them, which again will limit their life span. After CHB there isnt much to do.

2) This ties in with one, it depends on who is Harry's godly parent, if one of the big three than Harry should not be even alive with the scent he has. If it's not one of the big three, which is very rare than Harry will just be someone who knows about demigods.

Again, I love this idea but i really cannot find any, and those that i Hve found are bad on those two reasons.

Dissapointing since this could be amazing!
