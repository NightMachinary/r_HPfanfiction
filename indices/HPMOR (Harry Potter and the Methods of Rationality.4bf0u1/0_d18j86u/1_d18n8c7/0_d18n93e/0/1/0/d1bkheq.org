Yes, that's an opinion.

Picture a restaurant. Two people sit down. One order a nice medium rare steak. The other orders a pile of shit. They may enjoy their meals equally, insist its the best thing ever, but the fact remains one of them is eating shit.

That's basically MoR, Twilight and Fifty Shades :p
