Just so you know HPMOR has [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/][its own subreddit]].

HPMOR is one of the most intricately plotted fanfictions out there. There are foreshadows and references you won't learn the signficance of until much later on, which gives the story a lot of re-readability (you can learn something new everytime you read it).

It's not everyone's cup of tea. Harry's initial character is a turn-off to some (who may abandon the series before he actually starts growing as a person), the rationality rants may seem pedantic to others (fair), and it's not a creative writing darling (fine by me), but there are few other fanficitions which approach it in plotting, character conflict and growth, and introspection.
