This is my fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me][You'll be the Death of Me]]

It's Neville/OC the OC being Draco's twin sister. Still a WIP over 600,000 words later and I can say Draco's twin is still not at the point where she's given up her racist ideals. It's a question to her now, so there is progress, but I agree with you it shouldn't be an over night thing and she isn't a well adjusted individual. Spoiled and exceptionally flawed. Also, excuse the first few chapters before I got a decent beta.
