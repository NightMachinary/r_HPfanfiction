So I'm guessing you are NOT a fan of fics were Hermione decides that books can be wrong after all, mere moments after meeting Harry for the first time?

I totally agree though, a childhood being raised in one way isn't going to be overpowered by a conversation or two with people who believe differently. Or even a few years of school, especially when surrounded in that school by people who still support the original frame of thought.

Not many (any) fics I've seen that know how to handle stuff like that though. It's pretty much Harry and Girl meet, one of them instantly jumps boat onto the others philosophy. Usually the girl going light, but at times it becomes a pureblood redemption fic instead, with Harry realizing the purebloods had it right all along.
