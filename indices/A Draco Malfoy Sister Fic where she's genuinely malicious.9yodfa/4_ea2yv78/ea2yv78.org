Being born into a corrupt or abusive family does not make you doomed to be the same as them. I hated how my mother treated me for as long as I could remember, and although admittedly it did influence me - caused me to act to others the same way she acted toward me, even if I hated it and had empathy enough to know I didn't WANT to do it to others - with years of therapy and help I have been able to manage myself, to cope and to restrain and to change, and alter my views and beliefs about people and how they are supposed to behave toward each other. Now I am not the girl who, on being "rescued" from the abuse by her older sister attempted to abuse that same sister herself despite it. The girl who hit her and yelled at her and actually BEGGED HER to be returned to the woman who molested her because she MISSED IT and LIKED IT. That girl is not me, that twisted and hurt teenager.

No, now I am the adult woman who is positive, and optimistic, and helpful and kind as I can be most of the time. And I am very much not like the mother who raised me. When I have the anger, and the urge to yell and to hit the person in front of me, I do not do so. I will not do so.

Believe me it is NOT unrealistic for a child to realize, even very early on, that what they live with is wrong and that they do not want to live with it. Even if they cannot fully commit to leaving it, changing themselves, or seeing the full scope of it all. But if they do they can become so much better than they were.
