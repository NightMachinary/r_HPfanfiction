Yeah, the best way I can imagine a malfoy raised child being an angel that loves everybody is kinda in the way everyone loves a puppy. "Oh it's so cute, look at what it's doing. It thinks it's people, here have some of my table scraps." A kind personality, but weighed down by the fact that muggles just aren't "people" in the same way wizards and witches are.

I think it could be swung into a character that even seems good, does more or less the good thing, but for all the wrong reasons. But even that is an extreme, much more likely to be somewhere between malicious and just negligent really. ("Muggle? I've never thought about them. Savage brutes I'm told. Muggle-borns? Well I suppose somebody has to do the menial jobs right?")
