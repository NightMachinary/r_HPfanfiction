Difference: Being treated in a negative manner is VERY different then being thought other's should be treated in a negative manner. Yes yes, even a rather dimwitted child can realize that no, it does not like being beat and abused and what have you. Considering another category of humans as "Inferior", "Sub-Human", or "Not really people", that is a lot harder to observe and decide is wrong when raised with. If it wasn't, racism would never have become a thing, having been wiped out within the very first generation of humanity, and any subsequent generation that decided "That tribe over there is little better then animals really."
