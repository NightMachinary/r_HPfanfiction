Yes, I see where you're coming from. But I also believe that when a certain belief system is engrained into a child from basically since they could walk, that it would be very hard for them to go against that in such a short time.

It's like the frog in boiling water. If you plop a frog into boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you place it into regular water and slowly turn the heat up, it'll remain there until it dies. So if the girl were to go 'hey I don't think mudbloods are that bad' and Lucius backhands her, she's not gonna be too willing to follow them. But if he were to slowly over time get more violent, she'd be more likely to follow them.
