People can, and often do, overcome the circumstances of their upbringing. My family is religious, and yet at a young age I began questioning the belief system that I was taught, and am now an atheist. There are also several other things that differentiate myself from my family that is now causing a strain in my relationship with them.

So I don't see it as being unrealistic that Draco's hypothetical sister could also overcome the Malfoy family's beliefs. It's how the author writes it. It would be more realistic to see an 11-year old sister who still has some misguided beliefs but that also disagrees with her family on several key points and is willing to listen to and consider other perspectives. This would be a great starting point to see some real character development during the course of her Hogwarts years.
