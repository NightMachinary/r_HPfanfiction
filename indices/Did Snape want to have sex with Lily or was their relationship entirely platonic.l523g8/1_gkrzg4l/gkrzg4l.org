Book canon doesn't actually explicitly state that he was in love with her. However, it is strongly implied, and explicitly stated by JKR outside the books (in fact, she once mentioned /Lily/ having feelings for Severus at one point even if it didn't lead anywhere due to his fixation on the Dark Arts). My headcanon on this is yes, he loved her that way, which I think is what most people believe. However I also think that they could have legitimately worked out, if he ever got his shit together and left the dark path he was heading towards, which I know is a far less popular view.

However, I don't think his love for her was very physical in nature -- I mean, yeah, he was a teenage boy at one point and I'd be surprised if he didn't fantasize about her like that. But I always figured that, with how long they had been friends, that he loved her emotionally much more than physically. So yeah, as a teenage boy he likely wanted to have sex with her eventually, but just simply the idea of them being together romantically was far more important.
