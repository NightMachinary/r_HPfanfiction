I think he wanted her. Snape wanted a life with her but the path he was on was a dark one. Snape was surrounded by too many Slytherins whispering about blood purity and was a half-blood with a muggle surname. He would have had a difficult time in Slytherin especially with Voldemort rising. There was a part of him torn between the purebloods and wanting to fit in and the muggleborn girl he loved. Snape was already broken but he had no idea how to fix himself or move on.

To me it was always platonic on Lily's end.
