With all due respect to OP, who likely bailed at the right time, there is a /lot/ more wrong with linkffn(The Little Veela That Could) than that.

1. 350,784 words, about half of them not really needed.
2. She's really an [[/spoiler][angel or maybe fallen angel?!]]
3. They fight along side [[/spoiler][Joan of Arc?!]]
4. Wait wait wait, this has a soul bond thingie...with an eight year old girl?!
5. ...
6. This is an "M" rated fic.
7. ...
8. <sigh>

Well, it isn't another /Harry Potter and the Rightous Curb Stomp/, by robst. I can at least stand to read this one a second time...if just to remember how bonkers it is.

It /is/ well written, and makes few eye-catching writing mistakes. So at least it has that.

*edit to fix da spoiler tags
