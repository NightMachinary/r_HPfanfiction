The Green Girl. (SPOILERS)

I see it recommended all the time when people ask for canon rehashes and I just cannot grasp why it's so highly recommended. So much of this fic actually triggers me and I can't even make it beyond chapter 2 to see if it changes.

As I dislike coming off as ignorant and bias, I slugged though eight chapters of this fic before literally questioning my existence. As I said, I enjoy canon rehashes as I like to see what people do with them. I don't care about information being repeated, the same events happening -- as long as they happen differently.

The first thing out of one of their mouths is 'You're one of us now.' Are you serious? Like, who wrote that fic? Okay, okay... moving on. On the second line, it clearly states that Slytherin hates Muggle-borns. I can handle this. But to have that contradicted in the first three paragraphs has befuddled me.

"Hi, I"m Hermione Granger, I'm a Muggle-born!"

"Yeah, well, you're our Muggle-born now."

Are you having a giggle? Not even half way through the first chapter and everything we know about Draco Malfoy crumbles and he actually wishes to befriend this Muggle-born, something that Lucius Malfoy would go crazy about. Awesome. This will be a long drawn out process where we watch them squabble and Hermione slowly prove herself...

"Theo, we've got a Muggle-born in our year."

Are you fucking me right now? ARE YOU -- okay, relax. So, in the first chapter we realise that Slytherin actually doesn't hate Muggle-borns, or maybe because this Hermione is a self-insert in the highest calibre, and they're accepting. I eagerly await for Draco to be called the 'Ice Prince' and Daphne to strut along and be called the 'Ice Princess.'

Chapter 2. I need a drink... where's the vodka...

Some boy with sense called her a Mudblood. Excellent. We're back to real Slytherin and -- he was punched by a first year... amazing. Then another says the word, but only for Gryffindor? My GOD! And would you look at that, Draco still harasses Harry, despite the fact that there's nothing in the story to indicate animosity between them.

Oh, another canon thing that has been copy and pasted in and had three things changed. $10 Draco doesn't actually go to the duel and does it solely to get Harry in trouble, just like in canon. Yay, I got $10. Just kidding! Harry never went this time to make Draco look good.

And broom scene perfectly copy and pasted from the book with minor changes to make the mary-sue Hermione look good. I also love that they praise the same cunning and then get salty when it backfires and works for someone else. Finally, some eleven-year-old children are present.

Next part. Life is so unfair for the Slytherin house. We hate Mudbloods but love Hermione Granger. WAHHHHHH!

Oh look, the feather scene. I wonder if Hermione will correct Ron when she shouldn't be anywhere near him. Was Charms even a joint class in canon, at least in the books? I need to check.

Just speed-scrolling to skip half this nonsense...

Oooh, a Quidditch scene! I wonder how this plays out. Omg Harry's broomstick was jinxed... what a surprise. And once again, nothing comes out of that information. <furiously taps keyboard> Christmas! And it's copy and pasted from the book with names CTFL+F'd and then managed. Absolutely barbaric.

GASP! Severus Snape complimented Hermione. That's about as unlikely as Draco befriending her -- nevermind.

Pure-blood marriage contracts? Hell yeahh! We need that shit.

Same scene with Neville.... k. Stolen compliment/insult from the Quidditch section and just moved around... nice.

I'm done. I may as well go read canon as it's less cringy.
