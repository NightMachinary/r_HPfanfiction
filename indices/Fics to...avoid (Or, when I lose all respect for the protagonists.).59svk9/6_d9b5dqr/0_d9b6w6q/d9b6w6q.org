You know, I honestly don't remember. I haven't read it for a while.

I do remember that both times I've tried reading it, I did manage to get through about half of the story, and even close to the last few chapters.

It's an interesting (if somewhat overused) premise, Harry's sent to Azkaban after being framed for killing Cedric Diggory, then Love Interest, I mean, Susan Bones, starts to doubt his guilt and starts investigating pensive memories of the event...

It starts off with the targets of Harry's anger doing something to deserve it (Amos Diggory, Dad Granger), and his response is...relatively proportionate (he doesn't kill them), but later on the plot just seems to degrade into 'kill everyone we don't like'.

Arthur Weasley bothers me somewhat in the fic with wanting to kill Peter via a duel for the 'crime' of living in his house for 12 years (Peter runs away and ends up getting Kissed by a dementor), and the fact that Harry/Susan murder both Snape and Justin whilst they're in custody is also a minus...I quit reading after that second one, by the way.

...Yeah, I think that's about it. Some way through the fic, the plot degrades into A Series of Disproportionate Retributions, and that just doesn't do it for me.
