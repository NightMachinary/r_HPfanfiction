A taste of silence, Heart over mind, Pet project, Looking for love, Kitten, Severus Snapes's diary, Hermione's project, My real Parents, Magical betrothal, It happened one Hallows eve, The incident in the great hall, Signs and Vixen. Those are some of the ones I enjoyed most, not sure why but I loved Signs and Vixen lots. I think it was maybe the protective and caring nature of Snape in both while still portraying him correctly. X
