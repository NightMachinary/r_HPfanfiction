Some decent HGSS I've read, one each of the most common plots I've seen.

Post-war HGSS: linkffn(Semantics)

Marauder-era HGSS: linkffn(Pride of Time) -- not entirely canon-compilant, so some established events happen out of order compared to The Prince's Tale.

Teacher/student /non-smut/: linkffn(Pet Project)

The most common plot besides these are Marriage Law fics (based on a fic challenge from a community called WIKTT), but I usually avoid these. You may read one, but after reading one, you've basically read them all.
