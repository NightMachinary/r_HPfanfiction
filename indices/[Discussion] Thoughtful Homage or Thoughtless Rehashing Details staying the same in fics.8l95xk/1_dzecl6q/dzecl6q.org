A lot of this stuff is grounded in understanding why things have changed, how things are happening and not just going with what happened in canon with no explanation. If you're doing it, lay the groundwork. Bigger changes can draw their roots from the small ones without it seeming like we've just pulled it out of our backsides. We also don't want everything to be the exact same, because we've all read the books, no one wants to just see the exact same story. In AU, I feel like you need to justify not just non-canon things happening but canon things. Build your world through the story. Striking that balance is hard, but makes for a more satisfying read than just doing it because it happened that way in canon.
