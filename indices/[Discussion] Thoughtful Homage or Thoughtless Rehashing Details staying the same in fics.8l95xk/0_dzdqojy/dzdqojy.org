You have to consider if your changes would impact the situation. Harry being raised by Andromeda wouldn't stop Malfoy from being a dick, Voldemort from trying to kill him or the Ministry from organising a Triwizard Tournament. But if you want to keep stuff Harry did the same, you better have a good explanation ready. For example, make up some historical event where a Hedwig was a total BAMF and have Harry like the story so he picks that name for his pet.

The same goes for interpersonal stuff. Lets say that Harry ran into Tonks on the Hogwarts Express and she took him under her wing. The one nice person he knows best is a Hufflepuff, so being the abused and neglected child he was, Harry would want to be a Hufflepuff as well. He would make different friends. If you want an eventual Hermione romance, then you better keep them distant until they both grew up. They only became friends over a shared hardship, so either come up with something original (they run into Sirius during the third year) or bend some canon event to serve as catalyst (Harry sees Hermione at the Yule Ball). Don't try to force certain canon events (friendships, the Graveyard fight, the Horcrux hunt) just for the sake of including them.

Tl;dr: Personal stuff and interactions should be different, the rest should stay the same. If you want to change something, make up a plausible explanation.
