Yeah, the big strokes can be annoying when they're painted the exact same. The Hermione one is a good example of that, if Harry were in Hufflepuff, by what we see in canon, they probably wouldn't interact much, if at all. And it's definitely something writers should think about.

I'm more interested in the little things though, like Harry still getting Griphook as his guide to the vault, despite coming on a different day without Hagrid or anything. Do you see that as just a fun little wink and nod, or lazy writing?
