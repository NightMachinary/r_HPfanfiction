It depends. If he's just random Goblin No17 and serves no further purpose? Nothing wrong with that, they ought to have shifts after all (although ot would be suspicious if it always is Griphook, no matter if it's midnight on Christmas eve or Tuesday the 14th, 4PM).

Just don't overdo this kind of fanservice. It's nice once or twice, but it becomes cringeworthy at a certain point because those kinds of things feel forced very quickly.
