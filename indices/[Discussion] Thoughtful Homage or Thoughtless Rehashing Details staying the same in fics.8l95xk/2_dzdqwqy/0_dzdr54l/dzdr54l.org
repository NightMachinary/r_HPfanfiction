Wait so was the context of the first fic that they went back in time or something? Is that why it's remembering the conversation?

Also, that Hedwig thing is actually something that would annoy me a little. Like, I can understand it from a homage point of view, or it being for the readers, but logically it just kind of comes across as very unlikely. If I read that in a story, my first reaction would definitely be "...Really?" followed by "So no one else bought this beautiful, intelligent, snowy owl because... Destiny or something?"
