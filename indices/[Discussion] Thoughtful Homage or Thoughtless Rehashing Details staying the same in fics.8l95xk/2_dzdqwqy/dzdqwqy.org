Sometimes it's really cringey. I don't like it when fics get too referential. An example of this that I saw recently: While Draco and Harry are talking, Draco says "I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks" and /Draco and Harry both start laughing/. My problem with this is that it's the kind of conversation that fans remember because it's iconic, but the characters probably /wouldn't/ remember a conversation they had when they were 11 years old. It feels like a wink from the author to the reader, rather than keeping the characters on track, and it breaks immersion.

An example I read of somebody doing this right was in an AU where Harry doesn't find out he's a wizard until he's 17. He goes to Diagon Alley and the trip to Ollivander's is pretty similar, but Draco is accompanying him, which changes the dynamic; he then goes to the pet shop but doesn't have a lot of money, so they offer him an older owl, which turns out to be an older Hedwig. That actually felt really nice to read!
