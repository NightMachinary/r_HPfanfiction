A lot of fanfic readers have a weird complex about virginity and "purity". I don't know if it's because most readers are American and America does have a notoriously puritanical past, or if it's just a run of the mill obnoxious neckbeardism, but the second you imply that a character (and this happens way more often with birds than lads) is doing anything less than waiting for marriage, you get jumped on by some fundie thinking you've turned them into a slut.

It's pretty bizarre, especially because it's way more likely that English teens in the 90s would have been going at it like rabbits, or, at least, much more than they do in canon.
