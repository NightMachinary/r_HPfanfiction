  it doesn't even try to hide that it hasn't bothered to read or pay attention tot he rest of the story and is instead just assuming familiar tropes onto characters.

I think what's happening is that this person isn't seeing it as a trope. They're sufficiently aware of general HP fandom to know Daphne "ought" to be an 'Ice Queen', but not enough to remember that she's not canon. So they see a non-Ice-Queen Daphne as genuinely O.O.C., and as weird and bothersome as, I don't know, a non-mean Snape or a non-bookworm Hermione.
