I mean take your pick on chapter 11 of Pureblood Princess. Pretty much any review that states that because Daphne may not be a virgin she does not deserve to be with Harry Potter.

The fact that such idiocy exists both amuses and saddens me to no end.

  Terrible chapter. Your Harry is a jerk and your Daphne is a slut which actually is out of character for an Ice Queen. This chapter absolutely imploded your story.

That's probably my favorite of the bunch. Because not only is it blatantly wrong, it doesn't even try to hide that it hasn't bothered to read or pay attention tot he rest of the story and is instead just assuming familiar tropes onto characters. She doesn't act like the asinine trope of an 'Ice Queen' for the entirety of the story. So it's obviously super out of character when she isn't one.

Some other favorites include:

  Where is emily? Will she remain dead? I think despite loving her husband she has a deeper bond with harry.
#+end_quote

No. She doesn't.

  Sigh...You seem to have lost sight of the plot, all characters here including Harry is not capable of a committed relationship. It seems most your fics always have an apathetic and sleazy Harry who cant keep it in his pants, and they don't seem to be interested in solving the case of some dead girl. Why go solving when you got partner to knock up and ohhh there are soooo many women to knock up for him and the list goes on and proves just how much of sleaze harry is.

I don't think you know what knocked up means. Or, considering that he had sex with one person in that story, even really what you're talking about. But don't let the facts get in the way of your own insanity. Honestly, my adult Harry probably has less sex than he should.

Then my real personal favorite theme was while writing VP the amount of reviews that insisted 'oh they must be soul bonded!' when it was never, ever, mentioned in the story and I find the entire concept to be disgusting as all hell. And that consistently called Gabrielle Gabby. Which is never used in the entirety of the text. I have a hard time picturing a French girl ever going by Gabby when Elle is readily available as a diminutive.
