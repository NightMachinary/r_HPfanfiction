I am my nephew's godfather, and I've been an atheist for as long as I've been able to have an opinion on religion. My nephew and his parents are catholic. At the baptism I was asked three questions: 1. would I accept the responsibility? 2. Would I reject Satan and all his works? and 3. Would I commit to raise him in the catholic faith if I had to take over from his parents?

Mostly, I find the godparent thing in HP to be really weird. I choose to believe they're just designating an alternate parent or something like that. My headcannon is that wizards and witches are mostly godless.
