I think it's a bit of author tract seeping into the narrative. JKR has said, "I don't believe in magic, but I do believe in God" in response to stories of a few churches protesting the themes in her series.

Godparents are just a natural extension of her personal beliefs that don't make any /real/ sense in the larger magical world.
