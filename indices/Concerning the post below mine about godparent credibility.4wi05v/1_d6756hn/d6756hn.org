Religions say a lot of strange, and, sometimes, contradictory things. It's all about how you interpret and are taught your faith's holy book. In the time Lily was alive, the whole witch thing being a sin/abomination likely never came up in any sermons or sunday school classes she would have gone to growing up. The world she lived in didn't believe in magic or witches or wizards, so it would have been irrelevant to preach about the horrors of witches and it's quite likely she wouldn't have known the church's stance on them because of it.

Her intimate knowledge of Christianity is also dependent on how religious her family was. They could have just been regular, Sunday-church goers who participated in church milestone, such as baptism, (when godparents are named traditionally), communion, and confirmation and cared little about it beyond that.

I don't know for sure if someone who doesn't believe in god can give their child a godparent, though, I would think it doesn't necessarily have to be a religious thing. It could just be an honorary sort of title one friend/sibling/cousin/ect. gives another after their child is born.

As a Christian-raised person, I don't find it offensive that witches and wizards might have godparents or go to church. It'd be little different than being openly gay and still being an active member of church, as far as I am concerned.

I think it's believable wizards and witches could believe in God. Especially Muggle-borns and half-bloods. They could have been raised by devout parents and carried that faith with them to Hogwarts and beyond, perhaps even passing it on to their children, their grandchildren, and so on.
