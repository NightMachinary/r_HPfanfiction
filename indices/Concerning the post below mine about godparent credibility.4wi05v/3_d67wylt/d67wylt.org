My nephew and niece have 'godparents' apparently - though as far as I know they were never christened. (Unless they were and I wasn't invited. Quite possible). It's a thing that I always have found inconsistent in the books: That there is no apparent religion - they swear by Merlin - yet we see Harry's parents buried in a Christian graveyard and the church at Godric's Hollow feels like a significant place. It's a wizarding village and we see people going to church, singing carols if my memory serves? Almost as if JK didn't fully think it through. Perish the thought. But as inconsistent as I find it, the connection with 'that old-time religion' or at least religious tradition in the 'Merrie England' sense is a theme I've enjoyed using myself and might do again. Cause it's Canon doncha know.
