Yes, of course it is believable.

Godparents are just a failsafe mechanism. "Hey, friend of mine, would you care for my offspring if I die so that my name may carry into the next generation?"

While yes, in our western cultures the godparents are something deeply enrooted in the catholic and hence, christian churches, the idea is a worldwide phenomenon in almost every culture where names carried social- and/or political-weight. Calling them /god/parents is just a remnant of our christian-influences cultures and languages.
