Do you know why the author decided to rewrite? I haven't heard anything about their motivations for starting again.

 

It sounds like the author hasn't cut out anything he had previously, but just hasn't gotten the rewrite to a point where completely new HP magic happens. I know that in /Black Prince/ there is some wandless magic (more like accidental magic though) and there's some slight foreshadowing when Harry gets an anonymous letter that indicates someone knows the significance of his scar. I think the story will pick up pretty soon.
