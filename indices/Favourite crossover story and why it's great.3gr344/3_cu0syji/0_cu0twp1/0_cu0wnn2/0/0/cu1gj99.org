I haven't read the rewrite in its entirety yet, so I wouldn't know if the little bits of magic from the original were written off. I just skipped to its last chapter to see if it goes beyond the first draft. It didn't.

The first draft was just beggining to introduce the HP Magic, I think. My memory is fuzzy, but I do remember wandless magic and the like, and then one of last chapters introduced a witch doctor who knew about the lithning scar. Then the rewrite came, and it never went beyond what we already know. It is frustrating to think that if only the author continued on with the original, we might know more. But I'm still thankful that its still being continued. :D
