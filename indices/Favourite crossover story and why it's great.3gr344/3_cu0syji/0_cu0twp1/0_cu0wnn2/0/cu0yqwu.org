Are you referring to the first draft (/The Prince that was Promised/)? I decided not to read it but to follow Black Prince. I can imaging how it would be frustrating if what little HP magic that showed up was then edited out or pushed till later in the new story. Or was there a part in Black Prince that got edited out?
