I could probably go with Shezza's Denarian series, but to be completely honest, I find it a bit shit, even for all the praise. The action and kick-ass is fun, but Harry is very unlikeable, his Fallen isn't very interesting and the plot is just all over the place. Writing is passable, but its nothing fantastic.

Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod isn't a direct crossover, really, but it's still really fun. Not the best thing I've ever read, but it is nice. It does the eldritch crossover okay, Harry is generally likeable and Padma is an okay sidekick. Good writing, the plot is concise. Could definitely recommend this to someone.

The Gunslinger and the Mage is really fun. Really really fun. The writing is good, the characters are okay and pretty accurate, and its really nice to read a Dark Tower fanfic.

The Prince That Was Promised / The Black Prince is also pretty good. Writing is top-notch, characters are fine and as far as we've seen yet the plot is good. Some unnecessary events and things in the story, and the crossover part is still a bit underplayed, but it has amazing potential, and this could definitely be a favourite.

Natural 20, as you mention, is fantastic too. It may very well be my favourite crossover for the reasons you've listed.

Either way, it's really hard to say what's my favourite. I think, ultimately, it would be Natural 20, as I had the most fun reading that, or Black Prince, for the quality and potential. I really can't say.
