On FF.net:

- linkffn(Harveste by kyaru-chan) and sequels are a fun Addams Family crossovers that do a good job with morbid humor. (There is also /Perfect Slytherins/ by Jeconais, IIRC, but I found it to be preachy and bashy, overloaded with bad fanon.)

- linkffn(Effloresco Secundus by romantiscue) has Hermione be reincarnated as Sakura (from /Naruto/).

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9763839/1/]]) is a short and hilarious /SCP/ crossover one-shot.

- linkffn(House, DADA by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) is a funny one-shot crossover with /House, MD/.

- linkffn(The Professor's Journey by AlphaEph19), a /Naruto/ crossover where both Sarutobi and Orochimaru find themselves in the Potterverse.

- linkffn(Agent Double O Hex by KafkaExMachina): Harry is raised by James Bond. Comedy ensues.

Off FF.net,

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is an interesting James Bond fusion, where "Wellesleys" and "Malenfants", as well as Harry and Hermione, attend "Harworts", a school for spies where skill and technology (and occasional superscience) replace magic, run by "Appledore", even while "Death Strikers" terrorist group is making a comeback.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/yer-a-witch-taylor-worm-hp.340965/][Yer a Witch, Taylor]] is a technically-not-a-crossover, with /Worm/, where Taylor triggers with powers that mimic that of a /Harry Potter/ witch. Highly amusing.
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/riding-acromantulas-and-understanding-magical-biology-harry-potter-worm.10627/][Riding Acromantulas and Understanding Magical Biology]], also a /Worm/ crossover, where Taylor and Amy (a.k.a. Panacea) end up inhabiting the bodies of of Hermione and Harry, respectively.
