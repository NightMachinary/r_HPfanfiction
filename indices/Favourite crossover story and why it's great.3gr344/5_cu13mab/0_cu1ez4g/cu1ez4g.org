I think linkffn(Riding Acromantulas and Understanding Magical Biology) is on ff.net as well. I'm quite a fan of Worm, it's a shame there aren't more HP crossovers.

Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived was quite good to start with, but I'm struggling now that I'm at the start of the 4th year. Does it get better?
