All of the fics listed here so far are indeed very good, though I agree with [[/u/SniperGW]] that The Denarian series is somewhat overrated. I would probably have to second Browncoat as my favorite piece of HP crossover, but as a runner-up I'll put forward linkffn(Illusions of Grandeur by Kanathia). This is more of a Supernatural story than a HP story, but it is very well done indeed.
