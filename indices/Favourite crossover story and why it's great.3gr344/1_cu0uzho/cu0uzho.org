*HP x ASOIAF:* /Black Prince/. Really great writing. Appropriately grim, lots of consequences. Harry doesn't have a wand yet, so there's not much magic happening yet. No wise mentor or fairy godmother to help him along linkffn(The Black Prince by cxjenious )

 

*HP x LOTR:* /The Shadow of Angmar/. Master of Death Harry, where it is more of a curse than a help. Pretty grim world that he's thrown into. Harry deals with bad, bad stuff and you can't help but feel for him. Author does a great job with the LOTR languages and history. It is refreshing to read a LOTR crossover that is not set during a period covered by the movies because it introduces characters and plot lines that aren't normally touched. Still updating linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger)

 

*HP x Marvel:* /A New Man/. Middle aged Harry yanked to alternate earth. He's a bit cold-hearted in his attempts to return home (there's a case of pragmatic neck snapping). More recent fic, still updating linkffn(A New Man by Steelbadger)

 

*HP x Sherlock (BBC Series):* /The Case of the Missing Wizard/. Definitely worth a read. It connects the two fandoms in a new way. I've read 10+ of these crossovers and this fic feels unique. Hosted on fanficauthors.net. You'll need to create an account for that site to read ch. 2 due to that chapter's M rating. Recent story, still updating
