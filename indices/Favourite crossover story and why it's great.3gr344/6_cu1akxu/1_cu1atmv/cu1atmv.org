The Naruto fics are well written, with developed characters and a solid world building. With A study in magic i feel the same as Prince of the dark kingdom: it deserves to be re-read at least once. It's a really good fic, Sherlock doesn't solve all of Harry's problems overnight and again, contains well developed characters, rich world building and an engaging plot that even when it's half a million words long, lefts you wishing for more. Sadly, it's sequel is a bit slow on the updates.
