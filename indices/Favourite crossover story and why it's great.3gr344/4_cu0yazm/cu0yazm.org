I think I'd have to say [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins by Jeconais]] a HPxAdamsFamily(and others) that is pretty fantastic. Stories up to the start of 4th year.

I just really like all the characters. It's funny. It shows good character development, they all seem to get older as the books go on. It has one of the few Snapes that I've found likeable.
