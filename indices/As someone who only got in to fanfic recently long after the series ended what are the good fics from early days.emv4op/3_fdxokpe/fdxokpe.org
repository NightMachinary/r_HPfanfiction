linkffn(2027554) In Blood Only. A great, in-character fic where Snape finds out Harry is his biological son. It's AU as of Halfblood Prince, since Snape is a pureblood in this, but it's easily the best characterization of Snape I've seen in a fic. He's such an angry asshole in this, and the fic makes zero attempts to white wash his character. Also I found it to be pretty funny at times, and very compelling.
