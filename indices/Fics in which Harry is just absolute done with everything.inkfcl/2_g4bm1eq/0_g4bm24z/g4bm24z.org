  Isolating Harry over the summer before 5th year didn't work out like Dumbledore had hoped. Now, with her friend having run away, Hermione is left to pick up the pieces, trying to stand strong against the challenges in a school where racism and injustice are not only tolerated, but actively encouraged by some teachers. All she can do is wonder how Harry made it all look so easy!
