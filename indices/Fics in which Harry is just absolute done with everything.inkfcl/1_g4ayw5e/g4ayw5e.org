linkffn(To Become a Muggle by lifebitten) has Harry giving up on magic. I really like this story.

linkffn(When Fate Intervened by LordVishnu) has Harry decide to give up his magic when his name comes out of the Goblet.

linkffn(You Can Have It All Revised by opopanax). Harry leaves England after everyone turns on him.

And I know that I've read a one-shot in which abused!ignored!Harry brings Voldemort to Hogwarts and asks to be killed so he can join his parents, but I can't find it.
