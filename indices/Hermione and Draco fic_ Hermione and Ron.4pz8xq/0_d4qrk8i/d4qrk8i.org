People do occasionally rec this, so it's not /that/ underrated, but there's a /superior/ fic out there called /Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation/. It has a weird but surprisingly effective Hermione/Draco/Neville menage a trois, and the writing is astoundingly good. Seriously, it's some of the best writing I've seen in any fanfiction anywhere. Unfortunately, it's abandoned.
