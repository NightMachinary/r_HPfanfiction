Duuude I started reading the story you recommended and it's great! I love that there is no bashing and that its gen. I like the Harry's disbelief in the beginning on how absurd the situation he found himself in is. Also I like that the characters don't take themselves so seriously (no pun intended). Damm thank you so much!
