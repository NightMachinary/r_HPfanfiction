Yes Harry was arrogant sometimes in canon, like really thinking he deserved the prefect badge over Ron, but he immediately felt awful about it and scolded himself for "acting like Malfoy" and "wanting to ruin this for his best friend"! Canon Harry had his flaws, but he still overcame them and was a good person at heart! I can at least tolerate a character like THAT. But not an outright static jerk who never changes or anything.
