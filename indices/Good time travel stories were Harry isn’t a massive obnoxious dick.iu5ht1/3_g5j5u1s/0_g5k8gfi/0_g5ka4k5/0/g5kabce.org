Couldn't have said it better. There is a reoccurring theme here two things can be true at the same time people are complex creatures and expecting them to be one certain way is silly. Like Ron can be jealous but also a good friend. Harry can be stubborn as a mule and sometimes yield to his ego but still be humble in other ways. Thank you for your insightful comments 😊🙏
