Oooooofff can't stand bashing and arrogance! Its like people forget how forgiving Harry was in canon. I like Harry's compassion, forgiveness, and ability to see the bigger picture but it's like authors see this as a weakness rather than a strength. I particularly don't enjoy bashing because it reduces everything to a black and white scenario with no nuance. Also in my opinion Harry has always been humble so the added obnoxious arrogance only makes him look like a dickish version of James. Instead of contrasting him as a better person.
