I just can't with Daphne/Harry she is written like the archetypical femme fatale and while there is nothing wrong with it, I have yet to read and author depict her as something other than a 2 dimensional boring ice princess. And also for some reason Harry gets extra obnoxious in those stories. No judgement to the people who like the pairing though. Maybe I just haven't come across a good story
