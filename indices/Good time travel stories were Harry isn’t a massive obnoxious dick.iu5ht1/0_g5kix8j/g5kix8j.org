Here:

face death in the hope: Harry accidentally time travels to the past after giving himself up to Voldemort during the final battle. He saves Regulus from the Inferi cave, and teams up with him and a few other people to destroy horcruxes. Good characters,No character bashing. Harry isn't Dumbledore's biggest fan, but I don't think that counts as bashing. (Harry/Regulus Pre-slash) linkao3(5986366)

you belong to me (i belong to you): Auror Harry wakes up in the body of 14yo Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who ended his own life. He returns to hogwarts, where people realise that he was not the same boy as before. linkao3(11270490)

I can't remember much right now, so I'll add some more if i do.
