I also really dislike ALL CAPs. Rowling apparently used in book five, I haven't read the actual books for a while, so didn't remember that, but I still find it annoying even knowing that.

Attempting a humorous tone is usually a deal breaker for me, which I guess is sort of weird. While I like Pratchett and Adams, most fic authors are not near that level and when they attempt this I just find the characters act in ways that don't make sense because it's funny, and the dialogue is usually unrealistic and cringeworthy, which constantly breaks my immersion in the story.

In general unrealistic dialogue is a deal breaker for me, which can often happen in non humor fics too.

On the opposite end, fics that try to be super dark and angsty also often similarly have a lot of stuff that breaks my immersion, like things constantly happening just so that the main character is shit on and can complain about it.

Basically I like fics with subtlety, being too in your face about stuff with the tone bothers me. Also that they are written like the author is trying to write legit prose rather than just throwing stuff on a page to get across a cool story idea. I like a fic to take itself seriously, in terms of being a story, not saying the plot itself needs to be serious. Not sure if that makes sense.
