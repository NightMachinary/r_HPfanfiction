I drop fanfiction with oc Sith Lords with edgy shitty names with no meaning, its why i cant finish Darth Maars Sith Harry fic. The names of a Darth either have a meaning (Sidious=Insidious, Tyrannous=Tyrant, Vader=Father) or a meaning to the persons past. Darth Shadix sounds like a shitty sonic Oc and ignores the point of a Sith name.
