I understand that and ive read a few chapters of the fic. But the name still bugs me as a star wars fan, id rather him either keep his name as a twisted insult by palpatine to turn him into something his friends and those who know him wouldnt recognize so when he is conflicted he has inner conflict on who harry potter is. Or a nickname like starkiller
