I just looked it up, Harry is the only character who uses caps for yelling. This is also really only in book 5, where he's angsting the entire time. So, in conclusion, using an exclamation point to make the character yell is easier, and makes more sense to the reader. I have read some of your stories, and in many of the points where you choose to use CAPs lock to accentuate your meanings, you could instead use italics. Thank you for telling me about CAPs Harry, however. I have read the books, but most of my memorization is from listening to the audiobooks every night for years.
