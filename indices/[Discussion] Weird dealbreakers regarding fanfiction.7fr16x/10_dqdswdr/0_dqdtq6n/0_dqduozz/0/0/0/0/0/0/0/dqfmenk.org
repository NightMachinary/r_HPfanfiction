WordPad comes with Windows, so if you have Notepad you have WordPad too. It's a fairly basic word processor, more complex and featured than Notepad, but way less than Word. LibreOffice is a free word processor you can download from the internet, I haven't used it so I can't comment on if its any good or not.
