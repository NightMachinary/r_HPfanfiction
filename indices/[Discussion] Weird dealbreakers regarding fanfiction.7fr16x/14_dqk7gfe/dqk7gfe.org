Since we're going weird dealbreakers and not reasonable ones... I have to go with: can't read a fic with under 100,000 words. I can't commit if I don't feel like it's going somewhere and have trouble buying a story as developed if it's shorter. However I like really developed drama/romance fics, which you can't really do in fewer words (in general). I'm sure it works okay for other genres.
