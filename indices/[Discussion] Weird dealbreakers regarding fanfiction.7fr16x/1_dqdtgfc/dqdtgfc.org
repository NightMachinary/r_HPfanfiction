It doesn´t really show up in HP fanfiction, but authors trying to show their weeb cred, by using honorifics, which I can somewhat tolerate, but putting random Japanese words in it for no reason, is where I draw the line. Characters speaking English, one moment and then just trying to push dobe or baka into a sentence, like it´s a dry butt plug, just hurts.
