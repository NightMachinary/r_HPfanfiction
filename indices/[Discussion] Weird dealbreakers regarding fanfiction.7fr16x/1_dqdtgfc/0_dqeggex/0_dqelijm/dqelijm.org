I just recently read a Naruto fanfic, that always had author notes in the beginning, which I don´t mind and a really lengthy list of every jutsu, that was used in the chapter, that I could also tolerate, but what was really annoying, was that, after every jutsu, there was a translation in brackets, it wasn´t a dealbreaker though, but I stopped for other reasons, though I came pretty far because I didn´t have anything else to read.
