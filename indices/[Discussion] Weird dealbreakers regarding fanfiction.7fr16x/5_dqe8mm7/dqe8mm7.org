Spelling a person's name wrong. I can understand once or twice in one chapter but after that someone should have told them that hey you were spelling a person's name wrong. That just irks me. And especially when they spell the person's name wrong multiple times in different ways.

Also something relatively minor that I'm okay with most of the time, but can get kind of annoying is when the A/N is really long. Like I understand the author wanting to update people or answer questions or whatever, but when the A/N gets as long as the chapter that's pushing it a bit. At least imo.
