Mostly extremely bad grammar, but that isn't weird, i think at least. A weird one would be, if it could be called that, a stupid Dumbledore that keeps getting bashed but keeps on preaching "greater good". Its one thing to bash the shit he did, but having to read his perspective while spouting that tripe, is usually a dealbreaker for me.
