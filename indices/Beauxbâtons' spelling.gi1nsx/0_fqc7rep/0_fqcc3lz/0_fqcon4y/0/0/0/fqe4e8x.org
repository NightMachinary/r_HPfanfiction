Just to note, 'baguette' is the correct translation - "magic wand" = "baguette magique" (baguette literally means a thin stick - the bread is named after the shape, though obviously it's better known abroad).

"Baton" is a more general word for stick, but generally would be a bigger stick than a 'baguette'. In the context of a magical one, I picture it more as a staff than a wand (I forget if in LotR, for instance, if Gandalf's staff is translated as being a magical 'baton').

Obviously only tangentially related to your point, but I find that a lot of english speakers don't really realize that.
