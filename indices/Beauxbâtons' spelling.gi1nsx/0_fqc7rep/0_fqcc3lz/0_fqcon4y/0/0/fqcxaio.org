Also amusing is that the name "Beauxbatons" uses the word "baton" for wand, where the actual French translations of the HP books use the word "baguette".

I occasionally entertain myself with the idea that there is a second French school called Bellesbaguettes, which is where French magical families send their squib children. It teaches baking, not magic.

Through an administrative error, Tom Riddle is accidentally sent to Bellesbaguettes rather than Hogwarts. Nonetheless, he somehow manages to take over magical France through the clever use of baked goods.
