True. One of the things I love about English is our weird criteria for what we borrow. Deutschland? No Germany. Cliché? Sure, why not. Au revoir? Ooh, yeah sounds nice. Tsunami? Spell it the same but forget saying that t. In the end it's weird, and mostly up to personal preference I guess. I enjoy seeing Beaxbâtons sometimes, but you're probably right that Beaxbatons is simpler and even probably less jarring to see.
