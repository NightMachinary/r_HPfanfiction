Part of the French language, not the English language.

If you're speaking English, you say "Spain" not "España". If you're speaking French, you say "Angleterre" not "England". In most languages, including English, proper nouns are not just copied wholesale from their language of origin, but rather "localised" to that language.

So along the same lines, in English you would say/write Beauxbatons, not Beauxbâtons.
