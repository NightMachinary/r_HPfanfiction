You make a good point about encoding, but â is still a part of the language. It would be like saying ‘Remove the silent p from psychology because it serves no purpose in my language' or ‘Replace all k's with c's because k isn't a letter we use and it would just be too much work.'

(Edit: After a quick check it turns out a and â are also pronounced differently in some dialects of French.)
