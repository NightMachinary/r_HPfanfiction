Until reading this, I didn't realise there was an alternate, more correct spelling for it. In the past I would've obviously just written it like Joanne did. Now that I know, I'd say that l'd probably mention there being two spellings but stick to the book spelling for most use. For example:

"Beauxbâtons, or simply Beauxbatons as those outside of Wizarding France tend to write it, was..." etc

Either that or have it correctly referred to when in a french setting or being discussed by french wizards and witches. So if Fleur mentioned the school, it would be Beauxbâtons. If it was Harry, Beauxbatons.
