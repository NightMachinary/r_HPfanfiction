Defense is her worst, it's the only subject where she doesn't get Outstandings. This is mainly because the grading is highly based on practical work which she struggles with. Her best subject is hard to judge, but I would guess either history or arithmancy. No practical spellcasting involved, and she seems to enjoy the subjects. She reads history books for pleasure on multiple occasions, and I believe Harry gets her an extra arithmancy book for Christmas in one of the years. Binns is a shit teacher and that can make a huge difference, so I'm leaning towards saying arithmancy.
