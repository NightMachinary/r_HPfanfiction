I would say Transfiguration or Charms.

Hermione is repeatedly mentioned as doing extremely well in these classes.

In Transfiguration, when they have to transform teapots into turtles, Hermione frets over how hers looks more like a tortoise, while everyone else has more noticeable concerns--someone's turtle still had a spout for a tail for example.

Hermione's also very skilled at Vanishing--while Harry and Ron haven't mastered Vanishing mice, Hermione has already advanced to Vanishing kittens.

In Charms, Hermione is extremely skilled.

Professor Flitwick tells her in confidence that she passed with /over/ one hundred percent. She's able to use /Alohamora/ using Harry's wand to access the third-floor corridor, after only two weeks of school. She masters the Summoning Charm very, very quickly.

Hermione is able to use the Silencing Charm perfectly on a toad and then on a raven, when Ron notes that such a feat would be more difficult.

Essentially, if it boils down to theory and practical application, Hermione excels.

Anything that is instinctual--Divination, Flying, and the more abstract elements of Defense the Dark Arts (Patronuses and boggarts) Hermione struggles with.
