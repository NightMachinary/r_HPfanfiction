I disagree with practical application. Spell casting is dependent on theoretical knowledge and so it's expected that her ability to cast spells will be better than Harry or Ron. She knows more spells, more theory behind said spells, and general magical theory. The issue is that she doesn't excel. With her level of theoretical knowledge, a course curriculum, and experience, Hermione couldn't even overcome Lupin's defense exam. Essentially what I'm trying to say is she excels at theory which lends itself to practical application and her theoretical knowledge is buffering her lack of practical ability. If her theoretical knowledge was not as extensive, her spellcasting would suffer. Note how Harry and Ron are capable of mastering charms with far less study of magical theory.
