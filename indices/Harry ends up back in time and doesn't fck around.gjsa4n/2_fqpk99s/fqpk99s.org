Imagine if he accidentally became the next dark lord in the process of trying to topple a dark lord. Okay, sorry, this is a serious thread :(

But the idea could potentially be developed seriously. By a serious person.

Also, although the best course of action (in my POV), would be to kill TMR while he's in the crib, it'd be interesting to see the consequences of what he did.

Stuff like, the moment after he kills an 11 year old tom riddle, the time traveller screws up and is caught and sent to azkaban. Or something more creative, I don't know.
