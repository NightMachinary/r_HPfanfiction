That fic would be surprisingly difficult because only due to the troll incident Harry and Hermione became friends and she was the one who did by far the most for Harry. So now you need a satisfactory way to help Harry or you just fucked over the magical world.

Of course you could simply have Daphne gored before the troll gets to Hermione and some of her brain and blood still sticking to the club but then she's just a random background character getting killed within three lines.
