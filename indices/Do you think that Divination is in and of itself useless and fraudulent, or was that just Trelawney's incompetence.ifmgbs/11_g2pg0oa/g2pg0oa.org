My headcanon is that Divining Information is a valid and learnable/teachable subject. But that Divining the Future is only really possible by real seers and is not something that can be taught.

The state of the subject and art is one of decline because the need for the divining of information is going away (no one out their divining water sources with dousing rods type of lack of need) and the only thing people are really interested in is the future, which requires "the gift."
