Dumbledore explicitely mentions that Divinition as a school subject is pretty much useless. Prophecies and seeing the future are real things, but they are vague and not every prophecy comes true.

Just remember how Firenze taught Divinition in fifth book. It's not something that can be learned or even relied upon.
