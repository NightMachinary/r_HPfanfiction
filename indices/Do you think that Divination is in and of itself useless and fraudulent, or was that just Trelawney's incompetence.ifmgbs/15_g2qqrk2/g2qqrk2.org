I like to use it as Dumbledore being biased against it. He believes in the big stuff, but feels the only use of Divination is full on prophecy from seers and hasn't ever had a good divination teacher st Hogwarts.

Since Trewlaney is so bad at teaching it, the knowledge of all the useful minor Divination works is almost uh unheard of in Britain except to immigrants and expats.
