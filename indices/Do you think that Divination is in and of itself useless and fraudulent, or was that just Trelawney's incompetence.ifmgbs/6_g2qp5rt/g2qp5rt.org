In my mind, Trelawney was a fraud but only in the attempt to ascertain the fortunes of Humans. In my personal headcanon, Divination can only tell you so much about the future and in the vaguest possible and probably most existential way, without an actual seer that is. I really like soft and vague magic. I like the Centaur style of divination, it seems the most useful and most interesting. Take one of the first things a centaur says in the books;

“Mars is bright tonight”

As explained later, it represents war, it being bright, likely means war is coming soon. In the wider context of the stars you could probably learn a lot.

For a canon inspired take on things, it ties in well with the astronomy class.
