Thanks for the clarification. I wonder if there's a kind of magic to the way the map seems to put a name to people, because aren't names just social constructs? Why is Snape 'Severus Snape' and not 'Snivellus'. He is after all, known as both. That may be his most known alias but if the creators so preferred, couldn't they just brand their spots as their nicknames, and call people whichever they wanted? Same as your example with Wormtail, really. It's also the way that the map seems to know where it is in the castle. When Harry stood in front of the hunched witch, it immediately said 'Dissendium' as if it knew where it was. I can hardly see the Marauders going around 'tethering' the map to every single place in the castle; there must be some more magic in play other than the spell Rowling came up with. One thing that also interests me is the faint parallel between Riddle's diary and the Map's echoes of the Marauders, albeit the former is much more complex than the latter. It seemed like James and co. knew what they were doing when they implemented their personalities in the map.

I like the editting Rowling did for occlumency and veritaserum, I can definitely see how somebody skilled enough could navigate their way deftly around either
