It's too powerful for what it is; if I were JKR's world-building editor back in the day, I would recommend some sort of underlying explanation of its capabilities, like 'it collects all the information being gathered by the portraits, plus some special enchantments we placed all over the school, using Homenem Reveleo and some other charms to label observed creatures with the name they call themselves'. Then I'd make it so that it wasn't Peter Pettigrew showing up in the map but 'Wormtail', unless he was in human form. That sort of thing can be useful for most practical purposes but not for exceptional situations.

Even JKR had to go back and revise the limits of Veritaserum to suggest that an Occlumens could resist it; absolute knowledge is bad for storymaking.
