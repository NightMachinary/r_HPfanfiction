I both like and hate Divination in stories. As a reader, I like the idea that there are ways to gain insight beyond just forcing other people to tell the truth and I like how some insightful writers explore that. On the flipside, most writers who include it do so in the worst way possible -- as a monkeywrench to force situations on the characters, treating prophecies as if they were contracts with the Devil; y'know, the kind that can't be broken except at the cost of their dwindling goth-powers-sensing soul.

Also, as a writer I see the pitfalls of extra-narrative intuition -- the /idea/ of using Divination to answer questions is tempting, but the essence of drama is having characters explore and resolve conflicts with limited, incomplete information, and knowledge-giving magic shortcircuits that.

There's a great comic about the trio having access to a Google-esque search engine for the Hogwarts library that basically turns each plot in the series into a matter of look-up > read entry > problem solved.

My recommendation for anyone using Divination in stories is to make sure you emphasize the subjective nature of truth -- any Divination spell should be relying on some other point of observation rather than an actual immutable truth. I really hate when Sirius declares that 'the Map never lies'; how is it that an enchanted parchment cobbled together by some gifted students twenty years back is able to see through disguises, shape shifting, and other obscuring magic? It's an unforced error in world-building, putting an absolute barrier like that in place.
