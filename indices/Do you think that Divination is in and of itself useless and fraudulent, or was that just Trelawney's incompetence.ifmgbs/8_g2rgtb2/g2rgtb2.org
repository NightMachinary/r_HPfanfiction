In canon, I think it's a little bit of both. Trelawney is mostly incompetent (other than her two real prophecys) but even when firenze and other centars tell the future it's vague and open to interpretation. Dumbledore and McGonagal speak about divination and both essentially say it's unreliable.

My headcanon though is that there is a lot of things other than predicting the future that divination can be used for example: scrying, or viewing the past associated with an object or location.
