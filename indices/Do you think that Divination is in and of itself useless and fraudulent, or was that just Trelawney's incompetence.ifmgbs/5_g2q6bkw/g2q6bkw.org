I don't value Divination because sometimes knowing your own future is more a curse than blessing. Even if it's in super vague prophecy form.

I mean Voldemort learning of his possible future led to his eventual downfall. So if he didn't listen to prophecies he could rule the world(at least Wizarding Britain), so that sucks for him at least.
