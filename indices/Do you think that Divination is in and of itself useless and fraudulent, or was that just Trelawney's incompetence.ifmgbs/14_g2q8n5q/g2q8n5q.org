"Casual" divination outside of prophecies seems to work. Trelawney managed several accurate predictions, such as the rabbit's death, attacks on Harry, or Hermione leaving the class. She also divined the general aspects of Draco's plot "troubled man, lightning struck tower".

So I'd say divination itself is really capable of providing you with information about the present and thus accurate predictions about the future. It just needs a good interpretation.

Though I'd imagine that a general problem would be, that divination requires a certain level of intuition and trust to gather the divined information, and a high level of analytical, organised thinking. And those two traits rarely come together in people. Most people fall either on the intuitive side like Trelawney or Ron, or on the analytical side like Hermione. Reliable diviners with both are rare.
