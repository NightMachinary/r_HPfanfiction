I feel that Divination in canon is too focused on seeing the future.

My headcanon is that when properly taught Divination starts with remote viewing and finding lost items, then things like retrocognition for viewing the past, and finally ends with prophecy/precognition as a poorly understood NEWT level topic.

Trelawney is a fraud that relies on her innate talent for prophecy and its unreliable nature to conceal her incompetence. It might not be even be intentional as prophecy does seem to be an area of interest for her and may simply be uninterested in 'lesser' divination.

It is entirely possible that charms such as protective enchantments and summoning charms have devalued 'lesser' divination magic as well leading to a greater focus on divining the future.
