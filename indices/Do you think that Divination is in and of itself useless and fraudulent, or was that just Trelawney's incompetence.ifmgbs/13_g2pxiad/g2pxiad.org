Divination has some specific things which can be taught, such as tarot cards, tea leaves, astrology, and dream interpretation. The ability to give prophecies is something else entirely, requiring a specific gift. I believe reading the crystal ball also falls into the "need a gift to use" category.

Trelawney is a fraud. She has the gift of prophecy, but gives fake prophecies and predictions all the time to make herself look better, most likely because she has no memory of her actual prophecies. What she doesn't realize is that she is sabotaging her own reputation when she tries to inflate it. The fact that divination is viewed so poorly as a subject by even Dumbledore and McGonagall is all due to her fake predictions.
