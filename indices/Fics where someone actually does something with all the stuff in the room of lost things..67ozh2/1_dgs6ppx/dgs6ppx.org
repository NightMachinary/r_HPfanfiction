It's not major, but in /The Arithmancer/, Hermione uses various objects from the Room at times. This includes hundreds of toy wands (used for cutting up and serving as templates for custom-made wands), and, more interestingly, a Quick-Quotes Quill that once belonged to Rita Skeeter, which Hermione later uses to write an article in Skeeter's name (since the Quill absorbed Rita's usual purple prose style).
