not directly what OP wants asks about, but I really like how in Princess of the Blacks Jen figures there must be a lumber room somewhere, and eventually tracks it down. As a yank, I had no idea what a 'lumber room' was, but I looked it up and learned something new. If I ever do see a real lumber room, I'll probably be reminded of the Room of Hidden Things.
