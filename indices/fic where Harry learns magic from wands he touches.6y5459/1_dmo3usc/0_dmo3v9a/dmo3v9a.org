  "The wand chooses the wizard- The wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand." But what if you were a freak and touching another's wand caused you to learn everything that passed through that wand and was learned by the host. Another twisted story around the time of the Tri-Wizard tournament. No Slash.
