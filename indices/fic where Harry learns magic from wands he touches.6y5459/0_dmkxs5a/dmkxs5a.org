Are there any specific scenes you remember from the fic? When did Harry touch James's wand, was it when he was a baby or when he was with the Dursleys or on a Gringotts trip...?

What does he do with the information he gets? Does he become a master ward-breaker, or youngest duellist ever, or does he learn secret family spells from wands, or use it like Prior Incantato to know what spells people have cast, or...?
