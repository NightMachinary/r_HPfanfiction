Let me preface this with saying that I really like your story. It's a great idea and wonderfully executed. My main gripe is really only with the Harry/Hermione dynamic. And my view is definitively tainted by how much I hate the way Harry used his glasses to spy on everyone.

But, From Parvati, Harry really learned the wrong thing and treated Ginny poorly, especially with blaming her. Of course the stress is a big factor here. However, I wish by now he made the realization and apologized properly (only at Chapter 44 now, Fake ambush at Longbottem)

Afterwards he jumped into the mess of a relationship with Romilda that was doomed to fail. Atleast he learned that there is more to a relationship than physical and he did apologize.

Next there are the interaction between him and Hermione. Harry is patronizing, often downright insults her, yet also has the gall to act jealous. Of course Hermione is acting, but he outright disrespects her because she is a secretary. And then is arrogant enough to think Hermione should come to him so he can date her out of pity (after all, she does not know how to behave, dress, and is just a poor secretary)

Both sides obviously have feelings for each other, but I'd have frankly expected Hermione to call out Harrys bullshit and disrespect. He doesnt even care enough to recognize how disrespectful and insulting he acts. Even if his action are out of course obliviousness and not malice, Hermione should not be just taking it. Even feelings mellow out after a while.

I understand the intent, but my own Interpretation of what is written does not seem to support Hermione feelings. Although obviously existant, they don't feel justified.

Again, this is purely how I personally am reading the portrayed relationship as of right now. Thanks for writing the story and commenting.
