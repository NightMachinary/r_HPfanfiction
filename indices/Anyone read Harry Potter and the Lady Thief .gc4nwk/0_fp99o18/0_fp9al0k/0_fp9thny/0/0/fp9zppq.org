Well, from Parvati, Harry learned that he shouldn't let his girlfriend make him choose between his friends and her - which is a good lesson. However, he overcompensated, and when Ginny, quite justified, wanted more time with just him instead of just "snogging time", he thought she was doing the same as Parvati. Romilda taught him that he needed an equal partner, and Daria made him realise that he wanted a relationship, not just casual sex.

Hermione, of course, was jealous as well - from the start. Her antics in disguise at the ball didn't help Harry's relationship with Parvati. She doesn't call out his bullshit since she feels that's her own fault if she deliberately dresses badly and acts like a Klutz.
