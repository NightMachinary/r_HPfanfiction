HP/DM wouldn't be unreadable, I suppose, given the same stipulation that I gave mentor!Voldemort. Ample reasoning and doesn't turn Harry into a crazy racist.

The problem with summary-scumming is that I'm going to assume any HP/DM story is shit and ignore it, to save myself time. I may miss a few good stories but, in general, I'm avoiding some of the worst shit in the fandom, imo.
