Oh, absolutely. Hermione is one of the most pivotal characters in the series. Let's not forget she brewed a N.E.W.T. level potion to spy on other students in a rival house, ether.

I'm, however, searching for a fanfiction and you can't deny that in a lot of fanfictions they forget how much of a complete bad ass Hermione was. I'm only hoping to find a Hermione who is more... /direct/ with her rival's comeuppance.
