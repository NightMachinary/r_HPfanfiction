I'd like to see this as well, although characterizing Hermione as just a goody goody seems wrong. Among other things, she drugged people to impersonate them, blackmailed a sleazy journalist (and trapped her temporarily) and led Umbrige into a situation were she had to know Umbrige would probably get murdered (maimed at best).
