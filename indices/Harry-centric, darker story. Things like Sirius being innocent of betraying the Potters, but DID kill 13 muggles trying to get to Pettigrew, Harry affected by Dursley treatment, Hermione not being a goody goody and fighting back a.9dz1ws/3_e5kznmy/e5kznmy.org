Linkffn(the prisoners cipher) has Harry as an insane maniac locked up in the Ministry and no one knows why but him

Linkffn(By the Divining Light) has the story starting out after Neville, the BWL, is already dead.

Linkffn(Unspeakable things) Malfoy disembowels Luna, so Harry breaks his arms and forces Malfoys wand hand into his head and casts a blasting curse.

Linkffn(The Lies That Bind) did not shy away from sinister shit. The Bellatrix situation was particularly gruesome.

Linkffn(Phoenix Corrupted) has Ariana survive, so Gellert and Albus stayed friends. Creates a whole knew world where Voldemort is teacher and Grindelwald is the Dark Lord.
