Noticed that, pretty entertaining overall though I've got to say that...

I found the epilogues distasteful... a prime example of power corrupting absolutely as the four hop from world to world, killing and controlling for their own amusement. I get that it's supposed to be funny, but it really falls flat, especially after earlier comparisons between jaded/scarred Harry and Voldemort.
