Batsutousai's /Like a Ghost in My Town/ series has a loving big brother Harry in the second book, /Nose to the Wind/ (which you can read without reading the first book). Harry is MoD and reborn to a Lily and James Potter who are not killed. Unfortunately, he is sort of a squib, as far as normal wizarding magic goes, so he doesn't go to Hogwarts, but he has a different kind of magic related to being Master of Death. And he still befriends old friends--even gets the Potters to foster-parent Hermione. However, Voldemort is still alive, dark, and in a position of power--it's just that he's on Harry's side.
