Harry pretends to be a Squib in The Second String, and he briefly works at Hogwarts as Filch's assistant or something like that. The treatment of Squibs in wizarding society is a major plot point.

Magical Relations has Vernon buying both Harry and Dudley's school supplies, so Harry doesn't know about his Gringotts vault at first. He gets a job helping Filch to repay Vernon.
