linkffn(The Squib and The Cerberus)

This is the first of a series with a different take on Filch's character. This specific fic doesn't have any interactions with Harry, but in a later story he helps Filch defend Mrs. Norris' honor from other cats. There's also another one when they run into each other in London over the summer and have to work together to escape some magical creatures.
