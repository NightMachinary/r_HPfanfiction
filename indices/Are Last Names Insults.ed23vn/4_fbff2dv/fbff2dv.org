No, they aren't. It is polite to refer to strangers by their surname whereas the forename is reserved for friends and family. Secondly, some names like Tom, Dick , Harry etc. are very common ( especially among muggleborns, Dark Lords and scarheads) and it will create a lot of confusion if one were to use the first names only. Though, the full name can be used when there are more than one person sharing the same surname.
