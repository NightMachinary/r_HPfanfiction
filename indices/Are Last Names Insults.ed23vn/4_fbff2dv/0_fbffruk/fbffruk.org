It is considered polite to refer strangers in a formal setting by their last names, usually previewed by the title Ms., Mrs., Mr., or perhaps in the wizarding world, Lord or Lady. In this case, they (however antaganistic they are) are not strangers, are not in any formal situation, and do not refer to each other by any kind of title.

I suppose it is kind of difficult for me to understand as I have never had that kind of adversity in school.
