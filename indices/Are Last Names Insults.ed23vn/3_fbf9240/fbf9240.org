With the correct tone of voice yeah it can be insulting. I think for Harry calling Malfoy anything but Malfoy would imply a sense of friendship or familiarity that is neither there or wanted.

I've always been known to my friends by my surname funnily enough. Maybe we aren't as good of friends as I think. ðŸ¤”
