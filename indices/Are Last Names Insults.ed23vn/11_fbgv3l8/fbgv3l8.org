It's a mix. You can usually infer from the tone, I'd say.

It can be used neutrally, such as addressing someone you really don't know in a more formal way. For instance we see that a lot with the professors in the series - I believe McGonagall uses it often. Between students, you can expect it like you said (when they dislike each other), or to emphasize that they don't really know each other.

The next one is in the series, they often refer to each other by last names when discussing someone not there. Eg, when strategizing for Quidditch, they talk about how Diggory plays - not Cedric, not Cedric Diggory.
