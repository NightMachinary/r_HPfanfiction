Something nobody has mentioned yet but I feel is important is that when people in the HP world call out last names they aren't just calling the name. Understatement is a very British thing. When they say something what they don't say matters just as much if not more and what they do say is often filtered more for people they don't like.

When Malfoy calls Ron a Weasley he isn't just saying the name. He's calling Ron everything associated with the Weasley name, he's implying poverty, blood-traitor etc. When Ron says Malfoy he means spoilt little bigoted cunt, Death Eater etc, all the negative things about that family. This works because it's a small world where they know of each other.
