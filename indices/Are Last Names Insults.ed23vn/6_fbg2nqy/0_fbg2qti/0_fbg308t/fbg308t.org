It's a reminder his family is dead. Harry is all alone. It doesn't apply to all situations but a surname isn't just your name it's the family name, attacking the name is an attack on the family. There are plenty of times people use surnames normally, I walked to school with three boys called William, we used surnames normally but if you're using it as an insult you're making a dig at their family in some way.
