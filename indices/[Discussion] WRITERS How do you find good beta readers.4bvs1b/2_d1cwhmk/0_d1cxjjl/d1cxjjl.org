Not really a specific set of tasks as such- I'm just looking for someone with an eye for detail, characterisation and good with cutting superfluous scenes/parts, and plot pacing. Most betas hovering around seem to only focus on the grammar/language aspects of pieces, which isn't really what I'm looking for a second opinion on.

Another difficulty is that the fic is a Teddy Lupin next-gen piece, & next-gen is a little less popular than other eras.
