I could see what I can do for you. I'm not a native speaker, so my grammar and language is average at best, but I think I got a good sense of flow, detail and characters (its kind of my job, so yea... I hope so). Its, after all, one of those things that doesn't change all that much with language.

If you find no one else, send me a PM and maybe we can work something out.
