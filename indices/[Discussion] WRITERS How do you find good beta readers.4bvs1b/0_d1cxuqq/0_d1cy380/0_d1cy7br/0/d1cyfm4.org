No problem!

It's a sequel to 'The Escapades of Teddy Lupin' (29 chapters, only a few chapters were beta-d, and though I'd like to go back and work on it, I don't have the time right now) called 'The Skeletons in Teddy Lupin's Closet'. A few chapters are up now on FFN (my username's the same as here), but I'm taking a posting hiatus bc uni. I plan to write the entire story, and get it beta-d before resuming posting again. It'll probably be the same length as the first (150k words), and because of the length/the fact that it's a sequel, I think a lot of betas are a bit hesitant at taking it on- which I completely understand (although to be fair, I haven't exactly asked anyone specifically yet- just put out a general request on a forum I'm a part of)
