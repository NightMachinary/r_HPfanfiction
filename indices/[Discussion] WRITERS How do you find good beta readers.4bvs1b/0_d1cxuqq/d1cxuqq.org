Truthfully its bloody difficult.

A huge number listed in the FFN directory don't bother even responding to messages let alone take on stories at the minute.

I posted here and in two other subreddits and in total had about dozen people offer to help; of which when contacted perhaps 5 took the story and 3 bothered to respond with feedback and only 2 with notes which were particularly helpful. To those wonderful redditors I am so, so grateful.

I have IRL friends who write but aren't part of HP fandom but I still asked for their help in their areas of expertise - structure, plotting etc.

Personally I think the best way to get a good Beta is to BE a good Beta. I really wanted someone who was willing to do what I do for my authors. i.e. Commit to the story from concept to delivery. To turn around chapters in a timely fashion. I always aim to return notes/coverage to my authors within 48 hour. If it has to be longer because of real life I will still touch base and give a hard deadline for my notes. I will work with an author on any part of their process. Outlining. Line edits. Brit picking or simple proof reading.

That's what I do - I thought that was pretty standard in writing circles. Apparently I was mistaken.

That said the best way is post where the readers are.

Be specific with what you are writing (Is it a drabble? One-Shot or 150K epic?) and its genre and pairing if any.

Be specific about what you need, and the time frame you need it in.

Be prepared to take on more Betas than you need to allow for those who drop away, and for those whose responses you find unhelpful or who's style is not a good fit for you.

Don't give up - even if you don't get what you need right off the bat push on and publish you will probably find people who connect with the material among your reviewers and can always cultivate a relationship with one of them.
