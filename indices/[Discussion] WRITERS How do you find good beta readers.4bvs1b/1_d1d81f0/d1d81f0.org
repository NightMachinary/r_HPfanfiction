I've got 4 of the best Betas in the fandom.

One of them I found here on [[/r/hpfanfiction]] in another thread about finding Betas.

The other three I found using a letter I made and sent out to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/book/Harry-Potter/?&languageid=1&rating=4&ppage=202][a list of ff.net Betas]] who had recently updated their profiles, figuring that would make it more likely that they would be frequently online and willing to help. Check through their published work and see if they know grammar, punctuation, etc. Then start mass-mailing,

Here's an example of the form letter that worked for me:

Hello [Recipient],

My name is [Author Name] and I'm looking for a Beta reader for a story I'm writing in the [Fandom] universe. Here are the relevant details:

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in beta'ing, please reply in a PM and I'll send you the first chapter. If not, no hard feelings.

You're going to get a lot of rejections and even more who just won't reply. Keep at it. I promise you that having betas makes you a better writer.
