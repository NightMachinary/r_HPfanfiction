Taure's victoria potter fic seems like it'd fit a bit? There's some classism in it though so I'm not quite sure.

Cauchy's fic, "Blood Crest" also has some unique wizard culture, 'wizard-reading' though there's classism between purebloods and racism towards squibs in it. It's a very good fic overall.

Also this one which has lots of worldbuilding but is quite short [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9570961/1/The-Serpent-and-The-Crown]]
