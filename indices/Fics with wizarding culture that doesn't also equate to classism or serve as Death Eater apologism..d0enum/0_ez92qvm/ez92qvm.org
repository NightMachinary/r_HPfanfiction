If you haven't read Percy Take the Wheel I think you will really enjoy it. It delves into Molly Weasley's home-making magic (hedge witchery), general culture of the world through Percy's eyes, and also is a great family story. It takes two underrated things (Percy, Homemaking) and combines them into something really interesting.
