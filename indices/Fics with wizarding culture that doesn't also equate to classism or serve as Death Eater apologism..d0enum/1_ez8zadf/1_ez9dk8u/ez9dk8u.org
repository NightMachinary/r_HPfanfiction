I remember a fic I've read in Russian years ago where they had soup swimming races in Knockturn Alley. Like, they had a giant tank of soup, and competitors swam in it, pieces of vegetables and all. It wasn't even a complete crack fic, iirc, although I don't remember anything else from it and not sure how to search it even.
