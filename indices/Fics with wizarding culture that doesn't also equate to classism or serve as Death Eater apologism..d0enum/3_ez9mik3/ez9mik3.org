The Lord and Lady flashy high society stuff with amazing magical powers that only the Purest of the Purebloods posess is just more flashy, I guess.

I remember a few stories where Hedge Witches, and other less formal forms of magical use was the topic. Often it was Molly Weasley who used the magic even though she had gone to Hogwarts.

That and there's a few stories that brings up Suibb culture.
