Yes, I really like these “life of normal wizards” stories (or I was thinking about the term “magicians' realism”, nothing to do with magic realism, which I despise). That's half of the quality of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] stories.

That “story of a normal artisan in Hogsmeade (with some twists)” is exactly what I like on linkffn(Interwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray by Katinka31) (its sequels are loosing exactly this and they are just silly fluff without any substance whatsoever). Also, while reading the story it came to me how much I prefer this story (no spoilers, so I cannot explain fully) than the fairy-tale nonsense which is in DH. There is a huge difference for me between the Harry Potter magical world, which is (with addition of magical powers) more or less rational, middle-class, down to the earth, more or less realistic, and the fairy tale, supernatural, magical (in the Muggle sense of the word) crap which happens in DH and which is the dirty mark of so many fanfic stories. There are neither supermen, gods, supernatural intangible beings, nor kings and nobility in the original HP world, it is all about tradesmen, craftsmen, small ministry officials, and it makes much more pleasant experience than Scion Longbottom with Lady Potter (nee Greengrass) can ever be.

Also, [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC]] which has exactly this spirit, but it is even better because it is a historical novel.
