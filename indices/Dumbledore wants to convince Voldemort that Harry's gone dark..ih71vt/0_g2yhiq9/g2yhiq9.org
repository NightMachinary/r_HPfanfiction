"Join me, Potter. Together, we could---"

"Okay, sure."

Voldemort froze as his brain processed what he was hearing. "Did you just agree to join me? This isn't some sort of amusing miscommunication in the making?"

"Nope. I totally and completely one hundred percent want to work with you now," Harry said with a wide grin. "So what do we do first? Murder? Torture? Maybe a little destruction of property? I'm particularly good at arson, you know."

"I, umm...I was actually planning to kill you now," Voldemort replied sheepishly. "I was really only asking you to join because it seemed like the thing to do. It never occurred to me that you might actually accept."

"Don't worry, even the best Dark Lords make mistakes. Why, just half an hour ago, I was having so much fun turning an acromantula inside out that I didn't notice Cedric catching up to me. Luckily, I was able to distract him with some silly idea of sharing the glory of victory before he remembered proper spider anatomy. Otherwise, he might have told Dumbledore that I was using dark magic."

Harry paused and stared at the cooling corpse that was once Cedric Diggory. "Well, I guess murder works too."
