Not really, I've always shipped HP/HG but I also like luna.

I guess Lunar Harmony exists for indecisive people like me lol

I don't hate other ships but I can't get interested in them so I don't read them. Like, if you pair Harry with tonks most of the time the fic will be centered around lemons and sex jokes.

If you pair him with DG the fic tends to be lots of boring politics (to me), same with draco.

I don't intent to talk bad about other ships, that's just what I've seen so far.
