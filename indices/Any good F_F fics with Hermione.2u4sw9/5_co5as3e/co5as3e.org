I really like Roundabout Destiny. It is a SB/HG pairing but not in a creepy way. Hermione dies and is brought back a Hermione Potter, fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She sets to fix the future with her past knowledge. Starts in year one. Very good! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny]]
