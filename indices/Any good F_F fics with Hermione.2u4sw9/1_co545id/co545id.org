Can you clarify 'good' in this request?

I know some fics where Hermione and another witch have some (mmph! Oh yeah!) good times together and some others where she explores a relationship with another main cast character and some others where she falls under the influence of older, more powerful... /influences/ (one of the Black sisters or her mentor the cat, usually).
