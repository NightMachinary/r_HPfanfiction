I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/][Murder Most Horrid]] which is a Bellatrix/Hermione fic set in an AU where Voldemort never existed and Bellatrix isn't a raving lunatic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]] is a Hermione/Ginny time travel fic where they're sent back in time by Dumbledore during the final battle. Definitely recommend this one.

I also second Crazy Little Things, Aucune Defense Pour Toi and Written in the Body recommended by [[/u/wordhammer]].

One's I've read but it's been too long to remember how good they were:
