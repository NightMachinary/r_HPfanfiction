I mean even in canon we only get Harry's POV. Maybe Snape loved Lily because he was lonely and she was his only real friend. Maybe he had a big ol' crush on James. Maybe when his unrequited crush (James) fell for Lily and started taking her away from, as well as rejecting his love, he became bitter and turned to the dark side. WE DONT KNOW.
