Absolutely. Seeing someone's profile can tell a story itself. If a story seems ambiguous, yet their other stories have bad pairings like Harry/Draco, of the profile has long lists of stuff that seems like it would be on a 13 year old's myspace page, then you know it's time to go. If someone were to visit my profile, they would see the disclaimer at the very top saying that most of my older stories are shit, which should help people decide if they want to read them or not.
