I check after I've read a story I really enjoyed. I want to see if there are any other fics by them that I might like, and I usually check out their favorite stories. I like when authors put up the order their fics should be read in (if a series), or a more specific summary. I don't use tumblr much, but I will follow them if I really enjoy their work. A lot of authors tend to post links to other sites (GE, LJ, Ashwinder etc.) they're on, especially if they have a more mature version of a story posted elsewhere.
