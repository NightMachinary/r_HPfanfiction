Nope. I check the reviews, and if there's nothing deal-breaking, I just read the story.

But if there's weird stuff, I check the profile to see if it's a deal-breaking author trend or a genuine plot device.

One author wrote in his/her profile that the story would consistently use "tow the line" instead of the correct "toe the line". Because everyone used the wrong expression anyway. That's nice. One of my pet peeves that noped me right out of there. I'm a grammar nazi, in case you wondered.

  "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles][You're a Christian now, Harry!]]" Hagrid cried proudly.

  Harry smiled but then interrogated, "But *how do I be a Christian?* I don't know how!"

  Hagrid grinned widely. "There is only one place to learn that-Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles!"

Ah. You're a raging Christian, and are deathly afraid that your children will turn into actual witches. Have you even read the books? And you sorely need a beta reader. Unless your bible expressly forbids it?

Holy crap. Literally.

That particular author had nothing on her profile at all. Not that she needed it. And the story had 9000+ reviews, which proves once and for all that it's useless to sort by reviews as an indicator of quality.

  Dumbledore becomes Reverend Albus Dumbledore, who is married and STRAIGHT. *Hermoine* is Dumbledore's daughter (for some reason?) and is described as “modest” and “obedient.” And the commandments are shoe-horned whether applicable or not, like when she addresses coveting thy neighbor's wife while introducing Harry to the children's dormitories??

It's Herm*io*ne, you illiterate heathen!

Another pet peeve: Spinning portkeys. I first encountered them in "Power of the Press". It was a valid plot device, and necessary for the plot.

Then every other story started to use spinning portkeys. This happens when authors read so many fanfics that they're unable to distinguish fanon from canon.

It's annoying. By all means create an alternative universe. But if you change too much for no discernible reason, then it's no longer Harry Potter.
