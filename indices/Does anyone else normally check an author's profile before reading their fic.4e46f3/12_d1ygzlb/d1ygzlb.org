I do. I read mostly romance and I always check to see if an author mentions their age in their profile and then I compare that to the date the fic I'm interested in was first published. I skip any fics I come across written by anyone 18 years old or younger. I just don't feel that the typical fic author that young has enough life experience with relationships/romance to pull off writing a believable romance story. Sorry to all you teenage writers out there!
