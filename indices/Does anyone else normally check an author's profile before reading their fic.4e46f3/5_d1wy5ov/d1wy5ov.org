Absolutely.

If it's an author that I'm just hearing of for the first time, or I've read one or two stories, then I go just to see if there are any other stories I might enjoy. If I'm not there because of a story, it's to see if they hold a similar fanon as I do and then scour their stories and favorites.

In addition, you can find out a lot about how someone writes with regard to grammar, spelling, all that jazz, as well as their "style" of writing, if you will.
