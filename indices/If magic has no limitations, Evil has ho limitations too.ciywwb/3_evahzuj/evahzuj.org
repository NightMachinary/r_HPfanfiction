In terms similar to computers, the information is there, it's just not acessable, in my opinion. So in OOTP, Harry can physically see the No. 12 Grimmauld, he's simply prevented from using that information, and therefore his brain doesn't recognize the sight. It's similar to bad sectors on a hard drive; the information is there, and being let in on the secret allows your brain to 'recognize' the data.
