I'm confused. Are you forgetting they were outside the property in DH or am I misunderstanding you? And how was the Black residence famous?

The Fidelius hides the property from view. It doesn't erase the knowledge of it. In DH, I think they discussed having to land on the step. Harry almost slipped and a Death Eater saw his foot or something like that.

  "The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!"
