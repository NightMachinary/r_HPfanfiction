Yes, both fanfics are great, but it's a shame that they have not updated them in as much time.

If you want to read a good Star Wars crossover, I recommend linkffn(A Horse For the Force) It is not of this fandom but I think you will enjoy it anyway.

The author also has this linkffn(Magic of the Force) a Harry/Aayla, if you do not like the above (which personally I like more) you can give a view to this.
