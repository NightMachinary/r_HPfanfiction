Ironically Last Second Saviour is itself a ripoff of one of bluminous8's abandoned stories, Sword and Magic, there is a version of about 12ish chapters somewhere on the internet. Bit smuttier and not as much of a clear story as plums one, but I was the same in finding this one worse as well as being a ripoff of a ripoff.
