I think it would work, but maybe not in the best way.

Fire needs three things to keep burning: oxygen, fuel, and heat.

Water stops fire from burning by cooling it off and separating it from the air supply. Most fire extinguishers work purely by creating a barrier between the oxygen and the fuel.

Shrinking a room would reduce the quantity of oxygen available, so on that front it would help. However, what oxygen is still there would still be in contact with whatever is burning so it would continue to burn until the O2 ran out.

The real challenge here is what happens to the heat when the room shrinks? There's a bunch of thermal energy in there, and that energy has to go somewhere. If it can just be done away with via magic, then they should do that instead of shrinking the room. No heat, no fire. If the heat cannot be removed via magic, then shrinking the room would just concentrate that heat into a smaller space, potentially causing much worse damage to the contents. Fire is not the only way to destroy things with heat.

Overthinking magic is kind of my jam...
