You'd need a spell to automatically vanish unconstrained phlogiston and apply a cooling effect - specifying the cold humours of earth and water specifically - to all matter within the spell's effect that is actively dephlogisticating.

(When you're dealing with magic, of course, the humours, phlogiston and luminiferous aether are all real things, and their discrediting as scientific theories are all solid successes of the Obliviators.)
