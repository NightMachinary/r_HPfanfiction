I think the simpler path would be to apply some sort of magic to the surfaces in the room that basically stops combustion. That handles normal fires. Magical fires, you might prevent those from igniting the surface with the equivalent of a shield of some sort. If they cast fiendfyre or the equivalent, then you'd want magic that gets everyone the FUCK out of that room because they're screwed if they stay.

If you evacuate the air, or at least the oxygen, then having something that casts a quick bubble-head charm on the room's occupants wouldn't be a bad idea. You might not even need to evacuate the air, if an area transfiguration can swap out the oxygen for something inert - and then back again afters.
