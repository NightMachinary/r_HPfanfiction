I'd like to echo the advice that you should be specific what you're looking for. Know your weaknesses. If you're already a solid writer, but don't have a very firm grasp on HP canon or the fanfiction landscape, an old hand who's been around for a long time can help you steer clear of cliches. If you know HP backwards and forwards but your technical writing isn't quite there, you want someone who's willing to go line-by-line and help you improve.

I post my story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/][What You Leave Behind]], in Dark Lord Potter's "Work by Author" section (often long before a chapter shows up on FF.net), and the quality of feedback I get there is night and day compared to my other main source of information about how my work is being received, FF.net reviews.

For one thing, posting your work in a forum allows for a discussion to take place. You can follow the thread of the entire conversation; the whole thing is transparent. With a single beta, it's easy for it to become an echo chamber where your ideas aren't really progressing and you're kind of spinning your wheels.

From what I've read, historically DLP has a bit of a reputation for being unnecessarily harsh. I can't speak for what it was in the past, but I can tell you that as a relatively new member of the community, I haven't found that to be the case at all. People won't hesitate to speak their mind, often bluntly, about what worked for them and what didn't, but as a writer, you should consider this kind of honesty to be more valuable than gold.
