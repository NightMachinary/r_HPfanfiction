Depends on what your aim is. I would definitely recommend it for an amateur writer trying to get better. There are plenty of folks over there who will readily help out with basic stuff: punctuating dialogue, show vs. tell, characters driving the plot, adverb abuse, etc.

It's not a writing seminar, but you will get a sense, very quickly, of the areas where you need to improve.

It's a mistake to think of DLP as one cohesive group - tastes evolve with a changing userbase, opinions mellow or solidify over time, and well-respected authors come and go. But, yes, they do have high standards in terms of writing quality. In general, for a story to be held in high regard on DLP, it's not enough that it has good ideas or cool twists on canon - those ideas have to be executed well.
