A forum seems great because there's multiple people looking at your stuff and they can contribute as much or as little as they like. But would you still recommend DLP for a very amateurish writer, or for someone trying to write a borderline crack fic? I'm not familiar with DLP (besides the excellent C2 on FFN) but I heard they have very high standards.
