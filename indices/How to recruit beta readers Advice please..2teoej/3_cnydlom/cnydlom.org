You can post here or go to the beta section of fanfiction.net. There's a complete community of people who say they can beta categorized by their expertise (grammar, continuity, etc.) and category (General, Harry potter, Naruto, etc.) That would be two places to start. Also, make sure you put your expectations for your beta up front, some people may not work as quickly as you need.
