I haven't read that particular fic so I'm not positive these hit the same vibe. But all are great, fairly action packed and have a Draco/Harry pairing.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/753415][Paradox]] and the sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/753418][Convergence]] are a cool time travel Draco goes back to end of 5th year that's a canon rehash but with a twist. The adventure is the DH stuff.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1227880][All of our secrets laid bare]] is an auror partner fic with a really good slow build.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/330906][The Boy Who Only Lived Twice]] is a "secret identity" fic like I've never read before. In it, Draco and Harry are both unspeakables - spies who use polyjuice to hunt criminals and work in pairs. They are partners but neither knows who the other really is. Until Draco finds out Harry is Harry...

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164][Eclipse]] is a classic Drarry where Draco captures Harry for Voldemort, has a crisis of conscience and helps Harry escape in an epic journey to evade the death eaters.
