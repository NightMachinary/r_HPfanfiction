You know, initially I wrote this off because it didn't have the tag of Harry/Luna and so I read it last of the fics suggested to me. But now that I've finished the accidental animagus and have moved onto animagus at war I'm sorry I didn't start with it. This is an excellent fic, thank you for your suggestion.
