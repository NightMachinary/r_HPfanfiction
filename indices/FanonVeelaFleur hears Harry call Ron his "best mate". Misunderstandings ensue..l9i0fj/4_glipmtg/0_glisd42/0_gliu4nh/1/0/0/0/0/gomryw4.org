Did you know this is the second highest voted comment I've made? Right after something about Cerberus and Hades being fanon!Snap - something I still can't understand. How is it that I can be educational and accurate about a bunch of history shit, and yet that is highest rating? Reddit is weird. People are weird. Life is weird. I'm weird. Everything is weird.
