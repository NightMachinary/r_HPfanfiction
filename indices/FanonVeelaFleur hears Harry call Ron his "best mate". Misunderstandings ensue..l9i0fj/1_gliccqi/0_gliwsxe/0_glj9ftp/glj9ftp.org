It's on my list to write, but there's more than a hundred other things on that list as well (not including my already uploaded WIPs), so I can't promise it'll be up any time soon - it will definitely be written eventually though!

I'm just thankful I could bastardise it with that other prompt about Daphne Greengrass the Slytherin Sweetheart from a little while back. One extra idea instead of two is real nice. :D
