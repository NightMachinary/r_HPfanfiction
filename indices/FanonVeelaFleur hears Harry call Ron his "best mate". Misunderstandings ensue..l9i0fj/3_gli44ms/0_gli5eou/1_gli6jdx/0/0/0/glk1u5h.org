Got bored, wrote this at 3am on my phone lol:

"Voldemort! Use avada kedavra!" I yelled, pointing at the first of my opponent's two battlers.

"Volde-volde-volde-volde-voldeMORT!" Voldemort screamed, blasting out an emerald green beam. It was a direct hit, sending the target flying backwards before crumpling against a wall.

I grinned as the omnipresent narrator confirmed the result. "It was super effective! James died!"

"James, no!" My opponent cried, holding back tears as he commanded his final Pottermon. I would have preferred to continue Voldemort's offensive, but as this was a turn based game, I could not.

I settled for making a quick cuppa instead.

Looking back up to the fight, I wondered why my opponent hadn't attacked. Sipping my tea, I realised they must have used a status move. What a fool! Who uses status moves when you can just use a strong attack for big damage? Well, it was my turn now and I knew just what to do. Voldemort knew what to do. Charging up his Avada Kedavra attack once more, Voldemort aimed at his target.

"Voldemoooort!" He fired. Another direct hit. We had won!

"It was super effective! Lily died!" The narrator said. "??? sent out Harry Potter!"

Wait what? But there he was, he'd been there the whole time, but to small and insignificant for me to have noticed earlier. Must be some death fodder. Might as well have a low level Pottermon to sacrifice for a free heal. With it being such a low level, Voldemort would easily outspeed. But it wouldn't really matter too much, the battle is won anyway. "Voldemort! Finish this with Avada Kedavra!"

"VoldeMOOOOORRT" Voldemort fired a final Avada Kedavra, striking the small Pottermon right in the face.

"Voldemort used Avada Kedavra! It was super effective!" The narrator began, but what it would say next would make my blood turn cold. "Foe Harry Potter hung on using its focus sash! Harry Potter used mirror coat!"

And just like that, Voldemort died in a bright white flash, struck by twice the power of the endured Avada Kedavra. "VOLDEMOOORRT!"

With that loss, it was time for me to scurry back to the Pottermon centre and try again later. Everything turned black and all I could hear was that accursed narrator.

"You were overwhelmed by your defeat! You panicked and lost Â£5,000!"

Fuck.
