I think that would depend on how the animagus transformation works in the universe you imagine. I've read fics that what happens in one form translates directly into the other. So a wound to the leg in your animagus form translates to a wound to your leg in your human form. I've read other fics where when you transform to your other form and any wounds that had been suffered are not present in the other form. Allowing either time or getting to help to fix the problem.

Now that deals with physical damage. The question is what happens to food? If it doesn't transform to something "safe" then in your example if Sirius chows down on a lb of chocolate just before he transforms then his dog form should get sick. And transforming back should fix the problem.

Maybe what happens is that magic protects the transformation such that if the food is "safe" for that form when eaten, then when you change forms the the energy/nutrients remain safe in your other form.

Or it could just be that since he is not really a dog and only takes the shape of one and the abilities (not the internal biology) then what he eats has no impact on his dog form unless it's poisonous to his human form.
