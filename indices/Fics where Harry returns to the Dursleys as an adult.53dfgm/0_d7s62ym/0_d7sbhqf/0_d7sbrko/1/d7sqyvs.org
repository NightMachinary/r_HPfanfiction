Yup, Dudley probably had the capacity to be averagely clever, but he never was made to, being almost literally spoon-fed throughout all his developing years. It wasn't just the weight that whoever it was was referring to when they said his parents had ruined him, it was his brain. He was a very screwed up young man.

Your story is hilarious, I don't think Dudley is too silly. It obviously never occurred to him that Marge would be so poisonous. If anything, I thought Ginny was a little too dumb - the word electricity isn't too hard to remember. Nor is DJ too hard after being corrected at least twice. I get that it's humour, but for being raised by a Muggle enthusiast and having muggleborn besties, the Weasley kids ignorance is rather silly (Ron having no idea how to say telephone...)
