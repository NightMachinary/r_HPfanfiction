I dunno, I often see fics where dudley has suddenly smartened up and they just don't ring true for me - even when he was acting nicer to Harry it was made clear that he was still a bit of a moron. I don't think that stops him being kind or worthy of Harry's friendship, but even in DH he was like "why isn't Harry coming?" Which suggests, to me, that he's pretty clueless about how little the rest of his family cares about Harry. But yes, it was a little contrived for the purposes of humour, and it's my head canon that everyone's memories were modified except for dudley, hyacinth, Vernon and petunia. In future next gen fics hyacinth might pop up but I don't think I'll ever focus too heavily on them.
