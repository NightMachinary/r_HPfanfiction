Darn, I like the character of Hyacinth, and I kinda want more. Maybe Hyacinth is so horrified at Harry's childhood, along with Ginny, that they team up and force him into counselling, and she tries putting everyone else into therapy as well, especially Ginny for the Diary, Ron and Hermione for /everything/, and the other Weasleys start refusing to meet her.
