Hi steel,

Just want to express my sincere appreciation for the work that you've done on your stories in general and SoA in specific. You've blown me away with your immersive storytelling.

Whilst it's unfortunate to hear about the delay I fully understand that these things are of secundary priority. Hope that whatever's keeping you busy is good news!
