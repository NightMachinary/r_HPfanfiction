I'm interested to hear about these too!

...

Oh, yes, concerning Shadow of Angmar: The news isn't great. The next chapter is not especially close to being completed and I have not written anything in more than a month. I have simply found myself with less free time this year than I previously had, and while I often think about continuing the story (and often add new notes to my outline), I rarely find myself with sufficient time to both get myself into the correct head space, and actually achieve some noteworthy writing. I realise that these are excuses, and not especially good ones at that, but it's really all I can offer at the moment.

On the flip side, I'm always only one 'Good Week' away from a new chapter.
