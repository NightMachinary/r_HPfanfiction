I don't know if you're looking for feedback or not, but I decided to give it a try and, honestly, found my interest waning by the third paragraph. My problem was that everything is so incredibly long: the sentences, the paragraphs, the descriptions -- it's so bloated with information that figuring out what's actually important requires extra effort. Consequently, that made my attentiveness wander.

Take, for example, the third paragraph. At it's core, it uses Harry's office as a way to describe a little bit of his character and highlight the stature of his station. It's also very long. My question is: does it have to be? Are all the details -- like that he has portraits of his ancestors on the walls, the furniture is brown and shiny, or that his toilet has a propensity for chit-chat -- actually necessary? Does any of that move the plot along?

Then, there's the /way/ it's written. And I want to stress that it's not bad. There's a certain cadence, a pleasing lilt. But it's also very, very long. Almost every sentence, in fact, feels like it's filled to the brim.

There's, of course, nothing wrong with adding a long, detailed sentence every once in a while, but if that's not interspersed by smaller ones, then it begins to read like Dostoevsky on steroids. It's hard.

There's a really fantastic quote by Gary Provost that highlights this issue. I'll copy it below:

“This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals--sounds that say listen to this, it is important.”

Those are my thoughts. Others may have opposing views; that's fine. If my review was unwanted, I apologize in advance.
