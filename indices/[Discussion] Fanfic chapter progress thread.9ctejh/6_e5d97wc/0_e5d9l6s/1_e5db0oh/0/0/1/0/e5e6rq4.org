Well, getting a meaningful review on FFN is like finding an oasis in the Sahara: pleasing when it happens, but boy is it rare.

I just want to add that there's a lot of fundamentally good things: an expansive vocabulary, an obvious proficiency with syntax and sentence structure, and so forth. It's just brought down by what I see as a desire to describe everything in a way that could use a little tweaking. And that strikes a little close to home to me, because I was -- and still am probably -- just like that.

Thing is, readers have imagination. They can fill in the blanks; there's no need to explain every little piece of the puzzle. Figuring that out is still the hardest part of writing...for me, at least.

Also, FFN caters mostly to a crowd that prefers easy literature (and there's nothing wrong with that). But anything overly complex won't be followed.
