Sekrit Projekt by Chilord sadly unfinished but well worth it.

It's not on the usual sites so no bot, but it can be found at [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]].

The premise of the fic is that in the summer after 3rd year Harry discovers the map has more of the marauders in it than he initially thought. Interacting with the map inspires him, and through him Ron, into living up to his father's legacy.
