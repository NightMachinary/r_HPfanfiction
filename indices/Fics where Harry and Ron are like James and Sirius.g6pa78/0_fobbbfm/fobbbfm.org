Harry and Ron's 58 year old souls (rather than just memories) are thrown into their 14 year old bodies. Underage drinking, sexually inappropriate humour and no bashing. Complete.

The thing is, Harry and Ron being like James and Sirius isn't exactly possible. A big part of Ron's character, even in the last book, is his inability to deal with his insecurities. Of course, it often seems horribly exaggerated.

As for Harry, if he's anymore competent than he is in canon, he wouldn't try to use a Disarming Charm against Voldemort, and it simply isn't possible to be competent enough to beat a Dark Lord when you're 17 and Dark Lord is 70+.
