He's a champion in a pretty well-known fic. I don't remember exactly - I think it's /Pureblood Pretense,/ but I'm not sure.

There are plenty of Slytherin champions, most Slytherin!Harry fics will have him as the champion. I'd search either DLP or FFN for AU 4th year stories and you'll stumble across something eventually.
