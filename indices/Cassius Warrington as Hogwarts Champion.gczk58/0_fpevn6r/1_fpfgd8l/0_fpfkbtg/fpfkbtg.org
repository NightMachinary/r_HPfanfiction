  The closest is Dumbledore saying the Goblet picks "which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup".

  I'll give you her poor showing in the lake, but I'm not sure how a skirt is less suitable to wear while fighting dragons than the robes everybody else was wearing.

I've just reread the scene. The dragon snorted and her skirt briefly caught fire. In my flawed memory, it created an association between Fleur wearing a skirt and losing points as a result of it, probably indicating some implicit sexism on my part. I apologise and will edit my post. Thank you for pointing the error out.
