I don't know any, but here's my speculation:

*What would happen in canonverse?* Slytherins---and Warrington first and foremost---would use this as an opportunity to lord it over all other Houses. Snape would take every opportunity to award House points. Warrington would probably do reasonably well, since GoF wouldn't pick someone weak. (Well, there /was/ that time it picked a champion who panicked after being attacked by some creatures noted for their weakness and failed a task, and whom Barty Crouch Jr didn't even bother to Imperius during the Third Task; but maybe that was the best Beauxbatons had to offer.)

*What would happen in a typical fic with this premise?* The other three Houses (and Dumbledore) would take their frustration at yet another example of Slytherin superiority on the poor, misunderstood Slytherins. Warrington himself would turn out to be more friendly and supportive to Harry than Cedric, and introduce him to Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass, who happens to have all of Hermione's intellect and cunning but none of her flaws.

*Edit:* As pointed out by [[/u/The_Truthkeeper]], I had misremembered: Fleur wearing a skirt to the first task had nothing to do with said skirt getting set on fire by the dragon.
