Blood Magic by Gateway Girl linkao3(10678911). The hair-cutting doesn't happen until near the end of this 84-chapter fic.

Hair has social significance in this fic. A male with long hair is indicating he has no senior male relatives. Harry grows his hair long because they have to hide that Severus is his father, and symbolically cuts it when it comes out and he acknowledges the relationship. There's also a female student who wears her hair short to indicate she's not seeking a husband.
