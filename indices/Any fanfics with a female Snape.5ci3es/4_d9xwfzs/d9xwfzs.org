I'm working on a fic where the Marauders and Snape have been gender swapped to females, with a pauper Sally Snape, who is dating Lyle Evans, the rich Muggleborn from the "posher part of Spinners End", but is seeing Slytherin Seeker Regulus Black on the side.

It's a story where, given the choice, does Lyle split up with his girlfriend to date the Maraudette, Jenny Potter, the granddaughter of a famous Wizengamot member or stay with Sally and stop her from joining Bellatrix Black and Lucius Malfoy in becoming a Death Eater.
