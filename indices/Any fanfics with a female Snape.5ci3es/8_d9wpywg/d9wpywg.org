I'm not sure it would make Snape a relevant character at all. FemSnape would either just be another Death Eater or become a family friend to the Potters. The prophecy might not ever reach Voldemort. FemSnape could just be a maternal figure for Harry. Harry would undoubtedly start Hogwarts with an advantage in Potions.

You could(read: shouldn't) swap the Snape/Lily dynamic to FemSnape/James although that's just convoluted and pointless.

Edit: my point was that making Snape a woman would be utterly pointless lol
