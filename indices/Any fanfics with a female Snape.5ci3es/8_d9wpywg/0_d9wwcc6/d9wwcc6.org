Fem!Snape, like male!Snape, could be just another Death Eater who overheard a prophecy, took it to Voldemort, and then panicked when she realized the target was Lily, her estranged friend (and deeply hidden love).

Granted, I doubt the Marauders would target fem!Snape quite so physically, lest they gain reputations as woman-beating perverts.
