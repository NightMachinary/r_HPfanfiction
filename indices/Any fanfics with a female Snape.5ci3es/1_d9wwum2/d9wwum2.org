I'm thinking fem!Snape lashed out at Lily after Lily turned her down and that's when Lily kicked her to the curb. There's need to involve the Marauders in that particular broken friendship, since I doubt the Marauders could especially bully Snape without everyone mocking them for 'having a crush' on the nerdy poor Slytherin girl or without breaking any rules of chivalry they were raised with.

Motivation-wise, it's a similar situation to canon: Snape was in an emotionally vulnerable situation and lashed out when she felt humiliated by being rejected 'by a girl who's only a mudblood anyway!'

I feel like Snape and Bellatrix would have an especially antagonistic relationship as they're both trying to be the unquestioned best female exception to the male-dominated Death Eater group (Bellatrix the most vicious and devoted DE, Snape the most indispensable DE) and both hold the Carrow woman in utter contempt for being stupid and yet still being grouped with them.
