I think you don't /need/ a more positive meeting prior to the sorting - the change though needs to come in during the first 3-4 years or so, and in a way that opens up Malfoy's eyes. It can certainly work (and Harry having a friendship with both Malfoy and Hermione is a very 'easy' vector to forcing them to interact and changing Malfoy's opinion), but it can also evolve from a bad initial relationship imo.

Canon Malfoy gets swept up into the only way that he knows/was raised - and by 5th-6th year, he's too far along to make it believable to switch suddenly (and has done some pretty iffy acts :/ ).

But the first few years, he's still a child, really. And even with people he's rivals with, I could see a realization creeping in that his upraising isn't exactly correct. Stuff like little tweaks earlier on (eg - being more jealous at Hermione's success in classes, which runs counter to the idea of purebloods being superior to muggleborn, or the basilisk paralyzing some of Draco's friends, showing that the Heir of Slytherin isn't /really/ that picky about who gets hurt as long as it gives him power). I think that we can take the initial reactions of the spoiled, bratty, blood-purist taught Malfoy and have the first few years change him slightly - to the point where, the first time that he's confronted with what his father's ideology /really/ means, it makes him balk.

That's my thinking, at least. I can see the appeal of a well done Dramione fic (similar to a well done Haphne one that doesn't have her as perfect from the start) - but to me, a lot of it would be in seeing the evolution of the character in a different way than canon, while still starting off with some enmity.
