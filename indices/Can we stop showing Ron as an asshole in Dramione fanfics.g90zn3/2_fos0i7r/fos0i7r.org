It might be because I've just watched La La Land and I happen to think the last 10 minutes of that movie are as close to perfect as an ending of a film gets, but even though I will ship Romione until the day I die, I would really like to read some stories post-canon, post-war where they simply grow apart but remain on good terms. Even if the characters don't end up together, they still shared something magical and wonderful and walked away to happiness and success on their own with warm feelings towards one another still.

I've only ever read one Dramione fic I liked and Ron was dead... I don't buy them as a romantic couple, but I LOVE stories where they are forced to work together or spend time with each other and spend the whole time winding each other up and taking sarcastic jabs at each other. They're my favourite!
