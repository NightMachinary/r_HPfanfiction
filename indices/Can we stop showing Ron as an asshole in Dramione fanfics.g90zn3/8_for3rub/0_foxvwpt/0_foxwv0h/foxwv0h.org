I really like Ron and can't stand the level of bashing he gets in fanfics.

Having said that, expecting good Ron in a Dramione fic is like trying to take out a lotus without getting mud on you. They're trying to make Draco and Hermione a couple. All the logic and canon characteristics goes out of the window at that.
