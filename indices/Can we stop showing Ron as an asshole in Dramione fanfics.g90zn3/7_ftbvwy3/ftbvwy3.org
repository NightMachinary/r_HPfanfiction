Just stayed up all night reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13530716/1/The-Disappearances-of-Draco-Malfoy][this fic]]

It's a pretty new WIP. The writing is fantastic, the story is fresh, and Ron is----very very much like he is in the books. Hermione basically goes, sorry I think we missed our chance. And he's not pleased about it, but in a very canon Ron type of way.
