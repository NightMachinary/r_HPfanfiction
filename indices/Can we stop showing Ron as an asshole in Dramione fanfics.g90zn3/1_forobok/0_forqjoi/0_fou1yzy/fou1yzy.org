I would argue that even 17 year old Draco, who realised he didn't want to be a murderer, found the murder of the muggle studies teacher difficult and tried to deny that the trio were his school mates, to his Death Eater family.

I think it's easy to forget sometimes how young they are and how difficult it would have been for someone like Draco to change their world view while living with a murderer (that loved him dearly). He was only 16 when Voldemort moved into his home and held meetings full of Death Eaters in there. Only 16 when he was told to murder one of the most powerful and knowledgeable wizards in the world, under threat of his parents being murdered.

Would it be easier to keep going through his life with the same beliefs? Absolutely.

Is it possible that he could change his mind? I think so. Especially when he now would need to align the memories of torture with his views of what those calling for blood supremacy actually meant by it. You can get PTSD by seeing things happen. Particularly given that the light side saved him. The fic would need to lay out a gradual change before the relationship started, but I do think it could happen.

Likewise, there would need to be some very strong character building on Hermione's part.
