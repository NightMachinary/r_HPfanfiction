The reason I specify early on is that, at least during/after 6th year, he's already started to act as a Death Eater and done some pretty bad stuff. His canon (very slight) redemption arc does provide some sympathy, but not enough to lay the groundwork for a satisfying relationship with Hermione, I think.

If it's well written enough, it certainly can be done with almost any starting point - but I think it'd still need to go with a very charitable interpretation of his actions in years 5-7 to make it possible, which is still a change in my book.
