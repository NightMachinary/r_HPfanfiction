In canon, sure. But the point of fanfiction is to change things!

Canon Draco is a spoiled rich kid who idolizes his father and his ideology, and parrots what he's been taught. But at the same time, the tenants of that ideology are disproven fairly easily - and in the person of Hermione, at least in the idea that muggleborn are inferior (given her academic achievements).

It's possible to have the character evolve very differently than they did in canon - Hogwarts covers formative years, and I struggle to imagine that a 12 year old has their ideological view of the world fixed to a degree that there's 0 possibility of it ever changing. That'd be a pretty pessimistic and gloomy way of looking at people, IMO :(
