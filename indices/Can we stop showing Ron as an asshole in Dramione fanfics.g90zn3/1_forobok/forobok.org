I can't read dramione it breaks my sense of disbelief. Draco is a blood purist, why would he ever look to muggleborn Hermione as a love interest! To Hermione, Draco is bigoted, calls her mudblood, a bully and attempted murderer, why would she want to get involved with him? A relationship between these two makes no sense.
