As the (canon) romantic rival, Ron bashing is fairly prevalent within the fandom, but there is plenty of Dramione which either treats him more fairly or just doesn't dwell overlong on the character.

For that purpose, you may enjoy linkao3(16832419) Chosen, which treats every character involved as flawed and sympathetic.
