I think the trope became so big because people argue against it. I don't care for black Hermione, but the amount of hate I have seen under black Hermione fanart made me willing to defend it. People are annoyed by the outright racism and start adding other ethnicities to annoy the people that can't fathom headcanons.

There seems to be no problem with female Harry fanart or Harry being the descendant of 838 magical families or the fanfic where he actually isn't James and Lily son. Fae Luna is pretty common and halfgoblin Flitwick has pretty much transcendent. People are well aware that everyone was white in the books and are just having fun.
