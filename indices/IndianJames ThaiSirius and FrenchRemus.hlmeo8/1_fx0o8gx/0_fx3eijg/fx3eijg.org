Korean food and Thai food are both pretty dope though. Maybe the Weasley's and Hermione can be that. We also need someone for BBQ. Plus banh mis and dim sum are both pretty great too. Maybe we can get a half Indonesian half Dutch character so they can eat some rijsttafel. What celebrity chef should be the potions professor. Gordan Ramsey was already done, so this needs someone else.
