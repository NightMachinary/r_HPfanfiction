I have seen Indian James on /one/ fic, the only other time I have seen something similar to that is in artwork where people draw him to have a much darker skin tone, which makes no sense at all, but OK, it's just a change that doesn't give anything to the story.

I mean, sure, you COULD make something where Harry could reconnect with his ancestors' culture(perhaps with the help of the Patil twins?), you would also need to change his family tree a bit, but that's the easiest part.

Remus Lupin being french would be weird, he could be Italian too I guess, but I don't see how that could change the character.

Sirius would require a bigger explanation than Harry, his family were xenophobes of the highest order, I guess they would accept people with large lineages(the LeStranges) but still, more worldbuilding.

Again if someone does this just for the sake of having a diverse cast, well, it's not interesting for many and some will just ignore it unless it's relevant to the plot.
