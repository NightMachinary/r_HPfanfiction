Mainly because alot of people view doing this as a kind of reverse white washing of the characters. Especially since outside of someone REALLY trying to make the changes apparent and important to the plot they tend to not be.

As an example half Indian Harry would be fine if he was raised by his Indian father since he might still have some idea of what being Hindi means and maybe an Indian accent. But most of the time people only use Indian Harry as an excuse for the dursleys to hate him when they don't need the added excuse, they hate him for his magic already them hating him for being a minority doesn't add anything to the story. It also doesn't help that he would literally be the same character but have brown skin, nothing changes since again he isn't raised in the tradition to make the changes noticeable.

Edit: mind you I didn't downvote you but I'm just explaining why some people might downvote the topic. I personally love the ideas of Irish Harry
