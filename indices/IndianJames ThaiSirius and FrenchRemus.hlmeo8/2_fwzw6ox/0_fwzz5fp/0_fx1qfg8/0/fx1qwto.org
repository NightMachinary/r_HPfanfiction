And that would work out, I'm just saying that most writers (mainly inexperienced ones) use it as an excuse to have the Dursleys hate him when again the Dursleys really don't need further excuses. Honestly I'm not against Harry being part indian, i think it'd lead to some interesting world building especially if his father left him something that explained his heritage to him, but the problem is most writers just follow the stations of canon instead of thinking of something new.

Also alot of Authors ESPECIALLY my fellow Americans seem to the think that someone who is a third generation indian who's abused by his aunt and uncle would know anything about his fathers culture outside of maybe what he learns from the library. Like he absorbs the full on knowledge of his culture through osmosis of the dead or something.

It's like expecting Goku to know what being a saiyan is like after he bumped his head and never met one for the first 18 years of his life.
