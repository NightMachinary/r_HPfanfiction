I think a lot of people have a knee-jerk reaction to downvote anything about race. Your question seems perfectly reasonable to me. You're just asking for the source of the trope, like which story started it.

I'm curious too now. I've seen Indian Harry, but not the Thai or French ones. Remus is a real surname in France, so I can see someone extrapolating from that to make the character French. I've seen someone argue that the “correct” way to pronounce his name is to use the French pronunciation. I argued that there's no evidence that he pronounces his name in any way other than the British way, and his mother is canonically from Wales, not France. He'd have to keep correcting all these British characters mispronouncing his name, and I can't see him doing that.

In fanfic, we can do whatever we want of course.
