I believe that it is a result of trying to force diversity into the fic. I have not read too many of these types of fics ever since I read a Indian!Harry fic in which the author was trying so hard to make Harry and Indian(or atleast what Americans think Indians are like) that was so cringy it was painful as an Indian to read(also slightly amusing realizing that that is what the Americans think we Indians are like)
