My guess is that sometime after some people got angry about Hermione being black in the Cursed Child, JK Rowling said that Hermione /could/ be black even though it wasn't supported in the text. Not just physically, but socially Hermione's reactions to blood purity are of someone encountering prejudice for the first time which doesn't make a lot of sense for a minority character. This was before people had universally jumped on the "Rowling is ruining the canon" train.

After that, people on the internet just went "well, there's nothing in the text that explicitly /says/ James can't be Indian" and there were a number of tumblr headcanons that arose from that. I'm not familiar with the current tropes, but I wouldn't doubt that it grew from there.

Personally, I don't quite think it fits within canon, but it's really not hurting anyone to have diverse characters. Also, it's not like canon is a Sacred Cow. That much became obvious somewhere between when Rowling said that purebloods used to shit in place and vanish their poops, and the entirety of Fantastic Beasts.
