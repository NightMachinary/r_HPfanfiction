I don't object in principle, but I was reading a story recently where the Potters had come to England from India hundreds of years earlier, presumably married English people all that time, and yet, Harry (whose mother was a redhead) was still super dark-skinned, and, upon learning about his heritage, started wearing traditional Indian clothing (despite having lived all his life in England). There's a fine line between representation and exoticism, and that kind of thing can feel a bit clunky and obtrusive. If you want to write about Indian characters, why not write about the Patil twins, for whom those kinds of themes could be a more natural fit? Why not write about Dean or Angelina or Lee or Kingsley rather than making white characters black when it doesn't really fit their story? It's like people want the cred for writing characters of color but don't /really/ want to write about characters of color, and it just gets weird sometimes. Not to mention the stories where it's like, "Black Hermione (who was black) walked blackly into the room and smiled at her non-white friends, white teeth gleaming against the extreme blackness of her skin. 'Isn't wonderful not to be white?' she exclaimed. 'White people are the worst!'" - like, I get that your intentions are good, but you're overdoing it and starting to come off like a character from Get Out.
