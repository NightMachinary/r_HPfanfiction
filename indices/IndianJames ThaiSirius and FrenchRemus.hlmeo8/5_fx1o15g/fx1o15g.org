  here are so many fics that have James' being Indian, Sirius' being Thai, and Remus' being French

Care to link a few? In all my time on here, I can't remember a single fic with any of those ethnicities for the above characters. Heck, even with all the talk of Desi!Harry, I think I've only read one fic with that and it was a throwaway comment and not exactly clear if he was part-Indian from his mum's or his dad's side.
