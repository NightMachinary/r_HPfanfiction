The summary rings some alarm bells for me.

Does the story disregard canon completely, and focus exclusively on the time travel, with self-contained character growth and plotlines?

Does the story alter canon, having it serve as a base of operations for Harry, a time to regroup until he goes on the next time travel?

Does the story follow the stations of canon with absolutely no change to anything?

The whole "as he travels time and struggles with his second year" is mildly concerning me rn.
