  Does the story disregard canon completely, and focus exclusively on the time travel, with self-contained character growth and plotlines?
#+end_quote

Hmm... Yes and no? This is a fanfiction, so canon itself would inevitably change. I am trying to address how the canon would change with this new ability of Harry's that I have introduced. It does not focus exclusively on time travel, but the past is an important component in it. He does not spend too much time there, however.

Big spoiler:>! He develops a related ability that allows him to view the past. Thus past is very relevant.!<

I am unsure what you mean by that. The story emphasizes on the events of Harry Potter book 2 and its plotlines. As of now, there are no plans for any major plotline in the past per se. However, the past and the present are very much intermeshed in this story, and I can't reveal more than that without spoiling everything.

  Does the story alter canon, having it serve as a base of operations for Harry, a time to regroup until he goes on the next time travel?
#+end_quote

It alters canon, of course, as most fanfics does. The canon plotline doesn't stay the same with all the changes I've made. Let me say now that Harry does not have control over his time travelling ability when he goes to the past. I do not plan to give him control any time soon. The present is where he belongs.

  Does the story follow the stations of canon with absolutely no change to anything?
#+end_quote

Nope. Many future events change according to actions done now, otherwise it wouldn't make sense.
