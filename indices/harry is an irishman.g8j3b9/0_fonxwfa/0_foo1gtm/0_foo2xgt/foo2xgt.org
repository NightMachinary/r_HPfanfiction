Seriously if you ever come across it in a fic you'll know exactly what I mean. It's mad and universally terribly done. It's just better to steer clear because unless you're actually going to go into it in detail you're just going to fuck it up.

Like there's off-hand mentions to Seamus going home where his family are all involved with "the struggle" and everyone is just like "oh cool, it's early 90's England, obviously no one is going to comment on this open support of the group bombing us and burning people alive, good for you Seamus".

People wouldn't ignore that, Like people still sing No Surrender to the IRA at England football games 20 years post peace, it'd be like having American! Harry and him going to Ilvermorny and everyone laughing at the Muslim who's family are in ISIS making jokes about it..

Bonus points if he brings C4 back for some reason because obviously bombing random people is where his explosion spell thing comes from. You know, because it's quirky.
