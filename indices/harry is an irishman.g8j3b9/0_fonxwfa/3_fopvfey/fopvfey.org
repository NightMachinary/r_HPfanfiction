Hello, I think imma write this so if you want you can help me with the irish culture and slang... since ur irish I'd like that help if possible?

I dunno if u don't want to its fine honestly just thinking

Also you'd get credit in the book authors notes and the end where I say "thanks to: person 1 for x, person 2 for y" etc.
