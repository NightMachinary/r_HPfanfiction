I'm Irish and I can only imagine this would be written by an American who's never been to Ireland. Who i'm sure is lovely but I can absolutely guarantee that if it's like any other mention of Ireland in fanfiction Harry 100% joins the IRA at some point with absolutely no one having any issues or concerns about it nor any mention of why terrorism is bad.
