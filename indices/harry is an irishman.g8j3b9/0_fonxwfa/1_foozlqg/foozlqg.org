I've seen a great mention of Ireland in a fanfic... it was a single sentence in history class (with not-Binns teaching it) that was along the lines of "and now we're going to talk about why the 70s was such a fine time to be Irish." /endscene

My uncle did a 'grand tour' backpacking hippy trail thing in the late 60s and found himself in Derry. Why? Who the fuck knows, but somebody did take pity on his dumb ass and gave him some good advice: if anyone stops you and asks 'protestant or catholic' you answer 'Canadian' and then you fucking leave. Did he crash on couches of IRA members? Probably, he certainly thinks so. But he doesn't know for sure because you don't talk about that shit.
