Just going to point out that around the halfway point, the fic takes a sharp turn from being a crack fic about Gordon Ramsey in Harry Potter to a serious fic about war crimes in Harry Potter.

Both halves were worth reading, but the tonal shift was jarring, and I think it's best for the reader to have a rough idea of what they're getting into.
