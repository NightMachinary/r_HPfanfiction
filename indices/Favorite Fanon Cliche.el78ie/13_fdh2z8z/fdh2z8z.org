I wouldn't go so far as to say that I love the Ancient and Noble Houses cliche, but I am a sucker for fics that expand on pureblood traditions. I think it adds another dimension to the idea of being a long-standing wizarding family. Once we get lawyers and mansions and fortunes into the picture it gets a little wealth porn-y for me, but otherwise I am interested in some of the world building that has been done in the area of blood purity. Courtship practices, magic associated with godparent relationships, bonds that go with engagement, etc.

I like a bit of politics, but nothing crazy - especially when the kids are still in school. What teenager thinks about advancing their families political interests while in high school? But I think it's realistic up to a point that kids would be aware of politics and their place within it.

One trope that I unabashedly love, though, is marriage contract fics. It's a reasonably believable way of putting two characters together that otherwise might not interact in the same way, and it's a great set up for a slow burn romance - if executed properly. Harry/Daphne fics are good at this, and I've seen at least one Harry/Susan fic that I liked as well.
