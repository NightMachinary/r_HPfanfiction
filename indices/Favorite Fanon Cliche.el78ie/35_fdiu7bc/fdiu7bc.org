I like the idea of ward magic, it's interesting different, yet similar; ways it's described.

What happens in Slytherin, stays in Slytherin; trope. While I HATE Child Politics with a fiery passion, and stay away from those, there's something about the what happens in Slytherin; stays in Slytherin that I love. You can hate each other in private all you want, but in public we are united.

Sauve Blaise Zabini. Theodore Nott with a horrible father.

Charlus and Dorea Potter are Harry's grandparents. I just can't picture anyone else.

Time Travel: BUT! I like them when they change what happens in canon. It can be set in the Marauders or the Golden Trio Era, but yeah, I'd rather them change what's happening, instead of just witnesses it.

Snape as a mentor/guardian. It's just something I love.

Freed Sirius, with more of a personality then just womanizer, hater of authority, et cetra.

Soulmates: Though this one heavily depends on how it's written.
