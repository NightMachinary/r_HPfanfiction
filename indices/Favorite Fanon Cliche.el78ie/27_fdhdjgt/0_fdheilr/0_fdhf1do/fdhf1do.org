One of my favorites is Hermione going back by accident to 1993, and staying in Remus's quarters as he was who found her after the time jump and it's a safe place for her not to be discovered. She and Remus fall in love while she has to avoid telling him of Sirius's innocence and everything that will happen that year.

It has a lot of great time turner worldbuilding, and while it drags in the middle as Remus catches back up to her, I still enjoyed it a lot.

I am writing a time travel story right now where the time traveler isn't the PoV character in the past, and most of the story is in the present. I read a lot of that trope and wanted to do some of the things I never see writers doing, heh.

I wrote a 'guide' on how to write a bad time travel HP story if you're interested in reading it. It's basically all tongue in cheek, pretty short.
