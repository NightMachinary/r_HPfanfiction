God. There are so many... My personal favourite would have to be Lords and Ladies of the Sacred 28, and political power and the shit. It's just so much fun! I've read a couple good fics where Sirius remained part of the Black family and was way for subtle about muggleborn pro reforms. its like incredible. I love the idea of Lord and Lady Black, and how families often fight for political monopoly, its rlly fucking cool. ward magic is just impossible but its fun too so like its so so for me. I know we're not talking abut ships but I also just find Harry x Voldemort and Harry x Snape so fucking funny. its just so weird but when its done in a comedic way its amazing.
