Mindscape battles, psychic wars via occlumency/legilimency. Usually involves Snape teaching Harry and then both of them using this ability to somehow defeat Voldemort in the very end. Potions training or dark arts/dueling training from Snape to Harry is also good, but occlumency/legilimency is the best. It all boils down to Snape is already a badass and teaches Harry to be a badass too, instead of an incompetent wizard who's only power is "loving" his enemy to death. /The Power of Hugs! The Power of Friendship!/ In real life, your hugs and your friends would just die and get eaten by titans. /(Attack on Titan)/

I love the marriage-contract stories as an excuse to get Hermione/Snape together lol. I love dark-arts/mind-connection/blood-spell-connection/magical-signature-connection/whatever in regards to Hermione/Snape. Bonus points if Hermione is even smarter than she is in canon so she can keep up with Snape's talents.
