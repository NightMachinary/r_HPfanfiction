Gimme that Time Travel fix it that either deviates from canon, or follows it pretty heavily.

And I adore Harry thrown into a different dimension. Bonus points if his parents are alive and he has younger siblings. Extra bonus points if canon!Sirius is also their from the veil.

Do I love Backwards with Purpose and A Black Comedy? Yes, I've read them both multiple times.

Also, I have a huge soft spot for grouchy redeemed Draco and Snape.
