The first one reminds me of Barefoot, linkffn(11364705). I love fics where Harry has a unique ability that changes how he perceives the Wizarding world and its characters

The fics where Harry dives headfirst into one specialty that isn't Defense have a special place in my heart though. Like Problem of Potions and Art of Self-Fashioning, it's fun to see people explore different disciplines and expand on magical theory
