I feel like the textbook thing takes away from the overall depth of magic. High level magic should be obscure and difficult to master, not something you can match with school knowledge if you apply yourself. If Harry spends his Hogwarts years reading through every dark arts book in the restricted section that's one thing, but winning with the standard book of spells III makes Dumbledore and Voldemort a lot weaker.
