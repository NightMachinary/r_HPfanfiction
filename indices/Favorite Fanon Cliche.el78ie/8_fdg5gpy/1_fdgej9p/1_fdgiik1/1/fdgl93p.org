Yes, but those books were not light reading nor popular subjects. Like I said, explicitly studying the dark arts for years is one thing, and I don't mind that way to defeating Voldemort. But the notion that regular schoolwork learned from the standard material would do the trick is ridiculous and insulting towards the highly skilled. The duel in the Ministry atrium was leagues above anything else we see, and believing Harry could achieve that kind of ability through classwork is delusional.
