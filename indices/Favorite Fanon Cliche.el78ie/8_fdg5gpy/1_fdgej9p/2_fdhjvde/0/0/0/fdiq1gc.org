There was nothing grandiose or complex about Voldemort's attack on Hogwarts and any 12 year old Starcraft player could have led a victorious defense against the kind of frontal assault he ordered in canon.

A smart Voldemort would have still ordered that assault, but simultaneously sneak behind the defenders, unleash hell, retreat before a defense court be mounted and then strike at a different point while the defenders are tied up by that assault. Always on the move, keeping the defenders on edge while they die one by one.
