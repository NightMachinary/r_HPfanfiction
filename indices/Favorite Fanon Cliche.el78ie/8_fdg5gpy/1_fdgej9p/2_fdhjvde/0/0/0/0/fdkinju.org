You mean a smart and /logical/ Voldemort? Something that, as the book hammers into your head, he is not? You're missing the point of the Battle of Hogwarts because you wanted it to be something it isn't. The Battle of Hogwarts was because Voldemort needed Harry to die in order to fulfill another step in his ludicrously complex (and flawed) plan to become immortal.
