Yeah, Marriage contracts are kind of fun. But also the ones where Harry and Ron take turns saving each other's lives and are now SHIELD BROTHERS. Or the ones where Harry saves some Death Eater's life and now they are his retainer because of ANCIENT TRADITION. Or the kind where SOUL MAGIC is involved now person A has to do thing X until they can repay the debt.
