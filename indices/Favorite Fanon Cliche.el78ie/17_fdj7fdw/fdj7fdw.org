MOD! Harry or as I like to call it."yer a living God, Harry"

Death is a friendly and bored entity. (from a random father figure entity, Mistress Death of Marvel, Teluete to Sandman, to Terry Pratchet Death. Death is literally an old friend.) I just wish there's at least a oneshot of Death from Sims 4 where Harry can flirt and give death flowers to save Sirius or Cedric even Hedwig. Just imagine the absurdity of seeing death hanging around, Harry flirting, then someone getting resurrected. Where Harry is just like, Yeah, every Perver-... Um... Peverell talks, flirts with death. Heck, Ron can even challenge Death for Fred with chess.

Potter family magic or Potter grimoire. (though honestly a part of me truly wishes there's more, living earth,golem,teracotta warrior,gargoyle or even the ancient and noble house of potter decended from Galatea and Pygmalion for literal Potter magic but any family magic is fine for me)

Scandinavian magic, Seidr vs. Witchcraft and Wizardry (Norse, celtic and other druidic living/wild magic versus the modern magic is a tool. Like living magic is more of a soft magic system versus Hard magic system of Wand magic.)

Bad Ending!Harry in Alternate Universe/Timeline. Where Harry won but got a bad ending be it everyone scared of him, all friends dead, or Mundane wars then got displaced for a new start.
