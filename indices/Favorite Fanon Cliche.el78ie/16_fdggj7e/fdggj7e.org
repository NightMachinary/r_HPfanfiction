Time travel romance. It's actually the only reason I read time travel. I'm currently reading a fix it time travel, and I can't say I enjoy it all that much, maybe because I know that in the end we will end up with canon parings. Time travel romance is my favourite thing, though I have to say that if it's in marauder era, I get easily annoyed by characterizations which don't seem true sometimes.
