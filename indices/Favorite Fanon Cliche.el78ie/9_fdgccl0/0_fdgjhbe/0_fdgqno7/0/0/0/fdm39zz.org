It is so very common in fic that I typically just ignore it as much as I can. Girls are always slapping their pairing, always “keeping their men in line”, husbands/boyfriends saying “yes dear”. Unless of course it's a harem fic because then Harry is dominant. It's a rare fic that's somewhere in between and shows an actual healthy relationship.
