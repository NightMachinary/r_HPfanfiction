It had such a good plot but I couldn't get past the domineering woman + submissive man pairings that suddenly developed. I remember there being a chapter where each of the women was (playfully or otherwise) threatening their partner over something Am I the only one who felt this was a huge negative? I don't see people talk about it but it really made the story lose a lot of the mature air it had built up.
