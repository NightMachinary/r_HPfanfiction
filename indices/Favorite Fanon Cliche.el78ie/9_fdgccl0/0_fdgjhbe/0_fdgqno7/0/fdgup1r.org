I struggled with Honour Thy Blood for a couple of reasons, but I enjoyed the premise.

For me it got bogged down a little too much in building up Grandpops Potter too early in the story for me to feel invested in Harry's investment of the man, and the relationship between Harry and Daphne was very "tell not show", almost felt rammed in there in order to have the pairing.

Is that the one where he kills a bunch of Death Eaters in France and inadvertently saves Fleur's family from them?
