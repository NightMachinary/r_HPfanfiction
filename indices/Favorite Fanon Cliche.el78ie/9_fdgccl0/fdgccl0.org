- Charlus and Dorea are Harry's grandparents and they were badass. I honestly find the thought that anyone was ever called "Fleamont/ Euphimia" unsettling. Let alone the main character's grandparents.
- Fleur being a full veela and Harry being immune to her (and still falling in love with her).
- Fred is alive.
- Daphne's hair is black and she has blue +orbs+ eyes. I've never imagined her as a blonde. (Though the whole "Ice Princess" thing is quite silly if she's younger than 16- 17. Presumably, she got it from turning down suitors but she needs to do it multiple times to get a reputation and that takes time.)
- Family history. Not necessarily expressed in wealth like money and mansions. But I like the idea that Harry comes from an old family with traditions. Even better if the Potters have a reputation as warriors. Methods of Rationality catches a lot of flak (most of it deserved), but I really liked the "No rescuer hath the rescuer" motto.
- Family magic. Kind of related to the previous one. Also a good set up for a Hermione rant or even bashing. Normally I like her, but I really disliked her in a fic where Harry found a book of Potter family magic and she immediately tried to get her hands on it. It was one of the few things Harry had from his parents (I think there were no mansions and riches in this fic) and Hermione immediately tried to grab it just to learn a few new spells. I think Mr. Weasly stopped her and explained it all to her, but I don't remember what the fic was called.
