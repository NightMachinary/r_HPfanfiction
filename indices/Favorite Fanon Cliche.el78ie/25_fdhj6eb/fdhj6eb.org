I am a big ol sucker for ritual / old magic stuff. Especially "mother's magic". Using pagan significant days to cast certain spells for big affect.

It started with a buckwild Hermione/Snape fanfic where Harry ends the war by singing a lullaby spell to Voldemort, which everyone in the light joined in singing and it put him in an eternal sleep. The fic also had sigil magic which I found really interesting, and spell creation and how magic worked.

Honestly anything that gets deep into worldbuilding how magic works gets my goat.
