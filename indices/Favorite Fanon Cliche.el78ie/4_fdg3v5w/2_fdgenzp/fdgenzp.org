Quidditch practice consists of high G maneuvers for hours, three times a week. Probably even surpassing what you do in the air force. Just staying on your broom will give you a lot of core strength.

You won't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it will certainly tone your muscles similar to, for example, bouldering.
