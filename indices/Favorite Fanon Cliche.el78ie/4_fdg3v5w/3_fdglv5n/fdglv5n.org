'Wards' are just a general term for protective enchantments. People bitch about the non-canonicity of wards, but they're plenty canon. They're just not /called/ wards, instead preferring to use the specific Charms, Jinxes, Curses, or Hexes (like the Muggle-Repelling Charm on the Quidditch Stadium in /Goblet/, tell me that's not a ward as we think of them).
