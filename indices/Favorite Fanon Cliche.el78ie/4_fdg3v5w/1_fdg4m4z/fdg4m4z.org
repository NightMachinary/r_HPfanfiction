I think ward magic is so fascinating in how intricate, and relatively consistent people are about it considering it is not in canon. It's as if there are general rules stated in the first fic it was used from, or some other media (D&D? Other High fantasy?) and people stick to those conventions, using them to explain how the Fidelius works or how the wards on Privet Drive function.

And Quidditch toned abs! Ah, that brings me back. I haven't seen those in a while, but I loved that trope too. I definitely imagined they'd be more lean, since it's mostly stretching but there has to be some excuse for buff characters.

And the idea of magical signatures is so clever, I never knew it wasn't in canon until way too late. I just expected it to be there. But the idea you can identify spells like a fingerprint would make for interesting scenarios, and might be based in Priori Incantitem, but would make things like Prisoner of Azkaban make no sense.

Ah Marriage Law fics. Like Soul Bonds, they can be very soapy or high drama. Of course they're kind of true Handmaids Tale horror if you think about it too much, but the authors clearly don't so you kind of have to take them for what they are and have fun with them
