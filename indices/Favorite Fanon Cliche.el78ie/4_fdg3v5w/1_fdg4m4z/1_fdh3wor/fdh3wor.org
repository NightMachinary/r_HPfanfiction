The seekers and keepers are probably lean- a small build would help a seeker go faster (like how horse jockeys tend to be small) while a keeper would be better served by a tall, wiry build with long limbs. Chasers could easily be well toned because they have to be maneuverable and have strong throws, while the beaters would likely be buff since the stronger they are the harder they can hit.

So in reality Harry would probably be the smallest person in the quidditch team, while Fred and George would be the buff ones.
