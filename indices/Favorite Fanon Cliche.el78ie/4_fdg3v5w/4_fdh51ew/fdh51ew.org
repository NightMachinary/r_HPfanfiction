magical tattoos are amazing. I read recently (don't know if it was a fic or a hc piece, definitely drarry though) about Harry having a golden snitch one that you could 'catch' by touching it and it would sit still for a while. When he got bored he would search for it and it is so cool to imagine...

while I don't think someone would get body-builder-body from playing quidditch its reasonable that people would be fit. I think staying up in the air for hours throwing balls, swinging bats and trying to control a broom would tone someone's upper body at least
