I love the idea of ward magic in general, and it's so prevalent in fic that it's hard for me to believe it's never mentioned in canon. I wonder who brought it into the fandom first???

I also love the completely ridiculous notion that Quidditch players get all built and muscle-y, as if they're like pro footballers in real life. Makes no sense, but I do like to imagine the boys all buff!

I love the notion that a witch or wizard's magic is influenced by their family or nationality, or otherwise has personal markers. That someone could recognize a certain spell was cast by Frenchman, for example, or that "this charm was definitely done by Bill and not Charlie", or something like that.

OMG I *love* the marriage law fics, even though it all started with Snape/Hermione which is TOTALLY not my thing. To my utter delight, the fandom just took the notion and RAN WITH IT and I've read so many different amazing stories with that premise (with ALL kinds of pairings) and it's the best thing ever!!!

Magical tattoos! Of course Charlie is covered with dragon tattoos, and Bill has Egyptian hieroglyphics. Also they move around, just like magical photographs or portraits.
