Manipulative Dumbledore. If you look at canon with a different perspective years after the books completed, Dumbledore has a lot to answer for. That, and a l love how people get so protective of him. Bonus points if Harry and the gang know about it. Watching the gang navigate their way around voldemort AND dumbledore? That's what I love in a manipulative dumbledore story.

Personally, I don't give a damn if he is good, bad, senile, or dead. As long as the story can back it up. You can quote canon all you want at me. I don't care. Stick with your canon, I'll stick with my fanfictions.
