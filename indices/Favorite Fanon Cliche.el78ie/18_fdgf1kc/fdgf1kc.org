Using conventional weapons in ambushes. Whether or not a shield charm can withstand a bullet is a different debate because if used from an ambush, the target (usually a death eater) won't see it coming and shield spells are irrelevant. Same goes for hidden explosives.

Magic is not the force, and even if it is used to heighten senses, it won't give you precognition and no wizard a force user.

I guess that this is mostly the result of wanting Harry and co to have a more active role in the war and actually hunt Death Eaters and Snatchers down, but recognising that the trio would probably lose in a fair fight, partially because they refuse lethal force.
