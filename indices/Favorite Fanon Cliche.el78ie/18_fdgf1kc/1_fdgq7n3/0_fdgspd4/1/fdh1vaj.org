It is possible to anchor a Shield Charm to your clothing and have it be permanently active in canon. It's weaker than what an experienced wizard could do if he cast it himself, but it's mass-producible and all/most Ministry employees get one because they bought in bulk (which means most Death Eaters will have them).
