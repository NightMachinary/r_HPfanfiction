I was actually thinking of getting some explosives (hell, black market fireworks from Poland or the Czech Republic would do), duplicate it until you have a few tons, find some remote hill, bury the explosives there, prepare a sufficiently distant place where you put the detonator. Alternatively, get weapons on the Black market and set up a killing field. Raise an empty decoy tent in the middle.

Trigger the taboo, Apparate to your position and blast away as soon as the snatchers arrive. The few seconds they'll need to take in the situation should be enough to blow them to pieces or put a few hundred rounds downrange.

That way, you avoid civilian casualties and getting everything you need won't be difficult with magic.
