Okay this I could see working a few times before sending out a "They are setting up ambushes for Taboo Triggers. From now on everyone apparate 300m from the location first, cast homenium revelio, and always bring a hostage" or "Apparate with your brooms 1 km above the destination and lay down fiendfyre."

In fact I would be interested to read one where the gang accidentally kills a few people who were captured by snatchers because the group that arrived had already picked up a few and decided to collect a few more first before dropping them off.
