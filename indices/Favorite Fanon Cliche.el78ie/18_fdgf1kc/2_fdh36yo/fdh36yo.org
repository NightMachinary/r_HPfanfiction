I generally headcanon there being two types of shield charms: energy and physical. /Protego/ is an energy shield charm, able to protect against most spells and other forms of energy, like the energy of an explosion. It has a breaking point, but can still negate some of the damage. /Aegis/ is a physical shield, able to block banished objects and even bullets, but not spell bolts.

As such, grenades/pipe bombs would likely be very effective, as they release both explosive energy and shrapnel, and very few mages are able to keep up both types of shields at once.
