I think the difference is that it's so mundane. Muggle studies makes sense because Dumbledore or someone thought it was important that magicals at least acknowledge that muggles are more than the dirt beneath their shoes, but the idea that runes is only for learning a dead language is pretty strange when every other class has some amount of magic related application, even History of Magic. Also, why runes and not Latin or Greek, considering that they seem to be the basis of a lot of spells? It's just weird, so people ignore it, and combined with the common trope of ancient languages having power, runes becomes a warding class.
