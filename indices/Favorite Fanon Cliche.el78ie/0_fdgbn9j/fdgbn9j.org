Runic magic is my favorite fanon cliche, as the idea that 1 of the main electives would be a 4 year long language course on dead languages seems like a complete waste of time. Sure it could be useful for translations, but considering some characters like Crouch know a lot of languages i can imagine there is probably an easier way to learn them in the wizarding world.

Although i personally prefer the idea that Runes themselves don't have much power, but can be used as anchors for spells as long as the runic words/structures are linked to the purpose of the spells, e.g. Protective runes used to bind ward barriers.
