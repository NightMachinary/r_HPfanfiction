Here's my headcanon on the whole thing: Accidental magic is still magic, right? Right. I vaguely recall someone in canon saying something about reality warping powers. Can you imagine people getting pissed off and accidentally nuking the school, their home, shopping district, etc. Wand magic and latin incantations are a way to put a safety onto magicals.

Moving on. Now, Wards, runic script, enchanting, etc. That uses ANCIENT runes because they aren't commonly in use. Can you imagine the DADA teacher accepting homework for the blasting hex and someone bumps into the desk. BOOM! The classroom explodes.
