-The Ancient and Noble house thing. Definitely my top rated fanon trope.

​

-The (in)famous Gringotts inheritance test is surely overpowered and the Goblins played up to the point of the ridiculous in many fics. *BUT* the test is essentially just a DNA test. It's perfectly plausible for it to tell the MC which families he/she is related with. Also, while Goblins obviously wouldnt bend over for Harry just because he remembers their names and says thank you, it's not far fetched to imagine Gringotts offices across the world as a sort of embassies for Goblins. With the right bribes and connections I totally see them offering more services than just storing your gold.

​

-Some characters I just cant possibly imagine in any other way than their fanon characterizations. Blaise the smooth, Italian butterfly. Nott, the studious kid with a horrible father. Daphne... well, Daphne.

​

-fix it time travel with a tinge of crack in them. I saw so many people complain that there is little to no conflict in them, but to me that's exactly what makes them fun to read. They are the perfect excuse for an OP protagonist facing as little opposition as possible. At least when it comes down to Harry returning to his first year.

​

-Like other comments already mention, I kinda absorbed some Magical theory fanon as canon by now. Wards, Runes, Arithmancy, stuff like that. I'm at the point where I cant envision the HP magic system lacking the fanon view of these things.
