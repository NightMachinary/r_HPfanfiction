[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][The Meaning of One, Part One: Stone and Fire]] has an amazingly heartbreaking scene in it. I'll often re-read just that scene over and over again.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=126789][The Meaning of One, Part Two: Chambers and Secrets]] has another one nearer to the beginning.

If you've never read them, skip the first chapter of Part One if you're not into that kind of stuff, I know I haven't finished it, and Part Two is still a W.I.P.
