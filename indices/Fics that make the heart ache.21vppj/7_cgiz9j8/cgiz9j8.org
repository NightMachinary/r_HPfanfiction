Revealing that it's a heartache story may be a bit of a spoiler, but my favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2056132/1/Heart-With-No-Companion][Heart With No Companion]]. It's SS/HG, so that may be off-putting for some people. Hermione is in a coma since the Last Battle after jumping in front of a curse meant for Snape. A year later, he's the only one who still visits her. Complete.
