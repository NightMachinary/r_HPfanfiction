You have to remember, [[https://www.quora.com/How-many-wizards-are-there-in-the-Harry-Potter-universe?share=1][there are just thousands of wizards and witches in UK]] (give and take, there are different calculations with results from five to twenty thousands). That's one small village in the Muggle world. So, I guess we have just one fully magical village (Hogsmeade), some larger groups of wizards in some Muggle villages (Godric's Hollow), a community around the Diagon Alley, and isolated magical settlements spread in the Muggle world. How is it possible to live in the lifestyle completely isolated from the Muggle world is a mystery to me.
