Hm...I'll second the request, but not because I want Hermione's personality to change but Harry's because this would be an early dose of reality (so maybe he'd apply himself more if he - as he always does - feels guilty for "not being good/powerful/knowledgeable etc. enough" to save Hermione (particularly because his best/first friend's bullying caused her to be in danger in the first place!))
