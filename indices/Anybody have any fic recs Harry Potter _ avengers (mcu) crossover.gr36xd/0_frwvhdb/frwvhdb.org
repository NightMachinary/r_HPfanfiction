[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17926664/chapters/42330374][On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads]]. I read it on ao3. It might be the fact that I read it all in one night and at 3:20 you start to get emotional at every turn, but it's also fantastic world building by the author and maybe a little cheesy at the very end tbh
