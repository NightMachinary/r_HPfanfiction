I think it comes down to timing/pacing and how technical it gets. If it's like 5000 words of the author explaining how magic works, that's just boring. If they stop in the middle of a fight to say "oh yeah btw here's how x, ψ, and 參 work" then it's clearly the wrong place and time. I also factor in whether it's universal or just creating an OP-MC. When they're rewriting the entire concept of magic from the fanon/non-HP world stuff and spend pages and pages dithering on about how Harry is the only one that can do X magic or whatever, it gets annoying. But that's more an issue of simply making your MC completely overpower the enemy, effectively eliminating all conflict and interest from the story.

You really have to consider how much it is actually going to affect the story that you think you're treating magic as a whole differently than the commonly accepted fanon interpretation. Are you completely rewriting everything and not using anything like wands, spells, runes, cores, and potions? Do you need to do that at all, and if you do, do you even really need to explain it more than just a passing sentence? I know we like to joke about magical cores but honestly it's a decent system that just works for most situations: Skill, Energy, and Will --- Mind, Body, and Soul. While circumstances of birth might grant the character aptitude in one of those three (Hermione, Ron, and Harry respectively, for a somewhat canon example), all three are equally necessary for proper utilization. The Power Trio / Five Man Band is so fundamental to story telling that to go without dramatically reduces the quality of the story. Additionally, if you do give your MC a specialty, let them grow into it. I liked Rune Stone Path, but I did not like how Harry /started/ as a literal runes god. Most bad stories are like that. The Rule of Three is important here too in my opinion: Fail Fail Win. Five also works: Win Win Fail Fail Win or Minor success - overconfidence - major setback - regroup - triumph. Either way, demonstrating that your characters have put in the effort, pushed past the failures, and earned their success is key, regardless of how the magic works to get them there. I know I'm getting into writing theory rather than magical theory, but it sort of falls under the topic

If you do decide that your magical world's magic absolutely needs to be explained then I think the best time and place would be early on during a study session, and have it be written as part of dialogue rather than a montage of MC learned to do /this/ because he had an epiphany that magic works like /that/ and he's the only one that can do it. Just telling the readers how it is doesn't make it intriguing. Having your characters just know it isn't either. Give them trials to overcome, have them fail, let the bad guys be better at something.

Sorry I'm kinda rambling, but I thought I'd throw it all out here at once instead of flooding the IRC lol
