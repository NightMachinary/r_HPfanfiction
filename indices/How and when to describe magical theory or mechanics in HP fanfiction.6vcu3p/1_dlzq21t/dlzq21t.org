Read Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series or Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series.

In Mistborn, it's not really a mystic and unpredictable power we are talking about instead it's actually quite scientific power. You consume X and perform Y. And there are some combos you can perform. It's quite gamey actually. Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series sometimes uses master-apprentice study sessions to give us in-depth magical theory and sometimes gives us not-so-in-depth magical theory during events subtly and we subconsciously learn at least what would happen if X is performed. We, readers, don't have to know the exact math and formulas behind every single spell. To make the story much more immersive, it's good for the author to actually know those stuff but the reader doesn't have to know everything. Only tell when the reader absolutely needs to know. Or when it's actually fun. For example in Mistborn sometimes our character fails and her teacher makes fun of it while telling her why she failed. While we are laughing at that scene, we also learn some magical theory without any effort.

On the other hand, Jim Butcher's Dresden Files has 'magic' magic. It's named magic, the book's main character is also named Harry. Anyway; compared to Harry Potter's magic, it's a bit more will-based and ritualistic. There are no universal magic words -mostly- that you need to know to in order to be able to cast a spell for example, you find a word for your spell to make it easier to focus on it to cast etc etc etc. Through the whole series, our main character explores magic, performs it a lot and I'm sure in every single book there is a new type of magic explained. (He even reanimates a dead Dinosaur with necromancy and then rides it.) Books are written in first person perspective so we always hear the main character's inner thoughts and there are a lot of fun stuff going on in his head while he is performing magic. And our character doesn't really know every magical stuff, so we learn with the character and not immediately. And we only learn what we need to know when we are seeing the character performs it. Even the exploration of magic become interesting that way. Especially with a little bit suspense. He wonders why it happened that way, starts researching, stumbles upon some information which leads to another one... Magical theory part turns into a journey. And sometimes the author tells us he learned something but only mentions it without really telling the us what he learned. Then we see Harry perform that magic and during that, we also learn why he did what. Some nice little suspense mystery. Close to the climax of the story the author also reveals some magic theory that readers didn't know until that moment. So it makes the climax much more interesting to read because everything starts to make sense. Some bizarre thing our character did earlier was actually part of a big ritual and it was important because of some other stuff we knew etc etc. So we say 'Yes, it makes perfect sense, I understand that!' Also that book has a spirit thing with centuries of experience and it gives Harry hints at what to do in certain situations. And that spirit is mean, lewd and witty. It's quite fun to read those parts because that spirit sometimes tells us what creative inappropriate stuff we can do with that spell. So again, author gives us the theory while telling us possible situations to use it and some of those situations are funny. As a result we don't feel like reading a boring very serious essay about how to perform magic.

Brandon Sanderson has some lessons in YouTube and in one of them he talks about world building (including magic system if there is any) and draws an iceberg. He tells that the author should show only the tip of the iceberg in detail while hinting that it continues at the bottom. The reader doesn't need to know every single detail about the world. But author should know, at least more than the tip, so it doesn't cause some plot holes afterwards.
