I like the theory described when it's something new, especially odd, or intricate (such as rituals), and then only in short bits. Diving into the theory behind the magic is a tricky business, because it is easy to lose readers' attentions if you go too deep but at the same time easy to leave them confused about the magic if you don't go deep enough. The trick is to see if it's important to the plot. If it is, the explanation and mechanics should go fairly in depth to ensure understanding. If it isn't, a sentence or two about what that specific magic does is normally enough to get the message across.
