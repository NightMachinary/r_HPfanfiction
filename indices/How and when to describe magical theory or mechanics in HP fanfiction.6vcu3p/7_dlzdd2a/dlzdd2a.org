I personally love all such explorations. For me, they don't need to be especially related to the plot, as long as they're well written and in character --- which means that if it's Dumbledore and/or Flamel and/or Hermione (etc.) discussing magical theory, it makes perfect sense, but I'd rather not have Harry and Hermione start blabbering about it out of the blue since it probably wouldn't be a normal conversation topic for them.
