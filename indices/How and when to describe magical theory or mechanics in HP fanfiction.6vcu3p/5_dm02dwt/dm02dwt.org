To my mind, there's no point into going into the how and why magic works unless it serves the story, otherwise it's a distraction. If you want to get into a deep dive on magic theory, write an essay on it, don't try and shoehorn it into a fic.

I have a couple of examples from my fic, California Dreamin'. In my Potterverse, Aurors have the trick of being able to Apparate silently rather than with the more common /crack/ that's described in the books. Ginny wants to learn and she manages to get Harry to teach her. This required me to come up with a theory and mechanism for such a thing to occur and it was pretty fun working with my beta reader to come up with what I eventually did.

Another aspect of the magic in Harry Potter that I find interesting is wandless magic. There are some things that /might/ be able to be done wandlessly such as Apparating and other things that normally aren't and apparently being able to do things without a wand is the mark of a strong magician. In the story, Harry has to wandlessly manipulate an item made of gold and it got me to thinking--how easy or difficult is it for a wizard to affect things outside of themselves without the focusing conduit of a wand? What if the thing that needed to be affected was made of a really elementally stable material such as gold?

Both of these afforded me to explore how I thought magic would work in the Wizarding world in the context of events in the story and I always enjoy reading how other authors interpret the workings and theories behind magic. I'll have to check out the stories you mention in your post. :D
