The question you shouldn't ask is "how" or "when." The question you should ask is "Why."

Are you wanting to go into technical details to show off how clever the character is? How clever the author is? Are they trying to set up a clever moment in the future where a character uses the mechanics of multiple bits of magic in novel or unexpected ways?

In my opinion, it gets tedious when the author forgot to ask "why."
