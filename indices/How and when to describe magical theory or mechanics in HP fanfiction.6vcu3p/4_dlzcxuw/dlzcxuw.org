Taure, Steelbadger and enembee (at least in the ValbonÃ«) have magic that is different from the rules of our world, and thus interesting. This is especially visible in Steelbadger's and Taure's fics where they push heavily on the concept-based nature of magic. This underlying idea that magic is based on ideas is very elastic and allows for the creation of many rules that are unpredictable, but internally logical at the same time (see also Discworld for rules like that being applied to the whole working of the world).
