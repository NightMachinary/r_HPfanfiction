  If you're telling me there's a big twist ending that changes how I view the previous 520k words...yeah nah that's not going to get me to dread 510k of dross to see what it is.
#+end_quote

I don't really think there is a big twist ending when you consider the title of the story is "Cadmean Victory"

I, personally, think Harry is fine, having done a quick re-read of the first 30 chapters. It kinda makes sense why he reacts the way he does. You have to realize this is a pre-GoF Harry, he did not joke about entering the tournament, unlike canon Harry. This is also after he realizes the corruption with the government in not granting Sirius a trial, and he was just attacked (to put it mildly) again at the World Cup. It makes sense to not forgive them in the moment and isolate to try and survive the first Task. Especially as he realizes he has to get better with the signs pointing towards a rise of Voldemort sooner rather than later.

  His driving motivations are stupid and entirely self-compiled
#+end_quote

Not too sure this is entirely true. Wanting to survive is a pretty good drive for motivation. The social aspect is fair, I just think it makes sense given his characterization and mentor for this particular Harry. I do think this part does get better as Harry grows though.

  particularly interesting about this Harry
#+end_quote

I thought it was interesting because Harry's action generally make sense and he is consistent with his choices. I would say it is slightly different from Indy!Harry because you don't get a curve ball out of nowhere, and you get a mentor that kind of makes sense when you consider where they were found.

Also, most of the characters act/react the way you expect them to given their characterization in the fic if you separate them out from their post-GoF canon part. I think finding things interesting about this Harry is dependent on what you're looking for, for a fiction of this type. If you aren't a fan of this type of fanfiction, you may not be interested about this type of Harry. Most versions of x!Harry are all re-skinned version of one another. It's the story telling themselves that set them apart.

Just to hit on some of your points

  then the author goes to great lengths to make sure we all know he could have done it with his invisibility cloak in this AU and he's still adamant everyone else is wrong
#+end_quote

Harry's 14, he never joked about entering unlike his canon counterpart, he was attacked at the World Cup and is looking more towards surviving and surrounding himself with people he can trust, rather than those who would believe him to be a liar.

  Even worse with Dumbledore who doesn't really know him in the slightest and he's straight to "obviously Dumbledore believes in the Greater Good
#+end_quote

He just found out about horcruxes and believes Dumbledore is willing to sacrifice him. After the betrayals of this year, it isn't so far-fetched. It also isn't far-fetched to believe Dumbledore knows about horcruxes after having the diary and being renowned as having a lot of magic, even if we disagree about it b/c canon. As for "Greater Good", well two things. 1 - it's "greater good" in the story, lower case "g" which makes all the difference I think. 2 - Lower case g's indicate a greater good in the sense of believing to sacrifice (when they don't have to sacrifice) for the benefit of society rather than an individual (when the benefit isn't to you as an individual). It isn't so far-fetched to believe.

  Pettigrew
#+end_quote

In this story Jr is dead, so it makes sense for Voldemort to send in Pettigrew to mess with the tasks. He doesn't trust Dumbledore at this point, and I think he doesn't trust Sirius can get it done here. Also, Pettigrew was around, but wasn't lingering. Harry starts to think about doing something once he realizes Pettigrew was lingering a lot more. Then I would think more than 2 days, but maybe my timeline is off, he goes off to do something while not acting rationally. It makes sense in the the sense of Harry is in an emotional state and acts in the heat of passion. People do it all the time. He definitely screwed Sirius with the move in the moment.

Overall, I think the characterization of the all the characters and their growth generally makes sense. It doesn't exactly come out of left field in my opinion. Ask for liking the fic, and if it gets better, it kinda depends on what you mean by better. Writing wise it is pretty consistent, the rational for the actions taken don't feel out of place. It has okay world building, even if you (general) don't agree with it. Oh and for A/Ns, I generally ignore them but can understand why it may be off putting.
