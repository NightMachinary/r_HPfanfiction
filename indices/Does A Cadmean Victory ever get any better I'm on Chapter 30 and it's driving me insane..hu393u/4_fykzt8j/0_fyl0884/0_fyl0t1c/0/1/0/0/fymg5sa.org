  Harry really is an annoying little shit at the beginning

Agree to disagree here. I don't really find him an annoying little shit, but honestly that could be just based on the sheer volume of fanfic's I've read where the Harry's are just extremely bad and I nope out ASAP. That and I just happen to think everyone is way worse in how they act, cept Neville.
