Once again as one of the buggest advocates for this story you'll ever find, I can't say I agree with all this. Most of it yeah, but Harry really is an annoying little shit at the beginning. It's understandable why he's an annoying little shit, but understanding why he is that way does not change the way he is. I find the character growth later on to be well earned, as well as being satisfying largely due to the contrast between where he started and ended especially between his actions towards Pettigrew and where he ended., but the ending wouldn't have any value without the way he behaves at the beginning.
