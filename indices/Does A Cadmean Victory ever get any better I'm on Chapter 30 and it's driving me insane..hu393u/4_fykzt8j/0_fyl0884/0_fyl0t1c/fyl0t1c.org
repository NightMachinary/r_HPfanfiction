While I would disagree that a story has to have a likeable main character in order to be good, I do accept that Harry is unpleasant in the beginning. For me most of why I love the story comes from the way ending recontextualizes the rest of the story, and I know that's not for everyone. I'm not saying you have to, or even should, like it. I'm just saying that it will be hard to make a fair judgement of the story without reading the whole thing. I recognize that that is quite a lot to ask given the length of the story, but I genuinely believe it is worth it.
