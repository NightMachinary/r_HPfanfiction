  Remember, this story has over a hundred chapters, the characters change quite a bit over the course of them.

Right, grand, but if the first 30 are irritating and make the lead (and quite honestly one of only two) character an unlikeable twat it's not a good story.

If it had POV's of other people reacting to Harry to show he's not right all the time i'd feel differently, but it doesn't, it's all Harry and it's either pure evil from everyone else or falling over themselves to get Harry to like them. Except even the pure evil falls flat when Harry is just a dick to everyone apologising to him.

There's taking your time to make changes and there's using your time badly.
