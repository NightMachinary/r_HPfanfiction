I am perhaps one of the biggest advocates for this story you will ever find, and yet I fully recognize what you are saying. Yes Harry is an annoying little shit at the point of the story you are in, but it does get better. It's not fast, it would be rather jarring if it was, but it does get better. Remember, this story has over a hundred chapters, the characters change quite a bit over the course of them. It is not perfect of course and it is not for everyone but no story ever is. I personally think it is worth continuing to read.
