I'd say, if you haven't enjoyed it up till now, don't read more. My general rule is if it isn't good ten chapters in, it's not worth it. Fanfiction isn't meant to be amazing literature- you read it for fun, not for English class. I've forced mysef through so many stories, including this one, and trust me, it isn't worth it. Also, with this story in particular, you have to reach the end for it to be satisfying. Its one of those stories that is not enjoyable to read, but is enjoyable to have read, if that makes sense. Not a good way to write a story, not a fun thing to read.
