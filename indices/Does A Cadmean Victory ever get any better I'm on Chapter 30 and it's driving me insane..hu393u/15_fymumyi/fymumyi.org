I once thought it was quite a good story, but after having evolved as a reader, grown up a little bit and become a writer myself... I almost puked in my mouth trying to re-read it. Not even nostalgia keeps me going. It's quite a stereotypical, short-sighted fic with no twists or flair to save it from its flaws.

In my opinion, I wouldn't really give it the light of day. I don't know how the flying fuck I ever thought it was a good read. Take that as you will, but keep in mind my standards a little high now so I might come across a somewhat jaded.
