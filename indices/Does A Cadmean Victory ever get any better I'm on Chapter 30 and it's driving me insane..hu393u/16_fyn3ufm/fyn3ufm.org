  I actually thought the Fleur stuff would be good when Harry thinks she's not actually interested in him because he's only 14 and that'd be weird but no, no cut to Fleur's POV and she's all like "oh yeah underage kids really get me going, can't wait to get with him in the Room of Requirement ASAP".
