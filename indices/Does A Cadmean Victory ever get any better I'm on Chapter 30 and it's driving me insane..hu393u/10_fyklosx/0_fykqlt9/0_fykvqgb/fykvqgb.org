  It's just that in your teens, even just a couple of years make a huge difference

Honestly, I've known people who were more mature at 14 than other's were at 25. And I know quite a few who were more mature at 16 than they were at 21.

A friend of mine had a 14yo GF when he was 17. They stayed together for more than two years, his next one was 2 years his senior. They struck me as equally mature, despite the age differences.
