I don't think it's a cultural thing. It's just that in your teens, even just a couple of years make a huge difference.

I was different when I was 13, which was radically different when I was 15, which was again radically different when I was 18. After that though, I haven't changed much.

I think teenage years are just that age where your perspective of the world and yourself keeps changing rapidly. You are not a child, but you're not yet a full grown adult either. Just two or three years can make a huge gap in maturity.

I'm not saying a 17 year old dating a 14 year old is /wrong/. Or that it wouldn't happen. But I think the age gap would come into play in their relationship. For all its faults, I think 'A Cadmean Victory' handles this particular aspect decently. Everything else though? Ugh.(I never finished the fic either, so I don't know if it gets better)
