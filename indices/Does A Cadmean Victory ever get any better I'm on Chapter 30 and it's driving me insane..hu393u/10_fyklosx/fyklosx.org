From what I remember? No. The fic is... pretty much a convoluted mess in plot and characterization.

Also, not sure where you're from (America?), but age gaps like that are pretty common everywhere else? Between Harry and Fleur themselves, there's only a three year age gap. I think the main issue is that although Fleur is supposed to be 17, she's portrayed as being thought of in her twenties, or something.

Hell, one of my friends at 16 was dating a 21 year old.

Maybe it's an American cultural hang-up. I dunno.

Granted it's usually an older guy with a younger girl, but the reverse happens, too.

I mean, at 17 I was chatting up a 22 year old Aussie bird, so it's not strictly a UK viewpoint...
