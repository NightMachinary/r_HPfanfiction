So far, it's the only H/F fic i have enjoyed (that is longer than 20k words). It is by no means perfect, but I enjoy fics where the hero believably powers up to fight the villain (unlike canon, where Harry doesn't even try and instead waits for a deus ex machina; or in fanon, where Harry reads a few books or inherits some Galleons and suddenly is a BAMF).

Also, didn't think that the Fleur dynamic was unreasonable. Bill didn't enter the picture until way later, and Harry getting commitment-phobic was done fairly well.

If it were a novel or original fiction, I'd be much harsher. As it is, I'd rate it a 7.5/8 out of 10.
