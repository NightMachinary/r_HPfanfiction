short answer: nope.

Long answer: The reason stories like this get recommended a lot is because they had a fast update rate and and are now completed. Quantity > quality can be used to explain the popularity of a lot of fics. Something being "good" is just not a requirement. Regardless, you're always going to find someone who thinks a story like this is the best fic they've ever read.
