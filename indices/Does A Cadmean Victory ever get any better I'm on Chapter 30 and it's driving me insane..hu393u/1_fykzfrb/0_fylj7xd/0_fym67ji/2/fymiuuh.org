I liked Harry Crow. Maybe because it was the first story I'd read with detailed goblin culture. I do know that it's one of the few Harmony stories I tolerate because the author bothered to change the canon relationship enough to make it believable to me. (I'm not a fan of Harmony OR Hinny --- despite the latter being Word of God --- because neither canon character was a good match for Harry IMO.)
