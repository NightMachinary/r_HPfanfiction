I can't get through Harry Crow. It's reccd as like the holy grail of Harmony fics in some groups, and I've made it about halfway through (maybe, I honestly don't even know) a few times and I just can't. I want to like it, bc it's long and complete and I am always interested in long, complete stories with good characters and interesting ideas. But HC just doesn't do it for me.
