I'm planning to read all the way through it in the near future (after completing current projects). But the reason I put it after those projects is because I read as far as chapter 4 and found that I was skimming over most of it because...well, because I'd have a hard time making myself stop and properly read it. But I think I should give it a proper go before judging it.

At this point my thinking is that the premise of the story is, What if goblins were actually much more awesome than wizards in every way? Which, as a premise, obviously has problems when it comes to creating a compelling storyline, but might at least be a consistent lens that makes sense of it.

I might do a compare and contrast with Methods of Rationality afterward; I've already finished that one.
