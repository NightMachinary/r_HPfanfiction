It's not awful, I've read fics that I put down a lot sooner. And I've read some of the author's other stuff, and it's good. I think it's just soooo much detail. Or something. Idk. I find myself skimming and losing interest every time I try to get through it. Same with MOR, I want to like it, but I can't get into it to finish it.
