I remember it used to get recommended a lot more a while back. From what I heard, it was good for its time, but I admit when that when I started reading it, I couldn't stand it. The story seemed forced, the dialogue uninteresting, the characters flat. My guess is that at one time it was overhyped/over-recommended, then people who saw all of those recs started to read it and were thoroughly disappointed when it wasn't as good as others made it out to be.

That said, I don't think it gets that much hate beyond being used as an example of a poorly-written long work. I compare that treatment to how, a couple years back, anybody who would rec HPMOR would immediately get downvoted and get the "Why would you ever recommend such trash"-type responses. Which I always found rather rude - Just because I don't like a particular fic doesn't mean I'm going to get angry at somebody who does.
