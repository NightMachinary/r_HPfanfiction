I think that one of the really interesting things about A Cadmean Victory is that, in the end, all of these changes that Harry undergoes are ultimately not for the best, and the narrative at the end of the story reinforces that. Spoilers ahead, but I really enjoy the ending of the story because of how it subverts Edgy Harry tropes: Harry sacrifices everything for strength, but that strength isn't enough; he never becomes strong enough to out-duel Voldemort. Dumbledore is treated as manipulative by Harry, but ultimately is revealed as doing his honest best to save Harry's life and soul while still defeating Voldemort The story is called A Cadmean Victory because it's Pyrrhic--- canon Harry has a happier ending despite existing in basically the same world. It turns out that, no, sacrificing all of your friendships, never forgiving people, and giving up everything for power /isn't a good idea./

You just have to reach the ending for that to be apparent.
