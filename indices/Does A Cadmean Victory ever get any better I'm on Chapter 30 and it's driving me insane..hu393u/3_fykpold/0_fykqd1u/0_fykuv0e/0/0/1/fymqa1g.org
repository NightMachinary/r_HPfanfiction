Eh, I am going to have to disagree with you here about some things pal.

Yes, Harry ends up regretting a lot of the stuff he did after the World Cup, especially in relation to his friends and Dumbledore and some of the stuff he does while being edgy also bites him in the as but...

He ends up happy with Fleur and they have a daughter, supposedly he's also immortal now. Yeah, he doesn't roflstomps Voldemort but he accidentally outsmarts him. But in the end he wins.

There are two Camean's victories, one for Dumbledore(the classical greek one) and one for Harry(the Cadmus Peverell one)
