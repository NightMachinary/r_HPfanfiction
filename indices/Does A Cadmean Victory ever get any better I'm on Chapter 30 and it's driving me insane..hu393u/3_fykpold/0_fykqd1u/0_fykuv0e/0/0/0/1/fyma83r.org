That's an interesting take, and reminds me of Methods of Rationality - although people often seem to miss the fact that that Harry does get bitten by his mistakes many times throughout the year, before looking back at the end and recognising that he's been an idiot. Such as the Defence class where he is reprimanded for escalating a conflict with Professor Snape to the point where his school enrolment was in jeopardy, over a matter of losing 10 House points, and is told that he needs to learn how to lose.

  "Harry Potter," Professor Quirrell said.

  "Yes," Harry said, his voice hoarse.

  "What /precisely/ did you do wrong today, Mr. Potter?"

  Harry felt like he was going to throw up. "I lost my temper."

  "That is /not/ precise," said Professor Quirrell. "I will describe it more exactly. There are many animals which have what are called dominance contests. They rush at each other with horns - trying to knock each other down, not gore each other. They fight with their paws - with claws sheathed. But why with their claws sheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a better chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe their claws as well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest with a winner and a loser, both of them might be severely hurt."

  Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry from the repeater screen. "What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter, is that - unlike those animals who keep their claws sheathed and accept the results - you do not know how to lose a dominance contest. When a /Hogwarts professor/ challenged you, you did not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed your claws, heedless of the danger. You /escalated,/ and then you escalated /again./ It started with a slap at you from Professor Snape, who was obviously dominant over you. Instead of losing, you slapped back and lost ten points from Ravenclaw. Soon you were talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact that you escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot."

  "I understand," Harry said. His throat was dry. That /had/ been precise. /Frighteningly/ precise. Now that Professor Quirrell had said it, Harry could see in hindsight that it was an /exactly/ accurate description of what had happened. When someone's model of you was that good, you had to wonder whether they were right about other things too, like your intent to kill.

  "The /next/ time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate a contest rather than lose, you may lose /all/ the stakes you place on the table. I cannot guess what they were today. I can guess that they were far, far too high for the loss of ten House points."

  Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he'd done.

  ''You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts, a much more important goal worthy of great risks. That is a /lie./ If you had been -"

  "I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best possible time to make my move," Harry said, his voice hoarse. "But that would have meant /losing/. Letting him be dominant over me. It was what the Dark Lord couldn't do with the Master he wanted to learn from."

  Professor Quirrell nodded. "I see that you have understood perfectly. And so, Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to lose."
