  It turns out that, no, sacrificing all of your friendships, never forgiving people, and giving up everything for power isn't a good idea.

  You just have to reach the ending for that to be apparent.

I'm not going to read the spoilers but...that's not a good way to write a story.

There's 0 hints so far that /anything/ is wrong with Harry's actions. That works for a one shot but not for a 520k word story, you can't just write an unlikeable idiot and then turn around at the end and pretend you've subverted expectations by having a sad ending. I'll have to read it I guess but so far...yeah...bad.
