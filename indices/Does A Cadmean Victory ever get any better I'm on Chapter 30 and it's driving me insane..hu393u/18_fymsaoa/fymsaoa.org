It has been some time since I've read this fic in it's entirety, last two times I stopped around chapter 30-ish and then skipped ahead. But here are some points.

Harry at the beginning is being an angsty teenager with a lot of trauma and that's then bombarded with a lot of stressful situations one after the other until snaps and becomes ultra-paranoid to the point the only person he trusts is a thousand-year-old portrait. He's not /healthy/.

He then proceeds to try and learn and improve himself so he can keep himself safe because he's very afraid. His friends and house, being OOC, doesn't help and he starts avoiding them too, authority figures don't seem to help, some are decidedly corrupt, BAM he doesn't trust the teachers.

He learns about Horcruxes, figures out he's one, deduces Dumbledore knows, and from his experiences, 90% of the adults want to screw him over, so Dumbledore is probably a utilitarian who will sacrifice Harry to stop Voldemort(he /actually isn't/ for a change).

Harry develops a large distrust of Dumbledore because he had such a high image of him that when the man can't help him he sees it not as a lack of capability(which is what actually was) but as a lack of will to help him.

He finds Katie, reconnects with some of the House, but the Trio is broken, enter Fleur, another jaded and somewhat edgy teenager, and they both see similarities in themselves and being so paranoid with everyone else, become desperate to find a partner in each other(This relationship becomes unhealthy at some points).

Katie 'betrays' Harry(honestly this was forced as hell, and it's not like she had 5 options instead of 'Sorry Harry I /have/ to go with the guy who asked me on a whim, fuck you kindly.' making Harry for some reason just write off Hogwarts as a lost cause save for Salazar and Fleur.

Around this day he completely snaps and murders Pettigrew on a whim.

Then Harry and Fleur start dating(after some angst) and then Harry gets even more wary of Dumbledore because he's afraid the Headmaster will find out about his international excursions and stop him from seeing his girlfriend overseas.

He then manipulates the entire DA just so he can get Dumbledore out of the castle so he can do something illegal I can't remember anymore.

This is where I normally stop reading, BUT, the goal is to show you this story, IMHO, is not about an Indy!Harry who becomes a hero and everyone else is against him.

This is about a Harry who's traumatized, doesn't get the help he needs, starts becoming paranoid and desperate to save himself, goes through another traumatizing and stressful situation, and starts doing anything he (thinks) need to survive.

He meets another person who's just as jaded and stressed and who buys into his paranoia, they both do a lot of reproachable stuff.

It's basically an anti-hero Harry who's an angsty teenager with trust issues but placed in situations that don't allow him to solve that.

People often forget Fleur, but eventually, Fleur starts getting just as 'dark' as Harry out of love for him.
