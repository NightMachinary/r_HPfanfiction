I can see Harry doing that "no contractions" thing, because I did the same thing for about 3 weeks in 2nd grade after I'd won a special award for my Language Arts grade. It's the kind of thing a kid would do. For an adult to do it is just an affectation.

And your last point, that has been a reason for me to abandon several fics. I'm okay with intelligent Harry, even super-intelligent Harry (and secret bookworm Harry is plausible in canon), but not when he gains knowledge at such a ridiculously advanced rate.
