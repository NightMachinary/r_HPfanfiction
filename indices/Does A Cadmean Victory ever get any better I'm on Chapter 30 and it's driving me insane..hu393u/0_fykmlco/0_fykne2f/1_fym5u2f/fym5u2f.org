There has to be some of justication for such a huge skill increase. I don't even care if it's kinda cracky. Saw one where Slytherin's personal journals were written in parseltongue and magically imprinted Salazar's skills onto the reader. Studying really hard between the World Cup and 4th were doesn't cut it.
