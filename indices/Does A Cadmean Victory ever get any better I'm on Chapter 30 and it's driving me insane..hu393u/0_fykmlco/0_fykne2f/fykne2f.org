I'm only really keeping on going because it's been recommended so much. Absolutely nothing stands out so far as particularly unique, but there's so much more to go and it has a good reputation so...

I will say the A/N are putting me right off. The rant about a review on DLP in a recent chapter was jarring and there's one about how the author (and now Harry since he studied for a couple of weeks after the World Cup) never use informal contractions like could've as it's uneducated. Really irritated me and I'd bet a lot of money i've had a far greater education than the author.

Also it's not just this fic but the increase in Harry's ability due to what is literally like a month absolute max of studying is ludicrous. He's now magically at 6th year standard, probably further and casting non-verbally after genuinely only a few weeks.
