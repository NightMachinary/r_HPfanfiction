in linkffn(9057950) Harry goes *dark.* The author acknowledges that the first few chapters are a bit cliche (Neglected Harry and sister), but defends them on account of being told from the perspective of a child. The rest of the story more than makes up for it.

Edit: linkffn sucks. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too young to die]]
