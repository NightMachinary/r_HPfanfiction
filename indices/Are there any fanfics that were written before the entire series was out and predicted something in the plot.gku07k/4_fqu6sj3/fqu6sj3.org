I remember a satire fic which kinda accurately reflected the Epilogue. Even the name Albus for one of Harry's kids. This fic came out sometime after GoF. The story is similar to the Epilogue as the characters send their kids to Hogwarts and meet up on Platform 9 3/4. Lupin and Sirius were alive in this one. Can't remember the title.
