There was a story in Hungarian that was also called to be a fan translation of the leaked ending. I haven't fully read it, but a few chapters in we found out that Hermione was Dumbledores's spy who reported everything to him, and later she gave up SPEW after realizing house elves are unhappy without their owners. I guess all of it is pretty toxic.
