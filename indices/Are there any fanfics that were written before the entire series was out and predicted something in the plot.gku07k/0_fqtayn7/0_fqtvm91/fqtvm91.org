[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=290][The Last Dance]] by Sushi and the [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared series]] by Cybele both have Voldie and Harry soul bound in this way. Snarry, tissue alert.

I remember that several authors predicted that one (and only one) of the twins would die.
