There is /Betrayal of the Best Kind/ by Draco664, where the 5th year DADA teacher is a female Ministry employee (a full on Death Eater though), and Fudge spends a full year denying Voldemort's return. The sequel came out after Book 5, and has Peter killed by his silver hand. I also remember some old (likely deleted, since I tried to find it in vain a couple of times) fic where Voldemort returns again, and Harry has to die to keep him dead due to some soul bond they have.
