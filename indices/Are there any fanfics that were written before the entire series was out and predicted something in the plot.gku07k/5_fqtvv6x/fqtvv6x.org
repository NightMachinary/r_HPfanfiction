One of the oldest Harry/Draco fics around is Transfigurations by Resonant. linkao3(59676) AFAIK it was started before GoF came out and got finished before OOTP. It is set during the re-building of Hogwarts after the war.

So in a way this story predicted the battle of Hogwarts.

I also saw quite a few fics where Harry had to die in some way. In one Harry/Ginny story that I dimly remember he ended up drowning and Hermione rescued him via CPR. Harry was clinically dead for a few minutes, thus fullfilling the prophecy.
