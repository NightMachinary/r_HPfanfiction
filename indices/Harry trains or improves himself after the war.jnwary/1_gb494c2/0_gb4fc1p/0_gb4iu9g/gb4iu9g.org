Losse Canon is good but it doesn't fit all of you criteria. I haven't seen many stories with those specs and none that are more than 10k words. Now I admit I haven't read every story out there but I've certainly read more than most considering how many years I've been apart of the fanfiction community. I really can't think of any that pop into my mind. Loose Canon is more or less about a high strung emotionally fucked up Harry realizing that he doesn't want to fight bad guys and would rather play quidditch and score some tail. However the author does it in a way that's pretty unique and very enjoyable. I'll admit that once I hit the latest chapters that I found I was getting a little bored and didn't want to read anymore. But the author updates either every other day or every day. Worth it. Would recommend.
