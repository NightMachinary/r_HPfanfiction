Here it is. Full curriculum for 7 Years at Hogwarts, with a simplified and more detailed syllabus for each subject as well as the rules on what subjects are taken when and how many. It also has some even more detailed stuff as examples of the work for various subjects - a full list of Charms taught, a partial list of Potions brewed, an explanation of the X Classification system used in the Care of Magical Creatures OWL and NEWT, a breakdown of both Warding and Ward Breaking as taught in the new Warding NEWT, and an example of an essay that would be handed in by a 5th Year History of Magic OWL student.
