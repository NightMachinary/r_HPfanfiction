I honestly thought that 98% of the story was incredibly well written, and I waited years for it to be completed. I thought the world building and background on a lot of the characters and scenes was well researched and thought out.

But that last 2%... man, that ending was such a let down.... Its like the author just gave up and decided "fuck it i'm out"
