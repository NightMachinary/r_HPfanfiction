Why wouldn't wizards have farms? The Weasley's have chickens, and Hagrid also had roosters / grew pumpkins. I don't think wizards are immune to needing manage farms and livestock. If anything, the fact that most don't have muggle money suggests that the wizarding community is entirely dependent on wizarding farms to get food.

Also, children aren't legally allowed to apparate, and it's also not a skill all adults have.
