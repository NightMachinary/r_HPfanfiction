What about Saturday or Sunday.

I see no reason why Hogwarts wouldn't have classes every day of the week. Reasons detailed below :

- The weekend is a newer concept and didn't exist before 1900, statute of secrecy went into effect long before then.

- Hogwarts is a boarding school, and even some modern boarding schools have short days on the weekend

- Hogwarts is comprised of students across 7 years. Scheduling would be MUCH easier on a teacher if it was broken down as such :

- 

  - Each year level per one day of the week. (first years on monday, second years on tuesday, etc.)

- 

  - Pre-newt years (years 1 - 5) are broken into 2 sections, Gryffindors and Slytherins pre-lunch, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaws post-lunch

- 

  - Newt years (years 6 - 7) are combined into one class pre-lunch (due to class prerequisites filtering students out)

- 

  - Post-Lunch weekends are for quidditch matches and hogsmeade visits.

Obviously the above example can't apply across all subjects at the same time, but it at least shows how much scheduling stress can be alleviated by including the weekends.
