The one I made for my fanfic does change a few things from canon, I gave McGonagall and Flitwick time-turners as they seem the most responsible, and some classes not specifically stated to be grouped together combine houses. I tried to follow what little canon information we have, but the inconsistency with regards to dates and days of the week and calendar info mean it's fairly. . . eh.

And even then, it was months of very annoying effort to get it to mesh properly. I didn't pay any attention to the supposed length of the subjects, so my times may be inaccurate or need tweaking on a case-by-case basis, but I don't care. It's good enough for me, and if anyone else would find it helpful go to it.

(My goodness I'm glad it's done because making that thing was miserable.)
