It's impossible, unless you add more teachers or ignore a lot of other students, or give all staff Time-Turners. I mean, have you ever seen a school that serves ~250 students across 7 grades with one teacher per subject? Yeah, nope.

I just chalk it up to magic and move on. Besides, why would you need the class schedule? What boring story could possiby need one?
