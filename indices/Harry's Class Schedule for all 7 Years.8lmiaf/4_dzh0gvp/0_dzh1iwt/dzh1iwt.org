Just wanted to see if someone's calculated it accurately. A schedule is handed out, so knowing it makes for worldbuilding.

And to be fair, 20 Lesson slots a week, easy for Electives as your whole year takes them at a time (only 5 classes) NEWT would have the Whole year for every subject. (2 Classes) And pre OWL you have 2 separate groups per year (10 Classes total) so each teacher has 12 Classes for a Core Subject, and 5 for an Elective. Each class is a maximum of 90 minutes (Double Potions. Quote about it being an hour and a half of Snape)

It's possible, it just means the teacher gets literally no rest period, outside of the 10m breaks, and after the day has ended (which also has them marking homework etc)
