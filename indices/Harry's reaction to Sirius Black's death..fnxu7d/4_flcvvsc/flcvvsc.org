The scene where Harry becomes undone in Dumbledore's office is one that never fails to bring a tear to my eye when I read it.

With the benefit of an adult perspective and better understanding of good writing, I am of the opinion (that is shared by many) that HBP was the lowest point of the series in terms of writing quality and story telling. He /absolutely/ should be torn up about Sirius through the whole book, but since that was a “last book problem” it gets toned down to ridiculous levels.

It's why I like so many of the “Harry smartens the fuck up” fics where he channels his self loathing, guilt, and anger into training himself to put Voldemort in the ground. Instead we get more “just skimming along” Harry who acts like he /hasn't/ just been told he has to fight a dangerous Dark Lord to the death, and teenage drama, and nobody goddamn listening to Harry about Malfoy. Cause not listening to Harry has gone sooooo well for anyone for the past five books.
