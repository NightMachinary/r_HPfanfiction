Lupin never contacting Harry: he didn't exist till book 3, and once he existed, can't go telling Harry relevant information before the halfway mark of the book!

He stops existing: he's a “book 3” character so clearly he can't help in book 4 /s In book 5 an argument could be made for him being too busy trying to sway the werewolves to not join Voldy to be seen elsewhere

Sirius' death: /no one/ grieves properly for Sirius, after the end of book five it's like it never happened

Running away from Tonks: this one continues to baffle me, not that he ran, but that he ran before he even knew if the baby would be like him. But the real reason it happened was to deprive the trio of any adult help for the Horcrux quest.

Basically it all boils down to “people, spells, and potions only exist when JKR needs them to exist”
