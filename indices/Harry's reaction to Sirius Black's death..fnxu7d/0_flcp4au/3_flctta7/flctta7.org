  Keep in mind that Harry had one evening to bond with Sirius, but an entire year to bond with Lupin who taught him the Patronus and all

I really don't understand Lupin's character, he never tried to keep in touch with Harry for 13 years. And when he finally does meet him, he doesn't tell anything about being his parents' best friend until Harry mentions hearing his father's voice during the patronus lessons. Then he is almost non existent in year 4 and 5. And inspite of so many people considering wolfstar as canon, he doesn't really grieve much after sirius' death. Finally in the deathly hallows he decides to accompany Harry, but that is just his way to avoid a pregnant Tonks.

Makes me wonder why James and Sirius went through the trouble of becoming animagus for him, lol.
