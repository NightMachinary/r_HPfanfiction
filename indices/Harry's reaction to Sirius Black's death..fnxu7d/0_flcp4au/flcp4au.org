I've noticed that in general Harry Potter books kinda start over, with many themes of the previous book just disappearing. Here are some glaring examples:

1. Harry never visits the Chamber of Secrets again, and Dumbledore doesn't ask him to open the entrance for him. Even though the Basilisk is dead, surely there is much interesting to see. However, everyone just forgets all about it until the Basilisk's fang becomes plot-relevant again.

2. In GoF Harry is desperate to get help from Sirius, but he totally forgets about Lupin. Keep in mind that Harry had one evening to bond with Sirius, but an entire year to bond with Lupin who taught him the Patronus and all. Lupin was in a much better position to help Harry with the Triwizard Tournament because he was not a fugitive, but still Harry never contacts him.

3. Also in GoF, no one ever suggests that Harry's participation in the Tournament could have been caused by Sirius. Apart from Harry and a few others, everyone thinks Sirius escaped from Azkaban in order to kill Harry. Everyone knows Sirius managed to enter Hogwarts three times within the last year. The previous year the Ministry went to considerable lengths to keep Harry safe, but suddenly, in the next book, the crisis has been totally forgotten, as if the Ministry knew that Sirius was not a threat.
