Yeah, this has always bugged me. JKR didn't handle grieving process realistically at all and Harry would not be 'back to normal' in just a few short weeks over the summer. The incidents with Sir Nicholoas and Luna certainly would have helped, but he'd still be torn up inside and hurting perhaps for months on end. I lost someone very dear to me when I wasn't much older than Harry and it blew up my entire world, and I'm still not entirely over it. So from experience? Harry got over Sirius's death much too quickly and easily. Especially given how it happened and that he witnessed it. I can attest that something like that will make it hit even harder than it would have.
