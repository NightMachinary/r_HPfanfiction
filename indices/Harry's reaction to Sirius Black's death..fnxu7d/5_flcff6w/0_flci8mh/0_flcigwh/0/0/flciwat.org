Fanfic has a concept for this. They're called mindhealers and even they can't work miracles.

Magic at most would speed things along somewhat, but to be blunt? Healing takes time and even magic could only do so much. It would not have shortened his grief and mouring into a nice neat few week period. Not to mention he had all the other shit you mentioned, and having untreated trauma makes any further much worse. Further traumatic events can and will worsen prexisting trauma as well, and its entire cascade and a real clusterfuck.

Again. I speak from long experience.

JKR dropped the ball. If that was her intent, she should have shown it and not left a unrealistic grieiving period or response to abuse.

"rue, but magic probably changes emotions and dealing with trauma."

Yeah no. Being a wizard wouldn't give one an innate resistence to psychological trauma or grief. Otherwise Harry wouldn't have been shwoing very clear signs of PTSD due to Cedric's death.
