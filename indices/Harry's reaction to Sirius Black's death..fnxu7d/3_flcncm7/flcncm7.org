There's a nice little oneshot that attempts to address this issue. Basically, while on Dumbledore-enforced isolation at Privet Prison over the summer, he meets a girl at the park who has recently lost a family member. They bond over their mutual grief, and for a few weeks he finally has somebody to talk to, albeit she is a fellow sufferer and not a professional.

And then the f-ing Oblivation squad comes along and wipes both their memories. So his grief is "buffered" but he doesn't have any clue why.
