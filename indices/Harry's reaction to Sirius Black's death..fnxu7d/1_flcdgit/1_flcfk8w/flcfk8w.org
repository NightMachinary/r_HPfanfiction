Even with Luna's talk and Sir Nicholas, he still would have been hurting and torn up inside. Especially given that he saw it happen and how it happened. Going from enraged and grieving to almost completely normal in just a few short weeks is completely unrealistic for a grieving process. That shit can and most often does take months or even years, and it leaves you forever changed.
