I don't think they do - they have more evidence than we do but nothing definite. Ghosts are imprints? Souls? of people who have decided to remain on this plane (earth). They don't know anything about the afterlife. Voldemort shows that there exists a state where one can survive incorperally. However, he is still clearly in this plane - he hasnt gone beyond. The resurrection stone (which harry doesent know about yet) is the strongest evidence wizardkind have. It brings back people who seem to know too much to be mere memory manifestations - however we don't know for sure AND no one knows about it apart from a select few very learned individuals.

By far the strongest evidence there is for afterlife is Harry's journey into limbo. He meets Dumbledore who knows things Harry does not. He see's a shard of voldemort - a soul shard which points to a sign that limbo is indeed a stopping point for souls (something outside the material plane). He sees a train which would take him beyond and knows from the stone that people seem to be able to be called back. He knows this must be real in some way because he was hit by a killing curse.

He didn't know the strong evidence until his seventh year however.
