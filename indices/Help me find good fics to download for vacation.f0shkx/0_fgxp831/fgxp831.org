I was just rereading [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War by Mrs_Granger]] and I have been enjoying it tremendously. It is probably too canonical for your taste, but I would still recommended it to your attention.
