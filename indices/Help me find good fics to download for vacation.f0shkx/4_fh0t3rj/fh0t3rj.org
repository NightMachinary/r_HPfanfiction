Girl, you had me hooked on Time travel. There's this one series it starts off with.

Idk how to work the bot- Draco travels back to first year and befriends Harry. The second book has this really interesting premise where Draco gets possessed by the Diary instead of Ginny, I really liked that.

Another time travel fic and another series fic where Draco goes back to first year yet again, this time he's sent back by the centaurs to â€˜fix everything'

I really like this one where Draco travels back in time, it's got Harry/Draco slash and Draco gets sorted into Ravenclaw this time. The actual slash doesn't start until a tad bit later into their third year or maybe fourth, featured Pinning!Harry, Oblivious!Draco and Draco's actually on Ron's good side!

Draco goes back in time to first year, gets sorted into Gryffindor all whilst trying not to be a dick about it.

I have a problem with Draco and time travel.
