Okay this ones pretty different with a good premise. Draco gets a letter from the future basically telling him not to be a prick and be nice to Harry in the robeshop, which results in everything going differently, Draco befriends the golden trio and it does feature some beautifully written Pinning!Draco with some Pinning!Harry.
