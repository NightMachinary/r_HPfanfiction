Here's a random selection of fics I've enjoyed. And when I say random, I mean random.

linkao3(2352896; 12424344; 1124404; 7944847; 15068012)

linkffn(12005496; 10216252, 8148717, 3124159, 11027125; 12005755; 2857962)

I'd like to add [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/755028][this series right here]] but it violates the Snape as a protagonist rule. I also dislike him, and hate that he's part of the primary pairing (even if the pairing isn't a huge part of the story)... but the series itself is goddamn amazing so I deal with it.
