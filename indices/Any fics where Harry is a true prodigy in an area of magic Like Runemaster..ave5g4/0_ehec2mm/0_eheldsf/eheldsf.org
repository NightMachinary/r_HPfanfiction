Geek Of Magic is brilliant, but I decided to stop reading until it is completed, or hasn't been updated in six months. The way the story flows makes it way better to read in one sitting instead of waiting for chapters. I haven't read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, because it sounded very tropy. Is ge OP, and/pr learns Wandless magic easily. Sorry, it just sounds like that kind of story, and I wouldn't mind spoilers much if you could clear it up a bit.

Thanks,\\
