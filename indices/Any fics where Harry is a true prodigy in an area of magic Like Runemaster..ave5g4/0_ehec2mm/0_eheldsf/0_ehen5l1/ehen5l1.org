I would say it's actually not really tropey at all. IIRC, he doesn't know any wandless magic. I don't think it has any of the usual living Potters, wrong boy-who-lived or brother of the boy-who-lived-tropes. His family gets along just fine, with some minor speed bumps. Dumbledore doesn't suspect he's the next Dark Lord - He even helped Harry convince his parents to allow him to go to Durmstrang.

I mean he's OP for his age, but that's what being a prodigy of magic means. The upper year students shouldn't have much of a problem beating him if they were to fight, to say nothing of experienced adult wizards. It really doesn't come up though, he's not getting into fights. The canon plot stuff happens at Hogwarts, and his brother is the one going through that. I imagine that if the fic continued, he'd be pretty fearsome by the time he graduated. That's just how it goes if the character is a real prodigy.

Other than talent, the reason he's so good is that magic is his passion and he's been studying it for years before going to school, as much as his parents would allow. It's basically all he does in his free time.
