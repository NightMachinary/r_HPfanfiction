It's not really a bashing story, it mostly focuses on cool rune stuff, his mentor/parental relationship with Bathsheba Babbling, and his romantic relationships. It is a harem, but it's got an actually pretty reasonably healthy polycule dynamic going on and I didn't find it excessively ooc or offputting like I often find fanfic harems. Dumbledore is more on the negligently abusive/obsessed with control side, but he's not actively EVIL just a bag of dicks.
