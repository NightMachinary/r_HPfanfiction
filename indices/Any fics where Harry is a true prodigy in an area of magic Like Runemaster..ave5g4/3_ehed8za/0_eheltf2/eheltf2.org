Is Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path really a half a million bashing OP Harry story. I don't think I could read that, sorry. I like OP Harry stories, but it takes a lot to get me in the mood for a bashing story, and only for stories that are at most 120k words, and that's if the story itself is interesting. The Art of Self-Fashioning is one I stopped reading some chapters in, I don't really remember why, i'll have to have a look at it again.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
