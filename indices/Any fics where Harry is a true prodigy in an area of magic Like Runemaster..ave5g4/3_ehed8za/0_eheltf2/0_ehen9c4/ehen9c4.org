I think I stopped reading Art of Self Fashioning when Harry decided that 'hiding' his true skills is the best course of action. Nothing against the author or the plot device, I think you only need that plot device when the author wants the Main Character to be powerful but not affect the canon plot line much with his abilities. It just shows lack of creativity and imagination in my opinion.
