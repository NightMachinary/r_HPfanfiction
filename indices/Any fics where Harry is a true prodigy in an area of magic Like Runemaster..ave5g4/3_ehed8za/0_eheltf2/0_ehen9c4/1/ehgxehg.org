What I liked about it was that it showed a Harry that was realistically damaged from the exaggerated abuse many Indy!Harry fics use. He was so untrusting of anyone, even McGonagall who tried so hard to reach him. He's a bit too OP towards the end, and many side characters hold the idiot ball, but the author's use of emotion throughout was pretty good imho.
