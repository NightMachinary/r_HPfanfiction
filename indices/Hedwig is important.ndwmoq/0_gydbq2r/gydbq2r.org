Hedwig being major emotional support is actually pretty accuracte to canon as well. Harry was more devastated than I was losing my pet dog of 10+ years. Plus I find that most stories have her being a kind of support for Harry early on at least. The way Harry is terrified even of accidentally leaving Hedwig at the Dursleys/castle/Hermiones/Rons is hilarious.
