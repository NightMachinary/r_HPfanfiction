My issue isn't with OOC characterization with HPMOR so much as the fact that he's just a little asshole. He's entitled, spoiled, and selfish. He's super smart and super powerful though, so it somehow makes it okay. Except, it doesn't. I know for a fact that a lot of people absolutely hate it, too, and read for the thoughts on the way that the magical world works. I just can't get past the insipid main character enough to want to read anything else.
