I HATE stories where the characters are so far away from the personalities they were in the books.

HPMOR? Can't STAND it. Harry's this entitled little shit, who knows much more than humanly possible in the FIRST FIVE CHAPTERS, and he treats everyone like they're his little slaves and playthings. Sorry, but no. All the theory about the Magical World that could possibly be thought of, would not get me to ever try that story again.

Luna being a brainless little twit? Uh, no.

Hermione being a doormat, or overly girlish? No. Sorry boys, but Emma Watson was not actually what book Hermione looked like.

Draco Malfoy turning good too easily. (Note: Dramione fics can be AMAZING, when they follow character personality.) Draco Malfoy is a coward, raised by Death Eaters. He's a stubborn little shit, that would have to go through some SERIOUS soul-searching (or whatever) before Hermione would ever even consider him someone that she'd like to date.
