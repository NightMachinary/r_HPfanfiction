When it's written (apparently) by sixteen-year-old virginal porn addicts who have yet to know a woman's touch, I think it justifies my chancing a "rant about Harry Potter fanfiction" comment.

Look, people have their kinks, I get that. People dig the wish fulfillment thing, an objectified, blonde, blue-eyed, no-strings-attached, freaky sex addict. Bully for them. Just don't ask me to enjoy the same. Luna is one of my favorite characters and seeing her reduced time and again to an animatronix sex doll just rubs me the wrong way.
