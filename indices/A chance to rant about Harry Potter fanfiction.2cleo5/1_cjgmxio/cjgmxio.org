The worst thing to me is just bad character portrayal.

The Dramione fics where Draco is just fawning over Hermione, acting like a lovesick puppy and shit just drives me crazy.

Draco would never in a thousand years act that way. Same with Hermione just being submissive and accepting his /love/~ right away!
