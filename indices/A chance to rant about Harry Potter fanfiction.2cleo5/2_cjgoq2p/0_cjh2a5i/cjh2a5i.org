Same thing with the "he's not all bad, I can change him!" fallacy with Hermione/Snape that requires both of them to be out of character (not to talk about how the ship is fucked up in so many ways in the first place).

It's funny that I see a lot of complaints about Dramione below "often" having characters go ooc. It's impossible to have Dramione without having characters go ooc, so I don't know why they read it in the first place if they want a realistic ship.

I think I've only (tried) read one fic of each, both recommended here, and they just made no sense. If you need to change characters to the point where they're not recognizable just for the ship to work, why make it a harry potter fanfiction in the first place?
