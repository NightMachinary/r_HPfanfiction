I think that it can work if one "matures" the characters while staying true to certain vital aspects of their personalities (I.e. stubborn, passionate, Draco's arrogant, Hermione's an activist). I don't mind seeing some changes that make sense, like Draco going through a "realization" that what he was taught by his father was not right. It makes sense, especially in post-war fics. But when characters do a complete 180 and make zero sense, that irks me.

So, some plausible changes (that can be explained) are fine for me, but when people go to extremes it is a huge turn off.

And I totally agree with the gross factor of Hermione/Snape fics. Not only is the age gap disturbing, but he would never go for her because she's not even a redhead. Har...har... but yeah, just icky.
