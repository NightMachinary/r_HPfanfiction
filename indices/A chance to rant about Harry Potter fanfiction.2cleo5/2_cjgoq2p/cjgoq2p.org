I hate the "perfect" and submissive portrayals of Hermione in Dramiones. Most start with her having her heart shattered (usually by Ron, usually because he was a cheating jerk who winds up with Lavender or Pansy - WTF?!) and she just happens to meet with Draco at work/Diagon Alley/Hogwarts. He suddenly goes slack-jawed, steam shoots out of his ears, stomps his foot, and he pants like a bad 90's cartoon male seeing a hot chick. She went through this transformation where she suddenly has mega boobs, a tight waist, perfect shape, her face is like a model's, and her hair is suddenly straight or super tame.

And then she gets all quiet and submissive, never fights back, just cries whenever something goes wrong, and she hardly uses her brain. And you're left thinking "where the fuck did Hermione go?"

I hate it. Absolutely hate it. I already hate it in general when people mess up characters, but they go to extremes with Hermione, Ron (who always becomes some giant and abusive prick for no reason), and Draco. It makes me want to throw my laptop out of the window.
