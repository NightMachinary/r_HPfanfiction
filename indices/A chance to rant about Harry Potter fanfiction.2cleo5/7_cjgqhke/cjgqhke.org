Women as wallpaper. Women as devoted love interests with no motivations beyond keeping Harry's regard and helping him out. They're all identical except for some minor flavoring, so it ends up being boring, and I kind of like reading about real human characters rather than Harry's mindless slaves.

95% of fan fiction involving women as major characters seems to go this way.
