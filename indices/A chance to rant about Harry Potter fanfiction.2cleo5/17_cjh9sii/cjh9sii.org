I have only two annoyances [and I will be downvoted for this, I know]:

ALL SLASH IS DRARRY. Just it's ridiculous how much slash is darry and considering the male/female ratio of the canon you would think there would be something more than draco harry smutfests [/cough/ makemoretomarrynontimetravelplz/cough] about.

I want more mpreg but make it reasonable. If I can write a scientifically viable mpreg fict without it being buttbabies or magic on a shaky idea of human physiology at best, I am sure SOMEONE can manage it without turning the mum-er-dad to be into a hermaphrodite. I have read ONE fict that works it out and it glosses over the birth without making it obvious. And has a reasonable explanation why it happened. Less people would hate mpreg if you explained it better.

meta note: I am really sick of this subreddit downvoting anything slash related.
