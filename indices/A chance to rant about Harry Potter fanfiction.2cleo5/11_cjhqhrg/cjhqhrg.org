I am really peeved by the people who want to write Dramione fics, but want to keep it canon, so they turn Scorpius and Rose in carbon copies of their parents and have them make out. I've only read one Rose/Scorpius fic I enjoyed and it was because the characters were their own people and their relationship didn't develop in a predictable "I hate but I love" pattern. When people pull the same shit with Scorpius and Albus I also get a little peeved. Let them be their own characters!

Also, fanfics written for porn's sake really bother me. Yeah, a sex scene can be appropriate, but 98% of the time it isn't and it's just the author typing out their fantasy (and typing it out poorly, I might add). It feels kind of disrespectful to the canon and to the characters.

And finally, angst gives me headaches.

EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to mention my concern over /any student ever//Snape. It's creepy. It just is. Why can't Snape find happiness with someone who's actually age appropriate? Teacher/student relationships make me uncomfortable in general, but with Snape it's just... so messed up. The thought processes that go behind those ships make me extra distressed.
