Get what you mean in the part about a writer getting so involved with the romance that the plot is just sitting in the corner waiting to be recognised. I read a fanfic where they were so engrossed with the plot that Harry was battling Voldemort then saw Hermione (who of course was called fucking Mione) dally Harry and they stared at each other and started kissing saying how much they love each other. Seriously WTF!

Of course Harry win as he also happened to have found out (by you guessed it a letter from Gringotts) that he is Harold Potter-Black Slytherin Gryffindor Ravenclaw Hufflepuff Merlin Riddle Peverell Gaunt, and he is super powerful.
