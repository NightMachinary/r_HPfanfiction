What do you mean.. character bashing is for the (you know the catchphrase come on finish my sentence) *THE FUCKING GREATER GOOD*. OMFG does this phrase come up on the really bad character bashes that will make the Weasely's steal from Harry and Dumbledore be a master manipulator who is actually evil and wants to be the best.
