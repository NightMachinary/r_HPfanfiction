Okay, since I'm known for slash, I shall rant about Slashy Cliches.

Everyone's Gay: Really? In the U.S, only five percent of men are gay. Therefore, in a population of 500 students at school, there would only be 25 gay kids. NOT THE ENTIRE SCHOOL. C'mon, let's be realistic. In my school, there was only two openly gay kids out of 350. I'm being generous with 25.

Everyone's Okay With Gay: In a lot of fics, everyone is perfectly fine with homosexual couples. However, the Wizarding world is stuck in the Victorian Era! Up until recently, WE HAVEN'T BEEN OKAY WITH HOMOSEXUALITY. If the WW can't get over blood purity, WHY WOULD THEY BE OKAY WITH PEOPLE BEING GAY?

MPreg: No, just no.
