My propriety/decency filter has been damaged for a long time, as demonstrated in my written works.

I read the passage and said to myself, "No, Hermione wouldn't 'coo', she'd scream for Harry to put that monster away and then drag him to Madam Pomfrey for treatment of an out of control Engorgio or for using a switching spell on Hagrid... or Firenze."

The real stumper to me- if the author is male (as one would suspect), just how low is their self-esteem when they're in the shower facing their personal reality and they come up with those numbers for what they /wish/ they had?
