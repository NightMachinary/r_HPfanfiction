Very petty and ridiculously specific moment of rage related to bad mathematics:

I was reading yet another Harry harem power fantasy (in a moment of weakness) and the author describes Harry at the well-seasoned old age of fifteen, whipping out his equipment for the first time, and for Hermione's first time, and described said tool as '3 inches thick and 16 inches long, making Hermione coo with delight.'

Rrrrrrreally.

Advised the author to travel to their local grocer/butcher and use a measuring tape on a 3-lb tube of ground beef and then tell me why anyone who isn't part-centaur would think that's something they're looking forward to inserting into a bodily orifice, much less all three, especially for the first go.
