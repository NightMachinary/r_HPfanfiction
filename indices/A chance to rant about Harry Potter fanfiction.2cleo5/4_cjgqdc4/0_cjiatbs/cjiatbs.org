Hermione is extremely mature, so I can't fault authors on that aspect. She just has NEVER had any sort of reasonable relationship before and that's where authors fall off their chain. She kissed Krum what, once? and Ron in the final battle. She was always too busy fighting with Ron and Harry to even consider a relationship. But I also hate when they play Hermione to be this huge like mega-virgin goddess and super submissive (esp in Dramoine fics).
