Things I really hate when reading fanfiction:

Hermione in Dramione fics written as an emotionally inflexible, shrill speaking, super bossy, I-am-better-than-you, my-opinion-is-always-right menace. I know she is some of these things some of the time but all of these things all of the time? It gets to be too much. I hate how a lot of authors portray her this way.

Draco in Hogwarts Era (at least) Drarry stories written as this crying, insecure, whimpering, lovesick, vulnerable, sniveling mess of a man when it comes to Harry. I only see him written this way in Drarry fics, where in Dramione, he's written as a much stronger character.

Hermione in Hogwarts Era Snape/Hermione stories written as this wise relationship expert even though she's like 18 years old and never had a significant relationship before. Authors write her much, much more mature than what she should be.
