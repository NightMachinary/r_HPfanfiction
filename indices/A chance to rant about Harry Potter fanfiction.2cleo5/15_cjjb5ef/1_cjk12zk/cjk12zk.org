If I see someone say "with a beard long enough to tuck into his belt" one more time somebody is going to fucking get hurt.

The only place this could possibly be reasonable would be if you're deep, deep into a story that's far removed from canon and you're unveiling Dumbledore's surprise entrance into the story.

And I swear, I've read storie*s* where /every goddamn time/ someone returns to consciousness they are described as "blinking owlishly." Just... NO.
