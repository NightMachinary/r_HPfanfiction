  WHY IS DUMBLEDORE ALWAYS A SCHEMING DICKBAG?!
#+end_quote

Honestly, there aren't that many options.

Harry's guardians:

- The Dursleys are actually decent guardians. Dumbledore spoke to them before leaving Harry with them. He checks up on Harry on occasion. He doesn't think Voldemort will return within the next couple decades.
- The Dursleys refused to take Harry. Dumbledore placed him with another family. He doesn't think that Voldemort will return within the next couple decades.
- Dumbledore raises Harry. He suspects Voldemort will return soon, so he teaches Harry to be a warrior capable of defending himself against Voldemort and eventually of defeating him.
- Dumbledore wants Harry to be abused for some reason.
- Minerva McGonagall is strongly biased against Muggles, or her assessment of the Dursleys is in some other way highly suspect. Dumbledore is blindingly oblivious to the possibility of child abuse, despite his day job focusing on children.

Harry's training:

- Dumbledore thinks Voldemort will not return and start the fight again until well after Harry graduates. If you go this route, he will stick to this until mid-1991 with very high probability, until mid-1994 with high probability, and until the Department of Mysteries battle with low probability.
- Dumbledore wants Harry to fail.
- Dumbledore trusts the prophecy to keep Harry alive until some nebulous unspecified power automatically kills Voldemort. This Dumbledore has faith in the prophecy, the sort of faith that motivates parents to pray for their dying children rather than providing actual medical care that could easily save the kid's life. But instead of dooming one child, Dumbledore is dooming hundreds of people. The fact that it works in the end does not excuse his negligence.
- Dumbledore trains Harry as best he can. This can reasonably start as early as Harry's fifth birthday or as late as Voldemort's reincarnation, but earlier is better.

If you want to stay close to canon, Dumbledore is either evil or insanely negligent.

That said, a lot of fan fiction does a poor job of making an evil Dumbledore.
