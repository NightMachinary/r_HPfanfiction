1. I know... I loved the first few fics I read with manipulative Dumbledore. But it gets old fast. Especially because he is mostly written as a one-dimensional dumb villain, used only to show Harry's superiority in magical/political/financial matters.

2. Not really an issue for me if well written. I do, however, have problems with Harry unfailingly acquiring homosexual urges when bitten by a werewolf. And with male veela stuff.

Also: MPREG. Please, authors. Some things are impossible even with magic. I don't care how much you wish Harry and Snape had a cute daughter. Just don't do it.
