If the buffoon you're referring to was Lockhart, it's worse than that. He hired Lockhart as a revenge tactic. He knew some of the victims personally and either a) wanted proof Lockhart definitely did it, or b) wanted Lockhart to succumb to the curse over the position. It wasn't a decision that could in any way benefit the students. He even USED Harry's fame, without his knowledge or consent, to get Lockhart to take the job. At least with slughorn, Harry knew.

Edit for those reading: check the wiki page on Lockhart. I consider books, interviews, and Pottermore to be canon. This information was provided in Pottermore book 2.
