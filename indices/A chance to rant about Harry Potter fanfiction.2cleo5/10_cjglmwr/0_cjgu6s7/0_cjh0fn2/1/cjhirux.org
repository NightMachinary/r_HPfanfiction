  for the greater good
#+end_quote

many works of fiction have already explored this theme to the point where most readers know it to actually mean "for my particular set of, often misguided, ideals". Hence most authors use it in that sense and don't bother explaining it in the same way that most authors these days might mention Nazism without also bothering to describe it negatively - the expectation is that all readers would already know that part.

I've been reading fantasy/fiction for over 20 years and I don't remember a single novel where "for the greater good" was used verbatim and actually meant what the phrase says instead of the opposite.
