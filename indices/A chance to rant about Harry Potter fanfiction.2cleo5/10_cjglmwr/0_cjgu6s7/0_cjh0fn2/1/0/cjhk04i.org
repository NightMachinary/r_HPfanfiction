Whenever I have read it, it's meant "the ends justify the means", implying a willingness to endure smaller acts of morally questionable nature to achieve a larger objective (which the reader may or may not agree with). And with that meaning it comes up in novels all the time - it's a classic 'villain' signifier to be so convinced that their goal is worth the sacrifice, particularly of others. But that's not the opposite of what it says, and it's not the only form of villainy,

I've never heard it diluted just to say "for my particular set of ideals" - it implies more than that. I mean, no one says "No, we must read him his Miranda rights - /for the greater good/" or "I insist on due process - /for the greater good/" or "Give the child back her teddy bear - /for the greater good/" because these are the sort of 'minor' things that the antagonist would sacrifice to achieve the greater goal.

And the problem with Dumbledore is that he frequently seems to risk his declared ultimate 'greater' objectives in order to get relatively insignificant ones. It doesn't fit the ends justifying means deviousness of "the greater good" at all.
