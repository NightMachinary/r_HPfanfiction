The thing that annoys me is the fanfiction cliche of him doing everything /for the greater good/. He obviously doesn't - in fact, his problem is that he does the opposite. Instead of trying to help the most people, he is actually willing to risk everyone's lives on convoluted schemes to save one person's moral conscience or because he does not yet have solid proof of something that he knows is true (like early Riddle's maleficence).

Sometimes in fanfiction you get dialogues where these things are presented in juxtaposition without anyone noticing the contradiction - "You decided to die, to have Hogwarts invaded by Death Eaters, have Bill Weasley almost become a werewolf, and leave the critical characters in the dark - all so that you could save Malfoy for the greater good!". That sentiment doesn't make any sense. Clearly Dumbledore's motivation, however fucked-up it is in practice, is not "the greater good".

In fact you could write a fanfiction where Grindelwald's supposed "greater good" became so repulsive to Dumbledore that he went way too far in the other direction. It would make more sense of what he actually does.
