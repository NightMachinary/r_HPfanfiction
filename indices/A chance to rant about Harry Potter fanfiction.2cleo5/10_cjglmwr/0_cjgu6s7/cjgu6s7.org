  Seriously, about half of the fics I read blame nearly everything from Voldemort to World War 2 on Dumbeldore! It's one of the most consistent perversions of a character I've seen in any fandom ever!

It would be more of a perversion to treat him like magical beardy Jesus the way canon generally does.

- He let the war with Grindelwald rage on for quite a while just because he didn't want to face Grindelwald.
- He knew what Tom Riddle was long before he became Lord Voldemort, especially after the first opening of the Chamber of Secrets, and he did nothing.
- After Harry was orphaned Dumbledore dropped him off at the Dursleys' with nothing more than a note. He had no authority to do so. He's a schoolmaster and the head of a legislative body, not whatever the wizarding equivalent of a social services worker is.
- He basically groomed Harry to be willing to sacrifice himself so that the horcrux in him could be destroyed.
- He left three teenagers with the task of finding and dealing with Voldemort's horcruxes by themselves.
- He was grossly negligent in his duties as headmaster of Hogwarts.

  - He hired: 1) a man who frequently belittled and terrorized the children under his care and 2) a man possessed by Voldemort, a clearly incompetent buffoon and a death eater in disguise as DADA instructors.
  - He hid bait for Voldemort in a school full of children, secured by an /obstacle course/ that was potentially lethal and yet still was defeated by a group of preteens.
  - When the Chamber of Secrets was opened a second time he either let a basilisk run free in the castle or a thirteen year old actually figured out what was happening before he did.

The problem isn't people writing him as a scheming dickbag, it's that most authors can't write a complex, flawed character that's kind of /is/ a scheming dickbag.
