Even with all of these reasons to dislike some fanfiction, the thing that annoys me the most is when people use "banished" in place of "vanished".

"He banished the trash." He physically moved it to the location his wand is pointed at? Oh you mean that he magically disintegrated it into nothingness.

It's the simplest thing and I'll grant that it could be a result of B and V being keyboard neighbors but it bugs the shit out of me. /Depulso/ â‰  /Evanesco/
