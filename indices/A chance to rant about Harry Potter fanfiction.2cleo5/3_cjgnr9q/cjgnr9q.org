Don't get me started on Mary Sues, or even worse, Hermione who over summer gets braces (and ditches them before summer is over, didn't think that worked so fast), gets a new haircut, make up, clothes etc. Or those stories that seem to center on describing every single piece of clothing the characters are wearing. Ugh and I'll still read it through the end because I still want to know how it ends and it always dissappoints :(
