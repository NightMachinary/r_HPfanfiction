Now the thing I would like to rant about in fanfictions is the character portrayal of Fred and George Weasley. Now don't get me wrong I actually like the twins in canon as they actually have some depth and aren't one dimension bullshit pieces of cardboard that will do ping-pong style speech patterns and will always side with Harry giving him their 1000% alliance no matter what happens.

On the subject of the ping pong speech, let me copy what I have written before

  Bloody fucking hell does it piss me the fuck off! a lot of fanfic writers giving Fred and George (which they at one point will insist on call Gred and Feroge) this bull shit ping pong speech type. Sure after the first fanfic it can be overlooked, but after the next 80 it makes me drop the fanfic quicker than Voldemort pulling the killing Curse. Not only is this load of Hippogrith excretation popular in fanfics the fact that Fred and George are so one dimensional and annoying as fuck.

Now as I know writing characters in a fanfic is hard, but the most annoying trap a writer could ever do is to fall to the Gred and Forge cliche.
