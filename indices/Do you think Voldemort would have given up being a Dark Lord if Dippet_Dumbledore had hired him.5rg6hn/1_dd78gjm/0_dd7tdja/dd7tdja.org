There's a few very good Tomione/Vomione fics if you're interested in that. Lady Miya is my favorite, but there's also uchiha.s, Nerys, and others easily findable, the community is pretty small. You'll find most on Ao3. In Shared Flame by Lady Miya, Voldemort escapes the final battle and has a change of plans and he's becomes a teacher in a magical university. I really, really love that fic. Lady Miya doesn't do time travel but others do, Hermione usually goes to the past for a reason or another and ends up in school with Tom.
