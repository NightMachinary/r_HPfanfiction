I think at the time Voldemort applied for the position, he was already way ahead in his quest for supremacy. Dumbledore even says that he knows Voldemort's "friends" were waiting for him in Hogsmeade.

If Voldemort would turn around at some point it would have to be during his time at Hogwarts as a student, or even sooner. Basically, someone would have to show him some compassion and take an active interest in him.

Though, to be fair, depending on how you interpret some parts of his character, maybe actively working together with wizards and witches of lighter souls would have changed something.

I can imagine it being an interesting read if Voldemort would be turned light by, for example, McGonagall. At this point he already created (I think) 3 horcrux and killed a whole bunch of people. Finding love, against all odds, would throw an interesting wench into that hate-machine.
