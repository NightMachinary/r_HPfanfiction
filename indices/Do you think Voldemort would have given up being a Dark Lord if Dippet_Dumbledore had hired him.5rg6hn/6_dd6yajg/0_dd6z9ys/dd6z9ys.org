Right. Because Voldemort was the only student in Hogwarts living in London at that time. Don't try to use this to bash Dumbledore. Voldemort was clearly a sociopath by the time they met.

And Dumbledore wasn't even in charge back when Riddle was at school. He had no authority over Riddle's living arrangements. That would've be up to Dippet. Even then, he couldn't move him anyway. "Oh London is being attacked. Well, better move this student and ONLY this student from London."
