Well what is it then? We see that not one teacher during the seven years we see during the series retains the job for more than a year. At least one more before Quirrel, because it was his first year back from sabbatical. This has likely been going on for a long time or else how would the rumor that the position is cursed even start and also because it seemed like Dumbledore was scraping the bottom of the barrel with his choice of teachers. It's incredibly unlikely that for more than a decade not one teacher stayed on for more then a year and it was all just /bad luck/.
