I tend to think he applied and got rejected before that, possibly several times. The last time, he came to plead his case in person, but he knew it wouldn't work. So he cursed the position and hid his horcrux and went on his way.

But if he'd been accepted as at least an assistant professor, well, he'd still have a Dark following, but I think he'd have been less violent and more political in his methods. A presence in Hogwarts isn't the same as control of Hogwarts, but it still gives you access to the next generation of most everyone who matters. And it soaks up a lot of the time you'd spend on raids.
