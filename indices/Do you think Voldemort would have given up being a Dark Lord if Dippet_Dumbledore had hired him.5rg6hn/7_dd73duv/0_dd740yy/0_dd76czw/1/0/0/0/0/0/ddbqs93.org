that's all reasonable enough but jk wrote it the other way. it's just one of those points which she spelled out to get a point across, and you have to accept it. too much love potion during conception messes your baby up. like when she tells you sirius and remus are nice good guys even though they act like dicks, and historically fail potter all his life; except before the time they die and off course they love him... if you don't accept they're good people it kind of ruins whole parts of the books. not sure why this needs an argument; voldemort is allergic to love.
