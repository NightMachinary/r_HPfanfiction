I don't think you quite understand how it all went, in this case. The only “magic” there was in the whole love potions thing was the fake infatuation Tom Riddle Senior felt towards Merope. Him rejecting her was no magic but rather him coming to his senses once the magic was gone and making a decision. Her dying was likewise not anything caused by magic but instead simply her taking the rejection really badly and not having the strength of character to cling onto life and survive. And Tom's inability to love is not because of love potions but because his mother died and his father did not know about him, leaving him amongst people but very much alone and without anyone who would truly love him.

People don't need love potions to grow up twisted when they have nobody and are never taught that love is a thing via being loved. To blame this on love potions in this example means insisting that Merope could only love Tom if she herself took a love potion, which is an idea so absurd that it doesn't even really warrant a response. There is a lot wrong with his conception because of the fact that love potions were used, yes---it counts as Merope raping Tom Riddle Senior and generally keeping him as her slave with use of mind-altering drugs which is very very wrong---but love potions are simply one of the elements of this whole incident and they had no effect on Tom whatsoever.

And again, there's no “magic that screwing with love has repercussions”. Both of the cases when something happened seemingly of love (Lily's sacrifice and Harry's sacrifice) that we see in canon are situations where it's taking back the deal after it already went through that caused the effect we saw and the only thing love did in both cases is make the ones sacrificing themselves take the deal. Love was important in the series, sure, but it wasn't “magic” in any shape or form and to treat it as such greatly diminishes the weight of the decisions Harry and Lily made.
