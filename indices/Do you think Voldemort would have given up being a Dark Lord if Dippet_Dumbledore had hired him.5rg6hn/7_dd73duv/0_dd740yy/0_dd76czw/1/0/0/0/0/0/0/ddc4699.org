Except that Madame Rowling said that had Merope lived Tom would not have been the kind of person he was, so regardless of whether or not love potions can mess with a kid's mind it's how they are raised that matters. And again, as I already wrote, you don't need love potions to get a kid that is all kinds of messed up; heck, I personally know someone who did grow all kinds of messed up simply because his parents weren't showing them love, and there were no love potions involved whasoever.

And the rest of your reply feels like a random nonsense tacked onto it for no good reason, so I will refrain from replying to that part.
