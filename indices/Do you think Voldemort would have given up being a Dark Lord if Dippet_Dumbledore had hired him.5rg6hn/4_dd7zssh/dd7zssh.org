No, I seriously doubt it. Riddle is a sociopath, if you look at his behavior in his youth. He has no empathy for others, and all emotions are fake.

This is why he was able to charm /everyone/ - he learned which reactions give the best result, and simply applied that. While 'normal' people react instinctively in most cases, Riddle has simply academically learned what reactions are good and appropriate, and does that.
