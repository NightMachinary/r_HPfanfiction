Doubt it, Voldemort didn't want the position bc he was passionate about being a teacher. He wanted to search for more hogwarts artifacts, maybe open the chamber again and spread his influence and thoughts to his students.

He would have probably stayed a few years, get a few death eater pals to follow his orders while he stayed at his post and eventually resign and continue on his dark lord ways.
