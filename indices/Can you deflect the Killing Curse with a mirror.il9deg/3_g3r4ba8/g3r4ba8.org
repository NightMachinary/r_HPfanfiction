The Killing Curse kills. If it doesn't hit a living being, then it merely causes a great amount of damage to the object. A mirror was never stated to reflect a curse - and I don't know why it should, to be honest. In Book 2, the mirror was broken by the Basilisk, but the effect of the magic comes from seeing its eyes - which is the reason why Hermione was petrified. She saw a reflection of its eyes, a lesser copy - and was hit by a lesser copy of the Basilisk's Eyes Curse.

So there's two things preventing a mirror from reflecting the Killing Curse. One, a mirror doesn't reflect magic. Two, the Killing Curse destroys that which cannot be killed.
