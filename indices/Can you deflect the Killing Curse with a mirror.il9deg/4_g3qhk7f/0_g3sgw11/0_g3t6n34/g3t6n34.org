This seems likely, based on the duel between Voldie and Dumbledore in OotP.

It would be interesting to experiment on the minimum density of different types of material to block it, and see if you could put the Auror Office in anti-AK body armor. On the other hand, given how much Potter magic seems to rely on reflexes and dodging, it might be thought that armour isn't worth the reduced mobility, but that could be off-set with lightening charms, etc.
