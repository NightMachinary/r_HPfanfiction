Who ever said it was “paper” confetti? I was thinking Iron, myself. That way, it'll block an AK, but when directed to strike a target it'll work as well as any wood chipper. What spell do you cast to defend yourself against ballistic iron shavings? Better yet, use real iron and keep it in a Mokeskin Pouch.

How much would a Vanisher get rid of? All of it, or only the one confetti piece?
