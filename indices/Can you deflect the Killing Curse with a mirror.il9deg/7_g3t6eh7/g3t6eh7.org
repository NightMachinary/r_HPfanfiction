Physical objects of sufficient density may be able to block it (obviously clothing doesn't). Which makes me wonder if, say, a knight in armor (or a guy in a bullet-proof vest) could survive a hit. Of course, it seems to go off like a grenade when it can't pass through something (blowing apart statues and setting fires during the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort), so it might still be lethal- it just would be messier and less certain.
