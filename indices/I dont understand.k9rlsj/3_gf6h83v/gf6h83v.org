I get the same thing. There are several requests I've put out and I get downvoted and no coments on. And heaven forbid you mention a serten Harry potter fic with his last name a tipe of bird.

I asked this same question and I was pretty much told that if they dont like the paring, what your asking for, or age difference you will get downvoted. If you ask for an unliked person there is a higher chance to be downvoted.
