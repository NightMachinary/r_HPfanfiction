Personally, I agree with you - what other people like or dislike has very little impact on what stories I enjoy, just like my preferences don't matter for their fic choices. The general argument I've seen is that those people don't want those things on the sub, so they downvote in the hopes that people will stop requesting or recommending them. The reasons for why they might not want that thing range wildly, depending on the person and the thing in question, so I can't really explain those without making this response obnoxiously long. :D
