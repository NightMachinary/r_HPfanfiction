sorry for the rant, but twice now ive posted for a looking for fic post trying to a specific one. and its gotten downvoted both times. and it dosent affect the people who downvoted ot so why do they feel the need to do so. i got a comment asking if i ever found it and i had to say no because it got downvoted with no comments before that, why does it matter if i want to read a certaint fic with certaint tropes you dont like. or whatever reason your downvoteing, it gives no criticisim, and dosent show why people have an issue with the post for somereason. im sure you would feel a similar frustration if it happend to you. all i wanted to do was find the first hp fic i ever remember reading.
