I had a similar review for a bloodborne xover fic I did awhile ago that I've since taken down due to a rule I have because I always get triggered when I find an abandoned story that i happened to have read 50k+ words in.

Guy really didn't like bloodborne compared to dark souls (guy was looking in the Harry Potter x bloodborne category which was dumb) and gave me a fucking essay on why it's the worst souls game ever made.
