Cauterize, along with Riot and Wonder, are two that I have to read through in their entirety, every single time they are linked here or on the Discords or wherever. They are short, dense works that absolutely wreck me in vastly different ways. Cauterize, in particular, is one of the few fics out there that is so good and so pure that it has graduated to inviolate headcanon.
