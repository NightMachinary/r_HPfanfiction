I would expect her to stay behind the scenes and learn about her new surroundings while remaining a neutral observer in any conflicts. However I figure in each of those universes (particularly GoT and Firefly) eventually one of the factions would violate that neutrality and provoke her into a forceful response.

For example, I can imagine: her being marched into the throne room in King's Lansing whereupon Joffrey demands she swear fealty after watching him torment Sansa; her telling him no; him having the goldcloaks manhandle her; and her briefly losing her shit.
