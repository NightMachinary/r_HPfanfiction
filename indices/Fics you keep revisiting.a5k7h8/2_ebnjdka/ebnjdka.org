I have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9426206/1/One-Step-Left][One Step Left]] saved on my phone. It's a monser, over a 100 chapters, and I absolutely love rereading the carnage in Saint Mungo's and the way Hermione is slowly growing more twisted and dark because she's using the Elder Wand. Although I originally started reading it because of Hermione/Narcissa, their on again off again relationship is kind of off putting (after multiple rereads), even if the reasons are well established for it. I grow more and more fond of Fleur's arc as Fury with every reread. And oh yeah. The whole goblin rebellion thing.
