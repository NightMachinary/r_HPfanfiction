I'll ride or die for a few classics and a few less-knowns:

A lot of Northumbrian's work, all of it book canon, and majority of it is completed; a lot of people like Strangers at Drakeshaugh, but I also like to recommend one of my favorite one-shots that initially got me into fanfiction, The Mind of Arthur Weasley.

You can do the completed books of Alexandra Quick, starting with Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle- there's 4 of them, and there's a fifth in the works and the author is talking about it coming out sometime this year hopefully.

If you like Ron/Hermione, do Australia by MsBinns.

And one of my personal favorites of the last couple years, Order of Mercy by MandyinKC. Story about Percy/Bill/Fleur/Audrey/Oliver and what they are up to during the Second War. It's a really fun one for me (has a tad bit of smut every few chapters but not enough for it to be even the main focus of the fic, which is part of why I like it).

If you like these types of fics, let me know and I can point you towards some of my other favorites, but a lot of them are individual stories or series that are still ongoing. Didn't want to load you up with all those since you didn't request them.
