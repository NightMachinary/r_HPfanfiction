Looked to see if any of these were posted before I commented! Might have missed something though but if someone else also rec'ed a fic, well then, we must like it right?

Here's a few of my favs (that are complete!) (in alphabetical order because that's how ffdotnet had them on my favs page) (there's a few one-shots because they're cute)

- linkffn(5330248) "A Decade and a Half Ago" - one-shot - Harry meets Petunia again like a decade after the Battle of Hogwarts - melancholic, kinda
- linkffn(6950664) "Catching On" - two-shot - Ginny joins the Hollyhead Harpies and has to prove she's Harry's GF - cute
- linkffn(6982780) "Flying By" - one-shot - Harry watches Teddy grow - sweet
- linkffn(7772338) "Gift Of Gratitude" - one-shot - Harry thanks McGonogall for his first broom
- linkffn(3789820) "Guardian" - xover with Stargate - it's odd but good - what would happen if Harry semi-ascended the night Voldy tried to kill him - doesn't follow the plot of HP at all, but well written and enjoyable!
- linkffn(6386016) "Harry Potter and the Gift of Time" - Harry and Ginny go back in time mentally but not physically to the summer just before Harry started Hogwarts - things get derailed ASAP, Harry stops the war
- linkffn(3655940) "Harry Potter: Dark Memories" - I've rec'ed this before - Harry gets all of Voldy's memories and decides he's going to fix things - very good, I re-read this on the regular - written before canon was finished, but still very good!
- linkffn(4380273) "Meadows of Heaven - xover with Narnia - one-shot - Susan Pevensie is Minerva McGongall - go - quite good!
- linkffn(4611923) "No Need to Say Goodbye" - xover with Narnia - one-shot - Sequel to "Meadows of Heaven - Susan/Minerva's story doesn't end until Harry is an old man - mildly tear-inducing
- linkffn(5554780) "Poison Pen" - what if Harry decides to do something about all the "fake news" being published about him in the Prophet, and a few other things (written WELL before "fake news" was a thing, but I think the term fits here)
- linkffn(5678603) "The Fox Who Lived" - xover with YuYu Hakusho - crack, pure crack, hilarious and poinent - Harry /IS/ Yoko Kurama, go - just read it if you're familiar with YYH, it's great - oh slash warning as well!
- linkffn(6413108) "To Shape and Change" - good!Snape goes back in time to guide Harry - Hufflepuff Harry - it's good! odd, but good!

And I think that's all my finished fics that I can think of right now! Lots of my favs have been abandoned over the years, but these at least are done!
