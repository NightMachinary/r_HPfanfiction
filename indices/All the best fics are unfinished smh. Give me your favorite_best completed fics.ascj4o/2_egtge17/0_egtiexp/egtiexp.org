Fair warning the Armistice Series following Changeling is not complete. "pick it up, pick it all up and start again" and "we can still be, who we said we were" are finished, but "in my head we do everything right" is not. It's not abandoned though. Or at least I don't think it is, seeing as it was updated January 3rd of this year.

That said, you really should read this series.
