linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) - The best time travel fic there is, hands down.

linkffn(Dark Marauder) - When James survived Godric's Hollow and Lily didn't, he goes on a rampage.

linkffn(Black Vengeance) - the best post-Azkaban Sirius I've read so far. Has cliches, but is definitely right up there.

linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar; The Changeling; Magicks of the Arcane) - three other reasonably good fics.
