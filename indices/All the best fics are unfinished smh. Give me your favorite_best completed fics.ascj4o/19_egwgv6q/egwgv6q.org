"So if its words that you are looking for McKinnon, I am fluently gifted with the art of speaking. But I'd much rather spend every day showing you exactly how I feel, knowing that you're mine and that we belong together."

Its Marlene's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and she wants nothing more than to pass Transfiguration in which she is hopelessly failing. But her struggle to improve her grades means crossing paths with fellow student Sirius Black, who just so happens to be ridiculously attractive, arrogant, and unfortunately her best bet to acing the class. She doesn't know why Sirius has suddenly taken interest in helping her, but accepting his assistance doesn't come without consequences. Her best friend Lily Evans seems to think that there is something more to the relationship than meets the eye, but Marlene has convinced herself that she does not like Sirius in that way. However, things get a little complicated when her feelings become conflicted, and it doesn't take long for Marlene to begin wondering if Lily was right all along. Finally admitting to herself that her feelings for Sirius are more than just platonic, she must decide which path to choose. Suddenly, she no longer just has Transfiguration to worry about; she must untangle the complications of her love life and finally tell Sirius exactly how she feels.
