These are all wolfstar but I'm pretty sure no one's posted them yet.

linkffn(All the Young Dudes): This is probably the best marauders era wolfstar fic out there. Remus ended up in an orphanage after he became a werewolf and thus is slightly darker. Cannon compliant, read the epilogue.

​

linkffn(The Impossible Season): A seventeen-year-old Sirius appears out of the veil six months after he died. Wolfstar.

​

linkffn(Very Bad Things): Sirius decided to kiss Remus. Marauders era.
