Alright! So I just pulled these the first page of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bcategory_ids%5D%5B%5D=22&work_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=1803&work_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=83023&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Pansy+Parkinson&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][this source]] so you can keep looking if you want.

I haven't read: linkao3(Number my Sins by amaranthiun) linkao3(Nobility by olivieblake) - but I have read some of her other things and she is a FANTASTIC author. linkao3(Soulmates of Prophecy by gryffindortom)

I've started but am not fully caught up with linkao3(Touch by turbulenthandholding).

And I LOVE linkao3(Tangled Sheets by provocative_envy). If you like modern au's, envy is THE place to go for quality Hansy content, to be honest!
