Bad blood? Walburga could have hated him so much at that point that it didn't matter whose side he's on.

Or Walburga could've been almost entirely insane at that point.

Anyway we're not even sure if she actually didn't. It's possible she could've tried but seeing as after the "fall" of Voldie the people are thirsty for Death Eater blood I'm not sure if she would've been able to do anything. Blacks are known as a dark family and if they did anything to help Sirius it would've been seen as further proof of his guilt.
