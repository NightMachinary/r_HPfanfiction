Hearsay being permitted as evidence doesn't mean you can convict someone based solely on hearsay. That would be insane.

IIRC in many jurisdictions, the defendant can be called as a witness. I don't know about the UK but from what I understood from this page [[https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/competence-and-compellability]] the defendant can be called as a witness by the defence, just not by the prosecution (I assume the prosecution will have to rely on the statements given by the defendant to the police?).

Can you please elaborate why it would be a terrible idea to let Sirius testify?
