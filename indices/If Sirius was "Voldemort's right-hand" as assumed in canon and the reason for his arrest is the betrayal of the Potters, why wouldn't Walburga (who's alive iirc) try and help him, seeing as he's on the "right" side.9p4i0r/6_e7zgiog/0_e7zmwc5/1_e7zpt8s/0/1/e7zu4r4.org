The defendant can be called as a witness in the UK as well, yes, if they choose to waive their immunity from being called. But the very first thing they teach you in law school is to never, *ever* let your client do this. You don't allow it for the same reason you don't let your client speak with the police without legal representation present, and generally will only ever give a "no comment" interview. The Defendant's words can always be twisted against them, especially when under heavy cross-examination by a skilled advocate. Any criminal barrister worth their salt will be able to obtain a conviction against an innocent defendant who decides to take the stand.
