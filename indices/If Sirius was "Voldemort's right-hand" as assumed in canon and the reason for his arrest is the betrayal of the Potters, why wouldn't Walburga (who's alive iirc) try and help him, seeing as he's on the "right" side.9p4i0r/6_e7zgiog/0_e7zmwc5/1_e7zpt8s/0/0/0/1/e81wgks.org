It would seem to be the only logical reason it's not used more often, there being an undetectable antidote to veritaserum, but it's just fanon.

Canonically, Snape mentions that just three drops (the dose for average people), would be enough for “even the Dark Lord to spill his secrets.” Presumably if anyone would have the method for avoiding it, be it antidotes or occlumency, it would be Voldemort, but Snape seems fairly confident that it wouldn't matter.
