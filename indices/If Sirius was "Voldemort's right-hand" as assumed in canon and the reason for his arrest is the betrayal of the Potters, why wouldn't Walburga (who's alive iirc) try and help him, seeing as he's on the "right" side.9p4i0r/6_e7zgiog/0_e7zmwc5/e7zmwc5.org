  We know that evidence was heard, because Dumbledore says he gave evidence against Sirius.

Kinda hammers home how awful their justice system is, since the only evidence Dumbledore could have presented is hearsay. Yet I'm sure it was super important, because it's Dumbledore! They have an actual witness of the events in custody and instead ask an old man with a beard what he thinks might have happened.

  We must also remember that Sirius had confessed to the crime, and was continuing to confess at this point.

What do you mean continuing to confess?

Oh and as someone else pointed out: Sirius was send to Azkaban for killing 12 muggles and Pettigrew. He was perfectly sane at this point and certainly not confessing this if someone had bothered to ask.
