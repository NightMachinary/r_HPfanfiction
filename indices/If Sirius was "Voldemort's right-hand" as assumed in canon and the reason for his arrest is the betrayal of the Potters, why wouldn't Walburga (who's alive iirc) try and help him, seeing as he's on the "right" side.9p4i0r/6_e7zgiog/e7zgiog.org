There's a common fanon view that Sirius' imprisonment was in some sense legally irregular. There is no support for this. Bellatrix, Crouch Jr, Rodolfus and Rabastan didn't get to attend any kind of hearing either, as we saw in GOF -- the Council of Magical Law heard evidence in their absence, and then they were brought in only to see the vote of the jury and receive their sentence. We know this is standard because the same occurs with Bagman: when he comes into the court room it's explicitly stated that this is the first time he is brought before the court, and all the evidence has already been heard. He's just there to a) speak very briefly in his defence and b) witness the vote of the jury.

This is not so different to what occurred with Sirius. We know that evidence was heard, because Dumbledore says he gave evidence against Sirius. Following evidence given in Sirius' absence, he was then sentenced to Azkaban. The only difference with Sirus is that, unlike the others, he didn't get to attend the vote against him. We must also remember that Sirius had confessed to the crime, and was continuing to confess at this point. So perhaps it was considered unnecessary for him to make representations when he had already told everyone that he did it.

Of course, we know from OotP that the defendant /does/ get to make representations and bring evidence in a Wizengamot trial. I assume that the Council of Magical Law was an expedited process for Death Eaters, created during the war along with Crouch Sr's other authoritarian measures like authorising Aurors to use the Unforgiveables.
