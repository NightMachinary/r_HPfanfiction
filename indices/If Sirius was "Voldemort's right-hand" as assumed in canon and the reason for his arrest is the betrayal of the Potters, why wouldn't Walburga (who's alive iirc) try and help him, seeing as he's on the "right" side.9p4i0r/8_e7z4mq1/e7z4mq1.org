A different perspective: Walburga's allegiance in the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort war was never explicitly stated. We knew she was pro-dark magic and pro-blood purity. We don't know if she would follow Voldemort. Sure, Voldemort was going around killing muggles and muggleborns and Walburga probably would have supported that, but we were never told explicitly. After reading Wind Shear, I started thinking some "Dark" characters might not follow the Dark Lord. If she wasn't on the Dark Lord's side, for some unknown reason, then Sirius never really joined the "right" side to her.
