That's a pretty common thought. I've often pointed out that Lucius Malfoy in particular should have very little reason to want Voldemort back. Lucius is rich, famous and powerful, if he plays his cards right he can be Minister for Magic himself or overthrow the government.

He has no where to go but down under rule of Lord Voldemort.
