Doesn't Sirius explain something about his parents being like lots of people who thought Voldemort had â€˜the right idea' at first, and were proud of Regulus joining the Death Eaters, until the reality of what Voldemort was really doing became obvious? That they were racist, but they didn't actually advocate genocide, basically?

She wouldn't be proud of Sirius, in that case.
