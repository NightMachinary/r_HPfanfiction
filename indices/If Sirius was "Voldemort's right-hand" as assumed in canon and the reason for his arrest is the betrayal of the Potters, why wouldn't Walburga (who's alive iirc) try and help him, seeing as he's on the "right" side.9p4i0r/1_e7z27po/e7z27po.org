I'm not sure about Walburga, but I think I should point out that the reason for Sirius's arrest wasn't the betrayal of the Potters. It was the murder of Peter Pettigrew and the twelve muggles.

True, several Death Eaters were arrested for treason and espionage-related crimes, including Augustus Rookwood, but Sirius Black was sent to Azkaban for murder.

Such a crime would likely be harder to defend and rally a defense for--and even if a defense could be mounted, Walburga may well see Sirius as a martyr for the cause of blood purity. And what good is a martyr who is freed from his suffering?
