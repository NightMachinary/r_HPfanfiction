1. Walburga is a portrait in 12 Grimmauld Place, so she's not technically alive.

2. As a kid, Sirius was everything she /didn't/ stand for - Gryffindor, Light, not Muggleborn-hating, etc.

3. After Sirius is presumed dead, who would go and visit Walburga's portrait to keep her informed? The only living thing in that house was Kreacher, who was loyal to Regulus, the "good" son. There was no one to tell Walburga what the modern world thought of her firstborn.
