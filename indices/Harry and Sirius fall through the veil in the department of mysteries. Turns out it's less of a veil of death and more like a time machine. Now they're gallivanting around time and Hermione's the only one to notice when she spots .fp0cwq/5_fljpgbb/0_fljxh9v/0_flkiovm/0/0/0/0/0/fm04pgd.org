Putting your money (ie. galleons) where your mouth is is an idiom that basically means to do what you say (usually what you've been boasting) you're going to do. It's like telling those people who complain about something to go out and change it. If they do so, they're putting their money where their mouth is, ie. to allocate their resources to the same place their words are going.

And I have read that one - it's brilliant. Loved the sibling dynamic and the mild sideplot with Daphne Greengrass. Great fun.
