Shit, my bad. I'm not often on reddit and rarely ever look at my messages since a while back I subbed to a quite prolific author on the HFY subreddit.

In case you haven't already looked the three stories up, here you go.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13256035/30/Right-Side-of-Hell]] (This is actually quite good and has been updated in the past 4 months.)

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9332216/1/Sixteen-Years]] (Haven't started reading it yet because the reason in my previous message.)

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11352516/1/Sorry-About-That-Harry]] (Going to be honest, I've read this one now and it's... ehh. The author is still active and writes other fanfics, and I haven't gotten to check those out yet, but this one is not up my alley. It's not slash at least, but it just feels gimicky and that it was written to be out there. Also, it has a sequel, which looks abandoned.)

​

Also, completely off-topic, but shit, someone actually found the story! Awesome.
