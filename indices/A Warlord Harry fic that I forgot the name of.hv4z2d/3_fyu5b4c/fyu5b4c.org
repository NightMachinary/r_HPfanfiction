Gonna be honest. I spent the past 30 minutes trying to search for you, since I've never heard of a story like it. More often than not it's sent to Azkaban, not to hell. Sadly, while I found like 3 near fics to read at some point in the future, I had no such luck finding anything remotely to the one you're asking for. Sorry.

​

In case you're wondering, the three fics are: Right Side of Hell by NeoMare, Sixteen Years by Council (Which seems like it's one of those once in a blue moon I'll update or abandoned, since while the author seems active, the story hasn't been updated in 4 years.), and Sorry About That Harry by Nigelcat1. (Which is a 91k word story that is a single chapter... apparently complete. Wtf author. Still going to read it probably.)

​

If you do end up finding the story you're looking for, mind messaging me the name? Also, where you read it might help out a bit for people searching. I mainly traversed FF.
