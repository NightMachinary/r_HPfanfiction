I haven't been able to find it, but I definitely recognize it.

Here's some things I remember. Hopefully, someone will recognize enough to find it.

- First thing Harry does after being brought back from hell is summon his lieutenant who is a succubus.
- Hermione is in a coma, the succubus heals her, we later find out Ron caused it.
- Harry rescues some girls from a death eater 'entertainment' house, Luna is one of them, she's gone somewhat crazy.
