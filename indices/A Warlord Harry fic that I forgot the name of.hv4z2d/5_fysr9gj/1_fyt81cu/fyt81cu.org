I never read it, never heard of it, sure I could look for a few hours and maybe find it but the odds are slim. I've been there and done that. It's exhausting and discouraging. Doesn't help that I don't even know what site it's on. Fanfiction? Likely but I have /no/ idea how to work Fanfiction. AO3? Less likely though I am more familiar. I hope someone has read this and remembers and links it. That's why I set a reminder like many others - in the hopes that someone researchers for a few hours and finds it or that someone has read it recently and links it. I don't mean any disrespect to the OP. I just wanna read it like others. I hope it's found.
