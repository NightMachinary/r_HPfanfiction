I doubt either of these are it, the details are probably too different to get mixed up, but here are the closest fics I've seen.

Linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens by littlewhitecat) - Harry somehow gets teleported 38,000 years into the future. Warhammer 40k. He becomes a sort of psyker Space Marine Inquisitor. By the time he returns it has been perhaps a year or two for Hogwarts, but something like 300 years for Harry.

Linkffn(Harry Potter the Undead Slayer by Scott the Wanderer) - Harry ends up in some alternate setting where he's raised to be some kind of monster slayer. He gets summoned back by the Goblet of Fire along with a vampire that he was in the middle of fighting. Pretty sure he's covered in magical tattoos. It hasn't been /that/ long for him, but IIRC he is a full grown adult instead of being 14 like he should've been.
