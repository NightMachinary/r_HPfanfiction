While I like this idea, the problem is that the course would be called Numerology, not Arithmancy. I've yet to find any reference to arithmancy outside of Harry Potter that does not refer to the fact that it is a /branch/ or /instantiation/ of numerology, not a synonym for it. Generally I'm inclined to consider this an example of laziness of Mrs. Rowling's part, since I can't think why a form of divination would be required for Curse-Breakers though.

Yes, this comment contradicts itself. So do the books in this instance ;-)
