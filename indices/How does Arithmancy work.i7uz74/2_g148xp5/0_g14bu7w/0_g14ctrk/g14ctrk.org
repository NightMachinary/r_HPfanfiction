  since I can't think why a form of divination would be required for Curse-Breakers though.

Imagine, if you will, that you are on the bomb squad. You're sitting in front of a bomb that's going to go off in an hour and you need to disarm it. You open the control panel... there's a blue wire and a red wire.

So you pull out your abacus of divination, do some quick maths, and lookit that: you have a /very/ short future if you cut the red wire.

Snippy snippy goes the blue and a hero is you.

Divination is probably one of the most important parts of a curse breaking job! Don't step there, step there instead. This won't set off a trap, this will.
