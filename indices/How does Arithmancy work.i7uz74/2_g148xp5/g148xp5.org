I always liked the thought of it being a bit like the math of magic, like how physics can be poorly described as the math of the physical world.

Think of it like engineering. You don't need much math beyond "is this piece long enough?" to 'engineer' a table out of wood. However, if you actually know the properties of the materials and expected use case, you can make a table out of a lot less material that's as strong, if not stronger, than the crude table you slapped together.

So "anyone" can make and modify spells, but arithmancy is how you do it /properly/ to be safer and have more predictable results, as well as reducing the amount of effort it takes to cast the final result.
