My fanon it is the applied version of quantum probability and other quantum mathematics.

Instead of having basic understanding of that [[https://youtu.be/rYLzxcU6ROM][photons do whatever the fuck they want as light is super weird on a quantum level.]]

They instead have used the ability to /wield/ magic to stumble into a backdoor on applied quantum mathematics.

Which is what I think of magic as. Sure it might be alive, to varying degrees depending on the HP world, but it is still a force of the universe.

All forces can be made sense of through math, if they don't, we are doing the math wrong.

So magic acts like a quantum force of probability, literally nothing is impossible. It is just so small it is considered a "non-zero" number.

Right now you, the reader of this comment, have a "non-zero" chance of randomly turning into a gigantic magical world devouring space dragon. Perhaps instead you somehow get the ability to make purple farts at will, there is a "non-zero" chance of it happening.

Normally we would just say, yeah nope, that's impossible. For the most part you're right, but on a quantum level you are wrong.

So magic, or at least the ability to /wield/ magic, let's you totally say fuck you to reality and crank that "non-zero" probability up to a "yeah, that just happened" level.

So arthimancy is the math of determining those mathematics, of refining not magic itself, but the witch or wizards ability to /wield/ magic.

At least that's my theory on it.
