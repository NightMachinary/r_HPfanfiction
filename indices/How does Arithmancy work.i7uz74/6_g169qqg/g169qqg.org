Historically speaking Arithmancy has been always used as a mere divination system, akin to Astrology, Rune reading, etc, I prefer the approach many OPs take however, on the subject, Arithmancy not only as a divination system but also as a complex form of ritual Magic based on mathematics and geometry.
