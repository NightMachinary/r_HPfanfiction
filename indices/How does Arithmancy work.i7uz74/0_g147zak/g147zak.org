I mean, gay Dumbledore and black Hermione are objectionable because she said so on Twitter ten years on and tried to get brownie points without having gone through the trouble of actually including such representation in the actual books. But I don't think they're inherently bad/trollish ideas. A queer Dumbledore certainly makes the whole Grindelwald thing more interesting and resonant, and more tragic --- though having it as the only major queer relationship in the Potterverse is in itself a problem, of course.

Also, dammit, I /like/ Ancient Runes as the language in which grimoires are written, rather than an enchanting class. Magically-charged Runes are a fine thing to build a magic system on, but the /HP/ magic system isn't /like/ that, and that's okay.

...But in any event: the iconic fanon take on Arithmancy is that it's the scientific part of spellcrafting, analyzing the actual physical force of "magic" as equations and vectors and spellfire-patterns. Through Arithmancy you'll calculate the optimal widtha and shape of of wand motions, the length and cadence needed for the incantation, etc. --- and /then/ you build upon that framework by adding a bit of human intent to the casting, and matching words that have a bit of meaning to the abstract cadence. Note that the latter idea helps make sense of the "bad Latin" of a lot of spell names: the reason it's "Wingardium LeviOsA", which not only isn't proper Latin, but isn't /pronounced/ with a proper Latin accent either, is that the Arithmancy calls for an incantation that goes "o-A-o o-O-A", and whoever invented the charm scrambled to find words in any language that would fit that pattern while having a meaning that more or less corresponded to what the spell was supposed to do.

A completely unrelated idea, to hew closer to what we are told in canon (namely that it's math-based Divination), is that Arithmancy is in fact... maths. It's /nominally/ maths that you can use to predict the future via numerology, but that's as much bogus as any other kind of Divination that isn't Prophecy, and everyone at Hogwarts knows it: introducing Arithmancy classes was a way for Dumbledore to sneak a non-magical scientific education past the Ministry overseers, and nothing more. The reason Hermione likes it even though she hates Divination is that she's in on the joke.
