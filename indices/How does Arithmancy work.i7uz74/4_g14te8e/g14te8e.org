Necromancy is death magic.\\
Arithmancy is number magic.

The arithmancy class is a secondary math class, in which the math subjects get beyond what is easy/fast to do on parchment. Spells are used to solve difficult expressions, similar to how we use calculators/computers.

Applications of mathematics in magic are incompletely addressed up to Owl levels. One can use arithmancy to perform complex mathematical tasks, such as exponentiation and graphing, These skills will be foundational to successful account and business management, or for understanding what accomplished arithmancers are saying.

For Newt studies, the underpinnings of math in magic is studied, and students learn about high level math in spellcrafting (and enchanting, and potion brewing).
