I enjoyed the "Where in the World is Harry Potter?" series by nonjon linkffn(2354771). My favorite of the series is the 3rd one, but you can't skip to it.

The ones from the top of DariusA92's list are great though, I only mention this because it wasn't on the list. Seventh Horcrux and A Black Comedy are some of my favorites, and Oh God Not Again! is good as well.
