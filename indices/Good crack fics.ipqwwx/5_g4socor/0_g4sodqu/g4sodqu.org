  It seems like fanfics have had baby Harry raised by every character in fiction except for one: Godzilla, King of the Monsters! Watch as I descend into madness trying to take this story semi-seriously, by which I mean that it will have a plot that tries to make it work logically.For G-fans, this takes place in the Sh≈çwa continuity (for non G-fans, that means the goofy 60s and 70s Godzilla). For fans of both, or just Harry Potter, sit back and enjoy the lunacy!
