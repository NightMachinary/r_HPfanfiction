Women never seem to really get their head around the motivations and reasoning that goes into a gentlemanly bout of fisticuffs. They also never get the 'head-nod' and all the other non-verbal communication men often use quite right.

Also, the complete lack of dick and fart jokes. Fred and George Weasley appear in 7 books and over a thousand fan-fics as the absolute gold-standard of teenage guy humor and through it all never once even on accident fart in someone's face or make a dick joke. Rowling came closest to capturing this with Ron's Uranus joke in POA but the ubiquitous toilet humor that comes with that age is largely absent with female writers.

It really stands out in Marauder fics. Four guys running together like that set in a time and place where "boys will be boys" was still in effect would be a non-stop dude-bro-dude contest and jackals like Sirius Black are nearly impossible to pull off convincingly unless you had a brother like that.
