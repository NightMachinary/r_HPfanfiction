  the complete lack of dick and fart jokes. Fred and George Weasley appear in 7 books and over a thousand fan-fics as the absolute gold-standard of teenage guy humor and through it all never once even on accident fart in someone's face

Somehow I don't really feel as if I've missed out on much by not experiencing a constant hot air bag of fart jokes. A certain amount of toilet humor is funny, but too much and I can feel my brain cells dying. Besides, I prefer it if a writer captures the anarchic spirit of the Marauders in other ways.
