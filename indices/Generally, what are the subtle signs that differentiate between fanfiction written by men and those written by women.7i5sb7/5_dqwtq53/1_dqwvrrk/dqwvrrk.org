Or even just when a character sighs dramatically and says "Boys", because it really is the equivalent of a dramatically sighed "Women" a la Shikamaru. Both are stupid and kind of sexist, and are used to dismiss the person being referred to as stupid and impulsive (usually for men) or dumb and emotional (usually for women). I guess it's supposed to be funny and relatable? I don't know. I hate it. It's not an instant turnoff for me, though, as long as the rest of the fic is good and it's not used more than once or twice.
