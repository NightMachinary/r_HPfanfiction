I'm not sure but anytime I read the line "you /are/ 'just a man/boy'" when in the context of understanding something within a relationship or having to do with /any/ kind of emotion is written by a female, unless its just a man who's heard it said so many times that it /must/ be true. Usually an instant turnoff for a fic.
