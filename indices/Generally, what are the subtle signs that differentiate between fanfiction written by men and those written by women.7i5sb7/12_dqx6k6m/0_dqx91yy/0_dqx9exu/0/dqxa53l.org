I can see if like every character is needlessly sexualized making that assumption. What if men are described in a sexualized fashion?

I'm curious about this passage:

#+begin_quote
  She gets up to excuse herself to the Ladies' at one point and I get a good look at the dress that seems to float just above her knees, leaving those amazing calves bare, the high heels she has on making it look like she has legs for days. The pale champagne color and sparkling sequins highlight every dip and curve of her fit body and I have to stuff down the impulse to follow her.

Does it strike you as male or female writer? What about it gives it away?
