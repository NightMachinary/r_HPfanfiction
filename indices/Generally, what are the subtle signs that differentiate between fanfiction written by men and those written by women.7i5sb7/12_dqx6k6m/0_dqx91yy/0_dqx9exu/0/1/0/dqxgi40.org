Interesting because I, also a female, wrote it from Harry's first-person perspective. :D linkao3(7240150)

Question--does knowing that a female wrote that passage color your perception of it? I find the whole thing regarding male vs female voice/writing styles to be very interesting. I think that there is a definite sort of slant to how male authors vs female authors present things, but it just goes to show that one can't always tell. There is definitely a long history of women writing under male names such as George Sand and Andre Norton to overcome publisher/reader bias.
