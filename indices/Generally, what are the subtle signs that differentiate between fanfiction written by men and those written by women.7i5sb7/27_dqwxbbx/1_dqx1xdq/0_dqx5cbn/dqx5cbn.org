Just seems like an unnecessary descriptor. It's like describing the color of the sky, except you're not illustrating any difference from what the reader would perceive it as, if you hadn't said anything. It's not a red sky, or a purple and pink sky, it's just... normal. Average. Situation normal. It's a waste of time to describe it in any sense other than to distinguish a change.
