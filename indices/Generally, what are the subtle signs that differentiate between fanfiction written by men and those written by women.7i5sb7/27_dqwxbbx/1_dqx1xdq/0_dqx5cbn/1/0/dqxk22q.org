  So are you also against the word heterosexual, for the same reason?

In the context of a conversation that includes a persons sexual preferences I don't care, this conversation does so it's fine. The problem I have is that people (like yourself) use these labels to group up "others" and slap some weird preconceived social rules to them. Such as being "weirdly" obsessed with breasts. Who gives a shit if a guy, or even all guys, love(s) breasts? Get over it, you sound like such a pompous ass lol. I knew a girl once who loved being peed on. She was obsessed with it, wanted it every day. That's objectively much weirder than this, but would I ever shame her for it? Absolutely not.

This is just like when people shit on other people for not liking the same foods as them. I don't like sushi and I've had people give me disgusted looks for saying that before. Like come on, grow up.

  I do notice it's really just straight cis men who are weirdly obsessed over them.

I honestly have yet to find anything like this in a fanfiction unless it's making fun of Ron being obsessed with boobs. Never have I seen any of this from a main characters perspective.
