So are you also against the word heterosexual, for the same reason?

And in context there was a clear reason for the descriptor of cisgender...transgender men don't tend to fetishize breasts so heavily to the point of obsessing over them. Just as lesbians and bisexuals tend not to. For the most part, it IS just straight cisgender men who are that obsessed with breasts to the point of going on and on about them unnecessarily in fiction, at least in my experience. Like, there's a difference between just liking breasts and finding them attractive and absolutely obsessing over them, and I do notice it's really just straight cis men who are weirdly obsessed over them.
