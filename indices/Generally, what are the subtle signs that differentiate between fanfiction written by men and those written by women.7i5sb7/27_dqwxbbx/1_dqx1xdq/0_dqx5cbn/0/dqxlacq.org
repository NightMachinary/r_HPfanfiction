Actually, one reason the word 'cisgender' was coined was because of the embedded biases in the assumption of "normal." If there's no word to specify "gender assignment that matches biological sex," the implication is that it's the assumed state, and deviance from it is always noted. If you're not "normal," many cultural attitudes imply there's something wrong with you. At least in the US, where I live, "normal" isn't value-neutral. It's considered baseline superior, a majority membership that can be used as a club to beat "not-normals" with. By recognizing that cisgender exists and giving it a term to distinguish it from other genders, it re-positions it as one gender identity among several, by far the largest, but not therefore entitled to value itself above all others.

It can sound preachy, and it's sometimes irritating because fandom is nothing if not loud and proud about its internet activism, but it's actually a useful term. Like various language shifts over the years, it might help influence acceptance of other people's legitimate experience while calling things like "normal" into question.

Being at home with your gender and your body is really not comparable to saying the sky is blue.
