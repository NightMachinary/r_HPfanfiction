Oh, that I can agree with. I back-click right out of fics that use recent terminology devised for political or psychological purposes. That's not who these characters are. That's not how they think of themselves. It completely throws me out of the story. To be clear, I can imagine someone writing a good fic exploring gender confusion, but it would still have to be in the character's voices. The moment the fic starts throwing around words like 'cisgender' or 'demisexual,' the writer's agenda intrudes and the fic is ruined. I'm not here for issue fic - I'm here for id fic, the tropes and characters that push my buttons, and the writers who can make me care or surprise me with good world-building. I'm also here for the porn, but even there, the same priorities apply.
