I feel like you've missed my point. The word has a purpose. That purpose is not to be used in descriptions of characters. Cisgender /is/ baseline, and it /will/ be the assumed state. That's what makes its use as a descriptor pointless, unless you're using it to distinguish from transgender people. But if you're describing say, Harry, and you go through the whole, "black hair, green eyes, scrawny, glasses, lightning bolt scar," and then you stick in a, "cisgender," all I can think is, "Why?" Cisgender is the baseline, there's no reason to mention it in that scenario (hell, there's not really any reason to describe him at all, we're all pretty well acquainted with his baseline appearance, but it's a common thing), because that's what everyone is going to assume. It's just a waste of time for everyone involved.
