Mm-hmm. That's a lot of hostility over a term you're not even required to use. So nobody can say you're cisgendered (which isn't an insult, btw - it simply means your body and your sense of gender match), while /you/ can not only tell people they're weird, you can define what society means by "weird." And that it's a "victim's" own fault if their life sucks, because you know this, how?

I don't know what world you live in, but it's not the one I grew up in.

To bring things back around to fanfiction, I /will/ agree that I'm personally not interested in seeing the terminology imported into stories. I prefer to see difficulties and sexual confusion and transformation dramatized, and in HP I want it to be British and magical and conveyed through a character's POV.
