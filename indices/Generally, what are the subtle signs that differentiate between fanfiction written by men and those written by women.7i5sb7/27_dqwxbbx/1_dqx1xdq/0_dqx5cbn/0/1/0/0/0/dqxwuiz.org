Well, I can't say it's been a pleasure, mate, but I worked 12 hours today and I'd rather go do something I enjoy than answer your comment point by point. I will tell you something I suspect you already know, that young uni students (if we're going to lump people together) are always obsessing about the latest theory or cause or future as a way of defining themselves and test-driving their world views. Sure, it can be maddening. Sure, some of it is bullshit. Yes, most of their passion achieves fuck-all in the world because they're talking rather than doing. And yes, there /are/ a bunch of special snowflakes running around, and I thank fuck I'm not a college professor. Believe me, there are a plenty of people out there who would agree with everything you say and go even farther with accusations of abnormality and false victimhood. But whether you like them or not, concepts like cisgender are still useful tools. I won't bother talking about why, because apparently the language created to discuss sociological changes and sexual differences gets your back up.

  I have a gay best friend. He's a very masculine dude, you'd probably never be able to tell.

Um, I spent 25 years in gay San Francisco. Masculinity was all the rage. The lack of masculinity isn't how you identify whether or not a guy is gay. Pretty sure your friend would fit right into the bar scene.

Ah, the "you people" put-down. I'm not a social justice warrior. Social justice, hell yeah. But the fans who perform social justice as a way of winning ship wars are toxic, and they distort the very idea of what activism means. They're also weirdly puritanical, and their version of fandom is about the most destructive and unfun way to practice a hobby I've ever seen.

In any case, I'm off to write about Snape now. That generally puts me in a good mood. Cheers.
