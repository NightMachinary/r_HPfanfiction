I'm an aggressive guy, can't help it. I'm fully aware cis isn't inherently an insult, it's just a pointless word at best and it frequently is used to speak about a group of other people in derogatory terms.

Your argument is literally "well trans people felt sad that they have a word about them that identifies them as abnormal (which they are), so there should be a word to identify straight people so they don't feel as bad??? How is that not absolute nonsense?

  And that it's a "victim's" own fault if their life sucks, because you know this, how?

Mate, I'm in a university. I see this all the time. People that blame all their shortcomings on everything but themselves. Obviously there are plenty of people with really shitty lives. I had an awful childhood, it took me until I was like 21 to get on my feet and get going, but then I have these young kids in my sociology class telling me I'm privileged by virtue of my sexuality and skin color. They talk a lot like you.

I grew up in Idaho, and I have a gay best friend. He's a very masculine dude, you'd probably never be able to tell. He can't stand a lot of gay guys or SJW culture because it's so frustrating to even have a conversation with any of you. It's only black and white, right or wrong, cis/het or trans/gay. If you disagree you're an asshole at best or hitler at worse, but if you agree you're an "ally".
