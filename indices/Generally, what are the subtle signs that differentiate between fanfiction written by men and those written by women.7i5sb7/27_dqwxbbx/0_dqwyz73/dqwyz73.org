I really dislike the passive-aggressive tone here. It sounds like you are implying that het stories are written purely by heterosexual men who see every fic as written porn. And that slash is the only viable way to go. Which is even more disturbing when you consider that Harry Potter slash almost exclusively features the scum of magical Britain (Death Eaters) as the romantic interest.

The late Broomstick Flyer wrote almost exclusively Harry/Hermione and she was a woman, just to give you one example of women writing heterosexual relationships involving Hermione.
