The same as with any fiction - completely different handling of characters' emotions.

Additionally men are more likely to focus on character overcoming their problems, whereas women write more about effect of the problems on protagonist.

And of course pairings. If it's slash it's almost certainly written by a woman unless it's Dumbledore/Grindelwald. If protagonist has a harem, a fairly safe bet that writer is of the same gender. Draco/Anybody and Snape/Anybody are usually also written by females, whereas when Harry is paired with non-OC Slytherin girl or Fleur (unless it's fem-Harry).
