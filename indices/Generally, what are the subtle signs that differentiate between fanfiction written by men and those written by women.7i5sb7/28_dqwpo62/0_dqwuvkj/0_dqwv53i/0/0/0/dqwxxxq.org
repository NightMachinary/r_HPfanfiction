Sorry, what?

Yeah, a fight scene is a narrative choice, and I completely agree they're hard to do well. POV is tricky, sentence structure is important, pacing, knowledge of weapons if you're using weaponry, ability to keep it in character, etc. And I disagree that 'little' is boring - it depends on the intent. Spare writing can be a gut punch. Overdone fight scenes = skip that sucker, who the fuck cares after the fifth jaw punch or dismembering spell? Unless the writer is really good and focused and doing more than just listing mayhem. And yes, fade to black is as frustrating in conflict as it is in sex scenes. If you give us the build-up, don't cheat on the payoff.
