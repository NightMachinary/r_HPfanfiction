You're taking far too hardline a view on this.

A fight scene is merely a literary tool, and a well done one can really make a story stand out. Fight scenes often require a different 'basic approach' to writing, mechanics-wise, that can really highlight an author's talent.

Little is more boring than overdone/excessive/needless fight scenes, however. And it's just as bad when an author writes a long conflict but doesn't have the writing chops to cap it off with an appropriate fight scene.
