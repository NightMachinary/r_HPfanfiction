I don't read fanfic for battle scenes, so I'm not the target audience anyway and I tend to get impatient with lovingly detailed slaughter. In my (limited) HP circles, it's true that most of the women I know don't create plotlines that require major battle descriptions or fights.

In published fiction, I suppose it depends on whether you're looking for something like Monster Hunter or something like the WWI Regeneration trilogy. Very different approaches to "fight scenes."
