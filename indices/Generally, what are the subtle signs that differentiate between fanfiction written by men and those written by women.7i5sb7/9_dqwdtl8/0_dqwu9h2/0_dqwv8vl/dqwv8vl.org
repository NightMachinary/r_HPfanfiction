Oh man, you triggered me by referring to it as True Blood. And, I disagree that you can't compare them. They have so many similar elements that you can't help /but/ compare them. But, that kind of ties back into the topic at hand, and that if SVM was written by Jim Butcher, the focus on romance would be far less prominent and instead every woman in the story would be supernaturally beautiful almost without exception.
