True. I guess the eye-rolling got ingrained in me in the first few books before this really gets explained :p plus there really is only so much SoD can do. I can believe he meets faeries, I just can't believe he hasn't met a single woman with any significant flaw (aside from some vampires being hella gross under the facade).

That being said, it's been a few years since I read them (just started re-reading them this week, actually!)
