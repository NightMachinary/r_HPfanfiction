That always weirded me out about the Dresden Files (although I do enjoy them otherwise). EVERY woman is just drop dead gorgeous. There's no random average-to-ugly but still plot relevant ladies. (Unless you count Sue, but she is a tyrannosaurus, and I'm sure she's beautiful for a tyrannosaurus).

Also most of them are either attracted to Dresden, evil, or both. Very clearly a male writer.
