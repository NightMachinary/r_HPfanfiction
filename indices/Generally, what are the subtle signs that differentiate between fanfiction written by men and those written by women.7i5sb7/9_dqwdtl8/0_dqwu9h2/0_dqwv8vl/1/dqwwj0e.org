Yeah, but Butcher wouldn't be writing paranormal romance anyway. It's a genre thing, one I'm not fond of so I can't really go into detail, since the formula aspect absolutely kills any interest I might have in them. Not just because it's romance, but because I'm bored to tears by vampires, werewolves, alphas, packs, "tramp stamps," inherited specialness, and so on. But if Butcher /did/ sign on for a paranormal romance series (my brain breaks a little at the thought), I agree, it wouldn't look anything like the predominant tropes.
