You mean True Blood? Those are set squarely in the formula of urban fantasy/paranormal romance. The Dresden Files are fantasy thrillers. Two different genres, codified by publishers. You can't really compare them. I'm sure there are female authors of urban fantasy who'd prefer to concentrate on adventure (Charlaine Harris isn't one of them), but the pressure is on to include romance if they use a female protagonist, because it sells.
