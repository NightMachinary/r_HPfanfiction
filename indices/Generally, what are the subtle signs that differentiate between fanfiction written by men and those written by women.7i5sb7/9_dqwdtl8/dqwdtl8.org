I can't quite place my finger on why, but it's usually pretty easy to tell. Like, take the Southern Vampire Mysteries vs the Dresden Files. They're similar stories set in a similar urban fantasy universe, but you can easily tell that one was written by a woman and the other a man. Maybe it's just easy to tell what kind of demographic they were writing for via love interests and the kind of descriptions used and the focus of the story, or maybe it's as simple as the MC being a girl vs guy.
