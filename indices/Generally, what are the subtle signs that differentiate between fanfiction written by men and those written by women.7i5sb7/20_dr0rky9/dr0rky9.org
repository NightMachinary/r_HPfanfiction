A lot of females tend to think of colors in shades when describing something. Something isn't just red, it's burgandy. It's not green, it's emerald green.

Other than that, I feel that men tend to write Harry much more assertive compared to female authors (when they do, it tends to go more towards aggressive). The reverse is also true except men I feel tend to either make someone with tomboyish or girly without any inbetween. I think that this is because of confidence and relatability. Men understand Harry because he is male, so it's easier to make him assertive; women on the other hand don't feel as confident about the male mind and so either make him more passive - generally needing advice or seeking advice for choices - or aggressive - veering the other way.

Female writers also tend to not have Harry have a straight male friendship scene. Usually it's either talk about plot or heavily influenced by stereotypes. Otherwise you tend to get male/female friendship scenes or male/male/female friendship scenes. Neville also tends to be a stand in for a female if a male only scene is meant to happen due to being sensative, shy, and kind.

Females tend to write Hermione better than she is, and usually has the narrative be on her side when she does something wrong. Likewise, Ron usually ends up in the wrong. For instance, you are more likely to see Harry being "lazy" when learning because of Ron.

Petunia tends to be forgiven or redeemed more often by female authors. Vernon usually ends up as abusive towards her to explain it. Men tend to hate both Dursleys.
