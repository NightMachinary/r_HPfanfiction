Coarse banter between male friends usually indicates a male author, I'd say.

When I see one-sided platonic relationships between members of opposite sex I assume it's written by a woman. I mean the sort where the guy lends the girl a shoulder to cry on after she was dumped by her boyfriend, is always supportive, and never shows the slightest bit of interest despite him being straight and her being attractive.
