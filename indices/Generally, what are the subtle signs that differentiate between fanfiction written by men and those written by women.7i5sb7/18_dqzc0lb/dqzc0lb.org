Stories where the female characters are invariably passive, helpless, dependent and/or /nearly/ competent but not quite, and with different hair colors and body types rather than actual characterization to tell them apart, are generally I assume written by guys.

Safe to say I tend to click out of those stories.

Another tell is stories where weird stuff like incest or a character being attracted to a mother /and/ a daughter etc. are immediately on the table; those tend to strike me as being written by a guy who's seen a little too much porn.
