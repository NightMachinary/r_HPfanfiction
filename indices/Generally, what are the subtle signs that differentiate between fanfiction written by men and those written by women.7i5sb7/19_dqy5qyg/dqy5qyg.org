Sometimes I think it's all in what they focus on. If there's a detailed, blow-by-blow fight scene or play-by-play quidditch match, I tend to think the author is male. In contrast, if there's a lot of internal contemplation and deep conversations about the status of a relationship and where it's going, I tend to assume that author is female.

And I don't mean that women don't write fight scenes or men don't write romance, just that the scenes dealing with those things tend to be less detailed in those cases.
