I recently finished a teenaged Teddy fic and I really relied on my husband for teenaged boy interactions as I'd never been one. I do definitely remember how they behaved around girls, but have no idea how they behaved when they were by themselves. I was also a teacher aid for several years, but that was mostly with first and second-graders.

So far, I've received pretty good feedback on the teenaged boy behavior in it, but I don't know if any actual males have chimed in on it. linkao3(12132915)
