Yes? Boys of all ages - for that matter, men in their 20s - push and elbow and challenge and tease each other for the hell of it. If they're friends, it's like a private joke and a physical outlet for all that restless energy combined. If they're not, it's often cruel. I'd say in general adolescent boys have more physical energy than adolescent girls, and they jostle each other and horse around more; of course, society encourages that behavior in boys and discourages it in girls.

Boys also do remarkably brash and idiotic things in school, such as daring each other to slide down stair rails on cafeteria trays. Since the stairs themselves are made of concrete, this is usually a bad idea.

The puppies comparison is pretty apt, IMO.
