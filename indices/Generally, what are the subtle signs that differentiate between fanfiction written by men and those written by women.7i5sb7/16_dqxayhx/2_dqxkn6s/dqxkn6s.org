Yeah this is actually the norm lol, are you a guy or a girl? You won't see it as much in today's schools because they actively stop it, which I think is a huge shame. :( My friends and I had a lot of fun shoving each other around and wrestling, it's literally biological nature for boys just like it is for other animals. Girls compete socially and boys compete physically, but society doesn't understand boys right now.
