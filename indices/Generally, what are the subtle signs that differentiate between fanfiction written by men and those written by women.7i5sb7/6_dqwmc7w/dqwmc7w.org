A lot of older women write sex scenes as some sort of spiritual journey. As a less romantically inclined female, it makes me feel awkwardly too-close to the characters.

I haven't been personally acquainted with male writers, but I'm guessing that some of them are responsible for those excessive descriptions of the male orgasm.
