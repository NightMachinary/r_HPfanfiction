When I first came across the orgasm-as-drug-experience (I didn't think of it as spiritual), my first thought was, "Wow, have I been doing sex wrong all these years?" The time after that, I thought, "Bartender, gimme some of whatever she's drinking," because who wouldn't want mind-blowing orgasms? But it's clearly a narrative convention meant to stand in for, "Ah ha, finally got them into bed, here's a sex scene to prove they're meant to be together, and not just regular sex, either, this is /transcendent/ sex." I suspect I've been guilty of writing super-meaningful sex as a shorthand for emotional revelations myself. In fact, I know I have.

Mostly I want the sex scenes to stay in character and not be by-the-numbers, or what someone somewhere has dubbed "Ikea sex." And yeah, I prefer angst to fluff, although I usually want it resolved by the end. It depends on the story.
