I'm in a Facebook group of fanfic writers where some members are older married women. "Older" is really relative. I'm in my early 20s, so I just really meant older than myself. I've noticed that experienced younger writers, as well as those around my age, tend to focus more on emotions that drive a plot that doesn't revolve around a ship. They're more likely to center the story on angst or experimental themes. It's usually the older and/or married ones that have ships and smut as the focal point. Younger, less experienced writers have fluffy ships as the main focus, though a lot of them also have clumsy descriptions of sex; I have no experience within the HP fandom for this age group, and my acquaintances come from the RPF communities in K-pop.

This is what I meant.
