  A lot of older women write sex scenes as some sort of spiritual journey

Examples? I'm not sure what you're describing here. I've certainly run across sex scenes in fanfic in which orgasms get described as utterly mind-blowing, almost metaphysical experiences, but I haven't particularly noticed any age-specific patterns. And fantasy sex is almost always exaggerated in some way, but I haven't run across sex-as-spiritual-journey.
