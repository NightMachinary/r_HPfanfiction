That sounds almost like something a teenager would write or maybe an inexperienced adult. I mean, all right, maybe magical contraception doesn't exist in their world, but yeah, Harry could Apparate to a drugstore and pick up some condoms right quick and be back in like 5 minutes.

I would hesitate to peg that as a clear sign of female writing--I'm a ladyperson and I've written some down and dirty biz--but sadly you are probably right in this instance.
