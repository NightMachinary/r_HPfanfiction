I was reading a story earlier where Ginny divorced Harry and he has a woman over. He spills wine over her dress and instead of vanishing the spill there's an awkward scene where the girl takes a shower and they end up making out in sleep clothes afterwards. Things start to get serious but they have to call the thing off due to a lack of contraception. Instead of doing what sex deprived adults (and we are talking about a several-year-long dry spell) would do in that situation (oral sex, magical contraception, apparating to the next gas station and buying a pack of condoms or not caring and getting moring after contraceptives) they settle on sleep.

It is so obvious that the author was female from this scene alone and the whole "I am not ready to have sex but will come to his son's birthday" thing was the reason I dropped the fic. If you write adults your characters should behave like adults, not like in a T rated high school romance.
