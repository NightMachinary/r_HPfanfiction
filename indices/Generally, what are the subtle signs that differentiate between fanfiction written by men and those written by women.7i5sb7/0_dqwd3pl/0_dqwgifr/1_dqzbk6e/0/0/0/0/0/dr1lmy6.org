I think it's unclear as to whether or not the majority of slash writers are queer because we don't have good data, and that people who believe het women are the majority of slash writers should be seen as disagreeing on an empirical question rather than actively conspiring against your identity. Even if it turns out that queer slash writers are not the majority, they would still represent a sizeable portion of the community.
