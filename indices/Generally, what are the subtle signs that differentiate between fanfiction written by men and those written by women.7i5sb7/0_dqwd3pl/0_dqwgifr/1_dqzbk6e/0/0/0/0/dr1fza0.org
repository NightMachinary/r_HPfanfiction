Apologies for my tone. Sorry. I was in not a great place to be civil when I wrote that. I've edited it.

From my perspective what influenced my response is that I (and many other lgbt people) have until recently found fandom to be in general a safe and welcoming space, but that's started to change over the last three or so years with an increase of people starting to ask for 'no slash', suggesting that slash is - or /should be/ - a niche interest, rather than part and parcel of the wider scope of fanon, people 'forgetting' about slash pairings when doing a survey, etc. etc. Creating the overall impression that fanon and the fan community is moving, like the real world - that we come here to escape from the issues with - to push us to the margins, too.

Again apologies for my tone though. You were only repeating a commonly made claim that is to most people expressed as a common truth.

Some sources for further reading - although unfortunately I've mislaid the one that cites the original study explicitly by name!
