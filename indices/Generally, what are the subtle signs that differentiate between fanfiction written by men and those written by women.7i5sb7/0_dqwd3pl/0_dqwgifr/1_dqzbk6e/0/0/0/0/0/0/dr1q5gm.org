That wasn't really what I was disagreeing on in the first place though. It is indeed likely that a sizeable chunk of slash is written by heterosexual women simply because there are so many of them in the world demographically compared to lgbt people. I was just pointing out - light-heartedly! - in my original comment, that people who are not straight do actually exist outside of fiction.

Given that your original comment seemed to try to shut down the idea that anyone except women could like anything about Draco Malfoy :P
