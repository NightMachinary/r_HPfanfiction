You're being extremely aggressive and rude when I merely raised it as a possibility that most slash is read and written by women. I was unaware of that study and it was not the reason for my perception that that might be the case. I agree that gay authors and gay-adjacent authors exist in the community and like to depict people resembling themselves and those they know. Nonetheless, we should expect that effect to be small (even if gay authors are somewhat overrepresented in fanfiction communities!) because the majority of fanfiction writers are still het as a consequence of the majority of the overall population being het.

I'm not erasing people, and I take pains to understand the world outside my bubble. Don't make me regret it.
