So, that claim is actually based on a single study done back in the 80s that didn't even take into account that lgbt fans existed. Sure, a percentage of straight women write slash, but I'm willing to bet a significant chunk is also written by fans who identify as lgbt. On that point, it's actually I would say extremely likely that whenever lgbt writers /are/ writing, there's gonna be some M/M or F/F pairings, because to do otherwise would be to be erasing themselves from the world - and we in the lgbt community like to, in general, include ourselves when there is a chance to do so.

There's also the fact that we don't see M/M, F/F etc. relationships as inherently unnatural or something we would have to reach to include, like some straight authors might.
