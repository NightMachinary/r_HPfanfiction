* Unless the clothing is plot-relevant.

Granted, this rarely happens in the HP fandom because "muggle clothes," "dress robes", and "school robes" are all you really need, but I wouldn't mind hearing about a disguise, an unusual costume, a strange piece of safety gear, or whatever. Perhaps the wearer is covered in mud or stained with something you can't (or wish you couldn't) identify. Details like that help support the plot.

But yeah, if it's not plot relevant, clothing is pointless.
