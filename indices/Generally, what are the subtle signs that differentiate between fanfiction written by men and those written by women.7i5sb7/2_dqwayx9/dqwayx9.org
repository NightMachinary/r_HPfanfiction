I always assume harem fics, super-sexy Hermione/Ginny/any other female character and super-powered/stud Harry are written by and for males and romance oriented fics and fics with a female MC who is not a galloping nymphomaniac are written by females. I imagine mystery and adventure stories are pretty evenly shared.
