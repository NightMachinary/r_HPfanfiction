I think you can tell by how the female characters are written. Poorly written or unrealistic female characters are often a sign to me that the author is male. Like when the female characters are walking stereotypes or have conversations no female would really have. Like, i was reading a fic with fairly well-written male characters, but in the only female-only scene the characters sat around discussing their weight and clothing. Definitely not a female author lol. (Same goes for male characters, if they seem super unrealistic to how men usually act you can probably guess it was written by a lady.) Stories where the female characters experience sexism or just generally joke about female only topics (aka things like periods/makeup/ect.) the author is probably speaking from experience. If a story ever has a sub-plot about a doucy-male character getting his comeuppance for being a sexist prat, it's a pretty good sign that the author is a lady.
