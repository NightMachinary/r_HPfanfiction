How a certain character is normally written is how you can sometimes tell if the person is man or woman, not always but sometimes.

Stories that go in detail about what a person is wearing, those are normally written by women. Although I'm a woman and I can't stand shopping trips or when clothes in general are written about.

How the gender is written is normally a indicator as well; not always as there are exceptions.
