  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Years later, the effects of Slytherin's locket become apparent. The damage it had wrought was far greater than anyone anticipated, particularly to the psyche of an older Ronald Weasley.How else could he explain the fantasies he had? How else could he rationalise the lurid images of his wife and his best friend?How else could he justify the steps he would take to make it all a reality?
