I can point you to the original fic from which Kurinoone got the idea. It is called 'A Shattered Prophecy'.

Warning: it has been a while, so if I remember correctly, it is worse than 'The Darkness Within'. It is also unbetaed and riddled with mistakes. However, the author has great ideas - plus as I said, the concept is actually his/hers.
