funny comparison. But, we get witnessed about the Confundus 2 times in the Canon (if im not mistaken). Snape and Hermione. And Hermiones using was very Sloppy, as Cormac was fully aware, that his actions were manipulated....well, i guess he didnt think "what the hell? Someone was controlling me?" but he was definetely confused about his action. The Jedi Mind trick never is getting detected by the target, unless its immune or others are aware or the Trick.
