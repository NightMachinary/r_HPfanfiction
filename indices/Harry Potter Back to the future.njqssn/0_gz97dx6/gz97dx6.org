I'd love to see a fic where we don't see the numerous adventures in fixing the timelines themselves, but we do see the aftermaths from each attempt as chapters.

In one timeline, he's married Hermione. In another, it's Ginny. In others, he's married to other characters, including one future where he's unhappily married to a batshit crazy Daphne Greengrass.

Each future had something wrong with it, e.g. Voldemort winning, or Voldemort being defeated but the world becoming a dystopian hell hole, or his and the lives of his friends being crap-shoots despite the future being bright and cheery for everyone else...

Hell, now that I think about it, it has some parallels to Cursed Shite.

What'd be more horrific is if someone from one of these futures finds out what was going on and pulls a reverse uno; going back into the past to ensure their future happens -- kinda like Bif.

Just for something different, an unhinged, older Gabrielle Delacour or Fleur trying to plan ideas in their younger selves' brains would be disturbing -- same deal with kind, sweet Katie Bell coming face-to-face with her harder, embittered older self...
