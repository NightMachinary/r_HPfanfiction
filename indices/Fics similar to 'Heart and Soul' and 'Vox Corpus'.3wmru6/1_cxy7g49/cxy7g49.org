The age of Vox Corporis (I assume that's what you meant) makes me think of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Acceptance of Fate). It's quite old - and abandoned - but it's one of the best early Harry/Hermione stories. For something newer, I'd recommend linkffn(11318985). It's recently completed and very well written, although some posters on this subreddit believe the author's works belong on [[/r/iamverysmart]].

Edit: if you /really/ want a long fic, try [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6048][Harry Potter and the Fifth Element]] by Bexis. It's 1.42 million words long. I got around 60% of the way through but couldn't finish it due to some of the characterizations but others certainly enjoy it.
