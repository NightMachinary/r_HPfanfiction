I haven't watched the movie yet (and the book's fuzzy on my memory), but it's perfect for the girl. She doesn't trust magic at all, because she realized it was magic that killed her father and she does her best to withdraw from it. Her family line is quite powerful for the witches born from it, so I don't think she'll die before 10. It's a good option for her internalized struggle and the fact that she's the target of the dark wizard.
