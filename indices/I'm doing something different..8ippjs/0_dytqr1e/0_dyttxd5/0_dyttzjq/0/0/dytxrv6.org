Oh that sounds like a really good hook. I have to confess that I haven't seen the movie, either, mostly because the US magical world seems like it's a real downer! I do definitely like the concept of Obscurials and how they add another dimension to the magical world. In the core HP books, magic is treated a bit "everything is awesome" when it very well might not be for everyone. I also have to wonder if JKR hinted a bit that Dumbledore's sister Ariana was one.
