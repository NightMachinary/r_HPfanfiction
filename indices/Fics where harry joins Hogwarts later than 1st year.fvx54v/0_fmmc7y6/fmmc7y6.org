Not quite what you asked for, but check out Fixing Past Mistakes and sequel by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan. It is an AU that involves time travel and Harry attending another school on one of the Caribbean islands. When the Triwizard Tournament happens, there are indeed 4 schools competing and Harry is part of the group that travels to Hogwarts.

Warning: Lots of Gryffindor bashing, although it is relatively mild compared to other works by the same author.
