I would like to point out that while Harry and Luna are indeed signed up for the same package delivery service, at this point there is only limited romance in the story. It won't be until at least Harry's 4th year that I will be introducing any real romance into the story featuring Harry (Percy, on the other hand, is fair game). So you'll have to wait until the Yule Ball for anything other than hand holding, and even then it won't be until much later that romance takes center stage.
