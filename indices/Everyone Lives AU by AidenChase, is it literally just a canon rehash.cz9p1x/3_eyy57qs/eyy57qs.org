It's the most rigid rehash I've ever read. You'd think a world with a free Sirius and dead Peter woul mean a brand new plot for year 3 right? But no, it's practically identical but with a few names changed.\\
I gave up on it before reaching the end of fifth year, so dull.\\
Every time some possible divergence shows up the author finds a way to shoehorn in the original plot. I wouldn't be surprised if it still ends with Harry facing Voldemort, dieing, coming back, and winning thanks to the loyalty of a wand.
