I was just thinking that it might be less daunting if you were able to recruit some readers. Someone tried it a long time ago with Aspens Year like none other series, each chapter was read by someone different with different quality audio, it was a nice attempt but didn't work.. I wouldn't mind giving it a try, i'm not sure that I have the "right" kind of voice for this kind of thing.. I listen to audio books at work and go through one every two or three days. I can't afford any new ones, so I have most of them memorised. It would be nice to have something new, and it might help cut down on the time I spend reading fanfic at home.
