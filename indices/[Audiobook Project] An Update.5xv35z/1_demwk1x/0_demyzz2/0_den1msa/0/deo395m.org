I've actually heard the Like None Other series, and honestly, it's not that good. The fact that each chapter is read by a different narrator and is of a different quality detracts from the suspension of belief.

I think I'll have to have different narrators for each fanfic (that read every chapter of he book) if this is going to work. What do you think of that idea?
