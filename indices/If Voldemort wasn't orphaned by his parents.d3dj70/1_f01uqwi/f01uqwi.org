You want a story with the message of an abuse victim giving in to their abuser's manipulations and coercion and just staying with them anyway? Jesus. Tom would turn out /worse,/ having to actually grow up watching his father being abused by his mother all the time. He might even grow up to hate/fear witches in particular, broadly women in general.

If you want an awesomely dark story, write that. Show it as sick and unhealthy, with Merope coercing and raping Tom's dad all the time, using her magic to make him obey her all the time. And Tom would be having to deal with that by the time he gets into Hogwarts.

Maybe Dumbledore or someone steps in to help once they notice Tom's getting affected by it all, but probably not, since it was 50 years ago from today. Bad times.

It'd be real nice to make some stories that shed some light on female on male domestic abuse situations though. We need more awareness of that in the world. It'd even work out okay in the magical world, since there isn't any gender stereotyping/roles going on there like the muggle world has. They're gender equal. Nice way to show victims being treated the same - and perpetrators. To show the situation being treated /just as seriously/ by magical law enforcement, and by other people too. And, for readers who wouldn't really see it the same way unless it was classic husband-on-wife stuff, they might get their eyes opened too.
