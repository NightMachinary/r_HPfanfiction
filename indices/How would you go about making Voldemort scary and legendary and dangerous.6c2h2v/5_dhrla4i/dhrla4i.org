A good way of setting up a powerful character is to have other, already proven powerful characters, be scared of him. Don't go for the simple tactic of having <character x> beat Harry then lose to Voldemort; rather, have pretty much every powerful character refuse to take on Voldemort head-on. Show their fear, show how much they hate Voldemort but still can't bring themselves to face him.

Voldemort should be a powerful presence even when he's not there. When the characters are nominally safe, there should always be that undertone of fear. /What if he's found out where we are? There's no way he should be able to, but he's done impossible things in the past./ Casual conversations suddenly turn serious and unpleasant when something someone says is even tangentially related to Voldemort.

Basically, to make him a fearful presence for your readers, you should /show/, not tell, that he's a fearful presence in the minds of your characters.
