Give Voldemort a sense of omnipotence without actually adding to his list of powers. Adding secret powers, spells, or plans doesn't really do anything for me if the protagonists don't actually feel a sense of despair, like they can't run or hide or fight, only hope for quick death.

Voldemort was cunning, and wielded fear better than he ever did his wand. I mean, he enchanted his name with a taboo so that it worked as a tracking device, giving the impression of terrifying omniscience and omnipotence, which resulted in the entire wizarding population of Britain frightened of even uttering his name.
