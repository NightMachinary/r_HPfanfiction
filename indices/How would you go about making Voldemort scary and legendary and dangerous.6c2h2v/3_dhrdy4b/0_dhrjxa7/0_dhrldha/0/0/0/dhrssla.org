While I can see Voldemort fearing no repercussions for his actions, I don't see him as reckless. He has a goal and a deep sense of self-preservation. Unpredictable and calculating sounds a lot like The Joker from The Dark Knight, which is about as far from Voldemort as it should be. Voldemort doesn't really fit the wild card character.

I think a big part of this is due to Rowling basing the Death Eaters on Nazis.
