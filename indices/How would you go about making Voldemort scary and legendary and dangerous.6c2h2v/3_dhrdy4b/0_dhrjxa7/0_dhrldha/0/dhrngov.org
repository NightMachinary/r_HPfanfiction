But that's not the kind of guy you want running an evil empire. While unpredictability makes him more dangerous and, well, unpredictable; cold and calculating makes him seem more predatory. As if he's a snake in a tank with a rat, and he keeps circling the rat, toying with it, leaving it in suspense for when, or if, he's going to strike.

That seems like a scarier Voldemort than a Voldemort that kills people for no rhyme or reason.
