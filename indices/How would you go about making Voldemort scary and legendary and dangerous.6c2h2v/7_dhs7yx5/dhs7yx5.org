I've planned a few fics and quite a number of them involved a very competent Dark Lord.

I've found that the Voldemort character is greatly improved by a couple things

- Efficiency

- Efficacy

Voldemort made competent (more so than just in comparison to the incompetent ministry, he's efective at achieving things at rates no one else is). Think of it for a moment; the Dark Lord would likely not worry about paperwork and others idle things. He will be brutally effective, utterly single-minded on achieving whatever his mind is set to, and he has /time/.

Imagine a politican who could apparate across the country, manipulate with magic, inspire fear and awe with an incantation. Can you even imagine how much they could get done and how many people you could meet? Now imagine you swear those people to secrecy, or kill them if they don't join you. Now months down the line there's a veritable army of people sworn to secrecy through magic, fear, or loyalty - and you had no idea this was going on? As the months progress perhaps you catch a rumour or a hint of something that, surely, isn't possible - /"The Goblins have allied with him? But they were on our side! How do we safeguard our gold!"/

You're blindsided.

One thing leads to another, leads to another, leads to another - and you've got a seemingly insurmountable series of opponents who sprung up out of nowhere.

Assume you get creative and the Dark Lord has created legions of inferi, delved into the blackest of magics and is poised to release them to astounding impact, not to mention that this guy is just so damn good at magic itself.

--------------

Finally, I want you to think back to the Order of the Phoenix film when Dumbledore is accosted by Fudge, Umbridge, and aurors (Kingsley among them). Dumbledore escapes a seemingly inescapable situation by utilising a skill (Phoenx travel) that no one else can use. This elevates him above the rest, and in Kinglsey this inspires a bit of awe ("You can't deny, Minister. Dumbledore has got /style/.")

Now imagine instead of Dumbledore, that you've cornered Voldemort. He's seemingly caught off-guard, and outgunned. Yet he's in control of the situation, and he escapes through a means you can't hope to replicate. Instead of inspiring awe you'd inspire terror, fear, horror.

/What ELSE can he do? Can we even beat him?/
