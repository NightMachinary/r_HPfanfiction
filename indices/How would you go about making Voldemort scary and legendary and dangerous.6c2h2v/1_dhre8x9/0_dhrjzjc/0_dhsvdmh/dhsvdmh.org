The first time I read his voice being described like that in the books, I rejected JKR's reality and substituted my own (same thing with not pronouncing the "t" at the end of his name: no). I just can't imagine Voldemort being remotely intimidating with a "high" voice, no matter how cold it is. The raspy take of the movie versions is about as close as you can get to that.
