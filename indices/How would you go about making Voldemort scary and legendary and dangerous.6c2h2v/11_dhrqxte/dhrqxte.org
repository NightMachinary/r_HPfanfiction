What a lot of fics miss out on is showing the terror going on in the background, people disappearing, people being imperioused to do heinous crimes, deaths that are unexplained.

Voldemort is terrifying for the crimes against magic he's committed, but also because he's a strong leader whose shadow army had the ability to fade into society and wait quietly for their chance to rise up again.

Have any fics used Voldemort using his time as a wraith to scout out his enemies? I doubt that he just chilled in Albania for 9 years.

Voldemort can be written as terrifying, but it takes a lot of thought to make him scary without falling back on "he murders in a blink of an eye with no regret" which to be honest, loses some of its impact over time. Yes, killing is terrible, but Voldemort is a killer and if you don't show why this should have an emotional effect it probably won't.
