Hmm ... that's a fairly good question, I think.

I feel like the way to do it is to capitalise on the immortality thing of his. Horcruxes ... well, they do /sound/ all-scary and stuff, but in the series proper they, other than the diary, never amounted to anything more than plot coupons. The Dark Mark, as scary as it sounds on paper, is also woefully underexplored and while that is understandable because sometimes less details means more ... something, they too could be used better if /some/ things were known about them.

So let us start by changing the way the Horcruxes work. In this version, rather than being mere plot coupons that have to be destroyed and that's it, let us make them items that lay where they are and take some kind of life energy (or magic, or whatever) from everyone in the vicinity in a way that does not do /permanent/ harm but certainly is not a good thing, gathering it until the end of time, and every time the spirit of Tom gets to one of them a part of this gathered energy can be used to fairly quickly (depending on the amount used either days or hours or even minutes) make him another body that he can use. Imagine a man of his power, capable of duelling many at the same time and even winning them, and when you grab that victory by playing on the opening he just left by murdering half the people you were fighting with, it only stops him for days at most. And with the Horcruxes in the places they are: Diagon Alley (the Cup), Hogwarts (the Diadem), some obscure Muggle village (the Ring), middle of London (the Locket), the energy certainly isn't a problem. Furthermore, because the items are so full of energy, destroying them without first ridding them of the energy will cause terrible destruction.

Albus has a reputation of being able to stand up to him, for he is capable of fighting him one-on-one and surviving with nary a scratch. But he does not dare kill Tom, oh no, for he knows /something/ is at play but does not know what terrible costs are extracted and from whom when Tom is revived. He is wrong, of course, for the costs are extracted regardless, but he does try; it is not mercy for Tom and his Death Eaters that made him look for an alternate way, but mercy for those who could be pulled to their graves along with Tom.

Now, Harry being a Horcrux is a bit of a cop-out because seriously, but we shall do something about their connection. So let's say that in his act of breaking the contract he unknowingly agreed to by killing Lily, he managed to get /something/ of his stolen and attached to Harry, the ability to /use/ his Horcruxes. He does not die, for he still has them, but all the energy from them has to go through Harry first now and that is where it stops. Harry recovers from everything dealt to him, but he does so by draining from the Horcruxes. The Diary, rogue as it went due to Lucius's attempts at making it work for his master again, is defeated not by the fang of a basilisk but because Harry's wounds are so grievous that all of the Diary's energy gets used up to keep him from dying from the venom; certainly, though, the fang does not help it. Harry does not know it. The ritual at the end of the fourth year now serves not to make a new body for Tom, for he is not a weird foetus thing, but to tear the thing out of Harry and give it back to Tom. The tear is why Harry's mind is connected to Tom's: his very spirit, his soul, so aches for what it now feels is missing that without his input it reaches out to where the thing is now missing, to Tom.

Such a thing cannot be stopped by Occlumency, and Albus Dumbledore knows it. But it can hide things from himself, and on the off chance that Tom can see all of Harry this is one of the two things that could help, the other being Obliviating Harry. But Harry does not manage to learn Occlumency, he wears his heart on his sleeve, of course he could not manage, and by the time this is known nothing more can be done for Albus is dying and cannot rid Harry of what he knows.

The Dark Mark can only be taken willingly, but you need not perform any heinous acts to accept it. No, the very act of accepting it is enough for Tom to be able to brand their bodies and their souls, to scar their very beings forever, and it need not be an acceptance borne out of sharing their beliefs, accepting in exchange for them not doing horrible things to someone you know is enough. Because it is far more terrible when it is not a mark of the evildoers, but rather a mark of those who agreed and those who were forced to agree alike. The Dark Mark does stop the Horcruxes from draining the people whose souls are marked, that much they get from it, and they can hide it from view if they wish unless Tom wishes for it to show itself and betray their supposed allegiance; it can also cause them untold pain, as if the entirety of their beings burned, if Tom so wishes and has another Dark Mark at his disposal to trigger it.

Severus Snape fancies himself a spy, but it is futile. He cannot learn anything for people are willing to speak of nothing if the price is agony, and the few things he brings are from people who so despise being pulled into it again when they were forced the first time that they are only waiting to annoy Tom enough to die. And however much he thinks he is the member of the inner circle, there is a reason why his Dark Mark is always visible.

The Taboo on his name is light nowadays, when compared to the old one. Now, you only get snatchers, nothing more than werewolves who want you to suffer. Back in the days before his fall, when you said his name aloud, you woke up the next day to get tortured, see your family be tortured, and that only ended when you accepted the Dark Mark; then, you were tortured until you either killed those for whom you took it or until you were no longer able to raise a wand. Not everyone got through their initiation. Severus's act of bringing Tom the part of the prophecy that he heard was his /penance/ for not being able to pass his even though he sought to take the Dark Mark and was not forced into it.

Regulus did not die because he drank the potion. He died because he tried to confront Tom about Kreacher and was tortured to death. Tom did not know that Regulus took the amulet, and he certainly did not tell him for he was in too much of an agony to speak of anything.

The werewolves follow him not only because of his power, but also because he is rumoured to have a cure for Lycantrophy, and Greyback is well aware that if he truly does have it and they rebel he will not ask for permission before simply using it and then watching them break. The Dementors do not follow him but the ministry which by then is so compromised that it could as well be his, but he does not care, he just points them to places with people and they are eager to go there and sate themselves. The Giants, he recruited with the help of Dementors.

Even when the Horcruxes are destroyed, Tom still cannot die. They would know, they did kill him in the battle of Hogwarts, only for the Death Eaters to use a ritual to revive him. Though Harry is not a Horcrux, he still is an anchor, and the only way to kill Tom, to actually slay him rather than merely reduce him to a wraith, is to have both him and Harry die and then have Harry's soul take his away. It is only the title of the Master of Death that allows Harry to do so, that is the one power granted to the one who unites the three Hallows of Death, for souls normally cannot touch other souls, they all have to move on on their own, and Tom's soul cannot move from its place for even without the Horcruxes it still is chained to what they were. Harry does not need to surrender willingly, so he kills Tom as Tom kills him, by forcing the Elder Wand to turn back on Tom just as he is being slain.

The Goblins do not make faces at Harry after the whole thing, for Gringotts is no more. Hogwarts remains, for the Diadem was recovered by Death Eaters and only destroyed part of the Forbidden Forest later, and both the Ring and the Locket devastate some countryside. Nagini goes down without much of a disaster.

It is still love that is the power Tom knows not. Agape. Tom knows the other three, even if he thinks he does not need them, but agape, no, that will never be in his reach. Though he does not go gently, Harry still goes to the slaughter and he still does it willingly, and all that for the people he knows. Petunia gets his Order of Merlin, throws it thrice like a worthless bauble until the fourth time when the new Minister arrives personally. She does not recover, because she can no longer call Harry a freak, but that is worth nothing to no-one. The epilogue ends with Luna placing a painting of him that she made on his grave.

Peter Pettigrew went to Tom willingly, to take the Dark Mark before they would torture him so that he would take it. During the first war, he was only a Death Eater for a single day, but that was enough: his loyalty towards those he swore to protect broken, he did not even need to share the secret with Tom for it was no longer hidden from anyone.
