  I've always been of the opinion that Harry survived Voldemort's first killing curse because of /Snape/.

  Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily.

  Voldemort offers to let Lily live if she abandons Harry.

  Lily pleads to take her instead.

  Voldemort (attempts) to kill them both.

  There are a lot of conflicting variables in that kind of situation and in a world where you can apparently be binded into oaths and contracts without your consent, it's always been my opinion that Voldemort somehow /accidentally/ agreed to kill Lily if he would spare Harry. When he broke that "contract" by attempting to kill Harry immediately afterward, his magic backfired on him.

  Think about it - how many mothers must have pleaded to spare their children during a /war/? This seems like the only logical reason that Harry should have survived, and it all starts with Snape.
