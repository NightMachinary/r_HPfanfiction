  Lily blew Voldemort out of his body after all

When was this? Safeguarding Harry with her love doesn't really count in my book - there's no evidence it was ever intentional, and was likely a mother simply protecting her child to the bitter end.

I like the idea that Lily AND James (people forget or dismiss James far too often imho) were powerful and talented magicals, and together could at least delay Voldemort until Dumbledore arrived though.
