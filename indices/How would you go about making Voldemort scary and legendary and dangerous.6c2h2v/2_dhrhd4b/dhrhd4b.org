Don't wheel him out unless it matters, then have him devastate with ease. You become accustomed to things easily, you make everything overpowered and nothing is overpowered. He should be on another level above and beyond with no effort on his part, he simply is. Bellatrix delights in cruelty, Voldemort has already killed them and their family in the middle of the night and left his calling sign because he wants everyone to know it was him and you still can't stop it from happening.

It wasn't the surviving that made him terrifying, it was that he'd nearly won a decade long war and the only thing that could stop him was a baby and a fluke. Moody shows Harry the old order picture, most of them died. You didn't oppose him, you died. Harry's friends, regardless of how much you like them should be wiped out if they came across Voldemort. Too many people want to show that Hermione/Neville/Ron is strong so they hold off Voldemort, he should have no equals other than Harry (through luck or super!Harry) and Dumbledore who had the elder wand as a crutch.
