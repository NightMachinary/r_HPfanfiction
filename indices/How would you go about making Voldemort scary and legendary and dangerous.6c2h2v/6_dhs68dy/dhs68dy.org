I personally never found Voldemort to be scary in the books and most fics make him act like villain from a children's story where he explains his plans when he has the hero tied up. If you want to make him appear scary and feel like the insane psychopath that he is, keep him unknown in his abilities, have him live up to what people say about him, and if you are going to have the hero beat him make it a truly epic fight where the hero barely escapes, whether through luck or someone else's intervention like in OoTP with Dumbledore. One of the things that I find that can make or break the character is how he acts, if you want him to be a truly terrible /thing/ have him act the part, as I said before don't have him explaining everything the first chance he gets. Have him use magic that the hero would never use, for moral reasons or something similar, or simply can't use by some limiting factor, just don't have it be magic that requires 8600 mana to use, it's a story not a MMORPG.
