1 - Don't wheel him out unless it's /absolutely/ necessary, and when he appears, have him really put the hammer down. Voldemort is both more and less than a person, and his inhumanity - both in physical resemblance and behaviour - helps set him apart from the rest. The issue with his showing up in any situation, however, is that canon Death Eaters are kind of weak, with the exception of maybe Bellatrix. Voldemort /is/ their hope for wizarding purity, and his soldiers should be fanatical, skilled and /extremely dangerous./ If they aren't, then the reader will mostly wonder why Voldemort doesn't just do away with his incompetent henchmen and do it all himself.

2 - Have him really strike fear with his magic, for instance maybe use Legilimency as Snape described. Canon-Voldemort delights in pain and suffering, and although that is fun and can definitely be scary, a better way to do it - as described by [[/u/Epwydadlan1][u/Epwydadlan1]], is apathy. Voldemort should be so removed from humanity that he should be disinterested in being hilariously punitive, as making him reactionary to the protagonist diminishes his threat. The more terrifying concept is someone that is ruthless, yet utterly amoral and unfettered by laws or respect for human decency - that if you meet this person, they'll kill you because you're in the way if for no other reason. Maybe have him conduct experiments on prisoners, just to see what he can learn from magic.

3 - Tying on to his ruthlessness and need to /not/ be reactionary to the direction of the plot, Voldemort should have his own objectives, and furthermore should truly embody his cause. Too many authors, I think, use the fact he's a half-blood and is sort-of insane to say he was just /using/ the purebloods and their ambitions as a means to start a war, but I think he is /much/ scarier when he is a true believer in the cause. The idea that a charismatic, physically unassailable and utterly ruthless Voldemort could be driven - and in turn drive suicidal loyalty into his soldiers - to achieve an ideological aim is much more interesting than "duh, he's insane."

4 - If he is targeting Super!Harry, and is unable to do it directly, then he should do more of what he didn't in the books: target Harry's friends and associates. He should operate with equal parts surgical precision and unfathomable cruelty, using death, torture, dismemberment and rampant destruction to force Super!Harry onto the defensive, or to draw him out into a planned confrontation. I'm talking /heinous/ levels of shit here, for instance targeting Harry's friends' families - Hermione's parents are ripe for murdering in their (I'm assuming unprotected) household in the muggle world.

5 - More strategy, less grouping the Death Eaters up and letting them get caught red-handed in the Ministry. The Death Eaters should operate like any terrorist organisation, in cells that barely communicate and of which only Voldemort is aware of all. For every magical ready to fight directly, there should be sleeper agents, informants, mercenaries and creatures operating in loose communication and association with one another. Hell, even just encouraging your average criminals to get out on the streets and cause mayhem in Voldemort's name helps build an image of an omnipotent opponent, who can strike anywhere, anytime.

6 - Tying on to number five, there should be a total lack of clarity about Voldemort and his forces, /a la/ OOTP. The news outlets should be flooded with false information and scaremongering, Death Eaters should fraudulently report emergencies to the Aurors to draw them out and at the same time spread distrust amongst members of the public. He should rarely ever show his face, and the crimes committed in his name would set the stage for his eventual arrival, once the time was right.

7 - In duels, make him perform incredible feats of magic. Throwing out AKs like they're going out of fashion is cool, sure, but I think Voldemort could really be served by a wider repertoire of spells.

8 - In the end, things are "monster" scary when you don't understand them at all. Things are "Hitler and the Nazis" scary when you can understand only too well their aims and how far they will go to achieve them. To me, Voldemort should sit firmly in the middle - real enough with achievable aims that make him an idol to his supporters and terrifying in a long-term sense to his enemies, yet inhuman and cruel enough that he doesn't lose the mystique of being /something else,/ in the most terrifying sense of the word.
