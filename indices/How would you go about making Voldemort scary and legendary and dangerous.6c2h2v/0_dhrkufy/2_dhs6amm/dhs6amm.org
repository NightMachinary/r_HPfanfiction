Just to add on to this, you could have a very interesting mechanic with the Imperious Curse and terror cells. Voldemort commands the Inner Circle. Each one of those Death Eaters has imperioused five wizards, and each of those wizards Imperious five others. They would then work with absolute loyalty, and be perfectly willing to kill themselves for the cause. If you ignite Fiendfyre in the Ministry Atrium, while simultaneously poisoning the Burn Salve supply with Basilisk Venom, you can kill massive amounts of people.

The problem is that magic is powerful. There should be a careful mix of making horrific choices which kill dozens, but don't make it too logical, and too OP. Yes, we know that Geminio on nuclear weapons is possible, but you as the author need to figure out a way to keep the bullshit contained.
