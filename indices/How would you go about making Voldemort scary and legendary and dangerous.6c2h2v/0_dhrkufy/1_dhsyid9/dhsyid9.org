  3 - Tying on to his ruthlessness and need to not be reactionary to the direction of the plot, Voldemort should have his own objectives, and furthermore should truly embody his cause.

I like this one, I think it's the most important, but all of your suggestions are very good as well. You mention somewhere that a lot of authors love to just make Voldemort completely insane and he'll throw tantrums and such when things happen. It definitely makes him less scary in my opinion. Having a Voldemort with clear (to him) goals and a plan that he follows through is important in making him seem powerful and scary, if he is just reactionary to everything Harry or Dumbledore does then he's not quite so intimidating. In my opinion, in canon and fanfiction alike, Voldemort is like a force of nature like a tsunami or hurricane and that is what makes him so terrifying. You can't reason with him, you can barely understand him, and if you're in his path then you're going to be completely crushed if you take no precautions.
