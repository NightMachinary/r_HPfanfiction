Let me clarify, when I said 'desperate for life' I mean don't make him some idiot ranting like the Master from Doctor Who 'I'm eternal! Never dying!'

Make it a facet of his character, but not the whole point, he wants domination of the world for magic and he's a bad ass, he's suave, he's manipulative as hell, and he pisses concentrated power. He is not a volatile child that somehow managed to inspire a good old fashion civil war by throwing crucio's out like it's candy, that is my biggest gripe about the cannon character.

He's the proper villain of the series, he's supposed to be that thing in the night that goes bumping around that did things so horrifying, a decade after he's died to the masses, they refuse to even whisper his name. He's given a nation PTSD, and Rowling made him a cartoon character. She is amazing at world building, I love what she layed down the basis of, but she's not very good at a lot of character development or exposition.
