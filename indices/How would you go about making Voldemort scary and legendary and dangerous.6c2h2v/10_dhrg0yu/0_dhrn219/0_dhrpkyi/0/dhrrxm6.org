I have disagree with you there. Her worldbuilding is wonderfully imaginative and inspiring, but is also inconsistent and illogical. It's her characters that captured my attention a decade ago and hold my interest now.

I concede that the antagonists aren't portrayed very well. The Dursleys, for example, are exceedingly cartoonish. Voldemort fumbles alot, and is defeated by a child consecutively for years, which is frankly ridiculous.

At his beginning, Voldemort was exactly as you described. He was charismatic, cunning, and powerful, yes, but he was only so successful against Dumbledore because he struck from the shadows, and instilled fear into the masses. But then tearing his soul in seven took his sanity, and that's when he started cursing anyone and everyone near him.

In my head, Voldemort was defined by his childhood: a neglected orphan, abandoned by a mother too weak and sickly to care for her own child and a muggle father who never cared in the first place, bullied by his peers and dismissed by his supposed caretakers. He wanted to leave a grand legacy, to leave an indelible mark on the world. Somewhere along the way he discovered horcruxes, and initially planned to use them as a backup, but then realized their potential for immortality - why worry about your legacy, if you never die in the first place? It's why he chose his name; it certainly isn't because "I am Lord Voldemort" is a convenient anagram of "Tom Marvolo Riddle."

Finally, I believe that the only reason why he failed, in the end, was because of his obsession with escaping death. If he hadn't made horcuxes in the first place, it's likely he'd be ruling Britain by the time canon starts.
