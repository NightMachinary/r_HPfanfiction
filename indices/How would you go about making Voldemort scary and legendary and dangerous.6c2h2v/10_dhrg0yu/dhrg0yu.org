I'll put this here again, first time I found a truly terrifying voldy was in the fic linkffn(the power of the mind by Landstradd) . Voldy shows up as a construct as Harry's greatest fear( his second greatest fear was a balrog). Voldy just shows up and everyone collectively shits themselves. Dude is handsome, suave, and realizes he is a Construct at only part power, and just decides to test Harry on the pillars of dueling. He proceeds to wipe the floor with Harry iirc, and then just let's him go. Making him as powerful as you can, but just uncaring for small details, don't make him insane, make him apathetic, don't make him desperate for life, give him a goal to remake the world and just view people as things unless they are smart enough to matter to him.
