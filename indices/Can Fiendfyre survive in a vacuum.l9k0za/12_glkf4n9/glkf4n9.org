My headcannon is yes, past a certain threshold. To arrive at this statement, we must first exxamine the knowledge we possess of it.

1. Fiendfyre is one of the easiest fire spells to actually cast, but extremely hard to control.

2. It physically and magically damages objects and environments it consumes. We see this in Horcruxi, which have self-repair abilities. We arrive at that conclusion from the statement "must be damaged beyond magical repair."

3. It can consume itself, as shown in Fantastic Beasts when Nicholas Flamel used it to contain Grindelwald's casting of it.

4. It is capable of being enchanted beyond it's base magical properties, but the wielder must prevent it from breaking those charms. This is also shown in Fantastic Beasts, when the circle allows those loyal to Grindelwald through it without harm, but kills those who aren't. After he left, those charms broke and the circle went out of control.

5. It is extremely aggressive, willing to consume the world if it can.

We know that most forms of energy in modern physics are actually created by the movement of sub-atomic particles and waveforms. My assumption is yes, magic is included in that, but the nature of the energy "repairs" loose electrons that form electricity to other atoms or transports it elsewhere, which is why electronics are damaged by magic.

Now, we know that magic is capable of imitating matter or turning into it permanently (temp and permanent Transfiguration and conjuration), and is also capable of destroying it, or turning it into magical energy (vanishing).

So if fiendfyre gained enough ppwer from normal burning inside the atmosphere, it's magical properties would begin converting energy and subatomic particles into magic to sustain it's existence. When it reaches that threshold, it would theoretically be capable of destroying a planet or solar system, possibly more, while leaving only the void or magically inert ash behind.

If we assume that there is such a thing as "ambient magic" that is not a field generated by other magical entities, but is similar to background cosmic microwaves, it could theoretically, at a certain level, begin to feed on that and consume the universe. If we assume that parallel universes actually touch ours at the border, in a theoretical circumstance a single extremely powerful casting of fiendfyre might be capable of destroying the multiverse.

So in short, yes, it is indeed capable of surviving in the vacuum.
