From what I know, yes. First look at Gubraithian Fire "the Everlasting Flame" which can survive without fuel, air, and heat, and is a step down (in my opinion) from Fiendfyre, Gubraithian Fire proves that it is possible to create fire that can survive in those conditions. Secondly, look at the size and the heat (you can tell it's hot by its abilities), if it is that hot and big, and also increases in size, temperature, speed, etc. as time goes on, all the air nearby would be consumed faster than it can be replenished in the fire's area, meaning if Fiendfyre can't survive without air then it wouldn't be that useful, and it wouldn't be able to do what it did in the Room of Requirement. Finally, I believe that Fiendfyre consumes and is attracted to magic, it would choose a small but magical target over a large but nonmagical target because the magical target provides more fuel, so as long as there is magic fueling it, it will survive. Testing the vacuum thing will be impossible though, there isn't any nonmagical material that can survive it, and if you try to enchant the vacuum chamber to survive Fiendfyre, it will just sap the magic, and therefore breaking the spell. I'm betting someone will counter the "magic fuel" theory by saying that "If it can absorb magic and break protections like that, then why isn't it used more often, by cursebreakers and the like", well if you pour a few hundred gallons of gasoline on a fire, it will be uncontrollable, right? Apply the same logic to Fiendfyre, if you let it absorb too much magic, it will become too powerful/uncontrollable, and no amount of magical force, will power, and charms can extinguish/control it, at that point you may just let it consume everything there, while you focus on making the surrounding area devoid of magic.
