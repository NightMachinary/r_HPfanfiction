My guess is... Yes - as long it has stuff to burn.

I mean, there is stuff, like magnesium for example, that makes it possible for fire to burn underwater - so, there is no air and it also in a 'hostile' environment, but the fire still burns as long it has material to feed upon.

Fiendfyre is a magical fire, and one of the strongest. It should be able to burn without the need for oxygen since it wasn't created in a natural way but through magical means. Only magical means should be able to extinguish it. Or, it will go out when there is nothing left to burn.

Let's not forget that it's pseudo-sentient. It doesn't mean much, but I guess that this property will make the fire another few levels stronger.

...

My personal theory is that it can stay alive even if there is nothing left to burn by devouring the magic in the environment.\\
So, when the Fiendfyre is eventually extinguished, you might feel that it's harder to cast magic in the area affected by its destructive hunger because it exhausted all the magic around you.\\
And of course, the area is plagued by some 'Dark Energy' that makes it hard for plant-live and so on to grow. It has to be cleaned by druidic magic or whatever (think of it as some kind of radioactive poisoning).
