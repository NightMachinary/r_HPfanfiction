Since a combustion reaction is essentially:

X + O2 ---> H2O + CO2, then a vacuum, by eliminating the O2, doesn't allow the reaction to proceed, so yes, a vacuum would stop any type of fire.

Now, that's assuming that we believe that magic is still answerable in some way to the laws of physics. If we believe magic is able to ignore all that, then it doesn't really matter. The answer is whatever is most expedient to the plot, because you can hand wave away any explanations as “magic”.
