I'm not sure what on what basis you are determining these propositions.

Canonically, the only things we know about fiendfyre are (i) it is sufficient to destroy objects beyond magical repair, (ii) it spreads quickly, (iii) Aguamenti does not put it out, (iv) it forms into the shapes of animals which chase people down, and (v) it turns on the caster if not controlled.

Aside from those special features - which would all appear to derive from the fact that the flame is cursed - fiendfyre appears to behave like ordinary fire. For example, Harry comments on the charred remains of the objects in the RoR, indicating it consumes its fuel like ordinary fire. Which also implies that it would not be able to exist without fuel. And air, as the oxidant, is one of the two fuels of a fire (the other being the reductant).

In contrast, canonically, the only thing we know about Gubraithian fire is that (i) it never consumes the object to which it is attached and (ii) it is ever-lasting. So gubraithian fire occurs without chemical combustion occuring at all - it is an entirely magical fire which does not obey the normal chemistry of fire at all.
