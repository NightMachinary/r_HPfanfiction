In pyrodynamics we know that a fire need 3(commonly) or 4 things, namely fuel, heat, oxygen, and a chemical reaction to create fire. In magical fire I think the fuel is most likely magic, so any fire spell most likely need some sort of magic to fuel it, Gubraithian fire also most likely turn the ambient Magic to fuel it. I think the fire is unique because of its eternal life, but I don't think it was tested in a real vacuum to know wheather it can survive it, and also weather magic can stay in the vacuum. As technically we can not have physical access to the true vacuum, what we use the term vacuum means little to no air, magic, I don't think is affected by air, so Gubraithian fire most likely can survive no air, same way I think fiendfyre can also survive vacuum if there is enough magic to fuel it.

Also I think Dumbledore don't count fiendfyre as any 'gift' it's a curse, and a very dangerous one, not only to the victim but for the caster too, by that standard Gubraithian fire is only ' light' fire that is eternal.
