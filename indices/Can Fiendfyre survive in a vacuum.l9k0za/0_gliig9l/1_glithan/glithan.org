Well, Gubraithain Fire doesn't kill the caster like Fiendfyre does. It was mentioned that Fiendfyre isn't really hard to cast, but extremely hard to control so that it doesn't just burn everything it touches.

So, Gubraithain Fire is probably worth something because it's safe & a cheap method of having some source of fire, and as you say, eternal. Still, it most likely has to nourish itself with ambient magic to stay alive.

Fiendfyre is probably eternal as well as long it has material to devour. It's a magical fire and one of the most dangerous, and even pseudo-sentient. I doubt that it is just a stronger form of normal fire. It's probably on par with dragonfire, and enchanted with some stuff that makes it manifest as beasts of prey, which will pounce and attack stuff when summoned.

My guess is that if someone were to cast Fiendfyre on the Forbidden Forest, it would devour the entire Forest and burn as long it can find new sources to fuel itself. The only way to stop it might be to cut off its supply of burnable material, or magical water, or spells like glacius, or maybe some spell we don't know about, etc.
