I think it's a bit more simple. I believe that Fiendfire will burn in literally all environments, vacuum included, so long as magic is supplied to it. This means the important part is that Fiendfire tries to kill its caster. Once the caster is dead/stops supplying magic, the flames will become effectively nothing but water resistant flames.
