In Order of the Phoenix, we learn of Gubraithian fire, a magical fire which never goes out. Hermione comments on how exceptional this piece of magic is; Dumbledore himself performed it, and it was unique enough to be considered a gift so valuable that it might sway the giants not to join Voldemort.

Given how unique and special Gubraithian fire is considered to be, I doubt Fiendfyre replicates its properties. So I don't think Fiendfyre is an eternal inextinguishable flame like Gubraithian fire is. Fiendfyre is /cursed/ fire, not /perpetual/ fire. It /can/ be put out (albeit with some difficulty), and will in any event run its course.
