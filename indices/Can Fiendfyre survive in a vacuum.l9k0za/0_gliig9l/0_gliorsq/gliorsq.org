True. But which part is cursed?

Evidently, it's cursed such that water doesn't work. By the same token, I'd be surprised if (simple) vacuum or (simple) cold worked. IMO, a very reasonable interpretation is that Fiendfyre can only be extinguished by magical means, not physical ones.

If there existed an equivalently cursed ice, that might do it. A bit clich√©, but thematically it fits HP, where the opposite of a spell is often used to correct the first spell.
