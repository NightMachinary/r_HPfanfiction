I think the description as cursed fire is actually quite revealing.

Two features of dark magic we are familiar with from the books are (i) dark magic resists other magic, e.g. by being more difficult to heal; and (ii) dark magic is in some sense malicious in nature.

And all the unique characteristics of fiendfyre kinda fall into those categories. Resists Aguamenti and destroys objects beyond repair fit into (i). Chases people and its own caster down fits into (ii).

What this suggests to me is that the fire isn't going to do anything special when it encounters a lack of fuel. There's nothing there to resist, because it's not so much an action being taken against it. Rather, the fire has encountered an /absence/ of something. The cursed aspect isn't engaged by that; it's just the underlying fire's nature not to burn if there's no fuel.

Trivially I think this must be true, else the fiendfyre unleashed in the Room of Requirement would have burnt all Hogwarts down and kept going until it encountered a wizard strong enough to control it. But that didn't happen, so it must at some point just stop spreading even without a wizard there to stop it.
