The thing wrong with your Room of Requirement example is that once the Fiendfyre burns everything including air, it could've possibly survived in there, contained by the Room of Requirement and just stored away as one of the many "rooms"/parts of it, as we never see it get extinguished, we only see Harry and co. leave the Room and it closing as nobody's there, and since the room of requirement can change according to a house elf's wishes, whos to say that Hogwarts with it's limited, but still there, sentience won't have its wishes granted, as Hogwarts' sentience comes from its protection and the amount of magic from ley lines and the magic performed within, its priority will be the security of its inhabitants, and the Room being part of Hogwarts may grant that wish before the Fiendfyres' wish to consume everything (Fiendfyre has limited sentience, that is only focused on consuming things).
