It doesn't resist /just/ magic though. It resists attempts to douse it with water. I'm not even going to argue physics, but even so, it clearly resists /one/ way to snuff out an ordinary fire. Given its nature of a destructive dark arts spell, I'd say it's a fair (if obviously impossible-to-prove) extrapolation that it resists /all/ common methods.

(Also, if the fire can create fire-animals that chase people, it might not be all the concerned with fuel?)

As for the RoR, I honestly always figured it was the magic in the room that did it. If it had been any other room than the RoR, the castle /would/ have burned down.
