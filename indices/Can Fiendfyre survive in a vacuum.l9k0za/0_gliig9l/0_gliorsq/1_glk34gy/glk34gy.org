My headcanon for fiendfire is that it eats magic. That's all. The difficulty with controlling it is entirely because you are feeding it your own magic to keep it going. It's like trying to put out a normal fire using paper. Theoretically possible, but you have to know what you are doing. It could survive in a vacuum, provided there was magic to feed off. As to how it got put out in the RoR? Hogwarts. The room is a conjured thing, therefore Hogwarts can control magic at least within that room. Without anybody (alive) in the room, Hogwarts (automatically or not) reclaimed the magic that went into making the room, snuffing the fire out as sure as sucking the air out of a room with a fire in.
