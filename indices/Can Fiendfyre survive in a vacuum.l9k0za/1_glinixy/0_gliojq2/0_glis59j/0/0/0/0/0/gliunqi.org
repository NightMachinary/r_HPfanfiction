If it can only destroy the container it wouldn't be considered as a way to destroy Horcruxes ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Fiendfyre][Hermione Granger was aware of this, but never considered the use of it against Voldemort's Horcruxes due to the inherently dangerous, uncontrollable nature of the spell."]]), and the soul becomes a /part/ of the container, the container can't be destroyed without using something that can destroy souls (Kreacher couldn't destroy the Locket, despite having access to many dangerous artifacts as an elf of the Blacks) and if Fiendfyre can't destroy souls then Voldemort wouldn't have died in cannon, as Harry and co. never went back for the Diadem after it was destroyed, because Fiendfyre also destroyed the soul fragment.

Edit: And the Killing Curse rips the soul from the body, but we still see Dumbledore in the Limbo that Harry is sent to after getting AK'ed, but the Killing Curse can also destroy Horcruxes meaning it can also destroy souls, therefore just because a soul is damaged, it doesn't mean that it can't progress to the afterlife, otherwise we would be seeing a lot more Diarymort-Esque spirits created by partial souls that couldn't move on
