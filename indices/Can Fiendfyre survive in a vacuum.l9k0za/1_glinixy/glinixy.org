I would say, no. The Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement expanded rapidly with apparent hunger. I would say that the danger of Fiendfyre is that it rapidly expands, burns everything, and can't be extinguished by normal means. But just like the mindless aggression that sparks it, it always must move on to new targets. Without somewhere to expand, it burns through its fuel and disappears.

So in a vacuum, with nothing to burn, the fiendfyre would disappear.
