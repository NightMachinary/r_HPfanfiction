Harry Potter ruined passivity for me, i.e the protagonist(s) lounging around and wasting time on frivolous bullshit while A DARK WIZARD PLANS TO KILL YOU. Nowdays if I'm watching, for example, a scifi show and I see the gang making heartfelt conversation instead of preparing for the attacking aliens, I just rage.

It's bad writing really. There's a time and a place for filler, if the author is talented enough. Most aren't.

As for your sacrifice point, I personally am stuck in post-GoF & post-OttP fics. I read so much fanfic from 2002 to 2007, that the 6th and 7th books were not meaningful or enjoyable at all. The only things they added for me were plot mechanisms (horcruxes, hallows, w/e). That's why I mostly love gen AU fics.
