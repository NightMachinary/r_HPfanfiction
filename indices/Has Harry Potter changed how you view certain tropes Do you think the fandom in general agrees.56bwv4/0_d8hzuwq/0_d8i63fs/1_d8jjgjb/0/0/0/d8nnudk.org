  Does it also bother you that Harry & co suddenly get strong enough to match Death Eaters? Was there behind the scenes training where Neville got strong enough to match Bellatrix?

Sorry, but I've been tied up with classes for the past few days but I decided to take a quick break and answer this question (a bit shorter lol).

But yeah, the world created is the best part, which is one of the main reasons I read FF. I like the characters and the world, just not the plot.

I'm actually not bothered that Harry and Co can go toe-to-toe with normal Death Eaters. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/4s5h94/harry_potter_movieshow_come_when_wizards_fight/][The top comment in this thread]] basically summarizes why I don't really have a problem with it.

What I have a problem with is Harry and co. being able to fight top level death eaters. Remember that Harry got his ass whooped by Snape at the end of book 6 (and while Snape was a professor, he wasn't the head of Voldemort's troops).

I assume Neville trained with some of the Hogwarts kids, but Voldemort's had years to train his death eaters to fight well (or at least the top command), but the only Death Eaters we hear about that are actually worth it are Barty Crouch (who... I don't want to even go into the 4th book) and Bellatrix Lestrange who gets killed by Molly Weasley.

Yes, the head of Voldemort's armies (and the only Death Eater who is shown to have any real combat skill, Snape aside) gets killed by Molly.

Every single soldier in Voldemort's army was weaker than Molly Weasley.

I hope I'm not the only one who sees something wrong with this picture. How on earth did the aurors not manage to stop the Death Eaters if they're so ass at fighting. The aurors train for years in combat and they can't stop these Death Eaters.

The problem is that JK wanted a climactic scene where Molly kills Bellatrix. And I agree such a scene is a nice story moment. But she sets it up in such a way that it kind of ruins the world a bit. If it was set up differently (Bellatrix injured or weakened, Molly teaming with a few other wizards, Voldemort having other high level fighters) it would've been even better. But the way it is now is just... meh
