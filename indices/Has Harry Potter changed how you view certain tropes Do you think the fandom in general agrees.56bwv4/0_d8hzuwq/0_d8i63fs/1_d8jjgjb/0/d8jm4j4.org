Haha I'll start with recs: tbh I haven't read anything (non-crack) that handles Years 5-7 well. I'll gladly take recs, but a lot of my favorite fics are highly AU or post epilogue.

If you're in the mood for something light, ALMOST A SQUIB is nice (written by the sample person who wrote HARRY THE HUFFLEPUFF). It's short and kinda funny, but Harry has a lot more common sense.

As for why I hate them, I'll tall about my biggest pet peeve of book 7. It's not the characters, it's the entire Gringotts scene. You know the one where the trio breaks into Gringotts.

Let me repeat that. Three 17-year olds (and an ex employee who can't do magic) break into the biggest bank in Wizardig Britain, and one of the most secure places in the entire country.

And worse than that, it's the way they do it too. Remember, Gringotts is considered state of the art security.

Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione wear disguises. (Harry's cloak is considered a disguise because there are ways to detect people inside, so hypothetically Gringots should have anticipated invisibility).

Ron is disguised using random cosmetic charms taught to 16 year olds, and Hermione is using a potion so well known that 12 year olds read about it.

Now this isn't a problem, because Gringotts (like any reasonable bank) Asks for ID, which in the Wizardig world is a wand. And they happen to have Bellatrix's ID. Except for one thing: the goblins know it's fake. Bellatrix's has reported it stolen and using it should lead to their arrest.

Except it doesn't because Harry uses the mind control spell (the imperious curse). On the bank teller, the Death Eater accompanying them, and he even confounds the 2 security guards.

Yes. Harry breaks into a bank by mind controlling the bank staff. In a world where ever single person knows that a mind control spell exists.

What this means is that every single one of Gringott's hundreds of employees looked at Gringott's defenses and no one realized you could just mind control your way through.

Also, in the history of Gringotts, no one has ever thought to break in using it? Ever?

It's totally nonsensical that Harry and co can break into a location that's so secure Voldemort would put a Horcrux there by mind controlling people. Like no one ever saw this coming?

How is Gringots not robbed like every other Tuesday?

EDIt: The ministry scene is also bad (where 3 17-year olds break into the government) but at least they tried planning. Gringotts was just a Hail Mary
