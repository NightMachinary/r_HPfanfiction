  i.e the protagonist(s) lounging around and wasting time on frivolous bullshit while A DARK WIZARD PLANS TO KILL YOU. Nowdays if I'm watching, for example, a scifi show and I see the gang making heartfelt conversation instead of preparing for the attacking aliens, I just rage.

The two situations you are describing are different scenarios. Harry is lounging around for 3 years while Voldemort is trying to take over because he's a 15-17 year old kid. All of the adults are trying to keep him out of the battle, and they refuse to give him special training.

He was just immature and unprepared to shoulder the burden thrust upon him at first, but he wasn't completely idle. In 5th year he did the DA. In 6th year he did lessons with Dumbledore. In 7th year he literally hunted down the last parts of Voldemort soul.

  It's bad writing really. There's a time and a place for filler, if the author is talented enough. Most aren't.

I hope you aren't implying that Harrys passivity in canon was bad writing. His passivity was part of his characterization. It was intentional.

The scenario you are describing where in the middle of a pitched battle, the main character stops what they are doing and hugs their lover or whatever. That IS bad writing, but it's different from what JK did.

Maybe I just misinterpreted what you were referring to in canon. What exactly were you talking about from canon?
