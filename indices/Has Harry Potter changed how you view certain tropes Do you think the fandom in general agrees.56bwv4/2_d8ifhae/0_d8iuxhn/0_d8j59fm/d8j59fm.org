They found a plot on conflict, and they like to tell you that conflict is necessary for the plot - but, necessarily, a conflict that is good for the plot is one that is /good/. Bashing is stupid: it has no grounding in reality, and no place in good literature. In the original books, even /Snape/ was forgiven!
