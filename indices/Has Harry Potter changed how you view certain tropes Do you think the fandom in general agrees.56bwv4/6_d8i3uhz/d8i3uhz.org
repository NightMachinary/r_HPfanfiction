Yes, Magical Britain as described in the Books is a totally fucked up place. Imagine a society that needs saving through sacrifices by child soldiers.

That Ministry needed to be torn down and rebuilt from the scratch. Those who supported Voldemort and his genocidal ideology had to be punished to the fullest extent of their crimes. There would be no more cover ups.
