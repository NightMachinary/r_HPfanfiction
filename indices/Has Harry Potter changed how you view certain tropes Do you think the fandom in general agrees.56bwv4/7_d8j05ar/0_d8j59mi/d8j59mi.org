No, the dumb part is the fact that Harry didn't just choose to move on. He had lost so much during the war, and he had a chance to got to his family, the people that love him, that people that never turned their backs on him when they found out he was a Parselmouth, the people that were by his side through thick and thin. Instead he goes back to an unhappy life, with two annoying sidekicks, and a girl who only likes him because he is the boy who lived.
