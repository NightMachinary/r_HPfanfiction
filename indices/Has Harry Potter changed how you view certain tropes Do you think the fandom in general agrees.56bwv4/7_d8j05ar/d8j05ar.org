  Seeing him walk to his death did not fill me with awe, it did not inspire me as it usually did. Instead it filled me with dread, this constant in my life was choosing to die.

I was so insanely pissed about the rest of book 7 by the time it reached that point that I had absolutely no emotional response to anything that happened towards the end there. I wasn't even sad that Fred died.

  flat out call the sacrifice dumb.

The fact that you had such a strong emotional response just goes to show how much the character meant to you. I don't see how that translates to dumb. The dumb part is that he talks to Dumbledore in the afterlife and comes back to life.
