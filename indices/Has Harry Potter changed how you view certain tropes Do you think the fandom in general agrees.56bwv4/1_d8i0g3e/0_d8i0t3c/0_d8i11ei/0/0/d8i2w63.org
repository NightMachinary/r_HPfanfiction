This is ridiculous. It is such a common thing in these 'manipulative!dumbledore' fics that he sent Harry to the Durselys to become 'meek and pliable' but Harry isn't that. He was never that. Harry is fundamentally a good person. That is why he went looking for Hermione to warn her about the troll, thats why he jumped into the tube of death to help Ginny, thats why he was willing to die to end the war and save the lives of the people he loves. Dumbledore said that love was the power Voldemort knew not, and he was clearly correct.

I understand the motivation for people having a poor understanding of Dumbledore. JK mostly used him as a plot device and so some of his behavior is conflicted but we never see him as anything but a good person, and if his only goal was for Harry to die so Voldemort could than Dumbledore would've just smothered Harry in his sleep and saved everyone a lot of trouble.
