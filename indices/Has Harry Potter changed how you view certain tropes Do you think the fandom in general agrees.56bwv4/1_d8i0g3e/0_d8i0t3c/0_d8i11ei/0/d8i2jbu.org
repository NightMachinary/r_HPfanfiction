I always felt that a big part of it was the Dursley treatment; Harry was always told he was worthless and a burden. Therefore the consideration of sacrifising his life must have been made easier by the probability that he placed less value on his own life, compared to the life (or lives) of his loved ones.

All of which points to Dumbledore being a sneaky motherfucker and altogether a lot more ruthless than his portrayal in the previous books.
