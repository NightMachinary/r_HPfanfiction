What is legitimately bad with a super wand? I never understood why people disliked it, I mean Percy Jackson didn't get a sword like everyone else, he got a sword made of steel that can kill gods, while already having the power to manipulate any liquid. I think people just hate seeing Harry as a powerful MC because no one has managed to do it right, some people get the out-layer, but then ruin it with needless dialogue.
