A Superwand can actually help Harry in many ways. It isn't the fact that it just shows he is special, it shows that his magical power can only be channeled through a very powerful catalyst. The brother wand to the dark lord means nothing, it honestly doesn't. It was just a way for JKR to get herself out of a tight spot, instead of actually writing a character that can think for himself.

The thing I hate the most, however, is that Holly and Phoenix doesn't even fit Harry in the books. JKR stated herself that he is no saint, and he is willing to get his hands dirty, so why does he have a wood that represents purity? Sure he managed a Patronus, but so did most of the other people in the DA. Holly and Phoenix is how the public sees Harry, it's how Dumbledore sees Harry, but it isn't how Harry is, the wand doesn't make sense. If Harry is gonna be OOC, he is getting a different wand, that is how it works.
