That's because you're looking at it from a close-minded standpoint. Don't look at it as a way to power him up, look at it as a way to build his character. You could always give him one really OP wood and one really OP core. But the reason others give him multiples, is simply because they are trying to demonstrate how complex he is personality wise. To them, it shows how twisted he has become from the years of abuse, to them it shows that his personality change was monumental, it isn't just a way to flex power, it is a way to show what kind of character he is. Why should he get the same wand as everyone else? If he has godlike power, you obviously need a godlike wand to handle it. If he is destined from multiple forms of magical mastery, that too can me more cores, after all, usually, the wand chooses the correct wizard, for the correct reason. James got a wand that was good at transfiguration, his destiny lied in that subject, he needed to become an animagus, he needed to teach the rest of the gang how to do it as well. But Harry simply getting a wand that is "Good at defense, or decent at charms" is a complete outrage, Voldemort has the same core and he gets "Very Powerful Wand". You can give Harry a simple wand in the beginning, but it should progress, it should evolve, along with him, his character, his power. The one thing I hate about super-wand fics is that he gets the wand from Ollivander. Typically, super-wand fics give Harry about twenty or so heirships, and always one with the Peverell line. So why wouldn't he be able to find a powerful wand in the world's greatest wand maker's vault (Antioch was said to have made the Elder Wand, doubt that that was just a fluke of luck)? I'm sure he didn't just make one wand and stop at that.
