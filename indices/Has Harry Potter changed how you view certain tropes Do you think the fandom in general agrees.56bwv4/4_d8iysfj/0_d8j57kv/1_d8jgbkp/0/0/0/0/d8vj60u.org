While I do agree the Holly wand doesn't suit him, and really the only reason he does get it is the whole brother wand bit, I still don't find that adequate justification or a super wand. As I mentioned, even the elder wand was just that. I personally don't mind wands with unique cores, like basilisk venom, but I think that a wand is more than just the amount of powerful components. It's the combination of them, and the synergy they share with the wielder. I just don't see a need for any wand in the series, no matter who it's for, to have more than one wood and one core.
