I think the bigger issue with Super Wand fics is the idea itself. While Harry having a different wand isn't a bad thing, a super wand just doesn't fit into the world. Even the Elder wand was just that. A wand made of elder with an unknown core.

Also, personally I see a super wand, along with a few other tropes, as the author's way of saying "LOOK!!! LOOK HOW SPECIAL HARRY IS!!" When we already know he's special. He has the brother wand to the Dark Lord.

Speaking of which, that brought me to when people give him these crazy wand ideas when Harry isn't even important in their plot, or give super wands to other characters.... Like seriously, what's wrong with a normal wan for crying out loud.
