So would you read a fic, where, Harry's wand is only as powerful as he is knowledgeable or skillful or powerful in himself? But what you just said can apply to any wizard, in reality. Was James Potter really that good at transfiguration? Or was it just the fact that his wand was meant for it? What about Dumbledore? Would he have been able to take on Voldemort in the ministry without the Elder Wand to aid him? It's a pretty one-dimensional argument when you think about it, people don't want it to be Harry either. When a powerful Harry story appears people bash it to all hell just because he is powerful.

Harry still needs knowledge and power, even with a super wand. If he didn't have the magic, his wand wouldn't be able to shoot sparks or even choose him. If he didn't have the knowledge or skill, how come in most Super Wand fics he is knowledgeable and is trained? People just want an excuse for why canon Harry is perfect the way he is, they don't want him powerful or intelligent, they want him naive, that way they can look at the world with the same magic it has always had for them. Super Wands aren't really the problem, the writing, however, is. Can't tell you how many times I've seen grammatical errors in Super Wand fics, it's disgusting.
