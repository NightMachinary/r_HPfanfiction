The sucky thing about the concept of Super Wands is that it removes the ability of the user especially in Fanfiction.

Instead of Harry or even any other Main Character working to understand the magic they wield (which was a complaint about how Harry is Lazy) it's easy breezy, the Wand is so perfect and powerful and great it shoots Stunners twice as powerful as any other wand because /It isn't Harry, it's the Wand/

The non connection between Percy's Sword and Harry's mega wand is that Percy still needs the skill and ability to slay said god, the Sword doesn't Stab and Slash for him, nor does it make his stabs and slashes any more powerful or efficient. Harry's Super Wand does that 99% of the time
