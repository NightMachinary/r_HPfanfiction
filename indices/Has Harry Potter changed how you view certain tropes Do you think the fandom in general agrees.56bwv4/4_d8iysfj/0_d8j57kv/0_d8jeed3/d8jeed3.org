Who brought up Percy Jackson? It's an unfit comparison. Percy is already special because he's one of the big threes son. And he's not the only person with a special weapon and honestly it's not that special. If you mentioned Magnus Chase I would agree that's a bullishit weapon but then again those stories are about demigods who fight off the ends of the world. Harry Potter is about fighting off one madman that threatens a nation.
