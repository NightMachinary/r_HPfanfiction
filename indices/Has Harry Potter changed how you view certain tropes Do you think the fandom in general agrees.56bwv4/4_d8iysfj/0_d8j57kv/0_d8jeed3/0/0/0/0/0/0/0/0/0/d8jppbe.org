I'm commenting on your characterization of a super weapon. You assume it's something that instantaneously obliterates opponents with one spell, but in reality, a mega wand can just be a wand that can /become/ OP but takes time, training, knowledge, skill, power, etc.. You don't just pick up a wand and randomly know every spell, no matter how powerful a stunner you pull off, it wouldn't matter against a shield made of water. Percy's sword is arguably more powerful than any Super Wand, as most people don't make it so that the wand appears back in their pocket after being lost, or can be hidden in the form of a pen. It's solid if you know how to do it. Although I doubt you know good fanfiction, as you cannot even spell trope correctly, but I digress.
