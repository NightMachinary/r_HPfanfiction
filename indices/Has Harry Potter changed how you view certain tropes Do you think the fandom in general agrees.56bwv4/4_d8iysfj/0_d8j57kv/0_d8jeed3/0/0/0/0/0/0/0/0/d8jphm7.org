If you don't view a mega wand as a super weapon why did you compare it to Percy's Sword?

It doesnt work because the two series have different power levels. You are saying it works in one setting where they literally battle legends so it can work in harry potter. I guess it can be done 1/100 times but that doesn't mean it works. It's a bad troupe.
