You are putting words in my mouth. I haven't defined what a super weapon is or what a mega wand is besides the op's statement of 7 cores and 20 woods.

Then you use my lack of spelling to say I don't read good fiction. It doesn't add anything to the argument and is rather rude.

This is where the conversation ends because I refuse to keep this going.
