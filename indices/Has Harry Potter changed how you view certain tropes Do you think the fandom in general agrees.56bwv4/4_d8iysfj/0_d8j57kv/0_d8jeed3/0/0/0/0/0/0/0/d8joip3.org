How do you view a Mega Wand as a Super Weapon? All I said was that the character in one story, managed to have a pretty powerful sword, and the writing didn't falter. That is honestly the only argument against having a mega wand IMO, but if they manage to write it correctly there are no pitfalls, you can hate bad writing, but you can't hate on a solid trope.
