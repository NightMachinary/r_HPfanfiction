Percy and Harry are pretty similar in the end, their stories are similar, their appearance, I wouldn't have been surprised if Harry started using water magic if he found out that Voldemort used fire.

Voldemort would have most likely conquered everything, he isn't the type that dreams small. Percy is special, sure, but Harry is the "chosen one" no? He is a wizard, which in itself is pretty special, as they are beings who can pretty much bend reality to their whim if they are well trained. But like I said, people are afraid of a powerful MC, I'm comparing the both of them because in the end, Percy got the Curse of Achilles which made him practically invincible, and we still got a better ending than DH with that.
