In just straight up Harry Potter Fics

-Harry gets super wand that has 7 cores and 20 woods, because Brother Wands don't make sense to me and isn't special enough

-The Death Eaters weren't wrong, just misguided especially Draco and Lucius, but not Peter.

-Harry hears slightly shocking thing and faints, he doesn't argue or ask questions because that means writing important dialogue no he needs to faint.

Crossover Fiction featuring Harry or others from any fandom

-Harry is X's Brother (or sister in Fem!Harry Fics), although if he was Harry wouldn't fit any facet of the Prophecy which they all use to have Dumbledore kidnap Baby Harry away from that family, or even worse Dumbledore dumps a Potter who's existence would make Harry's Sacrifice even easier to protect his sibling.

-Everyone is Magic and going to Hogwarts despite it being impossible to explain how people go years without being known as a Wizard past their 11 birthday AND for some reason are now going to Hogwarts despite almost all living in the States.

-Harry feels afraid of a basic human threatening him over gurting their sister/brother/friend.

-The Over abundance of Slash Fic's in Crossovers. I would bet 10 Bucks the most common crossovers between Harry and another Fandom, like Harry Potter/Avengers, Harry/BtVS, Harry/Twilight. Every Page will hold at least 5 stories Harry in a Slash Relationship, or Harry in a Gen fic with Slash Undertones
