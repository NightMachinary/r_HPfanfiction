My view on the Arthurian legend being missing was that the pure bloods would never acknowledge it, Arthur was a muggle and therefore inconsequential. Throughout the series even those purebloods who fight for muggle rights are condescending towards muggle advances and lifestyles, thus the culture of the nation just ignored Arthur until he disappeared from the history.
