Ive mused off and on about a Harry who takes the easiest path after Hogwarts and joins the league only to find the team politics and backbiting of sponsorship even more dangerous than a dark lord hunting him. And now i imagine it with him courting the hottest singer in their Culture, Sophitia Ellington-Baxtorite, a singer who just left her band to strike it on her own after her band imploded due to their sudden fame post hogwarts.
