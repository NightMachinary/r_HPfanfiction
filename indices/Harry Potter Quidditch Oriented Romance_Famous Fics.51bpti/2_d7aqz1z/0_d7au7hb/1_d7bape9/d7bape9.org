Harry is a Quidditch player in Vitam Paramus. In fact, it's pretty much exactly what you asked for in the OP. Just don't expect very detailed Quidditch games. They are mentioned, some even in detail but mostly it's a fic about Harry's life, about how he deals with his fame after the war and about what kind of person he is and wants to be.

It also focuses quite a bit on Gabrielle but the romance is very, very slow moving. I probably would have liked the fic even better if it wasn't Harry/Gabby and they had a brother/sister relationship but it's still decent.
