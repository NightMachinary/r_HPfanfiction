I remember a few details in this fanfic - The story is dropped - The entire school (roughly) support each other to make the attempt - A banner read "Help us" was used, support by firework (courtesy of the Weasley twin) - Headmaster Dumbledore was able to shut them down, but not before the message got to the Hogemead village - Aurors were called to the school, and as they say "shit hit the fan"
