I have no idea if it's because the author gave up or not but it does end kind of suddenly and in a convenient fashion. I will say that the premise of the fic is that the ministry passes a law that forces people to marry and have kids, and that's handled a lot better than I expected, so convenient and rushed ending, it's not a bad fic.
