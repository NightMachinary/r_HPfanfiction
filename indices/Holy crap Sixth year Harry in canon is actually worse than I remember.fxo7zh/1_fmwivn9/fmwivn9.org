Every teenager (me included, when I was that age) is stupid. Give yourself a nice evening, rent (or find on Netflix or whatever people do these days) “Romeo and Juliet” (1968 version by Franco Zeffirelli with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey), and then tell me they were not stupid. Of course, they were.
