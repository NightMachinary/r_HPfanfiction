During my most recent reread of the 5th book, all I could think of after Harry get's the vision of Sirius being tortured was "Damn Harry you are stupid! Listen to Hermione and the other members of the DA goddamnit! Stupid fucking Gryffindor! Rushing into things again..."

But I think J.K. really portrayed the way teenagers act really well. Just when you are older you look at it from a different pov. and think, damn these kids are stupid. Even Malfoy has more of a grip of the actual situation than Harry during the 6th book. Ok tbh, it's hard not to if you literally have to assassinate you headmaster who is very capable.
