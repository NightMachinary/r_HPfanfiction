Well to be fair, Naruto wanted to be acknowledged as a human being as a child. People respect the Hokage, therefore if you become the Hokage you get that respect (it's actually the other way around, but that's probably what a child would think).

Naruto also got some positive treatment from the Hokage as a child. He was probably the first to treat him nicely (I don't know quite when the Ichiraku people came in, but I believe they were a little bit later, as well as Iruka not warming up to Naruto until his final years and not really believing in his dream until he graduates). Also, Naruto's one of the only people who don't call him his formal title, so that probably has something to do with it.

Anyways, positive enforcement from literally the only person who likes you kind of makes you aspire to be like them, especially if they have a job where people have to respect them.

So, yeah, this would make sense if it happened to Harry. It would put him on the right path (I assume you have to work hard to become the Headmaster of one of the top magic schools) by giving him a non-destructive goal.

Would like to see this someday.
