Harry had only seen Uncle Albus angry one time, which was when he was five years old and he'd found out that Harry'd slept in the cupboard. It was apocalyptic - the walls shook, the lights flickered, and Aunt Petunia's ugly photo of Dudley fell to the floor and shattered. But it was /awesome/. Harry didn't really remember what he'd said, but Albus' voice was like thunder during a lightning storm, and from that day onward, Harry had had his own room.

--------------

As he got older, Harry began noticing strange things. Toys would fly into his hand when he'd wanted them, he'd bounce off the floor after tripping on the stairs, and one time it felt like he'd been carried over a river by a gust of wind.

When he'd told Aunt Petunia of these strange things, she got white in the face, looked very, very mad and stalked off. The next time Albus visited, he sat him down and told him of Magic.

"Harry, you're a wizard, like me. What this means is that you, your very being, is infused with a very, very powerful force. Take care not to misuse it."

And he'd handed over two books - /Your Magick and You, a Young Wizard's Guide/ as well as /Simple Spells for Simple Minds/. Harry read those two books like none he'd ever read before.

--------------

On his 11th birthday, Albus visited as he always did, but alongside the customary gift of a book on magic, he also brought a letter.

"Hogwarts is my school, you see. I'm her headmaster."

Albus was the coolest person Harry'd ever known.

--------------

In his first year, Harry tried very, very hard, and he got second place in the end-of-year exams. There was some sort of disturbance in the forbidden corridor, but after Albus'd said not to go there, he hadn't gone there.

Well, maybe once, but only to see the cerberus, which was almost as awesome as Albus was.

--------------

In second year, he managed to just eke out first place, as well as a place in the quidditch team. Flitwick was overjoyed to have him as the seeker.

There'd been an accident with the youngest Weasley, but apart from a two-week hospital stay, she didn't remember anything.

--------------

In third year, he scored third, but only because of the ongoing trial of Sirius Black. Earlier that year, the man had broken out of prison, and immediately gone to Dumbledore to plead his case. Believing him for the moment, Albus had scouted out Sirius' trial, only to realize there hadn't been one, like he'd been told.

The court battle was bloody, as the judge had to be replaced twice when it was discovered they'd accepted bribe money.

--------------

In fourth year, Harry was exempt from exams. He was entered into the Tournament against his will, becoming the third champion despite not being of age. He had help with his housemates, who banded together after he'd told them he'd win, but also wanted to find out who had entered him.

The first task he beat by encasing the Dragon's feet, wing joints and maw in ice, which held just enough for him to run and grab the egg. while the Dragon melted the enchanted ice from within.

The second task he beat by enchanting his shawl to electrolyze water, though he'd needed a potion to help him recover from the oxygen poisoning he'd accidentally given himself.

The third task he beat by blasting anything that moved through the walls. In the end, the cup was a portkey that brought him stumbling onto the victory platform, followed only minutes later by Fleur and then Victor.

They never did figure out who had entered him, but Albus guessed that it was probably an older student. Out of adoration or hatred he couldn't guess.

--------------

Harry went a little crazy for his OWLs. Midway through the year, Sirius was finally exonerated, and promptly rented Mrs. Figg's house, which she gladly gave up to move into the country once more, like she had before.

Harry'd gotten almost straight O's, something which Albus was obviously very proud of - as was Sirus, but he tried to mask it behind a bit of bravado.

--------------

Sixth year was relatively quiet, and Harry once again placed top of his class. Albus was gone a lot of the time, taking along Sirius and his friend Remus - and though those two kept Harry up-to-date, they omitted the details of their activities as "dark, and not something a kid should think about" despite Harry's continuous prodding.

--------------

In seventh year, Harry gained his first grey hair while studying for the NEWTs. The apparition test however was one of the highlights, and when he'd found that Hogwarts allowed him to apparate short distances within itself, though not past the barrier marking the grounds, he didn't tell anyone.

Instead, Harry practiced night after night, apparating from one end of the room to the next, apparating with a wand and without a wand, apparating based on the Marauder's map, a map of britain and finally a map of europe.

He was only found out when Albus raised both eyebrows all the way to his hairline upon spotting Harry with a genuine italian ice-cream as Harry was returning to the front gate.

After a quick admonishment not to practice such dangerous magic alone, Albus transfigured a piece of wood into an identical ice-cream and walked away.

Harry only realized he'd also performed a switching spell when he bit into said piece of wood.

--------------

After his NEWTs, of which he'd gotten all he wanted, Harry took on an apprenticeship with the retired Auror Moody, who'd gained his mastery of Defense before he switched to becoming an Auror.

Despite Moody's repeated hints that he'd "make a good auror, lad", Harry was sure that's not what he wanted.

So upon completing his own mastery, he bid Moody farewell, who muttered something about "wasted talent", and returned to Hogwarts.

--------------

When Albus saw Harry, who'd changed a lot since his NEWTs, he was briefly reminded of another applicant to the post of Professor, some years ago.

However, this time, the applicant was accepted, and Harry became Professor Potter.

Though his first act was to break down a wall and transfigure a door out of existence to create a much-needed expansion to the DADA classroom, his first tenure was generally positive.

--------------

Professor Potter was a hit. Even though his fame had faded much since his own school years, the kids in his classes looked at him in reverence.

That is, until he had them start a physical fitness routine.

The seventh-years, who'd been first-years when Harry'd been a seventh-year, remembered him from their own first year and told the other students that he'd always demanded the best of them, even back when he was still a prefect.

--------------

Towards the end of that year, Harry was often seen stolling through the school, his mind on the DADA Curse. He'd not felt its effects yet, but he was sure it would come for him eventually.

Having at least a passing familiarity with curse-breaking, he knew what every other curse-breaker had told the Headmaster: It was anchored somewhere, on something. However, that object could be anything.

It was undeniable that the curse was set by Voldemort, which, knowing the man's fixations, made it likely that the curse was affixed to an object of immense value. Though none of the relics displayed within the school exhibited the common signs of being cursed (a dark feeling, deeper shadows, a smell of rust, rot or mold in the surrounding area, a feeling of hopelessness; He recited in his head).

During his wandering the empty school, and instructing a house-elf that had taken to him to apparate any wayward students found out of bed into said beds, he walked through the same corridor thrice, still wondering about Voldemort's curse.

On the fourth time, he came out of his thoughts and suspiciously beheld the door that had suddenly appeared in the previously empty corridor.

Moody shouting /"Constant Vigilance"/ while dropping from the ceiling or appearing from inside the shower (or jumping out of a trash can, or waiting behind an open door) in mind, he drew his wand and advanced on the door.

Inside was a small chamber with pedestals. Each pedestal held an object he recognized, either from his own research or the stone-boring history lessons, and each was cursed beyond belief.

It took only a few minutes for his devoted elf to wake the faculty and get those roaming the corridors to join him, while he beheld the utter darkness of the magic within the room he'd discovered.

Albus had a dark look on his face as he peered into the room.

--------------

Uncursing the artifacts was deemed possible, but took a long time. Various experts were brought in, but even then three of the objects were deemed irrecoverable. Among them was Ravenclaw's diadem, to Flitwick's sorrow, which was the most cursed of the bunch.

According to the lead cursebreaker, the diadem held seven separate curses. One to wither the flesh of any who touched it beside those marked by the curser, one a dark compulsion to put it on, one to suck the mind from a head and store it within the central gem, one to copy something from within the crown into the now empty head, one to siphon magic from any objects nearby, one to bind something inside the gem in place and one so dark their methods couldn't divine what it actually did, beside cause a cloud of almost visible darkness to emanate from the diadem.

Destroying them, he'd said, was relatively difficult. Only dragonfire could destroy the other ones, but the diadem needed fiendfyre or worse to even affect it.

The diadem was unceremoniously consumed by a spark of fiendfyre conjured by Dumbledore right then and there.
