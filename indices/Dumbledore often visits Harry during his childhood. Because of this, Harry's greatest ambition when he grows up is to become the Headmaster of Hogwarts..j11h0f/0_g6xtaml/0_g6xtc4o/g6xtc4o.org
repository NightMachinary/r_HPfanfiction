Harry remained Professor, proving that one of the cursed objects in that room had been the anchor for the Defense curse.

He stayed teaching for a decade with minimal issues, refining his skills evermore - he could now apparate to almost any point of the hemisphere centered on him, meaning he enjoyed spending his weekends in Egypt or Iceland. He'd continued working on his defense skills, and had some years ago discovered the fabled chamber of secrets.

Inside was empty, but he'd seen a collapsed exitway that led to the mountains once it was cleared, and assumed that whatever had been inside was long gone.

Eventually, he came across the still-forbidden corridor on the third floor. It'd stayed as such for close to 30 years now, and he was feeling flippant.

The cerberus had been exchanged for a chimera, which was a surprise, but a conjured chewtoy for the lion part was enough to get it to play in the corner.

Below, he battled a thorny constrictor, a relative to the devil's snare only carnivorous and toxic, then he leapt over a ten foot canyon, played a deadly game of chess where the other pieces didn't follow the rules, battled a large steel golem and braved a spark of the eternal flame.

In the final chamber, he came upon a mirror, and the floor around said mirror, which was covered in arcane glyphs and runes, all forming a mighty shield.

Worryingly, the shield was not pointed outwards - it was configured to keep something /in/.

The mirror was cloudy, roiling, and occasionally, deep red eyes were visible, following Harry as he circled it.

Then, as one, the mirror rattled and a fist made of smoke hit the glass from the inside, only for the shield to spring to life and send a lance of light into thing in the mirror, which gave a distorted shriek.

Instead of the previous roiling, the mirror's cloudy surface instead stilled, and began whispering. Foolishly, Harry crept forward, but the voice stayed out of reach.

Taking one more step, he felt a force seize his movements, and realized to his horror that he'd crossed the outer line of the shield, which was now working to keep him in.

Against his wishes, he was drawn to the mirror, and the whispers inside descended into a dark, mocking laughter, before condensing into a voice once more.

/"what a fool you are."/ said the voice, and the smoke inside the mirror formed a hand, bending the glass outward like water and grabbing Harry around the throat before pulling him in.

--------------

The inside of the mirror was filled with smoke, and as he looked back, he could see the glass surface floating in midair.

All around himself, he could hear the voice whispering to him.

/"fool"/ it said again and struck out, forming a spike that drove into his forehead.

The pain was unimaginable, and he became aware of thoughts not his own, an incredible hatred for himself. He still had the presence of mind to raise his wand, focus his own memories, and say /"Expecto Patronum"/ while jabbing the wand into his scar.

The patronus charm manifested, but not in the real world - in this twisted reality of the mirror, it entered into his thoughts, his mind, and began burning like the sun within his head.

The dark invader shrieked, fought and eventually pleaded, but his entirety was eventually burned away.

Harry fell towards the glassen surface, broke through and landed in a heap on the floor, the shield spell and mirror shards sizzling all around him.

--------------

When he came to, Albus was holding vigil by his bed.

"You've done it. Not how I expected it would go, but you did it nonetheless." was all he said.

When Harry asked what he meant, Albus proceeded to explain about a Prophecy, Lord Voldemort, and the Horcrux within his head - how he'd planned to contain the shade of Voldemort within a mirror until Harry died a natural death, upon which time it would simply vanish from existence, the last Horcrux apart from Harry having been destroyed a long time ago.

Harry understood then that he, Sirius and Remus had hunted Voldemort's other Horcruxes those ten years ago.

--------------

Once he was recovered, Harry got back to teaching, and remained the defense teacher for another decade, until Albus eventually retired. Minerva succeeded him, and Harry took the deputy headmaster post, but stayed Defense professor.

When Minerva eventually said she'd had enough of being headmaster and wanted to get back to teaching, Harry found himself as the obvious choice.

And so, Professor Potter became Headmaster Potter. Not the first, as one of his distant ancestors had been headmaster once before, but one of the youngest Headmasters for Hogwarts at the age of fourty-six. He would remain Headmaster for 139 years.
