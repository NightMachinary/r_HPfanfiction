Most writers think they can't write at least some of the time. It's normal. We get stuck in a bubble of looking at our own work - which we know backwards - and not being able to see it the way a reader going in blind would see it.

The only way to get better at it is to write. If you've got a fic you think is terrible, take a step away from it and write something else. Anything else. A description of the room you're in, a limerick about the man on the bus...anything.

After a day or two, when your brain has had a chance to rest and look at something else, you go back to it.
