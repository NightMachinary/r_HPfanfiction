I've had the same problem for at least twenty years. It's /that/ common.

Most writers spend at least some time convinced they should just stop because they're no good. I've had one story - not a fanfic, an original novel - that I've been working on for over a decade, and scrapped after several hundred pages (I began again from the start after about six months break) because what I had wasn't what I wanted.

The only way to work through it is to write anyway. Even if it's strictly private and you never show it to anyone or publish it anywhere, even if it's just exercises to see if you can mimic the style of authors you like to read.
