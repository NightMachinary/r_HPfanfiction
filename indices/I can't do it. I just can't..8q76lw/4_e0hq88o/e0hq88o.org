  "Nobody tells people who are beginners --- and I really wish somebody had told this to me --- is that all of us who do creative work ... we get into it because we have good taste.

  "But it's like there's a gap, that for the first couple years that you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good, OK? It's not that great. It's really not that great. It's trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it's not quite that good.

  "But your taste --- the thing that got you into the game --- your taste is still killer, and your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you, you know what I mean?

  "A lot of people never get past that phase. A lot of people at that point, they quit. And the thing I would just like say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work, they went through a phase of years where they had really good taste and they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be --- they knew it fell short, it didn't have the special thing that we wanted it to have.

  "And the thing I would say to you is everybody goes through that. And for you to go through it, if you're going through it right now, if you're just getting out of that phase --- you gotta know it's totally normal.

  "And the most important possible thing you can do is do a lot of work --- do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week, or every month, you know you're going to finish one story. Because it's only by actually going through a volume of work that you are actually going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions. It takes a while, it's gonna take you a while --- it's normal to take a while. And you just have to fight your way through that, okay?"

-[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ezU57J8YI][Ira Glass, Interview with Current TV, on Story Telling]]. I'm not sure where in the 4 part YouTube videos this quote comes in, but you should watch the entirety regardless.

Your title scared the pants off of me, by the way.

I've been fighting this same battle with myself for 15 years. There are [[https://examinedexistence.com/the-four-states-of-competence-explained/][stages of competence]], and for those of us who are in the creative game for the long haul, slogging through the gap between conscious incompetence to conscious competence is one of the hardest things we will ever do.

The only way to greatness is through. You can't go around. You can't go over, you can't go back, you can't go under, and you can't stand still. You have to slog through the bad. You have to face your terrible writing, knowing that the story that burns in your chest barely warms the page in its current iteration. You have to cringe over bad cliches, suffer your weak plotlines, carry your flat characters on your back. You have to face the pain of it. You have to you have to you have to...

Because your only other option is standing still, right where you are. You have this good taste and this story to tell and nobody in the world who can tell it the way that you one day will be able to. Right now, not even you can. If you stand still for a day, or a year, or twenty, the story still won't be written, not the way you could have done.

If you stand still for a day, or a year, or twenty, your taste will still be there, waiting for your story to be written /just so/.

And you'll have wasted twenty years not bridging that gap.

So then the question is, how do you face it?

Words on a page. You /have/ to write it anyway. Write it badly, write it verbosely, write run-ons, write walls of text or pages of dialogue, write bad accents, write crappy plotlines, write whiny, argumentative, cliched, asshole characters.

And then write them again. Print your work, take a red pen to it, scrap everything but the second sentence on the fourth page and the middle name of your asshole character.

Write and write and write and write. Use a white font on a white background so that you can't edit what you've written until you're done. Set a goal and put a word counter at the bottom of the page, then write double that number. Write every day, even if all you can think to write is what you ate that day and how annoying you find your roommate. Write about the bright eyed girl you saw on the train or the momentary fear you had of the hooded stranger hanging by the ATM. Write about the sun that shines through the window when you work only to fade to rain as soon as lunchtime comes. Write about your feelings, write about your favorite characters, write about the mundane and the simple and the joyous. Write write write write write.

This post cried for help, but despite your words, you're not really looking for someone to write your story for you. Don't run from this any more. Run towards, no, write towards the crap pile. From the smelliest dung comes the strongest trees.

You can do this. You need to do this. Will you?
