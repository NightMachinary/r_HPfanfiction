  So my proposal is that I provide the major ideas a beta and other things while someone else writes.

What you're talking about is a commission and, fanfiction or not, nobody is going to do it without being paid. So if you're going that route, I hope you have money to spare.

#+begin_quote
  I've tried and tried, over and over and over again but I can't write. At least not to my own standards.
#+end_quote

So don't write to your own standards. Don't /have/ standards. Standards get in the way when you're starting out. Standards are for people who get paid and for people who do the paying. You doing neither, unless you're going for said commission. All that matters when you're an amateur writer *is that you write and that you finish what you write*.

Once you've finished what you wrote, you can edit it, and trust me, editing is so very much easier than writing off the top of your head (which isn't to say it's easy, just easier). When you spill your brain out onto paper/the screen, you've got nothing to compare it against. When you edit, there is actually something there for you to look at and say "Hey! That's not correct!" And then you work at it until it's correct.

The thing to keep in mind is that this is your *rough draft*; It's right there in the name: Rough. It's SUPPOSED to be shit. It's SUPPOSED to be that thing you vomit up after you get plot bunny indigestion. Everything high quality that is published has had someone edit-mop the living shit out of it before they even dared show it to other people.

So yes, your writing is shit. My writing is shit too. In fact, I bet my writing is more shit than yours. If you want, we can compare writings (after I transfer it to google docs, its in my paper notebook right now) and I can show you the kind of crap I spew out just so I can get it out of my brain.
