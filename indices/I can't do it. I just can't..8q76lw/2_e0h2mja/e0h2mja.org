Are you also a perfectionist? I struggle to write simply because I consistently re-write everything I've written because I find myself disliking it as it's not 'perfect'. I haven't found much of a solution only to recognise that sometimes writing 'just ok' for a first draft is a good idea-and then slowly editing it over time. I'm still struggling to ever finish anything but I recently wrote more than I have ever written which I think is in of itself progress.

I have thought about doing the same however-being a beta on writing. But I know anytime I get handed something to edit I go through the same process (re-writing it over and over again).
