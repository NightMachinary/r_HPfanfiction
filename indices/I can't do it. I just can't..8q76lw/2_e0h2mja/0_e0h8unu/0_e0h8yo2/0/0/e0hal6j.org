I have written extensive notes on a lot of my stories-it is very frustrating that I can't quite put them into words.

Perhaps write a simple story with the character? Maybe a scene that you would have planned that has a resolution and a beginning (so you can feel you have accomplished something).

I think you might find some takers but you'll likely never be quite as happy as if you wrote it yourself.
