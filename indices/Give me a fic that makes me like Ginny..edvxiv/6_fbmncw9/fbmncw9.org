I really loved The Amplitude, frequency and the resistance of the souls bond by Council. It's not your typical soul bond fic where they immediately love each other or get super powerful quickly. About 20% of the book pretty much consists of funny and interesting dialogue between Harry and ginny (because they can hear each other's thoughts)
