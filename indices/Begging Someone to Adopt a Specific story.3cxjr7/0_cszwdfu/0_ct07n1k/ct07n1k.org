We find out that PNRP members have been massacred. This is a mystery, as we don't know who did it. Neville plans to sabotage the Greengrass party by blackmailing Harry.

Meanwhile, Harry finds some inconsistencies in the bodies he's examining. He speculates the PNRP bodies might have been dead for up to two weeks before the "massacre" and these might be polyjuiced fakes. He discards this idea as unrealistic, and the mystery continues.

Hannah reveals to Harry that Hermione is staunchly with Neville and is also sabotaging their relationship.

Harry, for reasons he can't yet understand, always looses control of himself near Daphne.

  Why did Harry get pushed backwards? I think Hannah did it on purpose but she loves him?!?!?

In that scene, Harry very nearly raped Hannah. He was oblivious to her protests, and did not care to pay attention to her.

Then, he succumbs to Daphne when he gets back to the Ministry. Yet another mystery brews - why would Harry act like this after demonstrating great care for Hannah earlier?

**** *In the 7th chapter:*

     :END:
Neville sabotages the Greengrass party's speech with arrests, using Harry's information from the previous chapter. Hermione is acting weird, frighteningly mindlessly subservient to Neville. We find out she's Neville's wife.

Daphne sends Harry a note asking for immediate help. Harry rushes to her. A mysterious organization - the Knights of Walpurgis - attack. One of them shoots a killing curse at Harry - Harry grabs the arm of the Knight right before it strikes, and the curse seems to bounce to the Knight instead, returning magic to Harry - possibly removing it from the Knight to do so. Harry can pull off some awesome, powerful magic now. He kills the rest of the knights and seems to be multiple orders of magnitude more capable than anyone else we've seen so far.

We find Daphne knows legellimency. It's almost obvious by this point that she's influenced Harry's thoughts at one point or another - perhaps accounting for his impulsiveness for her.

*In canon*, Knights of Walpurgis were an organization renamed to Death Eaters in 1970. A great fic that expands on this is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][Master Slytherin's What Lies Beneath]].
