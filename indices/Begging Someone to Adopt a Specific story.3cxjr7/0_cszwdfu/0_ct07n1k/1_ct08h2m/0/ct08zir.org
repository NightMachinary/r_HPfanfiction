She does - because the /real/ Dr. Potter abused her trust. If you look through the earlier part of the fic, the actual Dr. Potter slept with other women and was a general asshole to Hannah. And in this specific scene, it's very obviously rape - Hannah doesn't want to do anything, but Harry forces himself upon her.

The story is great, but the plot seems very tightly woven.

There's too many subplots, mysteries, and more for any other writer to effectively pick up on them and figure out what to do with them.
