Where is it implied daphne knows it? I couldn't read between the lines. This is amazing though although I don't understand why Hannah would react that way. I feel as if she wanted to be closer to him? I'm thinking maybe the curse doesn't allow her to be intimate with him?

Damn there is so much things going on :/ so much I missed. Your explanation actually made the story sound even better.
