Also, can someone summarize the last 2 chapters? I tend to dislike action in stories that I read. Like the duels Harry had with the Knights of W. also why did that scene with Hannah happen?

Why did Harry get pushed backwards? I think Hannah did it on purpose but she loves him?!?!?

So many questions!
