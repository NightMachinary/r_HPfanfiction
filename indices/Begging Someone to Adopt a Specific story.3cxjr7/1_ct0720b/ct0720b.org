It's a great story - thrilling and realistic, I loved it. One of my favorites. That said, I think you come off as a bit too desperate - and it wasn't /that/ mindblowingly good. There are many great stories, also "written for adults", also with a similar Harry in the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][DLP Library]].

Personally, I kind of liked where it was left off, actually, allowing for just enough imagination while not being a cliffhanger or falling flat.
