Alright then. *cracks nuckles* (At this point maybe I should note that I interpret "nice" as "not trying to make anyone miserable for no reason", him trying to be helpful without being overly condecending, and that I usually try my best to avoid bashing of any kind. So that's my standart for "Nice Harry". I know it's low. Have fun with these anyway.)

*Drarry first:*

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7145645][Blackberry Jam]] World War II, Nonmagic AU which is glorious, Harry and Draco both get evacuated out of London together. Multichapter, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1360492/1/][Eclipse]] In which Draco captures Harry for the Dark Lord and comes to regret that decision. Multichapter, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3688899][Like Diamonds We Are Cut With Our Own Dust]] In which the Dark Mark keeps harming Draco well after the Dark Lord is dead and Harry finds a solution. Oneshot, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2752127][Consequences of Redemption]] Canon Divergence AU in which Draco leaves Malfoy Manor with the trio and is dragged along the horcrux hunt. Multichapter, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124273][The Printed Press]] Not exactly nice Harry and mild Ginny bashing in the beginning, but explaination is given and the fic is worth a read. Harry has become a recluse after the war and Draco writes his biography. Multichapter, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/990428][No Shadow Taller Than Our Souls]] Case fic. Auror Harry and Unspeakable Draco investigating. There exists a podfic of this too but it's been ages since I downloaded that and I don't have the link anymore. Long Oneshot, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7229365][If Today Was Your Last Day]] Half canon divergence, half tag to the battle of Hogwarts. Harry knows he has to die and meets Draco on his way to the forest. Oneshot, Complete.

*And now for the* *one* *gen I kinda forgot the first time, and some crossovers*:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11456392/1/][Proud]] Petunia dies before ever telling Vernon about the magical world, when Harry comes to live with him he does his best to raise him right. Lot's of family feels but not actually that ooC. Gen, Multichapter, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9281191/1/][Animorph, Animagus]] Which is an Animorphs crossover and pretty much exactly what you'd expect a Harry Potter/Animorphs crossover to be, lbr. Gen, Oneshot, Complete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6833957/1/][Deathly Hollowed]] Bleach crossover, Harry/Orihime. Harry is Ulquiorra and... well about as kind as Unquiorra is able to get with all the Despair and Nihilism. There are some "crule to be kind" aspects but it's a good read with a nice and melancholy but hopeful ending. Multichapter, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3632982/1/][Torn between Sides]] Charmed Crossover, Harry/Chris Halliwell. Charmed Season 6 AU. Harry is a half demon and trying his best to keep the balance between good and evil, while more or less willingly on the side of evil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5730598/1/][Martyrdom and Paradox]] Death Note Crossover, Harry/L. During the Kira investigation L meets Harry in a cake shop. One of the few crossovers that also involves Harry's friendship with Ron and Hermione in a positive way. Multichapter, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/8722][Doctor Who/Harry Potter]] Doctor Who crossover. Hinny, Harry/the Doctor. A series in which Harry is kinda in love with the Doctor while also married to Ginny and it's mostly fine. No Ginny bashing is what I remember most fondly about this. Sadly abandoned, but still worth a read.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/585857][Not as Grimm as it Seems]] Grimm crossover, Gen. Harry moves to Portland where Nick and Monroe think he is another Grimm in denial of his abilities. Very short and very sporadic updates. Multichapter, WIP

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10216252/1/][The Triumph of These Tired Eyes]] Marvel Crossover. Gen. Loki is Harry's dad. This changes a lot of things but not all of them for the better. Family/Friendship fic mostly. I especially liked the Drarry Bromance. Multichapter, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096486/1/][Sowilo]] Marvel Crossover. Loki/Harry. A coffeeshop AU, because no rec list is complete without at least one of them. Twoshot, complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9589128/1/][Somewhere Safe]] Marvel Crossover. Loki/Harry. Loki tries to teleport "somewhere save" and lands in Harry's backyard. Oneshot, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5366507][Spellist]] Another Marvel Crossover, because I have a type apparently. Harry/Coulson. Harry gets thrown in the MCU and becomes a magician for hire. He's more apathetic than kind in this but he gets slightly better towards the end? IDK why I'm including this here but it's a good read and Harry is not an asshole in it so there. (Just on a side note, this one is by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]] and if you haven't checked out their page yet, you're missing out. They write beautifully original stories and some very nice trope subversions) Oneshot, Complete

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113600][Magnificent]] Sherlock crossover. Mycroft/Harry. In which Harry is the Ministry of Magic the same way that Mycroft is the British Government. Oneshot, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255][Whispers in Corners]] Sherlock crossover. Mycroft/Harry. In which Harry uses the resurrection stone to become a medium. Multichapter, complete.

That's it from me. Have fun with all of these ;)
