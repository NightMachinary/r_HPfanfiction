I think the nicest Harry that I can remember (at least in a story with decent writing) was Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom).

Harry wants to get along with pretty much everybody (with a couple of notable exceptions). His desire to do the right thing in this fic somehow makes him even more reckless than in canon, and by quite a bit. Part of that is, I think, in contrast to Voldemort who is malicious and plans for the long-term (he is immortal).
