To be honest, I don't usually care for that pairing either, partly because I think the characters lack chemistry, and partly because of weirdness from the age gap and student/teacher imbalances of power. However, the author handled the tensions between Hermione and Snape surprisingly well while having the personalities and ethical restraint of the characters stay true to cannon.

I like that the plot mainly focuses on other frightening aspects of their situation. Technically, in one of the endings (my favorite) the pairing never comes true.
