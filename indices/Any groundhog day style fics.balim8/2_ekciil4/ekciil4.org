[[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] is a classic example. In that fic, Hermione's time turner breaks during an accident in Potions class, trapping the entirety of Hogwarts in a loop of repeating the same day over and over. Hermione and Snape are the only ones who realize what is happening. The story gets pretty dark near the end.
