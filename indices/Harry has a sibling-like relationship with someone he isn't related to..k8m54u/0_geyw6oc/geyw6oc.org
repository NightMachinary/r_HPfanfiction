*With Hermione:*

Muggle Management - Part one of a larger complete series (Hermione Granger and the Child Protection Movement). Yes, it starts as a oneshot. It's 300k words total, however.

Accidental Animagus - You've heard of this one, I'm sure.

*With Somebody Else:*

Like Brothers (Draco) - It's Colubrina, so dramione is probably the focus (I haven't read it yet).

Like None Other (Draco) - Also severitus. I've read the first part, and part of the second, and then I had enough. Ymmv.

Harveste Addams series (Addams Family) - Yeah, it's a crossover that exists. There's five (?) installments, I think.

Harry Potter and the Elder Sect (Crossover/Tabitha) - Bewitched. This is crack. So much crack. Also technically related, but we're talking 30th cousins or some shit.

Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy Bears and Spot (Crossover) - The Munsters. Also crack, but not as much as the bewitched one.

Faultlines (Tony Stark) - Questionable relevence: they're actually uncle/nephew. Also, weird formatting.

I'm sure there's more that I can't think of atm, but that'll start you off.
