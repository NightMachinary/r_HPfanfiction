My favorite is Overclocking--it's got some really cool backstory on what it's like to work in the Department of Mysteries; Percy as a real, 3-dimensional character; and the characters actually grapple with the seriousness of messing about with time. Also, it's just an engaging read, and I'm a sucker for well-written Hermione time travel fics. I will second the rec for One Hundred and Sixty Nine as well, though.
