  And perhaps she was not subtle enough, because her boss finally said, “Ms. Granger, please do not attempt to capture any more Death Eater tech, a term Charlie apparently picked up from you and your team. The French captured two cube vans with full-sized mind-control systems, and both were boobytrapped. Both exploded while DPSD boffins were studying the equipment in situ. Both vans were destroyed, and the French forces nearby were contaminated with radioactive materials.”

  Hermione checked, “Just vans destroyed, men in the vans killed, and a small radiation clean-up site around the explosion?”

  ”Ms. Granger, that sort of threat does not go with the word ‘just'.”

  She insisted, “I beg your pardon sir, but it does. Those devices probably have several kilos of possibly-fissionable material as a power source. If I was designing those boobytraps, I would aim for a low-grade nuclear detonation, say a tenth of a kiloton up to half a kiloton.”

  There was a long pause before he finally said, “Ms. Granger, I would quite appreciate it if you would refrain from becoming our next supervillain or domestic terrorist.”
