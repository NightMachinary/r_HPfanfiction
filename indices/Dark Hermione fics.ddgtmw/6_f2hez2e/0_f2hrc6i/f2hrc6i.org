/Fervidity/ is an interesting one. It's delightfully un-angsty, and yet, it kind of goes off the deep end, kind of how porn often puts weird contrivances into the plot in order to facilitate sex of the kind they want to show (or so I heard <_< ). My summary (from a while ago):

- More-BAMF-than-canon!Hermione who is still recognisable: Cool.
- Poses as Snape's illegitimate daughter to help subvert Death Eaters from within: Interesting.
- Gets challenged by Bellatrix, fights, actually pulls off a win with a curse she had invented, and only spares her because Voldemort orders it: Cool.
- Builds a reputation and develops relationships (positive and negative) with members of the Death Eater inner circle, making moral compromises along the way: Cool.
- Is not a blushing virgin (Ron having been her first): Good.
- Learns that despite HPverse being far more egalitarian than Muggle and for much longer, and despite women in HPverse not being disadvantaged in matters of violence as they are in real life, Death Eaters have these mandatory monthly "revels" that involve participating in, and I'll phrase this as mechanistically as possible, group sex in which the female DEs must serve as bottoms to multiple partners whom they do not necessarily choose, and nor are the female DEs given control over the mode and style of the intercourse; and where a surprising number of male DEs avail themselves of this opportunity to inflict abuse, apparently unafraid of retribution and heedless of the fact that the next day, they have to rely on those very women to have their backs in battle: NOPE.
