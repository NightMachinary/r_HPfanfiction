The characterisation is different enough that Valerie Campbell is not so much a Slytherin Hermione, as a Slytherin /replacement/ for Hermione, but linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) is an interesting read.

Do not meddle in the affairs of this witch, for she is reasonably subtle, quick to anger, and "witch" is just one misplaced letter away from... Well.
