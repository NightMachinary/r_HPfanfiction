I don't think [[/u/poondi]] deserves to be downvoted for recommending it, but it's worth noting a few things about this fic:

1. It has a lot of Dumbledore-bashing.
2. Hermione becomes extremely protective of Harry, for no clear reason.
3. I dropped the fic after yet another irrational and unnecessary sacrifice by Hermione on Harry's behalf, but another reader who didn't tells me that she eventually becomes a submissive to Tom Riddle.
