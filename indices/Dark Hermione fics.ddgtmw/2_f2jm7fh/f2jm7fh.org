I've been enjoying linkffn(13051824) New Blood, which is a Slytherin Hermione fic. It's a Hermione who is cautiously interested in darker aspects of magic as a way to make herself more powerful in order to accomplish her goals. Currently only in second year, but there's been a lot of interesting magic happening already.
