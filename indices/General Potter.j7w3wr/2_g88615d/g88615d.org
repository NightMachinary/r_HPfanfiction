I'm not sure that would actually be a boon.

A general is an upper command position, which means a lot of experience both on battlefield, with tactics and strategy, and off it, with politics and bureaucracy. Unfortunately, such thing would also include years upon year of dealing with trained, disciplined troops and possibly tarnish his canon charisma (by removing the One Of Us factor). Depends on the degree of bleed through, I guess.
