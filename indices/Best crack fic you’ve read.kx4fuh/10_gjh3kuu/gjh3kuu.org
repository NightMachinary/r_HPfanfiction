Something I did a while back.

There is also one that involves Harry having a harem while being super powered and having every house name in the book, which is used /every time/ someone says his name. â€˜Mr Hadrian Gryffindor RavenClaw Hufflepuff, slytherin etc' its /hilarious/ but despite reading it only a few days ago I can't find it.
