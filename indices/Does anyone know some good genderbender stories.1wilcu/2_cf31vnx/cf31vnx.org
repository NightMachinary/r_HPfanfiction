Here are two girl!Harry fics that are pretty decent. Neither is complete, but I don't think they're abandoned, since both were updated in December.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/422080/chapters/704262][Girl in the War]] by astridfire. "Who says you can't fight evil and be pretty? A Girl!Harry AU, starting with Rose Potter's first year at Hogwarts." This is pretty good, but sometimes Rose got on my nerves. It's still worth checking out.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending Road]] by laventadorn. "AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet." This is probably my favorite girl!Harry fic. Don't let the pairing squick you if that's not your thing -- nearly 400k words in, and they're still not together! I don't think the author is planning on that until well after Harriet is of age.

And this is a girl!Ron. Worth reading if only for the novelty of the plot, but also pretty well-written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]] by Hyaroo. "We all know the stories that ask "What if Harry Potter was a girl," right? But what if Ron Weasley was a girl? Imagine that the first person Harry befriends on the Hogwarts Express is not Ronald Weasley, but Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first born daughter of the Weasley clan for generations... what might happen then? STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED."
