I'll second Alpha_Wolf79's rec of Equal and Opposite, but here's a few more recs of my own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and The Distaff Side]]

This is incomplete. But it's still worth reading. After the third task, Voldemort sends Harry to another universe, so he doesn't have to worry about the prophecy. Harry winds up in a world where everyone is genderbent except Luna Lovegood. It's weird, interesting and Harry meeting the girl version of himself is funny.

I haven't read this myself, but some people seem to like it.

Heres the summary: "Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal."

Harry's a boy in this one, but everyone in the wizarding world sees a girl because of a curse. Entertaining and hilarious. You feel for poor Harry in this one. The author does a good job of portraying how a normal boy would react to being seen as the wrong gender.
