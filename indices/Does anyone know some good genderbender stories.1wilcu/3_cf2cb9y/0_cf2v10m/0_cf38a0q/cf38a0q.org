My pleasure. And it's basically a matter of creating an account with yahoo. Then you can access the material. Kind of a pain in the ass but it's a good story. Oh and I remembered another recently that I haven't read in years, but it was a cool guilty pleasure. The girl who lived by silver aegis. Last I checked someone else had taken it over. Still a cool concept though, if a little squicky :P
