Silver Aegis' story was rewritten into [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived][a complete story]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/325962/Agnostics-Puppet][Agnostics Puppet]].

Seems like that happened a lot with Silver Aegis back in the day- he'd spork an interesting concept and then someone else would write a far superior version.
