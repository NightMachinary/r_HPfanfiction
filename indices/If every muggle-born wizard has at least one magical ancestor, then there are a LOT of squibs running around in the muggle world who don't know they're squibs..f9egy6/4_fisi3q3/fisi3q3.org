My headcanon:

- Actual first generation magicals, but they are "won the lottery" rare.
- "Refreshed" Squib born. Pureblood inbreeding leads to squibs, since their magic was mostly "used up" fighting off the effects of the bad genes. Once enough muggle blood is infused into the bloodline and flushes out the inbreeding, magic pops up again. Thus "muggleborns". This can take a few generations, as adding another Squib Bloodline doesn't help that much. You need actual Muggle blood.
