I just looked up the actual data. So, on average through history, you find that in about 80% of marriages the spouses are second cousins, that is they share at least 2 great-grand parents. The math for that is well beyond my understanding of statistics, (I might have been able to handle it 10 years ago, but not at the moment) for me to be confident in anything I say, but I'm pretty sure that the answer still amounts to something similar to my initial estimate, just slower.
