That math assumes that a random spouse of the global population is chosen.

This has never been the case. Moving 25 miles to meet a spouse would have been unheard about 300 years ago, most likely even 200 years ago. Which means that the geographic movement of genes is limited. I don't have numbers, but I suspect that you don't need to go back very far, before a very large percentage of your ancestors came from the same medium sized city or county.

And even then, the magical the magical community is fairly isolated and thus magicals are more likely to meet other magicals, and likewise, a muggle is disproportionally more likley to meet another muggle than a magical.
