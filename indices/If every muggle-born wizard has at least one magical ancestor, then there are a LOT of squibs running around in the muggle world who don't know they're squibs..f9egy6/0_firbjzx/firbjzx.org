Depends on how you define a "squib", and how far back you're willing to go on that "at least one magical ancestor". Go back three hundred years, and assuming that you have 2 parents whose families never intermarried, per 30 year generation (for a nice 10 generations), and you get 2046 ancestors, with 1024 of them in that generation 300 years ago.

Beyond that, let's say that 0.1% of the population is magical. That means there is a 99.9% chance that any given person is not magical. Assuming a random distribution of marriages, in family lines that don't intermarry, and once again going 10 generations back, You have a 12.911% chance of there being no magical ancestors. Go back a further 2 generations and you have 8190 ancestors with a 0.0276% chance that none of them were magical.

In short, in that idealized world, it would surprise me if /anyone/ wasn't descended from at least one magical ancestor.
