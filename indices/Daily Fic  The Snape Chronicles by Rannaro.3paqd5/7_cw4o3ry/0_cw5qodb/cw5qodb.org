I agree. Having given up after his first year at Hogwarts, this was one thing that stuck out at me, and ultimately caused me to stop reading.

That, and the depressing characterization of life in a coal town in Thatcher's Britain.

It's pacing is a major problem as well. I don't recall exact numbers, but it was something in the line of a full 100k words before he even got to Hogwarts. And whilst the author did his/her best, it just wasn't interesting enough to warrant that - as most pre-Hogwarts fics are.

All in all, I'd give it a 3.5/5, rounded up. Certainly decent quality, but has some fundamental issues that pull it down. Ultimately I round up because some of my problems with it are personal ones - wrong tone for me, lack of interest in Snape's character - and I can see how it would be worth the read for someone else.
