One of the qualms I had about the fic is the under emphasis on the Marauders--Snape animosity and bullying. Maybe that's just me being influenced by fanfiction, but I think that Snape really hates the Marauders, especially since his worst memory is them bullying him. If he hadn't been bullied, I willing to bet that SS/LE would be canon. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
