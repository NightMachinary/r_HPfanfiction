I'm reading this right now. I thought making Snape a space nerd was a really fun idea and probably made me relate a little too much to his childhood character, and his early childhood years flowed really nicely. Now I'm at the point where they're at Hogwarts and I've slowed down reading since there's something a little off about the pacing and characterizations here. I get the feeling that the author really gets English industrial town settings but isn't quite there with Magical Britain (which is fine, if you think about it JK Rowling is the only human who really gets magical Britain). My thoughts so far.
