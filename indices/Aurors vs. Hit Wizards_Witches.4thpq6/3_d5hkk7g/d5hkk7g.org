I like to think differently from most of the others in the fandom.

Hitwizards are Aurors who are trained specifically for targets that fight back. I came to this conclusion by the mention of them in PoA that is mentioned below. In the next book we hear ron describe an Auror as "dark wizard catcher" implying that they catch all "dark wizards"

Yet Hit Wizards would have dealt with a violent "criminal" in Sirius Black and it would have taken a team of them to bring him in. that is relevant because Moody, Kingsely and Tonks never mentioned having a partner except when occupying high profile targets. That means I must come to the conclusion that all Hit-Wizards operate in teams.

In the wizarding world it seems that teams (outside of quidditch) function for a higher goal against a formidable enemy. The examples of this are the dragon handlers, the OotP, The Death Eaters, and most interesting, how doing the tasks of the TWT alone (or without getting caught getting help) gave eternal glory. That would give us the concept that wizards are of the mindset that being able to operate singularly is of high importance.

Basically what I am trying to say is that all Hit-Wizards are Aurors. but not all Aurors are Hit-Wizards. My guess is that Hit-Wizards were the ones given the orders "eliminate without prejuice" during the first war.
