I've always seen the Magical Law Enforcement Squad as the general police force, Aurors as special investigators for dark magic and highly trained in combat, while Hit Wizards are sort of a pure combat force called on for help to arrest dangerous criminals.

The wiki says that Aurors need at least five E+ NEWTs, while Hit Wizards simply have to pass 5 OWLs. No clue where that comes from though. But it would imply there is still quite a difference in capability between an Auror and a Hit Wizard. Wasn't Tonks supposedly the first Auror trainee the took in like 3 years or something?
