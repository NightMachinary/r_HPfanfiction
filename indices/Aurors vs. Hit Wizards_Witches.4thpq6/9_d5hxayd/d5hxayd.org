In alot of fics I read, Hit Wizards are usually the regular cops, and Aurors are the detectives/investigators, which is weird to me because when I see the names, I intuitively see it the other way around.

The only reason I can see for it is that iirc, Aurors are described as "dark wizard catchers". Few people who break the law are "dark wizards" they're just assholes or idiots. Then I just assumed Hit Wizards dealt with the rest.
