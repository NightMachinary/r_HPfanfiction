No. James Bond is definitely on the hit wizard side of things. He is not the subtle investigator who observes and cultivates contacts over months and years. Bond is the blunt hammer who gets sent in when the operation has already gone titsup, to salvage what is left. He is the high-profile killer everyone in the business knows who is sent to draw the opposition into the light and save what there is to save after everything else has failed.
