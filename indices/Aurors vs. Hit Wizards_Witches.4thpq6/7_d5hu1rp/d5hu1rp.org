In my stories, I usually treat Hit-Wizards as the "Military" of Wizarding Britain, wizards and witches trained to fight in a war. They're generally small in numbers during peace time (where they serve as guards), which means in a war their numbers swell with green recruits. Aurors are the cops, ranging from patrol cops to special investigators. And they look down on the Hit-Wizards, and vice versa. "That's a job for Hit-Wizards, not Aurors; you don't need brains to blow a house up." "Why do Aurors wear red robes? So their boss doesn't notice that they were hurt trying to catch a runaway cat."
