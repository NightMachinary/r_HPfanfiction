We recently had a discussion about allowing the sharing of a story where a 17 year old Harry has semi-explicit sex and now you share a story were 14 year old Harry explicitly has sex with multiple 17+ year old women. I personally think that the rule is impossible to follow in the fanfic community without banning half the stories that exist, but rules are rules right?
