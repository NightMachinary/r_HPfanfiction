Perhaps he doesn't know how to snap, and simply verbalizes instead. Infact, maybe it's a misunderstanding. I remember this book as a child that told me how to snap and clap along to songs. It would simply say /snap/ (clap) /snap/, and that'd be the order you would go with. But if someone doesn't know to snap or clap, they may think it's a lyric of a rather straight forward trible chant. And so, years from when they found this book, they will see everyone else physically snapping. And, thinking its wrong, they will exclaim the "proper" way to snap. "SNAP" they will yell to everyone. "SNAP!".

I don't think it was a typo at all. I think it was the author trying to show us a flawed and misunderstood character, who never learned how to snap...
