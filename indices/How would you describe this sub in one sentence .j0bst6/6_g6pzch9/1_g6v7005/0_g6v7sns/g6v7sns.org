I'm not sure they really add much to the subreddit. Sure, they're sometimes funny (especially since the funny ones are usually the only ones upvoted), but they almost never lead to a short drabble, to say the least of a story. They're upvoted in favor of discussion posts, fic reviews, and the other posts that I enjoy most on the subreddit. Half the time, the "prompts" are a sentence in the title.

What I'd like is a weekly megathread for these short prompts to be posted. People would respond to them like they do now, i.e. jokes and comments, and the subreddit would have more room for other content. It'd be like subreddit quality moderation elsewhere where photos and certain type of posts are banned on certain days, though they might garner many upvotes.
