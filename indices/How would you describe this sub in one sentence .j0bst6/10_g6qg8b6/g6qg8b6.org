"We like to downvote all self promotion posts." It's like why do we even HAVE that tag now if every single person who posts using it gets knocked down to 0? Seriously just get rid of it, it's functionally useless! Or an instant loss of karma button if you want it. :( It's so dumb, what's everyone's freaking problem with it anyways?!
