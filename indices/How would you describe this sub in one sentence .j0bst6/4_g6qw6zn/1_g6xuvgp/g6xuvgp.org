I don't quite like Ron but his Character did take quite a few hits to become comic relief in the movies.

His jealousy became petty (Maybe it was the same way in the books) but it was amplified a lot more in the movies.

He did lose his chance to shine as the "Magic Culture Know-It-All" which became Hermione's schtick in the movies.

Ron is still annoying to me and Fanfiction has not made that better. The fact that I feel a sadistic glee whenever Ron is bashed in FF's allows me to understand that I on a fundamental level do not enjoy him as a human being.

I would not be Ron's friend in real life.
