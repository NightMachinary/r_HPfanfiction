Funny thing is that I grew up in that big lower middle class family. Clothes were sometimes hand me downs and vacation might be a car trip to the countryside or visiting family. We had food but not a lot of stuff.

Oldest of five siblings (I know Mum and Dad didn't go the full Weasley seven) but still.. We just learned that we had to make our own money so I have had jobs on and off since I was fourteen. That's where I got my pocket money.

I just don't get Ron.
