/Better than almost all of the other fanfic places./

I know it's fun to hate on this sub, I've even felt this way a few times. However compared to other fanfic communities I've participated in, this place shines.

- (almost) everyone is welcome. This is not actually an industry standard. Most FF communities have strict guidelines, either expressly stated or developed over time like invisible walls, about the kind of content you can post/request.

- It's not an echo chamber. Sure there are "factions" that gravitate towards certain views, but you can disagree to your heart's content. Sure, you might get downvoted, but if your skin is even a little thickened, that won't stop you at all. You can still post weekly about why Dobby/Aragog is the OTP, or why all purebloods should be executed with a desert eagle by ninja!Harry. And that's a beautiful thing.

- The mods are barely seen or heard. I can't stress how much of a good thing that is. In most communities mods have an overbearing presence that can actually hinder participation.

- It's vibrant. Most of the other FF places have either stagnated, been abandoned or have grown terribly bloated (Spacebattles comes to mind). This community has a good amount of users, it's not small enough to be in danger of disappearing, nor large enough to feel impersonal.

- It's always on flux. Users are leaving, new ones are entering. You can participate as much, or as little, as you want. This, again, prevents stagnation.
