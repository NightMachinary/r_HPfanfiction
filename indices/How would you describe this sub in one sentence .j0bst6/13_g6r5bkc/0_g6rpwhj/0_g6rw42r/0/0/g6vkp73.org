Sure

I just think it's interesting to see characters that are good and typically liked (Molly, Dumbledore, Ron, Ginny, Hermione-or others) and twist them so they're unlikable.

It's nice to have a different antagonist sometimes than the usual ones (Snape, Malfoy, etc)

I do agree that sometimes it gets laid on overly thick. I'm not a fan of Harry overhearing, say, the Weasleys where they unveil their plan with the most unrealistic, awkward dialogue ever.
