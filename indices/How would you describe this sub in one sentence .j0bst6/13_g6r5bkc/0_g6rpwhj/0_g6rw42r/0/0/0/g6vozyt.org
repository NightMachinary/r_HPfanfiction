Lol no worries! That's a really good point, I hadn't thought of it that way. I guess like with every type of fic, people see the most extreme and/or poorly written examples and assume the whole genre's the same. (Not to say that the extreme examples are actually bad, just that people latch onto them and build the image of the trope around them.)
