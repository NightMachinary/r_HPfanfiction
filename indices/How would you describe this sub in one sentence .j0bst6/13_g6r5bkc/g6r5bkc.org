"Bashing is bad."

Okay, I get it many people dont like bashing and that's fine. That's their opinion. But I happen to like it and I think it's dumb to say that if you like bashing, you're not creative and/or immature. People like what they like. I've seen many posts complaining about it, which is more annoying than the fics I come across that portray the bashing terribly
