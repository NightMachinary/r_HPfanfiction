I never said that they should actually KILL anyone (ok: that might work shortly before the final battle - to thin out enemy ranks!) just show up, say the name and apparate to another location and do the same (repeat as long as you think it's usefull!)

How would they plan a counter-ambush if you select RANDOM locations? They can't know them in advance, they'd be playing catch-up every time!

Voldemort using muggle-weapons? (explosives!) I don't think so he (the mighty half-blood) would not sully himself like that ;)
