  I never said that they should actually KILL anyone
#+end_quote

What? Why shouldn't they? They're in the middle of a war.

  How would they plan a counter-ambush if you select RANDOM locations?
#+end_quote

The concept of random location stops being relevant when the entire point of the taboo is that it gives your location. They don't have to know where you're going to be.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort using muggle-weapons?
#+end_quote

Just because muggles have similar items does not mean a wizard object is out. Muggles have cutlery, Voldemort probably still uses a fork. Is Voldemort going to be going out and getting a block of c4? No, probably not, but he'd have no problem with an explosive potion.
