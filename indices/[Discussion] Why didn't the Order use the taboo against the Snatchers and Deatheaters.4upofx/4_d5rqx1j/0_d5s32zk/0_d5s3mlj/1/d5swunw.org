Yeah, in the end they should - but for a test run they should not (hell: I've got a better idea: Why not use houselfs to say the name (order them not to say it in any hideout etc. so there aren't any slip-ups!)...no one can block their form of apparition after all!)

Well, they do - in order to apparate there (but when they do you will be either just leaving or you'll have already left!)

Ok, granted (upscalling wizard-fireworks might work...but I think Fred and George would send him some, too - taste of his own medicine after all!)
