This is the kind of trick you can really only pull off once (or twice).

It is very noticeable if an entire squad gets killed after going out and never comes back. Part of making a good story is to also have you enemies adapt to your ideas and perhaps launch a counter-ambush? Like instead of a squad, they sent a highly explosive potion/bomb to that location the next time...
