Not writing one currently :( - I've got several ideas (especially after reading "Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived" by The Santi - sadly unfinished...I just love a competent Harry who doesn't piss away his talent at magic and I love how he's better than his brother who is actually a mirror for canon Harry (rather lazy!)), but I don't know if I am up to it (I'd like to do it in English, too but it's not my native language, so I don't know if I can pull it off convincingly!)
