It's really more of a way to show in the narrative that normal everyday people are against Lord Voldemort. Up until that point the only people who are really show to be against Voldemort are Harry, a "Chosen One", Dumbledore, a wise old, highly powered wizard with too many jobs, and Harry's close friends who are on the peripheral of major events involving Harry and Voldemort, i.e. Sirius, Hermione, Ron. The Order represents more ordinary people, who are opposed to Voldemort for more ordinary reasons: revenge, to protect their way of life, and so on.

Your right though, the first Order was founded right in the middle of war, i.e. there was probably a bigger focus at Hogwarts at the time on defending yourself, seeing as there was an active war. However there has since been 13-14 years of peace, people who could and did fight died in the first war. New members wouldn't be as stringent on their defensive capabilities as they wouldn't have had to fight much for a significant amount of time. The first order was founded in the 70s and fought until the war ended in the early 80s. In other word these people had roughly 10 years to learn to fight and get good at fighting, a fairly large amount of time, especially with their lives on the line. By the end they would have been fairly profecient, but then there is peace for a greater amount of time, they would have gotten out of practice and out of shape and that was the people that survived, Moody likely not out of shape but older, probably slower and possible more injured, Sirius spent 12 or so years in Azkaban, Remus was probably bumming around for however many years until he took the job at Hogwarts, probably not the best conditions to stay in shape, Emmeline Vance, not sure what she did but she seemed to be in okay fighting shape/ability by the second war, McGonagall, who is a teacher, older than during the first war and is more about transfiguration than combat, and finally Elphias Doge who never struck me as particularly talented. Other than Albus, who was probably a little slower by the second war and Aberforth who retired, everyone else had died.

The people who joined up where the Weaselys, Bill and Charlie are quite talented and probably have half an idea what to do in dangerous situations, Molly and Arthur are a hosuewife and basically a government worker respectively, Fred and George, while talented and creative wizards are more focused on pranks and their shop and I'd probably rather a more combat orientated pair at my back. Mundungus Fletcher, need I say more? Tonks, someone actually useful an Auror, same as Kingsley. Fleur, talented but young and inexperienced. Snape had to be careful not to blow his cover. In other words by the time of the second war, the Order has 10 people who would probably be any good at fighting. Bill and Charlie, who are both mostly working overseas, Tonks, Moody and Kingsley who are shown to be useful to the Order, McGonagall, she's older by this point and probably a bit depressed from the first war and all the former students who died, Emmeline Vance, Sirius who was probably a bit out of shape and practice after Azkaban, and Remus, and finally Albus. No great fighting force, everyone else in the Order is more of an information gathering force. In addition the Second war lasted for about 3 years. In that time the people who couldn't fight probably wouldn't have learned a whole heap about how to fight, especially since the first year of the war had pretty much no fighting.

That is why the Order is fairly ineffective in the Second War, lack of actual fighters, and little time in which the non-fighters could learn to fight.
