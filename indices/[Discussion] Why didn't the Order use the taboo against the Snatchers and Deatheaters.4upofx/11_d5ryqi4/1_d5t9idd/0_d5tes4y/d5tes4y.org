Most things /don't/ work in HP.

JK might have planned the outline of her story and her characters but there is no way that she planned her world or magic system beyond what happens to be convenient for the plot.

Some examples:

- Quidditch

- The economy

- The number of people in the magical world

- The idea that magic has a techbane aura without the muggles immediately finding them

- Hiding the existence of dragons and smaller magical creatures

- The statute of secrecy in general

- Gamps law of elemental transfiguration
