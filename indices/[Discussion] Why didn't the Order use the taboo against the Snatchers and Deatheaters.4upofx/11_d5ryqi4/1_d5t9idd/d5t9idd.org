If that was true, many things wouldn't work in HP as a whole. Besides, when she has explained the way she created HP, she as a writer is a planner (meaning she plans ahead and then writes, having notes on background, plot elements, and so on). We may disagree on some of her choices, but it has nothing to do with planning IMO.
