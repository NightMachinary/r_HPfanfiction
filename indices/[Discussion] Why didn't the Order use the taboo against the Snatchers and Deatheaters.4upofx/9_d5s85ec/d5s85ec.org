You need a mentality that says you can fight back. You need a lot of chutzpah. You need to know about the Taboo. You need to be willing to say You Know Who's name. You need someone who thinks of the tactic. That lets you try it once.

You need an untraceable escape route. You need to be faster than the snatchers. This lets you try it a second time.

In other words, it's not so surprising that it didn't happen that way in canon, but it's also not unreasonable to have in a fic.
