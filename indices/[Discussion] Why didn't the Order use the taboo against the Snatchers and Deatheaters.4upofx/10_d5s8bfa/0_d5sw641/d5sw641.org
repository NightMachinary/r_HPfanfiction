Indeed and that makes me question Dumbledore's sanity even more...hell, having intelligence gatherers is nice, but why not say:

Compartmentalize the order (it would fit with Dumbledore's fetish of keeping secrets) into an intelligence and fighting section :) and giving both a leader (in case he dies, it's not like Dumbledore didn't know he was going to die - he orchestrated his own death after all!)
