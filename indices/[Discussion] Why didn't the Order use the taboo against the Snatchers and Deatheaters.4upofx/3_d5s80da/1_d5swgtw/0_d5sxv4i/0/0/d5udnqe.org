  You don't have to be a psychopath to kill Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

You don't get to kill Death Eaters. They are well hidden, well trained, and wary (especially after you kill the first one or two). You get to kill Ministry bureaucrat #532 who is just keeping his head down and following orders, or maybe a Death Eater's less-wary cousin who is just trying to sit out the war, or maybe a Death Eater's child at Hogwarts. All of those might serve tactical or strategic goals under the right circumstances, but a non-psychopath might have trouble with them.

Your very own excellent linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) shows how murky it gets.

  An Snatchers deserve to be killed - they are actively murdering innocents. Each dead Snatcher saves lives, by removing one scumbag and scaring off others.

And you'll kill a few the first time or two you do it. Then, they start with countermeasures, sending mind-controlled hostages to clear traps, and all the other stuff that would take a psychopath (or a really bad racist) to do.

  And I honestly doubt that the Death Eaters can counter ambushes that easily - all you need to do is lay out explosives, short fuse, say the taboo and apparate away.
