If they can work as Snatchers, they could flee as well. If they help murdering innocents, then they are legitimate targets. The alternative is letting a genocide happen. And killing a few sympathisers who would rather kill children than risk their own life is a small price to pay for stopping a genocide.

In book 7, the Ministry is Nazi Germany, working on the Endl√∂sung. That means that a whole damn lot of collateral damage is justified. If "Divided and Entwined" had reached that point, it wouldn't be murky at all. There wouldn't be any real moral problem. The moral problem in that story stems from the fact that things are not that bad. That the Ministry isn't trying to murder children just for not having magical parents.

But once that line is crossed? Then anyone working for the Ministry is, if not a legitimate target, acceptable collateral damage. Once your employer starts a genocide, you either quit, or you accept that you've just become a target.
