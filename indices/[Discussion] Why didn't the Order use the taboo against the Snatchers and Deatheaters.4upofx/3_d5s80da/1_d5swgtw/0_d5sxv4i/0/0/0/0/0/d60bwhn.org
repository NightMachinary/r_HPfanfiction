Agreed - you don't even have to kill: Stun them, take them with you and give them some draught of the living dead (wake them once Voldemort has been pushed out of power and then sort them out with Veritaserum etc.) only kill confirmed DE's (as mentioned: Yaxley, Lucius, Bellatrix etc.)

I would - if the situation called for it (not just because I think it's a good idea), there's always innocents being killed in war (don't know of any war without dead civillians!)
