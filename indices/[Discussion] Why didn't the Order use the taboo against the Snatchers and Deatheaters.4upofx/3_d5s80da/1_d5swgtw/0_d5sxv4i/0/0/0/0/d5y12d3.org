My original point was in response to [[/u/Laxian]]'s point that

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was so successful because he didn't have a lot of ground to defend and now it's the order who's in his position, so they should take advantage of that fact ASAP!
#+end_quote

and my reply was that taking advantage wouldn't necessarily be ethical or even a good idea.

With the exception of the flunkies sent after Taboo, when attacking Ministry infrastructure and personnel, the difficulty, the risk, and the cost of an attack would typically be inversely related to the target's culpability and harm, especially after the first such attack.

That is, a random floo technician or OWL examiner or cauldron bottom inspector or Obliviator would be an easy target, while Yaxley and Umbridge would be harder, and doubly so if you didn't care /which/ technician or /which/ examiner or /which/ inspector you killed, as long as you killed a Ministry employee: indiscriminate strikes are easier than pin-point strikes.

One can debate the ethics of attacking those functionaries, but there would also be PR consequences, and, ultimately, practicalities, because the Order is made up of people, most of them civilians, often with families and day jobs.

For example, would you ask Arthur Weasley to help in an attack on the Ministry that would have a non-negligible risk of killing his son, Percy, working overtime in the Ministry?
