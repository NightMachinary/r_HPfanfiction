You don't have to be a psychopath to kill Death Eaters. And I honestly doubt that the Death Eaters can counter ambushes that easily - all you need to do is lay out explosives, short fuse, say the taboo and apparate away. Replace the explosives with poison, conjured dangerous animals, and similar "fire and forget" hazards for variety. Soon the taboo is worthless.

An Snatchers deserve to be killed - they are actively murdering innocents. Each dead Snatcher saves lives, by removing one scumbag and scaring off others.
