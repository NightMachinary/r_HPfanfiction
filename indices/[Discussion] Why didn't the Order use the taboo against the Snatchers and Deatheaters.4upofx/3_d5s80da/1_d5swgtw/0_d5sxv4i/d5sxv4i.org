  Even, one less flunky is one less wand on their side (and if all of those are gone? Well, guess who gets sent next, unless Voldemort does away with the Taboo!)
#+end_quote

So you get one batch of flunkies. The next batch comes with countermeasures, some of which you might not anticipate; and there are many more of them than there are of you.

  Hm...enchanting the whole of England with anti-apparition wards? If Voldemort could do that I'd think the Aurors would have done it first (and Voldemort would have had a really bad day!)
#+end_quote

No, just around the area where the taboo was triggered --- which is what I wrote in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Well, divide and conquer :) make them fear you for a turn (come on Voldemort was so successful because he didn't have a lot of ground to defend and now it's the order who's in his position, so they should take advantage of that fact ASAP!)
#+end_quote

Perhaps. Are you sure you want to escalate against Voldemort and the Death Eaters? They are willing to cross lines you can't even imagine to get at you. Are you willing to do the same? (Well, maybe you are, but remember, most of the order are not psychopaths.)

For that matter, the "ground to defend" that you are talking about is the Ministry. Most people in there are just functionaries who are keeping their heads down and going along with whatever regime is in place. Sure, "just following orders" is no excuse, but just because you can morally justify attacking them, doesn't mean that it's a good idea. Suppose that you kill a few of them. Now, the rest aren't just keeping their heads down and going along, they actually want you and yours dead, and even if you manage to take down Voldemort, they won't automatically forgive you.

  I think it was planned (sorry, but even a weakened Dumbledore could have probably beaten 10 Draco Malfoys without breaking much of a sweat!)...it was more or less part of Dumbledore's plan (maybe not exactly this way, but that's semantics (Dumbledore knew well enough that Harry could take Draco in a fight!)
#+end_quote

If it had been planned, the Elder Wand's loyalty wouldn't have switched to Draco any more than it would have switched to Snape had Snape killed Dumbledore on Dumbledore's orders (as they had originally planned).

#+begin_quote
  Hey, that last one is funny...how about confounding a hacker into, well hacking into public announcement speakers and having them say "Voldemort"? ;) The Taboo probably would OVERLOAD (short circuit?)
#+end_quote

Well, it's magic, so it's not clear whether an electronic retransmission would count. The idea with a BBC broadcast is that it would get Muggles all over the UK talking about it, all at the same time.
