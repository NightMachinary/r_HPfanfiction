Even, one less flunky is one less wand on their side (and if all of those are gone? Well, guess who gets sent next, unless Voldemort does away with the Taboo!)

Hm...enchanting the whole of England with anti-apparition wards? If Voldemort could do that I'd think the Aurors would have done it first (and Voldemort would have had a really bad day!)

Well, divide and conquer :) make them fear you for a turn (come on Voldemort was so successful because he didn't have a lot of ground to defend and now it's the order who's in his position, so they should take advantage of that fact ASAP!)

I think it was planned (sorry, but even a weakened Dumbledore could have probably beaten 10 Draco Malfoys without breaking much of a sweat!)...it was more or less part of Dumbledore's plan (maybe not exactly this way, but that's semantics (Dumbledore knew well enough that Harry could take Draco in a fight!)

Hey, that last one is funny...how about confounding a hacker into, well hacking into public announcement speakers and having them say "Voldemort"? ;) The Taboo probably would OVERLOAD (short circuit?)
