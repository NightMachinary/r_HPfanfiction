Some possible reasons:

- They don't send Death Eaters. They send expendable flunkies like Scabior, and there is no shortage of those.

- Taboo might also impose an anti-disapparation jinx over the area around where it was triggered, precisely to keep whomever triggered it from just fleeing. (It might explain why the Trio didn't just disapparate after Harry triggered the Taboo.)

- It could have been a strategic decision: most Death Eaters thought that they had won and had relaxed, enjoying the fruits of their victory. Violent resistance would have made them more proactive in hunting down Order members and runaway Muggleborns.

- It could have been a moral strategy decision: Potterverse is not morally neutral, and it seems to have an afterlife, and it's the best Watsonian explanation that I know of for the series of highly improbable coincidences --- some of which, like Draco disarming Dumbledore, by definition could not have been planned, or they wouldn't have worked --- to put the Elder Wand loyal to Harry in Voldemort's hand. Keeping the Order's hands clean for the final battle might have been a priority.

That said, I have this mental image of someone in the Order confounding a BBC anchor into saying "Voldemort" several times during a live broadcast, and Tabboo being flooded by millions of Muggles speculating about WTF is a "Voldemort".
