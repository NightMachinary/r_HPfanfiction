Through ambushes, the Taboo would be rendered ineffective.

However, I have an idea about how a Taboo could be used after the war:

Place the word 'mudblood' under Taboo. But instead of sending aurors/hitwizards immediately after every use, the DMLE could keep track where and how often it was being muttered. It allowed the law enforcement to keep a statistic on who and where remaining pureblood extremists and Voldemort supporters could be hiding. Follow on investigations, arrests, and Veritaserum interrogations would serve to put them away, without giving up the secret of the Taboo.
