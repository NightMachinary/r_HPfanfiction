You don't get it. Voldemort has crossed the lines. The beggars in the street? Flashbacks to the ghettos. The Endl√∂sung didn't kill all in one day, it started like that, with people getting starved and dehumanised while others were already murdered.

In book 7, the Ministry is Nazi Germany. The only moral choice as a ministry employee is to flee, or actively fight it. Anyone who stays is an acceptable target or acceptable collateral damage. It doesn't matter what they do, they support a genocidal regime.

The argument about focusing on Horcruxes doesn't work - if the Order would actually be killing Death Eaters and collaborators, Voldemort would have to focus on them, freeing the trio up to hunt Horcruxes with less trouble. That's how enemy resources are tied up.

With regards to canon: If they could remote-cast spells like this, they would have used that in various means. And yes, I don't look for other explanations when the scene I'm reading is so stupid that it violates basic human capabilities and logic. Suddenly installing autmated spells never seen anywhere else, just to explain shity railroading (Heroes have to be captured!) is on the same level as some "and then Harry found the magical oath that Wizarding Britain had broken, and suddenly, all of them were squibs".

We simply should agree to disagree - I don't give canon the benefit of the doubt, and I scorn explanations to excuse obvious plot holes or plot railroading when they need far more "fanon" than canon.
