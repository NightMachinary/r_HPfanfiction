Well, if the Snatchers react that quickly, they certainly are /very/ determined to kill people. So, no Ministry clerks who don't really want to do this.

But, again, it's not possible to apparate faster than someone who says "Voldemort" and then apparates away - human reaction times simply do not work that way. Much less for an entire group. Unless you assume there's an automatic apparition system - something we have never, ever heard of. Just accept that JKR made another mistake.

Why didn't the trio apparate away? Shitty plot railroading. The idiot ball was passed around all the time in the last fewe books.

And no, I don't buy that "thematically fitting". Making up such stuff is no better than making up an old enchantment/vow that lets Lord Harry the Founder's heir drain the magic of everyone who ever violated some oath sworn by Merlin. It's shit, plain and simple.

And yes, you want to escalate against Voldemort. He already has escalated far, far more than is tolerable - he has started his genocide. Everyone, especially muggleborns and blood traitors, in his power are dead unless he is beaten.

Once the Ministry starts portkeying stuff to trigger traps, you have won. They are not sending snatchers out anymore. They can't know which taboo is safe and which is a trap, so they need to keep that up.
