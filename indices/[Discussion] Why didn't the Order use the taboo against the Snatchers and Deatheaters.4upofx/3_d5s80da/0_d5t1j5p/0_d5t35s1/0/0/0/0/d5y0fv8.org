  Well, if the Snatchers react that quickly, they certainly are very determined to kill people. So, no Ministry clerks who don't really want to do this.

Technically, they offered surrender first, which is rather fortunate for our protagonists.

  But, again, it's not possible to apparate faster than someone who says "Voldemort" and then apparates away - human reaction times simply do not work that way. Much less for an entire group. Unless you assume there's an automatic apparition system - something we have never, ever heard of.
#+end_quote

It fits the canon facts about as well as the alternatives. Portkeys can be triggered by words, cursed contracts by complex actions, and alarm spells abound. Items can be magically linked so that a change in one propagates to a change in the other. Why not Taboo-triggered apparation/portkey?

For that matter, using magic Hour-Reversal Charm (if you take that bit of Pottermore as canon), one can probably send information about Taboo being triggered, say, 20 seconds into the past without creating a paradox, which is plenty of time for Snatchers to get their act together.

#+begin_quote
  Just accept that JKR made another mistake.
#+end_quote

If you're going to dismiss canon events because you don't like their implications, then there's no point considering hypothetical actions in canonverse, whether for their moral or their tactical value, because /all/ canon is just fiction in the first place. So, if you are going to do that, why are you even involved in this discussion?

For any such discussion to be meaningful in the first place, all Watsonian explanations should be exhausted before we throw our hands up and go for Doylist.

  Why didn't the trio apparate away? Shitty plot railroading. The idiot ball was passed around all the time in the last fewe books.
#+end_quote

That's a Doylist explanation, so it's utterly useless in any discussion of feasibility or morality of any in-story actions.

#+begin_quote
  And no, I don't buy that "thematically fitting". Making up such stuff is no better than making up an old enchantment/vow that lets Lord Harry the Founder's heir drain the magic of everyone who ever violated some oath sworn by Merlin. It's shit, plain and simple.
#+end_quote

Of course it's better. One is making up the minimum necessary setting elements needed to make an apparent inconsistency in canon make sense, in a way that doesn't contradict our point-of-view character's observations --- and if somebody else has a better in-story explanation, they can say so; the other is coming up with elements that often /do/ contradict the point-of-view character's observations, don't resolve any apparent inconsistencies in canon, and often create their own apparent inconsistencies with themselves and with canon.

#+begin_quote
  And yes, you want to escalate against Voldemort. He already has escalated far, far more than is tolerable - he has started his genocide. Everyone, especially muggleborns and blood traitors, in his power are dead unless he is beaten.
#+end_quote

I don't want to get into a canon debate over what exactly they were and weren't doing and when --- and the beggars in the Alley do suggest that they weren't going for extermination --- but consider that while Voldemort's horcruxes are around, you can win a few battles but lose the war, because Voldemort can, in the ordinary course of things, beat up everyone on your side put together, or darned near that.

So, you might be better off focusing on horcruxes or anti-Voldemort weapons (like the Hallows), hide as many Muggleborns as you can, let DEs rest on their laurels, and let Voldemort go on his trips, rather than focus his whole ruthless genius on figuring out how to locate and capture or kill you.

#+begin_quote
  Once the Ministry starts portkeying stuff to trigger traps, you have won. They are not sending snatchers out anymore. They can't know which taboo is safe and which is a trap, so they need to keep that up.
#+end_quote

In this hypothetical approach, they are sending out hostages --- like Stan Shunpike --- under the Imperius, primed to cast the anti-disapparition jinx, and then they can apparate in troops at a safe distance and at their leisure. (This is just an example. Someone more familiar with wizard combat tactics --- such as a Death Eater --- could probably come up with something more efficient and effective.)
