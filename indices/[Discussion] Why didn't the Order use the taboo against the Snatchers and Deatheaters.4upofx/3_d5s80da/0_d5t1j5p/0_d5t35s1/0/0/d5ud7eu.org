  See above - you don't need to have to be present to ambush people. Remote-cast anti-apparition wards? Wow, that's in the same league as "Harry waves his hand, and all death eaters die".
#+end_quote

Why not? The Ministry could take down the protective enchantments around The Burrow, for example, or at least that's the common interpretation.

For that matter, what would be your Watsonian explanation for why the Trio didn't apparate away?

#+begin_quote
  If you could do that, far, far more spells would have been remote-cast.
#+end_quote

Like? How could the Ministry have used indiscriminately casting a spell on a location conditional on a word being said? If the remote spell is something nonlethal, it might be Voldemort himself triggering it, and then he gleefully slaughters those they send to the Taboo site; and if it's something lethal, he gleefully sends a Confounded or Imperiused victim to meet someone he wants dead and has him or her trigger the Taboo. With Dumbledore dead, the good guys didn't have that option.

Taboo + Anti-Disapparation is very thematically fitting, actually: the Ministry learns that something has happened, so it auto-issues a "stay where you are" order, while hitwizards apparate in and sort things out.

#+begin_quote
  So, no, you need people to apparate to the point the taboo noticed. And they cannot apparate faster than the one who triggered and apparated away, reaction time alone makes this impossible.

From DH:

  ‘Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol---'

  ‘HARRY, NO!'

  ‘---demort's after the Elder Wand!'

  ‘The name's Taboo!' Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent.
#+end_quote

Probably less than two seconds between the trigger and the apparation. You better be really confident that you've got your three Ds in place, though perhaps using a portkey that has the Taboo as the trigger word could work.

Speaking of portkeys, even if the Ministry can't remotely interdict disapparation, they can still likely portkey out something to trigger whatever traps have been left behind. If portkeys only work on humans, just use a prisoner under the Imperius to either to hold the portkey or to do the apparation. Are you sure you want to escalate against Voldemort?

#+begin_quote
  Sorry, but ambushes are far safer than you think. Unless you invent stuff to make them suicidal.
#+end_quote

Not suicidal. Just not as safe or as effective as people make them out to be.
