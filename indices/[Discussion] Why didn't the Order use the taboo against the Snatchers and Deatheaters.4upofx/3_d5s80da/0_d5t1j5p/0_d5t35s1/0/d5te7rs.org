See above - you don't need to have to be present to ambush people. Remote-cast anti-apparition wards? Wow, that's in the same league as "Harry waves his hand, and all death eaters die". If you could do that, far, far more spells would have been remote-cast. So, no, you need people to apparate to the point the taboo noticed. And they cannot apparate faster than the one who triggered and apparated away, reaction time alone makes this impossible.

Sorry, but ambushes are far safer than you think. Unless you invent stuff to make them suicidal.
