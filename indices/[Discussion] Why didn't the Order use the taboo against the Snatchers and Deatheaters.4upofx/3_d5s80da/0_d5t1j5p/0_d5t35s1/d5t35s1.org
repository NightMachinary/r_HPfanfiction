  Through ambushes, the Taboo would be rendered ineffective.

I just gave four reasons why that wouldn't necessarily be the case. Even if Taboo doesn't automatically trigger an anti-disapparation magic over the area around it, after the first ambush or two, they would institute countermeasures against ambush, and unless the ambusher can anticipate those, they die. And, there are many more Death Eater flunkies than there are those willing and able to pull off the ambushes, so the exchange favors Voldemort.

I am not saying that Taboo can't be turned around, but it's not as simple, as effective, or as unambiguously a good idea as people make it out to be.

  Place the word 'mudblood' under Taboo.

Maybe. The Ministry isn't the best at keeping secrets, especially since everybody is somebody's relative, and the fact that "mudblood" is Tabooed will leak very quickly indeed. Actual blood purists will start distracting the investigators by saying "mudblood" in the vicinity of various patsies, and just use "crudblood" or whatever else instead.
