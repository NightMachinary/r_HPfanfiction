  Hell, she even made a sport that is essentially 2 people actually competing while 12 others play to pass the time between start and snitch-catch, just to make Harry seem more relevant and impactful. My gamedesigner heart bleeds every time I read the actual rules of Quidditch (especially the scoring system).

One interesting explanation for it that I read in some fanfic a while back was that this is primarily due to brooms getting better and making the snitch easier to catch. The rationale was that a few decades back, the snitch would have been relatively more difficult to catch, making games last longer and the overall scores higher. With scores in the high hundreds, 150 was a fairly reasonable tiebreaker amount. The reasoning for the snitch still being worth 150 in the present day was that the international quidditch governing body resembled FIFA in its bureaucracy, and could not agree on how to amend the rules, resulting in the present situation of seeker dominance.
