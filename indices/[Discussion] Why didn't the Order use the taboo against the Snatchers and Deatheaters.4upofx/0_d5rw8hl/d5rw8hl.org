Why they didn't is quite clear: It would've taken the spotlight off of Harry and Rowling never did anything to take Harry's spotlight. If the Order would've worked a resistance, then Harry's part wouldn't be as "impressive" in comparison.

Hell, she even made a sport that is essentially 2 people actually competing while 12 others play to pass the time between start and snitch-catch, just to make Harry seem more relevant and impactful. My gamedesigner heart bleeds every time I read the actual rules of Quidditch (especially the scoring system).

If we disregard that this is a story and the sidecharacters didn't do much to make the protagonist look better, then I can only think of one thing. Demoralisation. All the Order knew was that their leader was gone, their Chosen One was on a trip somewhere searching something for who knows how long, and their country was so incredibly pathetic and passive that only a handful of people actually took up their everyday use lethal weapon (read wands) and fight. My headcanon here is that with the exception of some like McGonagall and Lupin, most Order members were already ready to pack and flee.
