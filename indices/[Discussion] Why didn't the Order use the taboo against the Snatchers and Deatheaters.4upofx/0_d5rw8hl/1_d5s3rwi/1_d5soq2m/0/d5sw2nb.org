Even better! An unforgivable is after all a one way ticked to Azkaban :) (so yeah: Draco should have been sent there never to come out again - I mean coerced or not, he could have tried to stun Harry or to use Petrificus Totalus or something!)

ps: Didn't remember this fully anymore (I just remembered that it wasn't just a combat spell Draco was casting, but something really really dark!)
