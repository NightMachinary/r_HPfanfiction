Maybe - but at that point I disliked that she wrote Harry in a way that made me want to SLAP him senseless (for squandering his talent, not having even a shred of a plan and being a general idiot (thus prooving SNAPE - of all people - and even Draco right!))...the only good thing he did in that book was his stupid self-sacrifice and telling Lupin that he's a fucking coward (note: I thought that he was a coward, a loser and stupid when he showed up as defense teacher...come on, just because you turn into a damned furry beast once a month doesn't mean you can't check up on your supposed best friend's kid every once in a while (you don't even have to talk to him, just check if he's alright), not to mention that he just believed the worst about Sirius - without any evidence, not to mention without a trial...come on I always give my friends the benefit of the doubt, that's what friendship means IMHO!))
