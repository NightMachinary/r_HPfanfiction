Thinking it and not questioning it (the lack of a trial should have been enough for very very serious doubts, I mean if they had enough evidence for a confiction (evidence that couldn't be doubted in any way!) they would have surely gone for it!) are two different things!

Those eyewitnesses were either unreliable or confounded (why? because the difference in who fired the curse should be obvious, even to muggles!)

Not to mention that Sirius didn't resist arrest - come on a hardened deatheater wouldn't just stand there laughing like a loon (not even Bella Lestrange is that far gone and she's quite mad!)
