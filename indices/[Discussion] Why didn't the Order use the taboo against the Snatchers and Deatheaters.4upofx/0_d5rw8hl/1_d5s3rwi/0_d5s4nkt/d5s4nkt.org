thats like you never actually graduated. What the hell...

But no, Rowling didn't, really. She just "exaggerated" the characters of all three of the trio. Harry was basically a manic depressive patient for the padded room clinic when they hit rock bottom, while Hermione clinged to her books, hoping beyond hope that she would find anything and Ron ran, seeking his home, his safety, driven by jealousy and hopelessness.

The last book was all previous books in extreme conditions you could say. While Hermione is keeping the ship steady over longer periods of time, Harry delivers the big heroic stuff when it counts.
