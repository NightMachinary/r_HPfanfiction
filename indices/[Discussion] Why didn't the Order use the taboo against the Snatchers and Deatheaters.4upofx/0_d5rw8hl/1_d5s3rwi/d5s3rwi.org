Didn't she? It was more like "Hermione and the Deathly Hallows" in the last book (Harry was demolished left and right IMHO...it's why I never finished the last book, I stopped reading when Hermione had everything planned and Harry was stumbling around like some simpleton who couldn't find his own arse without a map!)

I agree that the order wasn't that usefull (hell I would call most of the members useless - only Moody, Tonks, Shacklebolt and selected few others were any good in a fight (I still want to slap Rowling for having Molly kill Bellatrix...sorry, that's as unrealistic as it would be if I went out and killed a trained Delta Force Special Operator (which is highly unrealistic to say the least...someone like that would kill me before I could even point a gun at them :( ))...yeah, the normal people were pathetic, I agree (everybody carries a lethal weapon and they still cower in fear? Come on, band together and FIGHT...no wounder that I'd have left them to Voldemort in Harry's shoes (as long as they don't fight neither would I!))

If they (talking about the order, because come on Dumbledore isn't the be all end all - he's powerful, sure but I bet that say Flitwick, McGonagall and Moody together could at least fight him to a stand-still, if not actually beat him!) really were then "pathetic" and "useless" are both actually too nice adjectives for them (Harry and the others were ready to put their lives on the line and what did they do? Hide away somewhere with their heads in the sand? - Damned, everybody who didn't resist should be charged with collaboration :(

Then again: As I said the Wizward World in canon is really corrupt and yes: pathetic! I mean they let Draco walk (coerced my ass, the guy could have faked his death for example if he was serious in not wanting to fight for Voldemort, but no he endangered all of Hogwarts with his vanishing cabinet, not to mention that he tried to curse Harry in sixth year (ok Harry replied with "Sectum Sempra" but I don't think Draco was casting a tickling charm or a stunner!))...sorry, but with Harry's name and fame I'd have been out for some payback (I'd have called everybody a coward in the Prophet and I would have demanded that every deatheater be killed and sympathisers locked up for life!)
