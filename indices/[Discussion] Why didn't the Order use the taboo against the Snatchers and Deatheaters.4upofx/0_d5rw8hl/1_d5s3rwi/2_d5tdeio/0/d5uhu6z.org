I know, sometimes that's even better than a normal power-trip :) (working within pureblood-rules etc.)

I am still waiting for a fanfiction were Harry is some kind of muggle-born (he more or less is, because with his upbringing he knows less about the wizard world than other half-bloods) champion who unites all of them to push back against pureblood supremacy (in this case Harry and company might even be counter-supremacists and call - almost - all purebloods stuff like "inbred bigots" etc.) by using non-magical means (cellphones for example...I mean as far as we know two-way mirrors can only link one pair, so you would need a ton of mirrors for a communications-network!) in conjunction with magic (and they work cloak and dagger style - not tipping their hand unless necessary) :)

There's one fiction were something like that is going on...it's one were Voldemort took over, James Potter is dead, Lily is alive and called Lily Evans again (same for Harry because as the son of a traitor and a half-blood he's not allowed to have his father's name and neither is he given access to his father's money - it's something Voldemort later tries to bribe him with!) and muggle-borns are the botton of the social order (and treating them like shit is ok!), half-bloods are treated a little better (not much!) and Dark Arts are taught at Hogwarts...need to look that one up (maybe there are some more chapters now, as it wasn't finished!)
