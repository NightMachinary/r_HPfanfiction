From what we've seen the game doesn't last days and weeks, however. At least not at Hogwarts, which makes having the snitch at Hogwarts count the exact same is a bad decision.

My brother plays Rec Soccer. When the kids are too small to dribble across a full field (and defend a huge goal), they shrink the field and goal. When kids are too young to hit a basball, they use a tee. You change the rules of the sport to make it better align with peoples' skill level. In my elementary school gym class we even had volleyball where you could catch the ball (this was before they taught us how to set and bump).

Also it's 15x the number of points of a goal is ridiculous. The only instance where the snitch being caught doesn't matter is if one team is 15 goals down (which in pretty much every sport mean you are being killed). In any other situation, the seeker is the one who decides the game. No equally-matched teams will ever be more than 15 goals apart from each other (that's a 30 point swing in basketball). I can't think of a single Hogwarts game where the team that caught the snitch didn't win.

And lastly, for such a crucial role, the snitch is essentially random. Assuming two relatively similar skilled seekers, spotting the snitch and finding it seems to involve a lot of random searching. The snitch randomly chooses where to go and it can easily move towards the opposing seeker, giving them an unearned disadvantage. Normally (in sports like football, where windspeed is random) random factors aren't significant enough to swing games. But in Quiddich, they are.

Honestly, if I played Quidditch, I'd have one of my best fliers harrass the other team's seeker constantly, while my other players search for the snitch. I don't really understand why anyone focuses on the chasers (especially until a 15 goal differential is scored). Like Chasers shouldn't exist; it should be keepers, beaters, seeker, and seeker's helpers

EDIT: And now I spent 15 minutes of my life arguing about an imaginary game instead of reading/writing
