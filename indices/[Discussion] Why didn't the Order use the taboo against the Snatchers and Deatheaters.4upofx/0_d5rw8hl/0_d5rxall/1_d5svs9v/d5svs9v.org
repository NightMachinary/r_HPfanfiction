Either the seeker wins the game on his own or he's completely useless. It completely destroys the effort of everyone else on the team if one player can just turn a 140-0 game around with one move.

If, one the other hand, the chasers are already more than 150 points ahead then the seeker becomes essentially useless because the game is already over and they just have to wait until the snitch is caught.

The game would be more balanced if you either removed the snitch completely, give the game a time limit, and make the seeker a sort of independent disruptive element or you lower the points the snitch gives and make the seeker strategically more important because they will have to actually pay attention to how the game is going instead of just catching it whenever they see it.
