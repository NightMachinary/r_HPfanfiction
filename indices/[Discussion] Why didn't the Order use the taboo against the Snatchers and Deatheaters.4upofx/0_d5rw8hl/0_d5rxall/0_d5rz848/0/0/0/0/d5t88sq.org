So you /are/ speaking about goal-difference.

I agree with you that goal difference should be a factor in the league. However, this doesn't change anything when it comes to my assesment. The seeker should not score that difference, the chasers should. The seeker should only check if his chasers do well, and if yes, keep the enemy seeker from catching the snitch in order to make the difference bigger. If the chasers loose the seeker should try and catch the snitch (gaining a small amount of goals, maybe 30 points) to either win the game by a small margin or prevent further goals from happening.
