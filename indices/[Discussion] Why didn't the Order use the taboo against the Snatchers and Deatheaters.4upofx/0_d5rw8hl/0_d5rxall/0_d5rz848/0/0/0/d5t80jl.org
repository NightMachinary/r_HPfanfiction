I mean Gryffindor was able to win the league in the 6th year despite loosin that one match due to the massive point lead they achieved in the last match.

EDIT: and a smiliar thing happened during the third year, right? I have stray memories of Oliver Wood saying to Harry "You must catch the snitch ONLY when we have this many points, or we win the game but lose the league"
