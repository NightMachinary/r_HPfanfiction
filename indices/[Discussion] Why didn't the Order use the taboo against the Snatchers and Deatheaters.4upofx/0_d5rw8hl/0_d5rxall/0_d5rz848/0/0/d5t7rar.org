You need 10 points more than the other team to win. There is nothing more to the winning condition.

I'm not quite sure what your point is? The goal difference score in a league, or...?

The state of the seeker in the current rules of quidditch is overwriting most of the other player's efforts. It is strategic *but also* game-winning most of the time. It should be *just* strategic, in order to give meaning back to the efforts of the other players.
