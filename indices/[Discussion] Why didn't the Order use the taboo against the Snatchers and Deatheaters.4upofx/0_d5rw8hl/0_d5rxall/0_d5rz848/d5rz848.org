Well, Krum arguably ended the game to get it done and over with, seeing as the irish chasers destroyed the Bulgarians.

But that is beside the point.

The hotfix for Quidditch would be to decrease the points the seeker can score and therefore focus his position into a strategic one. 150 points - or 15 scores - is a disgustingly high amount of goals. We know from the 4th book that a seeker catching the snitch but not winning is rare. However, ending the game on the teams term is a nice mechanic. So you let the Seeker get, lets say, 30 points - or 3 scores. The moment this happens, the seeker becomes a strategic position that is no longer just about catching the snitch, but also about prolonging the game.

With that comes the change that the snitch should appear more often in the game, making the overall playtime shorter.

Yes, I know we're talking mostly about our experience of school-league Quidditch and I admit that I've read a few fic where the 150 points work. But given what we know, I come to the conclusion that the seeker positions score impact is the one huge flaw in the game. 15 goals is such a huge amount that if we compare that with real sports, the seekers would turn entire games more often than not, which is not what you want. You want equal teams competing and the better /team/ winning, not the better seeker.
