  My gamedesigner heart bleeds every time I read the actual rules of Quidditch (especially the scoring system).

Why? I'm curious because I've often thought the snitch may be worth too much, but if you take into consideration how long games purportedly last in the professional leagues, it isn't really a game-breaking amount of points. If a game lasted days/weeks, the points could be in the thousands, plus (IMO) the rest of the team is more "active" in the game in terms of working constantly towards scoring, whereas the seeker keeps an eye out to end the game (even if behind, a la Krum).
