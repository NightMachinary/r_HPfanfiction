I don't hate Rowling, I mean she wrote a children's book-series and probably knows less about military tactics than the average Call of Duty player!

Actually I like her for creating this wounderful world - still, I prefer well writen fanfiction over canon any day!

ps: Harry didn't have that much spotlight in the last book IMHO and when he had center stage: He was disappointingly clueless!
