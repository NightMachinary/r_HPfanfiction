we dont have contempt for the author. However Rowling created a world as diverse and as amazing as Middle Earth, yet unlike Tolkien, she refused to shine light on more than one facet. To compare the two, we have an enemy that is steadily gaining in power and taking over the land. We have an old grandfatherly wizard, who mentors the young protagonist. The young protagonist gathers a series of friends and allies, and eventually succeed at battling back the dark while trapezing across their magical world and discovering secrets within it.

Sounds shockingly familiar right? It is the formula for the contemporary fantasy novel. There are few rules in the formula : Antagonist that threatens the entirety of the world Protagonist lives in. Protagonist must have allies. Allies must be fleshed out characters to matter. The one point we have an issue with, is that JK forgot the last rule in the formula. "Make the world matter by exploring its nuances." By the third book, there isnt anything MAGICAL outside of hogwarts. By the seventh book, we dont even understand why Harry keeps fighting. (sure to survive and cuz a prophecy told him to boo hoo). But in every single other fantasy novel of note in the last fifty years, excluding Harry Potter, the world matters. Game of Thrones makes the landscape less about the world and more of the characters, then makes it apparent how the world functions around said characters. The inheritance saga, spent close to a whole book exploring the concept of natural balance in relation to characters. A key aspect of the book is Aleigasia. Twilight saga has the vampires battling against their natures to ensure that there is balance (yes the book is bad but whatever). Shoot even Star Wars follows the expanse of the world it builds and makes it matter. Just watch the Star Wars the Clone Wars series on netflix and you will grow to care about characters other than the MC.

Basically, JK fucked up in the formula. But she wrote the rest so well that we are enamored by the end result. JK didnt make magical britain worth saving, from the beginning. And it showed when she had the characters unable to pick up slack while the Trio attempted to make Voldemort Mortal. personally she should have done what Paoloni did during Eldest, Brisingr and Inheritance. She should have followed the trio, then followed say..Neville in hogwarts, then every few chapters focus on Snape and his involvement with Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Instead we get close to 600 pages of the Trio not knowing how to save a world full of characters we as readers dont give a fuck about.
