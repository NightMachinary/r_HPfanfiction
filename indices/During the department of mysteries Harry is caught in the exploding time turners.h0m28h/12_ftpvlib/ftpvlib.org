Story: Strange Visitors From Another Century [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820]]

Harry, Ron, and Hermione get thrown back to the Founders era. It's incomplete, but they stay while the Founders research how to send them back. They train them to fight etc. It has rough spots but overall it's really well done.
