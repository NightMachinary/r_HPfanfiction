If you get over the cringe factor in the first few chapters, the story gets interesting.

Like that one Naruto fic in which the MC is named Alvarcus, so I didn't bother to read it. Until I did and then found that the fic is actually funny and a good read.

Linkffn(The Unwoven Threads of Fate by Diadru) if you need it.
