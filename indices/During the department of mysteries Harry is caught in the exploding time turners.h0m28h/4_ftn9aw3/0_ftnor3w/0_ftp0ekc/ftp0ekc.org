There is also A long journey home. But 1. Its incomplete; 2. It has both past and present. Mostly past. 3. Its after mouldy.

There is 2 fic set you might like. I cannot remember the names (really sorry, someone else might remember)

The first fic is Harry in the past: Harry travels to the past (by mistake). He apprentices with Salazar Slytherin (no Slash). Learns a ton about the guy, learns a ton about magic, etc. He also meets the other founders throughout the story and goes to. One scene I remember is that SS tells HP that he will be buried with the DA coin (made by Herm) that harry gave him.

For some reason even Lucius Malfoy is also in the past, trying to attack hogwarts. Harry is super powerful, but inexperience. He helps defeat the forces attacking hogwarts. He also kills Malfoy.

1. Harry is not sent to his own timeline. He tells everyone that he met SS and the other founders. He brings back the original ward scheme of hogwarts. The whole fic he makes allies and frnds and works to defeat Voldy. SS (and GG also i think) visit him in the future. The whole new fic is about harry in current time.

Now that i have described the fics, I want to read it again. Someone please remember and tell me what the name(s) is (are).
