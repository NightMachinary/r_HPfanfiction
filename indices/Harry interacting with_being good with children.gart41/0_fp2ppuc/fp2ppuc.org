I got you fam

Grow Young with Me - linkffn(11111990) - One of the best parent fics out there if not the best.

The Little Child to Lead Him - linkffn(3123443) - A very cute fic about Harry being a father. Second best after Grow Young with Me.

The Drive in Being Alive - linkffn(13188485) - A decent series of one-shots showing a different take post epilogue. It involves Harry being fatherly but not as much as Picnic Panic.

A Baby Wizard and his Cousin - linkffn(1949002) - A Harmony story and pretty decent

Betrayed - linkffn(1291535) - It is a story about Harry/OC, it is a very interesting story and does center on Harry being a father.

Black coffee, with sugar - linkffn(12414949) - A story about how Harry finds out about a child

Harry Potter and the Greatest Gift - linkffn(7969757) - Another very sweet fic and well done

An Adoption - linkffn(12823890) - An incomplete Harmony story but was well done until the author left it.

Adopted - linkffn(5813363) - Here is a complete Harmony story that I thought was good.

Found - linkffn(5573547) - By the same author as Adopted, an older story of theirs. Still Harmony.

Delicate - linkffn(2926255) - Another Harmony, and Harry becomes a father a little later on in the story but it does happen.

And that is my list of stories that have some focus on Harry being a father. And some stories about Harry being good with children.

Uncle Harry - linkffn(12282305) - And here is a very nice fic about Harry being the favorite uncle.

Head Boy Potter - linkffn(10942945) - Harry being good with students which there really needs to be more of.

It's nice to see my incessant need recommend Picnic Panic is making more people enjoy the 'Harry being a father' troupe. There are some more I believe where Harry is good with children but this list is already too long. Just PM if you want some more.
