I have a story with this idea in my IDEAS folder! :) I got the idea from Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword where the magic hero sword has a spirit entity inside it, or the personification of it, yes. :) But yes in my harry potter story I'm expanding this to make my own magic wand lore and every wand has one. :) It's going to be kind of a TOTAL AU because I changed the history of the magic societies and a bunch of laws and stuff to account for them. :)
