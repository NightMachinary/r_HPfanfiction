This is the only fic I've ever actually READ where Harry's magic is a person, but it pisses me off in SO many ways. Going to post it here so you can try. Who knows? Maybe you'll like it. The story is titled "Harry Potter and the Manifesting Magic" and it is written by TrekTech.

That being said, I've heard a lot of good things about "Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome" so I recommend you make that priority. I still haven't read it though.
