Based on your (as of now) two comments in this thread, have you come here to be an arse to people by providing unasked for negative critique of no worth, or do you plan on actually contributing constructively?

Because while yes, characters do matter, they are not the only thing that matters and the person you were replying to is absolutely right in saying that the duel between Albus and Tom is one that most people would not be capable of and as such average duels would not be similar to it. You can disagree with their ideas of how to handle it, but calling them a bad writer for it without offering anything worth the unwarranted and thus rude interruption ... well, you aren't giving people much of a reason to agree with you at all about anything, let me tell you that.
