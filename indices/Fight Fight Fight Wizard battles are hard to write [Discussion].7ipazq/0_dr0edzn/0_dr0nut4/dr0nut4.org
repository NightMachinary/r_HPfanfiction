I have to partially agree. Sure, not every fight can (or even should) be epic, but a low level fight won't necessarily be stale. I mean, the characters aren't /defined/ by their magic, and I'm sure a creative writer (which I am...not) could make use of things beyond that, like the environment or plot items, plot devices, and stuff. I mean, muggle action scenes aren't boring because they don't have magic, right?

...

Sorry, tbh I have 0 idea of what makes a good (written) action scene :|
