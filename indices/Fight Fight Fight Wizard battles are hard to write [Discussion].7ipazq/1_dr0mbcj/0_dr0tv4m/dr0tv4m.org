I prefer to have individual styles for each character. People like Dumbledore, McGonagall or Tonks will heavily rely on transfiguration while the Black sisters prefer attack as their defense, with Bella heavily relying on Dark magic and most notably the Cruciatus while Andromeda goes for precision and speed over raw power. Narcissa is the creative one, throwing in odd charms for unexpected results. Snape uses obscure, dark magic and Voldemort rapid fires killing curses unless up against opponents like Dumbledore. Hermione is hesitant at first, trying to get a feeling for the enemy before exploiting any found weaknesses.

As for Harry I prefer to go with him practicing a small arsenal of spells to perfection, relying on the counterattack and dodging. Better to properly learn five spells than half ass 50.
