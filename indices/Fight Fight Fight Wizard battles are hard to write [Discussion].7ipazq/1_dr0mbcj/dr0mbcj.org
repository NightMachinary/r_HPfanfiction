Every decent writer will make the environment, transfiguration etc part of a fight (though bad writers still write magical combat as spell tennis). What the best writers do is use the plot and environment in conjunction to give the battle narrative structure as well as dynamic movement. That is to say: the characters should have strategic goals they want to achieve which are determined by the plot. The characters are not there for the purpose of fighting - fighting is the thing standing between them and their goals. A fight with this in mind has a completely different feel to it, one that I think is more interesting.

The OotP DoM battle is a good example of this - not the Dumbledore vs Voldemort fight (which is good for different reasons), but the fight between the Death Eaters and the DA members. Both sides have objectives: the Death Eaters to get the prophecy, the kids to escape. Where and when and how they fight, and where they choose not to fight, or to abandon a fight which has already begun, is dictated by the differing priorities these objectives contain.
