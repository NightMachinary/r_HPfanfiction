I'm not a writer but overall I agree however let me ask you a question how would you write Bellatrix -an exceptionnal duellist- in a fight considering she never showed once any transfiguration skills throughout the book ? I'm not implying she isn't skilled, far from it, I just find it unsettling that in all the numerous fight she had, there were never any use of the environnement to take the upper hand of the fight.
