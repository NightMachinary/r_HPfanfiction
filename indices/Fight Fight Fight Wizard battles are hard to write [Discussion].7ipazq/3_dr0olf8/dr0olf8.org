I wrote a wizard fight and it didn't turn out so well, so I changed it to a sword fight. Likely a lack of creativity on my part, but I think one mistake was to make it a fight to the death and one Avada Kedavra and it's s all over. I just couldn't find a way to make it exciting. Swords I feel I did a bit better with.
