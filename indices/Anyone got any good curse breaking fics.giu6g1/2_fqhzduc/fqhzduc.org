One of my favorites is linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter). Then there's the big ones like Cursed Summer and Bungle in the Jungle but I figure you've already read those.

Honestly, the easiest way to find cursebreaking fics is to just filter for Bill Weasley and sort by favorites, all the ones at the top are cursebreaking stories
