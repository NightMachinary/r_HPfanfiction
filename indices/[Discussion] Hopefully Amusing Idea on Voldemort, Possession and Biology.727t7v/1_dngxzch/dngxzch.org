  what if Voldemort is just no good with pets?

Or if he just did't care. Depending on how easy it was for him to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf][bodysurf,]] it could've been more convenient for him to just burn the bodies out and switch hosts than bother with the whole mortal “taking care of the body” thing. Ugh.

And snakes could've either just been more fun for him to “roleplay” as or provoked at least some kind of empathic reaction.

Also, I think this is good enough to also be posted to [[/r/FanTheories/]] (unless it already has been, somewhere in the past).
