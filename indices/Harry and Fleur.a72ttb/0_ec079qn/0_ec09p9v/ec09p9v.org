It's called 'good taste'. Look it up.

Jokes aside, it's because age difference aside they make a better match than arguably every other Harry/female character, although much of it is Fleur not having enough of a role for JKR to manage inserting negative interactions between the two like she did with Ginny and Hermione. She's basically a cross between the two of them without the baggage, plus more similar social context with Harry than both of them put together.

All this good stuff however is generally wasted because most flowerpot fics are power fantasies and of course Fleur is the choicest bird of the setting.
