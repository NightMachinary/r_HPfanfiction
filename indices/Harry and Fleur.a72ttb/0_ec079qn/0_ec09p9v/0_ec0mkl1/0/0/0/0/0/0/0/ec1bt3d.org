I don't mind canon characters being OOC in fanfiction. I get it, it's fanfiction, and most people write it so that they can fix things they felt was wrong about the original series. Having said that, DM/HG is one the worst pairings there can be, right there with Snape/anyone and Voldemort/anyone, especially while they're still in school.

Saying that canon Fleur is a lonely wallflower though, is just too much.
