  People seem to look at her and see only the half-veela, just as they only see "The Boy-Who-Lived" when looking at Harry

Agree with the seeing Harry as only the BWL thing, but the seeing only the veela thing in Fleur is pure fanon. She's never shown as isolated at all in Book 4 - she seemed pretty outgoing, confident and sure of herself, like most 17 year old girls who know they're beautiful are. In fact, her confidence almost borders on arrogance.

Fleur is just not descirbed well at all in canon. She's shown to be very talented, both from being the Champion of her school and being hired by Gringotts immediately after graduating, and fiercely protective of her little sister, as shown by her reaction to the Second Task, but the rest of her is a blank slate.

She dates Bill for a few months, and is suddenly engaged to him at the start of Book 6 - I always found that to be super weird.
