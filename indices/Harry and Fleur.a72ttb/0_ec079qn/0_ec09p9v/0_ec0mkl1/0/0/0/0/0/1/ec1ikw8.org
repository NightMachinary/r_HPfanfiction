  Treatment like a sex object would mean that boys and men would be constantly hounding her for sex.

To me it would also suggest rather less agency on her part than is actually portrayed. When Ron is captivated and asks her to go to the Yule Ball with him, she's not interested - so she shuts him down without even needing to speak. She is passionately devoted to her little sister. She makes it very clear to Molly Weasley that she has chosen Bill - for his personality, not his looks - and woe betide anyone who thinks they can get in her way. She definitely comes through as a person rather than an object.
