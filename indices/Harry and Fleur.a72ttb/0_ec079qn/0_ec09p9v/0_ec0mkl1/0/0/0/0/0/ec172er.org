  She's treated as a sex object throughout GoF
#+end_quote

A few hormonal teenage boys ogling a girl does not make for "treatment like a sex object". Treatment like a sex object would mean that boys and men would be constantly hounding her for sex. That does not, in spite of fanon's best efforts, ever happen.

Hormonal teenagers ogling at pretty girls is the most natural thing in the world. It is not, in any way or form, treating said girl as a sex object.

  Ron tried to ask her to the ball
#+end_quote

14 yo Ron is absolutely clueless about girls. He yells at her, asking for a date, due to his own lack of...several things, manners and courtesy being a few of them, and runs off mortified. That's just Ron being an immature teenager, not Ron treating her like a sex object. Get real.

  her actual Yule Ball experience with Roger Davies
#+end_quote

Read up the Yule Ball chapter again. She enjoys the Ball with Davies - HP sees them walking in the gardens with Davies, kissing along the way.

  Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.

  "'Ow dare you!" shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him. Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rosebush. "I 'ave nevair been more insulted in my life! 'Alf-giant? Moi? I 'ave - I 'ave big bones!"

  Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall.

As you can see, she's clearly having a good time, like any other 17 year old at a social event involving dancing and alcohol.

  There's also how shes treated by Molly and Ginny in HBP, solely due to her nature and nationality.
#+end_quote

That just shows that the female Weasleys are terrible hosts, and are uncouth - which shouldn't come as a surprise when you remember what Molly says to Sirius in Book 5. None of the other members in the Order treat her that way.
