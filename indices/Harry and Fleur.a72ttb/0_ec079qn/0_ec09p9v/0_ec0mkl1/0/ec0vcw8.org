  I 100% agree that Harry/Fleur makes much more sense than Harry/Ginny
#+end_quote

Wait, why? The biggest obstacle I can see to Harry/Ginny is that Ginny gets hardly any screen time, so their relationship is kind of "surprise! dating now!" - but Fleur gets even less time than that.

In Ginny's case, we at least know that she has a temperament not entirely unlike Harry's best friend, that they share some interests and laugh at each other's jokes. In Fleur's case...well, she's part-Veela, so naturally she's stunning to look at, but that's pretty shallow and Harry definitely finds Ginny attractive too. Why does Harry/Fleur make "much more sense"?
