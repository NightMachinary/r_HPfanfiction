Side question. I read a fic years ago that started out with Harry and Fleur meeting in 4th year and becoming BFFs. It follows canon but at some point she breaks up with Bill and then her and Harry are together. It wasn't nearly as angsty as it sounded. I read it like 9 years ago. It was definitely complete. Do you know this one?
