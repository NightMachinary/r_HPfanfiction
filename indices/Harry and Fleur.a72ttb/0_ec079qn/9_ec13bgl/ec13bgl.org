Literally just finished Cadmean Victory and I am super surprised by the story. It's truly amazing. Yes, some of it can be a bit weird, but it constantly found a way to subvert my expectations - and left me wanting more. The tone shift in the last 10 or so chapters is truly amazing.

Really recommend! Don't get attached to anything or anyone. :(((((((((

Also, does anyone know if the author intends to make a sequel? The epilogue kind of left it open for a continuation/sequel.
