You have great taste :) - it's among my faves (the others being Harry/Hermione (but only if he doesn't become whipped and is constantly bossed around by her and as long as she doesn't turn into a servile walking encyclopedia!), Harry/Tonks (seriously, she deserves better than the professional victim, Remus Lupin, who always runs when the going gets tough!) and Harry/Slytherin-Girl...with Harry/Older Woman (Narcissa, Bellatrix etc.) being a guilty pleasure I don't actually feel guilty for! Hell, I also read power-trips sometimes, they are funny if you don't take them too seriously!)...especially since Fleur would probably push Harry to be the best he can be (she is ambitious and talented (she charmed a Dragon to sleep after all!) IMHO, because otherwise she would not have been the Champion for her school), while he would keep her grounded (she's a bit of snob after all!)
