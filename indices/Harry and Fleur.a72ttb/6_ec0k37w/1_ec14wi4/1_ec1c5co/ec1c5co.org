I was into fetish and bdsm things since I was about 7. Obviously I didn't know the terms and I really didn't have much context for such feelings, but the idea of domination and submission, humiliation and sadism, the concept of tying and being tied were present and powerful even back then.

When I got into the internet years later (I am that old), a new world opened up for me and many things got explained (and I found out I wasn't the only one with such feelings).

EDIT: to prevent misunderstanding, I've had a pretty normal and happy childhood, nobody abused me and I never saw someone abused either. I simply had these feelings as something not really sexual at first (I became sexually active late, actually). Some people are just wired that way, mostly like someone can be gay or straight without it being sexual, you just prefer looking at cute boys instead of cute girls.
