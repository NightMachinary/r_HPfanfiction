Flowerpot is mine too! Here are my favs, haven't found anything super recent that sparks anything for me.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8848598/1/Allure-Immune-Harry][Allure Immune Harry]] is my favorite little sweet one shot.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] on the 1% chance you haven't read it. Personal favorite, such a fun guilty pleasure. Abandoned.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power by Fettucine]] is an old good one that has thankfully been recovered. Abandoned. But it's great.
