[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Ginny fit in very well under Grindelwald's leadership. [[/spoiler][They didn't really search for Horcruxes, but captured Voldemort and tortured their locations out of him. When the Goblins refused to give up the Cup, they stormed Gringotts and killed most of the Goblins.]]

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]]: It's a crossover with BtVS. Ginny gained the Slayer power and took the lead in Horcrux hunt. She did most of the heavy lifting, but the others made major contributions too.
