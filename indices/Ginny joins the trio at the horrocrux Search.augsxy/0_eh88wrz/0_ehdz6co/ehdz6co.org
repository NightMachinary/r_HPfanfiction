I believe it was written during the DH was published (so it can react to it in some parts), but yes, it is AU to DH. What's more important, it is really good. I have written [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][elsewhere]] that *ALL* fanfiction stories could be cut in half for the general improvement. That is not true about this story. Author of this mentions help of some professional editor as a beta-reader and it shows. Story flows rather well, and there are few pages I felt need to skip. Really good story, highly recommended.
