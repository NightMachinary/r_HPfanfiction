I don't think I'd call what happens in Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire bashing. The ire Ron had for Harry is instead directed at Hermione. This damages their friendship more than it damaged Harry/Ron. They both act like children (including a particularly good part where Hermione chews out Ron for acting out without knowing it was in her defense).

Needless to say Her going with Harry was not even really part of the drama going on with Ron/Hermione.

I don't recall if the one where Mcgonagall recruits Hermione as Harry's date when he is clueless had any Ron bashing. The premise certainly doesn't require it.

That would be Yuletime Blessings in Disguise. I haven't rescanned it to see if there is any bashing, but I don't think so? linkffn(12773140)
