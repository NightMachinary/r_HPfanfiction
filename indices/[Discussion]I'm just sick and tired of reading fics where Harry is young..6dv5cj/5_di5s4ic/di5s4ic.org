I was already an adult when I read the books (I was introduced to them by my daughter). So I was never deeply engaged by any of the young characters, only by the adult characters. And I'm still not particularly interested in Harry, Ron, Hermione, et al, no matter what their age.

I did write an adult Harry story once, and I got to like him a bit better. But it's not very popular and I do wonder if my general disinterest in him as a character comes through. I hope not, obviously.
