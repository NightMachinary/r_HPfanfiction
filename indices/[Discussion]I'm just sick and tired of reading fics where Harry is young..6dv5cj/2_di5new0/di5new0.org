I'm mostly in agreement with you. There are a few stories that are different and well-written enough that the early years are interesting. Linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) is one that springs to mind, but most just change one or two things then go through the canon events.

Starfox5 did a clever thing in linkffn(Patron) where the story starts in fifth year and uses flashbacks to fill in the back story. So yes, we get a troll attacking Hermione but not all the other boring crap from first year.
