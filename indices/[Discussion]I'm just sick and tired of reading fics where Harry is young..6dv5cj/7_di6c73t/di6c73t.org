Personally i would say im pretty much your opposite.

Aside from crossovers if Harry is outside the 6-24 range i generally lose interest in the story full out. With my pure HP stories im more interested in the "canon rehash" stories because i like reading butterfly effect style stories where Harry either grows up differently or gains a specific skill and seeing how that change affects his hogwarts life.

When i do read crossovers there can be an important distinction to be made. If the story is set in a blended universe then i usually prefer reading a Harry going through hogwarts with whatever appropriate changes applied. If the fic is set in another series' universe then i dont mind Harry being a few years out of hogwarts just so that he can more easily fit into the authors plot.

Now there is a type of story which i have never read and really have no interest in reading. Marauder era and Potter children fics, i have zero interest in these genres and usually avoid them at all costs. I read fanfiction to read about Harry in his prime, not his family.
