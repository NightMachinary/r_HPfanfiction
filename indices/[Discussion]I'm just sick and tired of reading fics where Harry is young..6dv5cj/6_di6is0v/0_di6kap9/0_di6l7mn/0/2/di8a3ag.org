While some of those are valid, a few are not.\\
A) They didn't expect an attack at all, since they were under Fidelius, so borrowing the cloak for a day or two wouldn't have seemed like such a big deal.\\
B) What makes you think he cast the Fidelius? The book doesn't say that at all. If it requires a third person besides the secret-keeper and the ones to be hidden, it's likely Sirius did it. Dumbledore did not know about the switch, the object was to keep it from everyone.\\
C) It's likely the Longbottoms were under the same protection. But the attack on them happened a few days AFTER Voldemort attacked baby Harry and "died". So they came out of hiding. Everyone thought the threat was over.\\
D) agree\\
E) also agree\\
F) Eh, he seems to have thought that Harry would already know all about the wizarding world from Petunia, so just needed someone to take him shopping. He didn't expect Hagrid to actually have to explain stuff. And as a bodyguard, Hagrid is a decent choice. He's tough and good in a fight, as is shown in book five.\\
G) agree, but the wizarding world is vastly different than ours culturally, almost more like a warrior society. They don't seem to mind putting kids in a lot of danger. A magical educations seems to be incredibly dangerous anyway.
