Personally I can't see Dumbledore as an effective leader of the light.

A) he had the invisibility cloak away for "study" when he really should've left it with Lilly who might actually need it.

B) he knew Peter petigrew was the secret keeper because he cast the Fidelius, yet didn't do shit to help Sirius.

C) why did he leave the longbottoms totally defenseless? He knew the prophecy could also apply to them.

D) he didn't get a child struck by a killing curse any medical attention before leaving him on a freezing porch overnight.

E) his decision to not only leave Harry with the dursleys, but with a complete lack of oversight is impressively bad.

F) he assigned hagrid to introduce him to the wizarding world, when clearly any teacher, even including snape would have been better.

G) He set a trap for a dark lord in a school full of children.

I could go on.
