Yes, the Canon plot (or Dumbledore) was actually awful. But if he had acted more competently, like in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), he would have crushed Canon Voldemort like a bug. So to write Dumbledore more competently and keep the plot exciting, you need to raise Voldemort's competence as well, or make the Ministry a lot more sympathetic to him.
