I rather disagree. I rarely like fics where Harry is older. Mostly because it seems the only way authors know to write a 16-or-older Harry is to make him /angry/ and /impulsive/ to the point that I simply can't root for him at all. But there's also the fact that younger Harrys:

- generally have less personality, which you could see as a bad thing but I think helps with the identification process;

- are found in alternate versions of Books 1, 2, 3 and 4, which is fortunate because they're my favourite books;

- usually discover Hogwarts at the start of the story, allowing for more changes to the canon plotline. If you take a Harry who's already been through the five first books, you close yourself many possibilities both in plot and in worldbuilding.
