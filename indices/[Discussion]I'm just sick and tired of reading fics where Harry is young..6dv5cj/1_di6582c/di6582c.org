I don't mind reading a story that covers the younger years. What I do mind is when 11 year old Harry acts like a 20 year old. I understand the theory that wizards mature quicker than muggles so fine. But I think some authors can get impatient wanting harry to grow up. Thus we see this super mature Harry that is honestly not relatable to 11 year olds because of maturity and 20 something year olds because of age.
