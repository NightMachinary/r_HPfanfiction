I usually find my stories by google search or this reddit, though when I do manually search in FF.net, I usually filter out by most follows/reviews/favorites and a length of at least 60,000 words. Though I do sometimes forgive shit writing if the plot of the story is good.

Every once in a while I'll sift through a bunch of bad stories in search of some good ones. Has worked out quite well for me on occasion, and sometimes not.
