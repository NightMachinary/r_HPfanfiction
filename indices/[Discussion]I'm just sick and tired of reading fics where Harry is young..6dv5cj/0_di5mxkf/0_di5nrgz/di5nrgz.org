  average quality of fanfics to improve.

I think that's being generous. We get plenty of new blood as young people read the HP series for the first time or watch the movies, esp. with Fantastic Beasts giving the series more attention. Maybe I'm just being cynical.

I think it's fair to say that the average quality of the top 10% of fics is substantially higher than it was 15 years ago.
