I have no patience for pre-Hogwarts fics either. The only exception that comes to mind is /Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them/, which is, well... fantastic.

I don't mind year one to seven fics though, and I understand why most authors write them. It's much harder to write a post-Hogwarts fic because you no longer have the whole framework of canon to rely on.
