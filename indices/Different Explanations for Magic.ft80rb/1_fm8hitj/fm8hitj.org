I'm not good at explaining stuff but here's the gist of idea I once read.

So there's free energy like a net of energy that the universe has and wizards or anything magical can tap into this and becomes a kind of conductor. they can tap into this and create distortion by adding or removing in the system.

Anyway, the sciencey stuff tell that the parallel plane is separated from our world and that this "leakage" of gravitons from the brane(stuff that separate the planes) into higher-dimensional space causes distortion (I'm pretty sure I got stuff wrong) thus things don't seem to be mathematical consistent and stuff.
