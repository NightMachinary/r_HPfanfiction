Alright, well let me elaborate on why Muggles would be destroyed by Wizards in a heartbeat. There are simply too many concessions that have to be made in a scenario where Muggles win. I think as I make an argument, it'll reveal how magic in canon is conceptual (obvious example would be Gamp's law btw)

A president is "made to forget" a phone call to the British Prime Minister for an impromptu meeting between Fudge and the Prime Minister. Other aspects of magic aside, you know what we would call espionage on this level in the muggle world? Flawless.

Concession 1 - Despite the wizarding world having clear control over Muggle government, muggle governments and other political powers are capable of acting against wizards. Concession 2 - Enough of the muggle world finds out about magic, and decides that military action against wizards is actionable. Okay, but what are they going to act against? Muggle-repelling charms, unplottable charms, other magical protections keep muggles from even noticing, much less targeting wizarding locations. Here is an example of canon magic being conceptual. The unplottable charm relies on the concept of a map. /Any map/ cannot display that which is unplottable.

Concession 3 - Despite muggles not noticing people waltzing around in train stations being blatant wizards, and canonical evidence as to the strength of muggle-repelling charms, muggles somehow manage to target a wizarding location. Maybe they nuke London, deciding that an insane amount of civilian casualties is worth killing a part of the wizarding population. They target Diagon Alley flawlessly. A nuclear missile is launched (despite the implausibility as this requires plottability), and it flies in a clean path. A ballistic nuclear warhead detaches flying straight towards its target. It enters Diagon Alley (possibly not even this - I'll elaborate later) and promptly smashes into Gringotts, killing a few unfortunate goblins. Why didn't it detonate? Magic interferes with electricity and nuclear warheads rely on electricity. Since nuclear warheads cannot confirm that they're supposed to detonate without their electrical functions, well, functioning, they won't detonate because of failsafes.

Concession 4 - A nuke goes off. Well it's not going to do that much. Wizards have enhanced reflexes (stated many times in the books), enchanted protections (commonly called wards) and other mechanisms. /But oh my god so much energy is in a nuke?! How on earth could a wizard defend against a nuclear missile?/ Well that is decidedly muggle thinking. First of all, magic is not energy. As such, it cannot be compared to the theories of energy muggles have developed. We know from JK Rowling that magic overrides mundane nature. The greatest threat to magic is other magic. Concession 5 - Magic can be treated as an energy and does not override mundane nature. Alright, well still doesn't matter. You know how much energy is implied in transfiguration or conjuration? A whole lot. Having established that magic is obviously capable of generating the "energy" to stop a nuke under this unlikely scenario, let's look at some other factors. Radiation and heat are often named as things that would bypass a protego. Again, this fails to consider the conceptual nature of magic. A protego defends against harm (except for Avada Kedavra - again reaffirming that magic is vulnerable to magic only). Radiation and heat clearly fall under concepts of harm.

Concession 5 - Wizards cannot defend against nukes with shield-like protections. Cushioning charm, arresto momento, flame-freezing, and apparate away.

Concession 6 - Cushioning charms, momentum halting charms, and flame-freezing charms don't work on nukes. Well the light still reaches you before the shockwave so that's plenty of time to apparate under a wizard's reflexes.

The next part of an argument for muggles would typically involve guns. For this, there's the concession again of concession 3v2. Protego. Concession 4v2 - It doesn't work cause "bullets are too fast" (disregarding the faster than one could see casting of magic in the books). There's enchanted protective clothing. Concession 5v2 - Bullets can't be stopped by shields. Alright well you have the imperturtable charm to repel bullets. Again stating that bullets would not be repelled similar to the dungbomb's is muggle thinking. Magic is conceptual and repels any object all the same. Just repelling an object contravenes muggle's models of the world.

Let's say that ultimately, Muggles can kill wizards. Wizards can still apparate, something muggles can do nothing over. Even in a scenario where many of the concessions apply, and a nuke devastated the ministry of magic, wizards would only have to regroup to destroy muggles. Like it or not, canonically muggles would lose to wizards. Why? Magic is conceptual and overrides mundane nature.
