Heh. You sound mildly irritated - did you post this on a bad day or is this just an argument you have to make often? :D

Apologies for the delay in response, incidentally. I wanted to look into a few things you've said and make sure I had some good questions.

Before I actually attempt to rebut, I'd like to ask a few clarifications, if I may (they may appear to be phrased like criticisms, but I assure you they aren't and I'm just trying to understand your points further - I haven't been sleeping well recently and my brain is struggling to phrase things well). Perhaps I do have this wrong, after all.

Regarding your 'faster than one could see casting', I'm assuming that means you're taking the latter 'Rule of Cool' battles version of Rowling's Magic 'System' that allowed Harry to cast Sectumsempra without knowing pronunciation or purpose rather than the initial 'Pronunciation and knowing what you're doing is vital', then?

Because if you still had to 'say' the incantation (in your head for silent casting or verbally for non-silent), then that's still at least a second or so to speak then swish and flick (wingardium leviosa, for example) and not as instantaneous as you seem to think.

How are you defining 'concepts'? Is this some platonic overrealm where 'map' means the same thing to everyone or is it reliant on the concept of 'map' in the mind of the caster? And if it is the latter, then how are those concepts associated? Does harm mean maiming, killing, burning, etc? (also, interesting aside, is this why Hogwarts is so dangerous? To teach kids to make associations with as many dangers as possible in order to get their shield spells up to snuff? :D).

eg. A Modern Muggleborn casts the spell, knows about Sat-Navs and such and counts them as maps, but a Wizard casting it back in a thousand AD would have a more 'conceptual' concept of maps (they were strictly representative back then, not descriptive - more for teaching and demonstrating than navigation). Does satellite imaging count as an image or a map? Also, if Hogwarts is unplottable on the concept of maps, why does the Marauder's Map work?

Same with Harm. Wouldn't that depend on what the Caster's concept of harm was? Hence why the stink-bomb went through a shield charm and the glass Dumbledore repels in the Atrium didn't (also 'repels any object all the same', but doesn't repel stink-bombs?) - it wasn't perceived as 'harm'. So, if you're aware of bullets and know they're 'harm', then they'd be stopped, but otherwise they wouldn't be? And surely if it was conceptual, the Killing Curse would be the ultimate example of the 'Harm concept'?

And how would the unplottable spell be implemented when locations are removed from maps? Given that we have now mapped the entire planet, would a conceptual removal of places from maps just lead to blank spaces we don't see or would it replace those spaces with land like it was never built (and incidentally, Hogsmeade is canonically plottable, so they'd see the village easy and apparently Muggles see the Castle as ruins - see Hermione's lines in GoF for that one).

And does it prevent them from knowing the location at all, or just from finding it? eg. "Hey disenfranchised Muggleborn, here's some money and a job you can't get in the Magical World, do you know what's next to Diagon Alley? And hey, isn't that Hogsmeade place plottable? And isn't it right next to Hogwarts? What's that ruined castle over there? Isn't Hogwarts a castle?"

Ah, and there's another question - politics. Do you see Muggleborns as siding with the Ministry or with the Muggles? Does this attack take place before, during, or after the war? Could a bomb/nuke from inside the protections cause harm?

What's the range of the 'interferes with electricity' effect? Is it absolute (cast spell, no electricity) or random (cast spell, lights flicker and sometimes turn off, sometimes not)? Given that the areas around Diagon Alley and St Mungos aren't a wasteland, there are people living there in London and I highly doubt anyone would be willing to live in a place with no Electricity in London of all places, I've always thought that's one of Rowling's more iffy attempts at worldbuilding, but I'll play along with it.

I haven't read the books in awhile, but googling doesn't seem to find anything about enhanced reflexes. Could you provide a citation or something for that, please? But even reactions can't make up for lack of awareness, no? A sniper team with a suppressor shooting from a mile away, the bullet would hit before the sound did - and since they tend to operate in eight-man teams with four shooters, that's four people at once. And we have a lot of Snipers - if you go with Rowling's semi-canonical 'there are 3000 wizards in Britain' line, then I'm pretty sure we have about as many snipers as they have people.

And on that note, how many Magical combatants (with experience of being shot at) are you envisioning? As any soldier will tell you, a warzone with guns and bombs is a very stressful place - they have to be conditioned to run towards those things where the normal people run away from them. Spells are quiet, aside from the people yelling incantations, where Muggle weaponry is loud and distracting (possibly to the point where an apparating Wizard could be distracted enough to splinch themselves, no?).

And regarding protective clothing - I'm assuming you're referring to the shield hats the Weasley Twins made because most of the Ministry couldn't cast a decent Protego? I don't remember anything else featured in the books, so please do clarify if I'm forgetting something. How long would those last? Do they reduce with each 'hit', so to speak?

To summarise - I don't doubt that magic is more powerful, but my questions all seem to be about the point of failure being where it always is - in people. But I am a psychologist, so it's the lens I see most things through. :D

I also apologise for how garbled some of the order of this is. Like I said, I'm low on sleep. I just wanted to respond before I forgot to or accidentally clicked 'mark all as read' again. :D
