Quality varies, but most of these were quite good iirc. I'm including The Elder Sect even though it's too short for your taste simply because it's hilarious.

Is yaoi slash? If so, whoops, because Of Wizards and Heroes is on this list. Which, by the way, is probably the best HPxMCU crossover there is, and the romance is a) barely there, b) not explicit: definitely PG13, and c) only even mentioned in the last 2-3 chapters iirc. Give it a try, it's a great read imo.

EDIT - I thought I went back and removed the ones other than Elder Sect that were too short, but apparently I failed. Whoops?
