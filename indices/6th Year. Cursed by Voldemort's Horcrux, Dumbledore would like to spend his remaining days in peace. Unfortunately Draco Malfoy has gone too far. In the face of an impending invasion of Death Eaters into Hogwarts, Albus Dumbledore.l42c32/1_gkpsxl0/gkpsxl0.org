"I too often wandered the ailes of this here room. Often to seek treasure, mostly to find just rubbish. Always to find peace." Dumbledore slowly walked past a large cupboard full of old, dusty books. He turned his head in a slow, deliberate manner. "You do not seek peace here, Mr. Malfoy, do you?"

Draco was frozen still. His hand trembled. The tip of his wand went up and down with every new desperate plan in his head. He would have given it a shot, had Dumbledore not looked like wrath incarnate in this moment. They said Voldemort feared only this man. Draco understood now. There was no swirling of robes, or breezes from nowhere. All encompassing was a pressure, as if the air itself tried to flee from Dumbledore.

"I am used to being poisoned. I do not take it personally. I did falter at Ms. Bells fate by your hands, but given her recovery, I hesitated. Who knew? Maybe. I hoped. Hoped that the blonde was all you inherited from your father. That deep within, you were capable of compassion." Dumbledore's wand pointed at the Vanishing Cabinet. One quick flick of the wand and the door opened. "You are hereby expelled from Hogwarts. You may take the exit you intended to be an entry."

"No,..." Draco whispered. "Its not..."

"I know." Another flick of his wand, and Draco flew into the Vanishing Cabinet. His last desperate scream could be heard as the door closed. Not even a second later it apruptly stopped, followed by blood and gore seeping from its cracks.
