Dumbledore is more or less on his last breath and Voldemort can take him in a fair fight... But Voldemort doesn't deserve fairness.All Deatheaters get ruthlessly picked off and Voldemort gets Legilimensed for the location of his Horcruxes before slaughter.

Dumbledore doesn't have time to seek out the Horcruxes, but after Voldemort and his powerbase are gone, Harry's Horcrux Hunt will effectively become a picnic trip.

Since Harry probably won't get the chance to get AK-ed by Voldemort in the future, Dumbledore can only have Harry improve his Occlumency technique. He uses what little of soul magic he knows to completely destroy the memories of the Scarcrux. After that, just to be safe, he secretly applies a impotency curse on Harry so that he won't have kids and the malevolent spirit in the Horcrux won't have a chance of getting passed on.

After that, Dumbledore and Harry have a conversation. After Dumbledore tells Harry of the Horcruxes location, they converse about the nature of Dark and Light magic. Dumbledore talks about how he has been cursed, how he really didn't want to fight and just die a quiet death, how he had planned for things to take place after his death... Dumbledore admits that he was turning a blind eye to Draco's mad assassination attempts but he couldn't close his eyes to Hogwarts' imminent invasion. Dumbledore says that he really wanted to die with the reputation of being unstained by the sin of killing but now he will die as a evil worse than the Dark Lord who destroyed most of Wizarding Britain's aristocracy. Dumbledore asks Harry for forgiveness (while Harry insists Dumbledore never did anything that requires forgiveness) before passing on.

After Dumbledore is gone, Harry talks to Hermione and Ron about the legacy Dumbledore left behind - about the families that were attacked and Death Eaters slaughtered. The Order of the Phoenix and Snape swear to help Harry hunt down and destroy the Horcruxes. Harry accepts their help.

In his heart, Harry is determined to ruin Draco for driving Dumbledore so far.
