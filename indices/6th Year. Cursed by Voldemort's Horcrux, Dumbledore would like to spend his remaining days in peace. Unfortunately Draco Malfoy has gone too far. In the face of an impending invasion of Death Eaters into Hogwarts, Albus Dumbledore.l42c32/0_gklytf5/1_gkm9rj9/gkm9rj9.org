Didn't the whole using Fawkes to teleport thing happen in the one where a paranoid Harry runs away to the US and uses the fidelius to hide his identity. There, Dumbledore used Fawkes to teleport death eaters and paralyse them with the basilisk, if I'm not wrong. I forgot the name of the fic tho. It's pretty decent, but kinda cliche.
