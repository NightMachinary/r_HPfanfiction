That... would be a very entertaining, but also very short fic.

The thing about Dumbledore is that he's been around for a long time. His methods, his way of doing things are very well known. While I'm sure there are some conspiracy theorists wearing stylish tinfoil hats and warding against all the means of entry and all types of magic that Dumbledore - and anyone else who put in the work - /could/ use, most only protect themselves against what he /does/ use.

That means, the moment he decided to do away with his limiters and utilize all his skill, experience and wide spell repertoire to remove the group of people who overstayed their welcome amongst the living... They would not last a single evening. All it would take is an unbreakable bottle, a bit of fiendfyre, and either Fawkes the Phoenix or a house elf, or even an owl. A duplication charm, and Dumbledore is all ready to express his displeasure. Since he's still active politically and all for talking ususally, the targets expect words... They are given flame.

For the few harder targets, Fawkes can still make deliveries... And Dumbledore would be more than capable of tearing down most wards*. After all, even in his advanced age, he is still the one Voldemort fears, for good reason. And if Riddle could break the wards of Hogwarts, what would stop Dumbledore from just walking into a lowly Death Eater's house?

Work of one evening. Followed by a visit to the Ministry to dictate some law changes and appointments to the - much diminished and throughly cowed- Wizengmot.
