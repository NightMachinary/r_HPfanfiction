I don't think you're ever going to find a filter that can sort on something as subjective as quality. For AO3, I suggest making extensive use of their "exclude" option to get rid of characters/pairings/additional tags you don't care for, and then slogging through what's left. Additionally, if you find an author you like, take a look at their bookmarks - that's how I've found a lot of lesser-known stuff.
