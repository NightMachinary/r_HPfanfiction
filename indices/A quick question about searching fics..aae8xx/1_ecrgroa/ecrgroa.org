You can set up a search once and then get back to it by simply bookmarking it. For example, here's roughly what I would use for a general fic search:

You can, obviously, change it to whatever you want or make your own. Maybe you don't mind CC or Ron/Hermione, or anything really. It is not a guarantee for quality, but by purging anything you hate, you are left with things you generally enjoy. Just set it up once and enjoy quicker browsing in the future.
