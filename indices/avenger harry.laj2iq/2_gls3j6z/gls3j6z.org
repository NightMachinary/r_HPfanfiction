you might want to start at the end of the first year, with the meeting with Quirellmort having him feel inadiquate and force him to study, perhaps have him quit quidditch, and have him prepare himself for a summer where he needs to improve when his parents killer whos capable of attaining followers are around.

Summer can be him slowly but steadily coming with the plan, have him realise that Voldemort will come after him untill either are put into the ground.
