Lmao, reading the thread title, I thought it was going to be [[https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/lord-voldemort-jailed-insurance-agent-threatened-clients-who-cancelled-policies][this HP-relevant news article.]]

#+begin_quote
  Identifying himself as "Lord Voldemort", a disgruntled insurance agent sent anonymous threatening messages to some clients after they cancelled policies they had bought from him.

  The court heard that he targeted 33 people in all, including his former clients and their neighbours. The accused also created letters and e-mails that were addressed to his clients, which threatened that harm would befall his clients and their families if one bitcoin was not transferred to the accused's bitcoin wallet. He signed off the letters and e-mails with the pseudonym Lord Voldemort.
