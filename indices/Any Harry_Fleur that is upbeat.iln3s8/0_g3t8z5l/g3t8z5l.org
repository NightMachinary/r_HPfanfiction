Linkffn(triwizard tournament take two) is pretty upbeat but not complete. Linkffn(in spite of obstinate men) is something of a middle ground cause it's a real slow burn fic amd they dont actually get together officially until the sequel linkffn(in spite of appearances) which isnt finished yet.

Linkao3(a much needed Holliday by canon convergence18) is really upbeat but the author had issues with JK's recent comments and wrapped it up. Still a fun read but sad that he didnt complete it fully

Linkffn(the stag and the flower) is a fun read but not kind to bill or Ginny weasley
