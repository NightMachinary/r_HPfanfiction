Occlumency is difficult magic, but it's not complex magic. As Snape described it in OotP, it's pretty much the magic of mental self-discipline, of being able to think about things in an emotionally detached way, a kind of mental numbness. I picture this as a kind of mental knack, a state of mind that you can slip into. You either can do it or you can't. And we see that in DH Harry discovers that state of mind when digging Dobby's grave. He is detached from his pain, he is said to have learnt control i.e. the discipline over his own mind that Snape was talking about in OotP.

Grief was the vehicle to that discovery, the impetus for it, but that doesn't mean that Harry has to still be grieving to be able to recall the mental state he discovered.
