Based on how you describe it, I dig it.

As a complete, and total, aside, how would you grade Snape's attempted education of it? Making the best case of difficult magic or just being a shithead?

"Control your anger; discipline your mind" seems very apt based on your view. But how would you go upon teaching this?

It is very interesting when reading the text of his lessons that he isn't really doing that badly. Providing a stinging hex to disrupt Snape's attempts, creating a shield charm, etc, intention or not.
