I would say Snape did the bare minimum - if Harry had wanted to learn, done the practice etc. then Snape's tutelage would have been sufficient for Harry to learn Occlumency.

But Harry didn't want to learn. And therein lay the problem. It's a catch-22: Occlumency is the art of mental self-discipline, but to learn it you already have to be sufficiently self-disciplined to put the effort into practising reaching the mental state required. You simply cannot teach occlumency to someone who does not want to learn it.

Of course, Snape could have been a better teacher - describing things more fully, attempting to inspire his student rather than just going through the motions and leaving it to the student to motivate themselves. Though given that Harry had many more occlumency scenes than we saw, it's entirely possible (indeed likely) that Snape did describe it more fully. Harry knows a lot more about magic that the reader sees him learn - that's a common theme throughout the series, where we only see small glimpses of his classes.

But honestly, I doubt that this would have made any difference. So long as Harry continued to enjoy his view into Voldemort's thoughts, so long as he considered it a useful and valuable skill which allowed him to do things like save Mr Weasley, so long as he remained wilfully blind to the dangers, then no teacher would have been able to teach him the skill. He wasn't just disinterested, he was actively seeking the opposite, wanting /more/ access to Voldemort's thoughts, not less.
