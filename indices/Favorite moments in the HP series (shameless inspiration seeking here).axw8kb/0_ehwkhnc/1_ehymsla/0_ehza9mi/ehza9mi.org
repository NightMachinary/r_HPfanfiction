  His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last

It sounds very much like he has mastered the general skill of emotional detachment which is the basis of occlumency. That skill isn't Voldemort-specific, so yes, I would say he can definitely repel legilimency attacks from other wizards.

As for performing legilimency himself, in OotP Snape tells us that Voldemort is using the scar connection as a vehicle for legilimency. What's special about that connection is that it allows legilimency to be used without physical proximity. But it's still legilimency being used. So if Harry is using the scar connection to perform legilimency, I don't see why he couldn't do the same in the more traditional manner with eye contact.
