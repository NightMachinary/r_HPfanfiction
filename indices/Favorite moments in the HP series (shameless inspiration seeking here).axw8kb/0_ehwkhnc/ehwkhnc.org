The moment in DH when Harry finally masters occlumency (and legilimency) - it's such a perfect culmination of that arc which began with him being useless at it in OotP, and the way in which he masters it is so well in tune with the way Harry always ends up mastering complex magic: learning by doing, figuring it out his own way rather than learning from books.

  He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.

  His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out...though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love.

  On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys' returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness...

  The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows...Horcruxes...Hallows...Horcruxes...yet no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again.

  Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why... And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy...Dumbledore had foreseen that...How much more had he known?
