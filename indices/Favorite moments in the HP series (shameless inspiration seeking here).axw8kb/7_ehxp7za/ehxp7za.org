The moment Ron and Hermione decide to go with Harry to protect the Philosopher's Stone always stuck out to me for one line in particular, when Hermione says that she'll go look through her books because there might be something useful. The idea that a first year's book collection (even a first year like Hermione) would be at all relevant to the protections put in place by some of Britain's foremost experts in their respective fields sounds completely ridiculous.
