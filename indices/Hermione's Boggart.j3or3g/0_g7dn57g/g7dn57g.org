Technically, Hermione's boggart is McGonagall telling her she failed /everything/, which is already a little more serious than failing a test. But in the end, it doesn't really matter whenever Hermione's Boggart is "/the personification of her fear of not being a good enough witch/" or just an immature fear. It was not during her OWL or NEWT but during 3rd year, half the class had immature fear like "a giant eyeball", it's not really a problem for a kid to act as a kid as long as he grow out of it.
