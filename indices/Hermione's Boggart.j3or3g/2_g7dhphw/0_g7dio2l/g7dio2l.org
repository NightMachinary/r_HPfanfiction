That would be an interesting plot point - perhaps in that case, Hermione struggles with the spell, and we can hear Boggart McGonagall start saying that they've clearly made a mistake, she's not a witch, they'll have to Obliviate her and send her home. Of course, that also relies on Boggarts having the ability to speak or at least mimic human speech, and I can't remember if they do that in canon.
