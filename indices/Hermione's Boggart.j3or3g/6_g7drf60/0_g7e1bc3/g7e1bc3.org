  I don't think that is immature... I think that is very disturbing. She has to have some very strikt parents to have such fears, because no child should fear failure more than death.

This has been part of Hermione's character from the beginning.

  I mean she saw Fluffy, had a run in with a devil snare and a troll, was nearly killed by a basilik and also was in the compartment with the dementor.

To be fair, Fluffy is scary but can be tamed. A Devil's Snare can be fought with fire. Ron and Harry saved her from the troll. She was paralyzed instantaneously by the Basilisk--as soon as she knew it was there, she was petrified. Lupin sent off the dementor.

All of those monsters can be fought. Failure is not something that can be fought, as it quite literally means the fight wasn't good enough.
