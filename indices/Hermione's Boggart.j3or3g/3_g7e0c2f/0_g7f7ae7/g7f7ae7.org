Yeah, Neville sees Snape instead of... oh, I don't know... Bellatrix Black. Is he /actually/ more scared of an abusive professor who harangues him, or the woman who tortured his parents into a catatonic state where they no longer recognize him, and could do the same to him or anyone else around him, or did he just have class with Snape so Snape sprung to mind?
