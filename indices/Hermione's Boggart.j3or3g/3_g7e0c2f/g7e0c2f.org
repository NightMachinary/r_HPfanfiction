"Greatest fear" is patently false* in every case we see. It's more like "the first scary thing that springs to mind".

Harry would rather hang out with a dementor than Voldemort.

Ron would dive face first into a pit of spiders if it would prevent his mom from dying.

Hermione would much rather fail her test than admit to Ron and Harry that she was grown in a vat and has no parents.

etc

edit: Not necessarily patently false, as we see Molly see what is probably her worst fear, but that doesn't falsify this hypothesis; the deaths of her family are very likely in the near future so it's definitely present in her mind at the time of her boggart encounter.
