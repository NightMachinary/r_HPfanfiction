Abstract concepts as fears are a bit difficult to visualize so I guess it goes with whatever the victim seems to think it would show up as as that fear. She is a teen who is very academic so school is the thing her mind goes to. Harry's fear of fear is interesting and I suppose Lupin was probably right in thinking it would show up as some version of Voldemort had Harry not seen a dementor. It's always interesting to wonder what an abstract concept would look like as a boggart. I wrote a fan fic where my characters greatest fear was the unknown and he was in Lupins class. The boggart was so confused as to what to turn into, it screamed and hid in the trunk it came out of. Kinda hard to visualize the unknown.
