I don't like the fact that in book 5, the fact that Hermione failed this and Harry didn't is used as proof that Harry is a Defense prodigy and should be the one to lead the DA. Harry had just spent several months practicing against boggarts in order to overcome his fear of dementors and this is Hermione's first ever time seeing one, since she did not get a turn in when Lupin had the class face it either.

And Hermione's fear of failing is perfectly understandable, especially when you consider that by third year she is starting to understand the power and influence the pure bloods have and that as a Muggleborn she will need all the help she can get to succeed.
