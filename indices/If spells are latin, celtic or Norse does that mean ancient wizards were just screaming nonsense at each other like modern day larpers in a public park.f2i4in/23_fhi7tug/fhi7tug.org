I think this is where invocation came in. You know the chuunibyou "light of hellos, I call upon thee ,banish this darkness. lumos!" since stuff is chanted like galdr or something (I just remember that Norse spells in the eddas are written and spoken differently, or something). So likely, ancient Egyptian, Romans or Greek invoke the gods or titans. Then came shortcuts, but not everyone can do it. Merlin is probably that guy who hates all the dramatics and did practically forgoing presentation since he's likely get poked with a sword before he finished chanting. With the secrecy, there's no need for dramatics to awe people so they won't revolt so short hand version was popularized. As far as weird pig-Latin and stuff, it's probably shortened after by someone who isnt Latin fluent and just know what the spell does. Thus, pig-latin = long Latin invocation and is good enough.

It's probably why unbreakable vow works despite no 'magic spell' involved but needs a 'bonder'. if the bonder to a spell is an 'invoked deity or element' then it works the same way. (therfore, theoretically Harry can use the power of christ to compel Dudley to leave him alone :D).

As for the last part.

I think I've read something... Not sure if it's an HP fic or not but the person did have a "power of words" in that story "screw you" was accidentally said with magic and the guy was twisted and drilled to the ground. The "fuck you" (once he realized screw you worked) was a demonic 'moo' or 'bleat' is heard before "unspeakable acts" occurred. The second time it was used, a moo was heard and the man is seen in the distance running from what seemed like a heard of livestock and was told the creatures won't die or disappear until their job is finished. I imagine it's the reason for weird cursing in wizardry world to prevent weird "curses".
