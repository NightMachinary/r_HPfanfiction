I have some personal theories on the Taboo, in particular that its power is directly proportional to the frequency of the word used, so "Voldemort" would be especially strong since people are still afraid of it 10 years after his supposed death.

However, I liked a theory I've read a while ago, that the Fidelius is simply an adaptation of an even older spell into Latin by roman sorcerers. If its discovery and adaptation was the result of a betrayer, then that would be some truly JKR-worthy naming irony. The spell named "Trustworthy" being discovered through treachery.

Its nature also strikes me as something older than the other spells we see used, especially with the three ritualistic components - caster, secret, keeper.
