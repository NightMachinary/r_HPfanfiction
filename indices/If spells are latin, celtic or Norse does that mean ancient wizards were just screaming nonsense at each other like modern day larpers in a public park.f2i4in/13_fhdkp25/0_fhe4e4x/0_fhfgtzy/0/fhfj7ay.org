Another interesting thing to think about is if chinese or african have their own spells, how do they interact with european ones?

For example, Voldemorts taboo was able to break through all of hermione's protection spells in book 7 but not enough to break through the fidelius charm of grimmault place. Is there an ancient spell without european origins that could get through the fidelius charm?
