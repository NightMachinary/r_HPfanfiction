I wasn't vocalizing my upvote. I was briefly acknowledging that someone wrote the exact same thing that I would have. I understand if you don't like it. You don't have to. Absolutely no one is forcing you to write "This" on a post. However, I think that it's rude when you try to tell other people what they should or shouldn't comment.

I'm not looking to get into a lengthy debate, so that's all I'm going to say on the subject.
