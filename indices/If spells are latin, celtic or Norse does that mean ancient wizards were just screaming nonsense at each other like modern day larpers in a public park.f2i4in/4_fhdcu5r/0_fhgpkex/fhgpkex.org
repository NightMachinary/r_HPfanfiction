Mayhaps that's what the Wand and the Wand Waving are all about?

Some goon with a stick can beseech the magicks "I hate that bastard over there real bad and I want to zap him with lightning!"

Some goon with a wand says, "Fuck that guy, Lighning Bolt!"

And some wizard with a wand and the correct swishes and flicks can just say "Lightning Bolt!"
