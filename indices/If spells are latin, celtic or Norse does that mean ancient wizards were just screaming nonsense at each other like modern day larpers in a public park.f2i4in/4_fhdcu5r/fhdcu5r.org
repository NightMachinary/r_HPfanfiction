I'd like to think runes played a bigger role back then or they had long chanting spells instead of casting. Like they'd say "I call upon the fires of hell to destroy my enemies!" then someone figured out they just needed to say "fire" for the spell to work.

But the connection of wizards going around sounding like modern day larpers is hilarious and I want some poor muggle overhearing wizards discussing spells and thinking the wizards are losers. Would also be a funny bit for a muggleborn to say that they're larping (and dying inside) in case they ever came close to being caught doing magic around muggles.
