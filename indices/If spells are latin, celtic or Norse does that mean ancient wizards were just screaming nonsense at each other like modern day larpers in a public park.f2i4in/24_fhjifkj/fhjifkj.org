My headcanon is that they were all using "accidental" magic, except, you know, purposefully.

Chants, wands, and runes (wards and enchanting with runes is a thing damnit! It's not my fault JKR is boring as hell) were introduced later to "nerf" wizards.

This kept people from blowing each other up in an argument. Or someone exploding when they accidentally drop your letter.
