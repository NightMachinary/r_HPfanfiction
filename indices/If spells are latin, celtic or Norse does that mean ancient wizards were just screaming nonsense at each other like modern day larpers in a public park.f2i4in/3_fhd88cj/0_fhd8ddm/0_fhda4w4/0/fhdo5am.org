It's actually a plot point that Wizards converse in Latin on all official occassions, but the Wizard who taught Dresden made him use doggy-Latin for his spells so that he couldn't testify as to how much of a bad guy the Master really was as he'd be casting spells as he spoke.

Dresden's apprentice uses mangled Japanese.

It's a brilliant and well-thought-out series. Any series where a Wizard can ride a dead T-rex into battle is awesome.
