  In HP it seems like only children vocalise, barring particular spells. So it shouldn't matter as much.

Is it only the children in the books? I always had the impression that non-verbal spells were much more difficult, and that most adults ended up still relying on the crutch of saying it verbally (with the caveat that they'd likely have a few spells that they used often enough to just use non-verbally).

I know the movies had a lot more of that non-verbal casting, probably to help their flow.
