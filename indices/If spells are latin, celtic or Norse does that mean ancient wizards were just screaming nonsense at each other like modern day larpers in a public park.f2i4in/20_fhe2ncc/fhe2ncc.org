The explanation I've seen in some fanfics is that languages acquire power and hence can be used for spell-casting through being used for a long time, and that power becomes available when the language is no longer used by ordinary people and hence no longer having the mystery sucked out of it by being used for talking about such thoroughly mundane things as soup and chamberpots. Back when normal people used Latin wizards would have been using an older language. Perhaps what we call Proto-Italic, or Hittite, or one of the non-Indo-European languages that has since gone extinct.

Therefore Norse could have been used from about the 14th century onwards, as it was then the dead ancestor of Danish, Swedish etc.
