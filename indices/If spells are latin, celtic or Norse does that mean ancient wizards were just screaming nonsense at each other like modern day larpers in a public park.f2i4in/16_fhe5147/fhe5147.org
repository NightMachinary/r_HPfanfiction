I feel like they use those languages in order to make the children concentrate, and then believe. As such when those languages were current, they either had a formal way of casting (e.g. calling on a god, a chant, or something like that) or they used other nonsense words either from the archaic form of their language or another language.

I also think that the reason they use Latin is because of the Roman invasion.
