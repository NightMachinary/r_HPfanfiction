No. They used to use Altantian, but they switched to Latin after the Witch Trials, to make it easier to blend in with the muggles. At least, they did in Europe. Really, it's more about learning to apply your Will and Magic, than it is doing a dance and saying a few ‘specific' words in a dead language. The exact words are meaningless, as long as everyone in your general area agrees on what they are.

This is all headcanon, of course, but I like to think that Magic is slightly cognitive, that it Knows a bit about itself and the world, and that if you just push at it it'll try to help you. That's where ‘accidental' magic comes from, children begging for help, and getting it, just not in a trained way. It's the natural magic Halping you, trying to help, but not knowing what you want it to do. That can be dangerous, so, a While Ago magical people got together and desided.. We Say This, You Do That. Words fall out of use as new ones are added. The more people Believe in it, the easier it is. The more people use it, the easier it is. The more You, Yourself, believe that you Can Do It, the easier it is... but you CAN do Anything with magic, technically. Just most people Don't Know How, and almost all would say, No You Can't.

You'd be pushing against the Belief, the Will of the World, and of Everyone Else in it, if you went off the beaten track. But you still COULD. If everyone says “You need a wand to do Magic.”, then clearly you DO. But, Magic can be done without one, accidental magic is done without one, as a rule. So, clearly you don't NEED a wand. A wand just makes it EASIER. Or does it? If people tell you “you have to say the spell, and do the wand motion”, but you don't have a wand, do you Just say the spell, or do you do the motion with your hand? Once you get Told the way things are, it's Much harder to think otherwise about them. You stop being able to do accidental magic as you age. You need a wand to do magic. You need to say the spell, or think it. You can't use more that one spell at a time. You can't transfigure Part of something. Magic Can't Do Anything.

Yes. It can.
