It does paint a ridiculous picture, especially of magical fights where people are screaming explosion at each other.

The way humans process language is interesting though. The best example incantation think of is when people have names that are just normal words, like Joy. Most native English speakers that know or meet a Joy don't have any issue separating the name from the word. Our brains just recognize and accept it as a name and don't give it any thought. I'd imagine it would work the same for spells, yes intellectually you would know that you are saying the same thing, but Water Spout would feel different from water spout and people just wouldn't give it that much thought.
