Amen for intention.

We know from canon that intent is required for the unforgivables, I don't know that it wouldn't be required for other magic. Obviously varying complexities of spells would require different levels of concentration and intent.

Small children could certainly "will" things to happen by having strong intent to reach things or avoid things and thus make simple magic happen.

Older wizards that have become very adept at magic can use their wands and intent alone without vocalization at all.
