I think the main thing with spells is the intention. The word/wand movement just helps you focus. And I guess the language was used because everything technical was named from Latin or Greek back in the day, and the trend stuck. It's not a rule though, as Hermione's Four Points spell is literally just "Point Me".

Another example would be Serpensortia. It is supposed to have originated in India, and logic would dictate that the incantation be in Sanskrit. Yet, it's from Latin, and I assume this is likely because some visiting British wizard saw the spell being performed and came up with their own word for it.
