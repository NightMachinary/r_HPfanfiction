  To us that sounds juvenile, but to Germans it sounds perfectly normal.

I'm trying to give more examples (not from German, though), and they all seem ridiculous in English...

Ivory = elephant tooth Rhinoceros = horn nose Cinema = moving voice (it makes more sense if you know that when it was silent it was "moving sight") Alien = living stranger or foreign life Firefly = night amber (and if you'd tell me "fire fly", I'd honestly think you're high) Seal = sea dog Catfish = moustache fish

And, ofc, eight fish and ink fish, which I'll leave blank for your (my?) Amusement.

octopus and squid
