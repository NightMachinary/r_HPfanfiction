I think the main part about those compound words and how they sound in English is that breaking it down like that makes us think about each part individually - but I'm not certain how much, say, Germans actually think about the words that make up the compound ones (I know that I have to think them through individually, but that's from the perspective of a non-native speaker. On the flip side for French, words like 'quatre-vingt' - literally 4 20, meaning 80 - I don't think of it as the individual one, but just as the combined word).

We certainly have a lot of compound words in English that we don't consider juvenile - 'campfire', 'aircraft', 'farmhouse', even 'foodstuff', etc. I know that personally I don't think of them as individual words combined, even if that's how they started off as.

You are right that it doesn't sound quite as high class as Latin or Greek, but that's a general western European thing I'd say.
