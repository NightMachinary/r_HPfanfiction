And, back when Latin was a language, it was /two/ languages. So every day conversation was in Vulgar Latin, while magic was discussed and worked in Classical Latin. With some older spells in Etruscan, for the advanced classes.

Some hedge-wizard from the backwoods of transalpine gaul comes to town banging out druidic evocations in whatever barbarian nonsense they babble at each other up there, the snooty buggers from Rome and Naples are going to be raising their eyebrows in a condescending manner and remarking that it's almost like he thinks he's a real /magus/.

'S why the Romans killed all the Druids.

Snobbery.
