It only seems weird to you because we've all been indoctrinated by Modern English into thinking that advanced vocabulary should come from Latin or Greek; that native Old English words sound uneducated and lower-class in these contexts. In other languages it's perfectly normal for technical and prestigious vocabulary to consist of native words. For example the German word for "Hydrogen" is "Wasserstoff", literally "water-stuff". To us that sounds juvenile, but to Germans it sounds perfectly normal.

In my head-canon, each cultural region uses their own local prestige language for spells, so South Asian wizards would use Sanskrit spells, East-Asian wizards would use classical Chinese spells, etc. Once upon a time, they would have just been normal vocabulary, but as the languages evolve and the spells are borrowed by wizards from other cultures, the spells remain frozen in time until they became incomprehensible to their users. Presumably there's nothing stopping people from using English spells, but it's probably stigmatised as uneducated and crass, due to a similar mindset to yours.
