In my story "The Dark Lord Never Died", Malfoy keeps going after Halloween 1981 and fakes the Dark Lord's survival to take over Britain - and promptly stabs Voldemort in the back and sets himself up as the ruler of the country. It leads to a three-way war between Voldemort, Malfoy and Dumbledore 20 years later.
