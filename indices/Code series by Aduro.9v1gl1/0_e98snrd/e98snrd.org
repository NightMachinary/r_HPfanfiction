That's my all time favorite series. The author went on hiatus during the third story and then came back after like 6 years to finish that story and get us up the point it's at right now on The End Code. It's been 2 years now since the last update on that but I refuse to give up hope because of the first gap in updates. So hang tight, might be a while.
