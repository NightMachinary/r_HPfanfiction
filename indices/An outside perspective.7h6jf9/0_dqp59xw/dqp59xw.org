I have two recommendations that you may like as I have a similar problem with the whole op!protagonist thing though they are both still told from the main point of view.

linkffn(11373351) and linkffn(11907443)

The first one is a story where Harry has been being reborn for thousands of lifetimes and is obviously godlike by this point so he sets specific absurd goals at each rebirth ie. 'make draco malfoy fall in love with susan bones, bonus points if they marry before the end of Hogwarts' or that type of shit. anyway on this specific lifetime he encounters a female tom riddle for the first time in these thousands of lifetimes, who, unknown to Harry somewhere along the way also collected the Hallows. she is on her ninth lifetime so is obviously also completely different than canon though not as godlike as Harry. The story is told from both points of view and is tragically not completed, but is imo hilarious as it doesnt focus on their op-ness (heh).

As for my second rec, its pretty much what its summary says.
