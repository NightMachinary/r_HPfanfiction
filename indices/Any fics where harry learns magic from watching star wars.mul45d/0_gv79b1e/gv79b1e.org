Truth be told, I want to write something like this at some point, but on a broader scope with an Otaku Harry Potter.

Basically, high octane Achievements in Ignorance rules of magic for Harry. Because no one told him he couldn't do something (even if it's normally impossible), he did it. Expertly even.
