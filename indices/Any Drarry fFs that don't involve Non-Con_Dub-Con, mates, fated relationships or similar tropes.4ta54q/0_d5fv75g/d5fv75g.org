[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW01.html][Beautiful World]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY01.html][Beneath You]] by Cinnamon have been my favourites for over a decade now. (/Beautiful World/ is a heartbreaker, though! Have tissues on hand.) Some others I quite enjoy:

- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/plumeria/DID.html][Draco in Darkness]]
- [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=6771&chapter=1][All His Saints]]
- Ain't No Friend of Mine
- 101 Ways to Heal Your Wizarding Woes
- Here's the Pencil, Make it Work
- Then Comes a Mist and Weeping Rain
- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/metisket/refraction.html][Refraction]] - this one's a bit weird, but I enjoyed it.
- [[http://dragongirl16.livejournal.com/95485.html][Faith]] - this one has bashing, just in case that's not your thing. Also *warning for some serious violence/gore*. (And it is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1318020/1/Faith][on FFN]], but I don't know if it's the updated version or not so you might want to read the LJ version which I first linked.)
