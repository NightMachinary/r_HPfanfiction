Fair enough, to each their own. :)

I forget about the bonding in Beneath You because it's not the huge focus. I know it plays a factor in the ending, but I guess I never really thought of it as a bond-fic. But then, I'm not that familiar with the genre; there's only one I've read because the concept has never appealed to me.
