I havent read Beautiful World, although it is on my list, but I have to disagree with the rec for Beneath You. Beneath You is a bond-fic (although not /really/ non/con), where Harry and Draco start writing back and forth in a journal together and due to a potions mishap the ink kinda puts them under a bond-type thing. I actually love bond-fics (although OP does not seem to like them) but this fic's execution just wasn't the best. I didn't even finish it because it got pretty boring. I think that it is one of those from early(ish) fandom that just doesn't hold up.

Love a bunch of your other recs though - of the ones I have read. Just my two cents :/
