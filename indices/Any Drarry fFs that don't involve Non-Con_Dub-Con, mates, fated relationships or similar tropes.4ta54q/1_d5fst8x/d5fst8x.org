Yes so many! I think you're right that those are common tropes but there's so much great drarry beyond that. Can you be more specific with what you do like?

I'm happy to come up with a few "curated" recs, but if you aren't sure and just want a bunch of choices you can check out my ao3 bookmarks which is where I keep all I've read with notes and recs. Just filter by Harry/Draco. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks]]
