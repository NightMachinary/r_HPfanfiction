Well I dropped the pairing (and the fandom mostly) for a few years and was getting back into it over the last month. I found out that I cannot stand non-con or bashing, that I prefere at least Harry to be a self confident character and that I don't really like children enough to want them around in an FF all the time if they aren't the main characters (especially child OCs), though I can get past that last one. Other than that I will read almost anything from Pre-Hogwarts fluff over war time angst to post-war redemption to non magic AUs or time travel. I will read almost every plot if it's well written and has good charactarization.

If you have any stories that you specifically liked than I'd be glad to hear about them but for now I'll look through your bookmarks list. ^{^}
