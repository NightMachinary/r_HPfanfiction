Okay some that come to mind off the top of my head that fit your criteria are the following:

Recently I loved the *Gentlewizards Club* and the sequel *A Madness Most Discreet*. The Draco in this fic is so lovable you will smile a lot while reading it. linkao3(6148987) (linkao3(2106744)

A cool fic I recently read was *Eye of the Beholder* by pir8fancier - linkao3(639538) This fic was really unusual and well done - it reads like a portrait of Draco Malfoy. It is written in the first person (Draco's) and is an introspective and detailed account of Draco's whole life - his motivations, his thoughts and opinions, his participation in the war, his relationship with his son and wife and how he came to discover he was gay. The relationship between Draco and Harry is well done, although it felt pretty secondary to the rest of the story - which was also somewhat a breath of fresh air for H/D slash. This fic is also totally epilogue compliant and reads like a well done version of the author's head canon on who Draco is/was and how he turned out within the confines of canon.

*If the Sun Goes Black* and the prequel *There Is Always the Moon* are really good mystery-ish fics set a few years after hogwarts. To say anymore will give a lot away because there are some cool twists and reveals and I don't want to spoil. Read them in the order of If the Sun Goes Black first because otherwise the plot twists are nowhere near as good. linkao3(6264406) and linkao3(4707098). There is Always the Moon is one of the best fics I have read this year - if not the best.

Probably my favorite of all Drarry fics is *Twist of Fate* by Oakstone730 - Linkao3(473335). In this fic, Harry and Draco have a beautiful, albeit young love, relationship 4th and 5th year at Hogwarts that they have to keep secret. Then for Harry's protection in the war, Snape forces Draco to erase all of Harry's memories of them being together. The story pics up after the war at the trials when Harry finds out. It is so heartbreaking and beautiful. This story is expertly woven into the fabric of canon so much so that part of me wants to imagine that this IS canon, but it is also pretty heartbreaking..

*Friend Like Me* and the companion piece *Friend Like You* are also really heartbreaking angst fests. Friend like me is a haunting and beautiful short that goes in depth into a daydream that Draco has where he and Harry became friends first year. It is really sad and really beautifully written. The companion piece is from Harry's POV. linkao3(495908)

*The Printed Press* by Soupy_George is another favorite. It is an incredibly cute and well thought out fic where Draco is hired to write Harry's memoirs. I love journalist Draco (probably because of TURN) and this fic was angsty but not too crazy, well written and sweet. I also love that the plot device of the memoirs forces Harry and Draco to talk about all of the things that happened at hogwarts year by year - it is so cathartic for a Drarry fan and suuuper well done. linkao3(1124273)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss the Joy Until the Sun Rise]] - This is a beautiful fic where Harry and Draco both seek refuge in the RoR after the war and slowly heal together. Weirdly, it felt very in character even though it was slash - of course they hated eachother at first and the progression was slow and believable. And the plot device of what/who was "real" was heartbreaking, original and beautifully done.

Okay that is so many fics - I could seriously put so many more, but I already linked my masterlist of recs so that I dont spend the afternoon linking.
