As gotkate86 said, there are a lot of great Drarry fics that don't have those tropes.

Some fics I enjoyed were:

*Turn*

*Must Love Quidditch*

*Chaos Theory*

*Tea and No Sympathy*

*In Pieces*

There are many, many more so just let us know what in particular you are looking for (Hogwarts, Post Hogwarts, Aurors, Time Travel etc.) and we can provide more links!
