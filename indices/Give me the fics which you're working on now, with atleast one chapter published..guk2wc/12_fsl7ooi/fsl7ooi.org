[[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/to-the-ordinary-world-everybodys-got-to-write-an-azkaban-fic-sometime-2785009bffe8][I have a single chapter published]] in what probably won't be a very long (assuming I finish it) fic (three/four chapters altogether, I think). Basic premise... Harry's been in Azkaban for ten years. Ginny's in the cell next door. Oh and Voldemort's already deader than dead so if they want out, they'll have to escape.
