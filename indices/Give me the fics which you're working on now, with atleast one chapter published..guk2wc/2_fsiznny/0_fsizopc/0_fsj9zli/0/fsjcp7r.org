Thank you! I can understand your decision. That was a very polarizing twist. I‘ve also noticed that I‘ve lost a few readers with the chapter, and I also know that some other polarizing plot points won‘t be made for everyone as well. Since I have already dropped stories if I did not like something, I really cannot resent that xD
