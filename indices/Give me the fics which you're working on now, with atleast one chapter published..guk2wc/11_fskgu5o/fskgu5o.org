The Might of the Architect, Linkao3 (23957842) is my main work in progress right now! Three chapters published, six chapters written, A Lot to go.

It's a canon compliant founders era fic set a few decades into Hogwarts existence. William the Conqueror has just invaded England and the political fall out ripples through Hogwarts in the course of the fic.
