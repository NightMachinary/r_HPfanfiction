Ummm , like no Harry/Fleur or Harry/Draco (which often is a Veela in some fics) ? Maybe be a bit more specific? I saw this one: linkao3([[http://www.archiveofourown.org/works/985941/chapters/1943148]]) which has Veela Snape, very uncommon it seems. I remember reading this but not finishing it. Not sure why though, it's been a while.
