Those 25 authors are all that's on the site, as its invite only. It wasn't designed as a site for readers, it's a site for writers so they can host their works in one place. It's all explained in the FAQ.

To find a fic, click an author's name then at the top left corner select fanfiction then select Harry Potter or whatever XO you want. All fics by that author show up, sorted by pairing. There's probably less than 500 stories total on that site, and most of them are also on ffnet or the other archives such as ao3, ficwad, and patronuscharm.
