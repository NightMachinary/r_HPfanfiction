That's an interesting idea! It was used in a fanfic once, although not with the excellent reasoning you gave. In a crucial scene, Tonks goes undercover as Bellatrix to spy at the Malfoy Manor, while Hermione goes there to rescue a hostage. It's the use of 'Wotcher' that actually helps Hermione realize who that particular Bellatrix actually is!
