That gives me an idea.

What if, since Tonks can shapeshift, she uses a very small and precise vocabulary as her signature? If she can't guarantee people will recognize her the next time she sees them (especially if it's in a muggle area where she can't change), by /always/ saying "Wotcher" when she greets someone, she's actually saying, "Hello. I'm Tonks, remember?"
