You've forgotten Matrix Syndrome...wherein our protagonist learns that he's ridiculously overpowered, or about ridiculous overpowered magics somewhat early on, and proceeds to completely ignore that fact for the entire rest of the series. Examples include the trunk he never fucking uses, the 32 animagus forms he never fucking uses, the time turner he never fucking uses, the metamorphmagus abilities he never fucking uses,etc.
