In the Delenda Est, Bellatrix is basically an OC. Just once I'd like to see Harry deal with some high-tension romantic dance with a slightly unhinged pureblood-supremacist teenage Bella(as she would have been in my headcanon). But I guess the psychological aspect of a story like that would be too much for most fanfic writer.
