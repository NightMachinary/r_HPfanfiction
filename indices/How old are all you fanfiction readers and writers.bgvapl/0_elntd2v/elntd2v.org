I'm 23 personally, but my first foray into the amazing world of fanfiction was when I was your age. I dont particularly adverstise it but I've been mocked for it too when I was younger.

But I read for myself because I enjoy it, not for the sakes of others, and you'll realise soon enough when you grow up that the opinions of others don't matter regarding your hobbies. Not only that but you won't give a damn. So just enjoy it ;)
