21, But I got into fanfiction at 12-13 because I always was interested in the "What if this happened?" sense of things. I opened an account when I was 14 and I still have it. Unfortunately, my first stories had tons of spelling, grammar, etc mistakes that have no good reason being there. I wish I invested in a beta lol. I also wish I planned out my stories better so that I wouldn't have so many abandoned ones haha.

I know much better now.
