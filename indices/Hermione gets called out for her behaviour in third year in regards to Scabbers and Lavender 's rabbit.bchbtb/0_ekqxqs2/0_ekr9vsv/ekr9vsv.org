Disclaimer, I like Hermione as a character, but I do have issues with some of her actions. A big thing with Hermione is that she should have apologized for Scabbers as Crookshanks was out to get him. Now Ron admittedly should have put him in a cage, but Hermione was rude about it and prevention went both ways. Scabbers being a murderer does not excuse her lack of consideration as she had no knowledge of it. She did something similar near the end of HBP with the potions book.
