Why would she be called out for her behavior about Scabbers? It's a miracle he wasn't killed be an owl by that point. Ron never keeps him in a cage, he's just allowed out where ever he wants to be, why can't Hermione's cat be?

And while callous, she wasn't deriding the rabbit. But I agree someone should've said something to her about it.

Edit: because you guys are too lazy to actually read this discussion before just downvoting this, I feel I have to say that I agree Hermione is rude. The problem is Ron HAD NO PROOF.
