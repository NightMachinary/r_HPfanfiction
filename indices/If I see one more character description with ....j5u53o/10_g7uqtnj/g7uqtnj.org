That is ridiculous now that you bring it up. My hair probably goes down to the middle of my back, or maybe a little past the middle of my back, and even that is hard to manage! (Currently brushing it now, if you must know.) I mean, it takes time to brush through every tangle, so i can't imagine how hard having it waist length would be!
