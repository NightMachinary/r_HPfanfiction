If you have straight hair and use good shampoo/conditioner it's annoying but not that big of a deal. 20 minutes or less to brush, under 2 minutes to do a braid. Wash every other day.

Short hair is way easier in a lot of ways, but being able to hold it all together with a braid is way more convenient than short/medium length hair where it's constantly coming out of ponytails or too short for them and constantly in your face, and the only way to use an elastic is to do it tightly which can cause headaches. Also need way less frequent hair cuts if you don't particularly care about taking good care of it.
