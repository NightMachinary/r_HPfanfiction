H'okay, so, while having long hair is a fanfiction trope and many people who write it clearly do not have long hair you clearly do not have long hair either.

I have a ridiculous amount of hair. When I take the time to straighten it (which is not often as that is a time consuming and annoying process) it comes down to my knees. When I let it fly free in its natural curly state it falls down to the top of my butt. It does not take me a ton of time to manage it, I'm very much a 'wash and wear' kinda gal. I have officially reached a point where long hair is a legitimate style and I do not have to worry about regular hair cuts, styling products, or whatever hair fashion trends are happening. I comb it when wet, braid it to sleep, and if I need it out of the way I can clip it back or coil it up and jam some hair sticks in it.\\
My morning hair routine is probably about 30 seconds. I have elf princess hair, and I have embraced this fact.

Having my hair long makes it easier for me to manage than when it is short--to a point. When my hair is shorter it floofs out and I have a terrible case of triangle head. The weight helps pull the curls down so that they don't stick up everywhere. I have passed the "easier for me to manage" point into the realm of absurdity because I like my hair longer, but until my hair hits mid back it is a nightmare to manage. If I went very, very short I could avoid the snarling, the floofing, and the frizziness, but I'd be trading that for having to pay someone else to cut it regularly, and having to take the time to style it in the morning.

Annoying things about long hair include: sitting on it weirdly and then trying to get up but being impeded by your hair, strangling yourself with your own hair if you are a restless sleeper, taking longer showers, wondering how in the heck you went through conditioner so dang fast, and the terrible, terrible process of cleaning out the shower drain that somehow manages to get clogged no matter how many different drain blockers you use.

My hobbies include hiking, camping (in the woods!), playing way too many video games, oh and sleeping in because it really doesn't take a lot of time to do my hair.

Um, yes, sorry about the rant there. But in short--everyone's hair is different. The best way to manage one type of hair is not the same as another type. And the things people find annoying to deal with in regards to their hair are going to vary a lot, which means the "best" solution to their hair problems are also going to vary a lot.
