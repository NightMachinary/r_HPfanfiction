It depends. How obvious is his disguise? Are others (Hermione) going to be able to figure it out? Will he tell his friends so that they can help? What will happen if Fred and George see "Harry Potter" on the marauder's map? If he's got a perfect disguise that nobody can figure out, not even with the map, then keep it forever. If his friends can figure it out, he'll have a small group of people who know and help keep the secret, but he could be betrayed later on. If it's too obvious, the secret will be out at the most inconvenient time possible.
