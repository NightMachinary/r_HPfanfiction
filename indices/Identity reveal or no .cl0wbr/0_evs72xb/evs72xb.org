Identity reveals are one of my favourite tropes. I say do it.

Otherwise your not really writing a Harry Potter story, you are writing an OC.

Edit: Also it depends on what your endgame is, is there a prophecy? Will Harry roll over and let Voldemort win?

If there is a prophecy, then it creates a condition where Harry's identity must be revealed at some point.

If Harry rolls over and let's Voldemort win, then that creates an unsatisfying conclusion to the narrative.
