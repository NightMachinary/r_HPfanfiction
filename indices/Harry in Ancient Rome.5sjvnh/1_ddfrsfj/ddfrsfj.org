It's fem!Harry and kind of episodic. Jasmine(Harry) gets sent to ancient Egypt, basically the beginnings of human civilization and magic and becomes immortal.

We only get to see the results of her journey in the beginning, how she changed from the girl she used to be as the story switches between present time and episodes of Jasmine's past.

The first part in the past is about Morgana and Merlin at about 500 BC in Britain. Which means it's the end of the Roman Empire.

The second flashback is starting in ancient egypt but then quickly switches to Indus Valley at about 2700BC.

It hasn't updated in awhile but it's a very good story and does a nice job of combining myth and history and Jasmine's character is very well done. It's more about the drawbacks of being immortal in the beginning than anything else but there's a fair bit of history and legend to make it more than just an angsty 'everyone around me is dying' kind of thing.

That said, i liked the present story line more than the flashbacks, especially her interaction with Flamel and the one Dumbledore story.
