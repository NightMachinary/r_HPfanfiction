Hmm, that depends on your tastes considering how broad the whole request is. Lets see:

- linkffn(The Tinkerer): long-story short, Harry takes up an interest in computers as a kid (in the late 80s remember) and ends up developing some high level programing that gets him involved with Bill Gates and Windows. This all happens in the 1st chapter or so, and it does come across somewhat ridiculously, but the fic is a serviceable Hufflepuff!Harry fic that delves into some of the culture of the individual houses.
- linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw): on paper, the premise(s) and tropes employed by this fic are as generic as they come. But the author makes it work with clever writing and almost original storytelling. Harry doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel, but the changes he makes when time-traveling very clearly affect the wider wizarding world. A personal favorite part of mine is how Harry affects the girls in his "harem" (for lack of a better term) and how they change or develop their own skillsets. Bonus has Harry basically selling drugs in here too (and later muggle weapons).
- linkffn(The Firebird's Son): and its sequels. This is /deep dive/ into an AU, and it can be dark, but Harry becomes heavily involved in the politicking and business of the wizarding world even at a young age. Not for the faint of heart, but as a bonus he actually does become something of an inventer later on.
- linkffn(Delenda Est): kind of on the fence with this one given how off the rails it gets later on, but there is generally some of everything you want in this fic, though Harry himself is more passive than say Bellatrix here.
- linkffn(An Unfound Door): a deftly written AU with an intelligent (and addicted) Harry as a 5th year Ravenclaw. Some inventive worldbuilding and storylines are a certain must for reading.
- linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff): more crack than anything, but basically Harry invents things as way of minimizing the amount of work he has to do. Funny how well Hufflepuff fits with the whole "business-man" storyline.
