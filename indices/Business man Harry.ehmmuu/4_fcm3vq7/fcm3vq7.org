I love this one. It's got 100k+ words and a sequal. Its been a while since I read it and it dont think its 100% business Harry but it's similar. I dont remember the beginning but harry gets really powerful in the criminal world. He works to save children from child trafficking after having to sell himself to survive. He uses his magic to help him aswell as muggle weapons (he also has this squad called the hounds). It's pre-Hogwarts and moves to during Hogwarts.

It's really great and also on fanfic . Net
