i read a fic a while back where the quill Umbridge made him use was enchanted to make the user do whatever they wrote they'd do. essentially, he was under a kind of geas inclining him to naturally be more truthful and making it hard to tell outright lies. i can't remember the name of the fic unfortunately.
