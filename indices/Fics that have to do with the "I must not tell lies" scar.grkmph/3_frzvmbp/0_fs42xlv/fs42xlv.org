Hi hello I would just like to say---- I have never ever shipped SS/HP, but as is my custom, I'm fully willing to try weird ships with time travel elements because it's normally a pretty interesting concept.

That being said, YOU HAVE RUINED ME

I will never find another time travel fic this good, I will never be able to ship these to characters with anyone else, and I will never stop sobbing, just in general over this.

I just finished this fic and it is, hands down, one of the most raw, poignant, absolutely devastating things I've ever read. Not fanfics. Anything. Ever. This is on my permanent favorites list now and I'll probably never read anything quite as good. Thank you so much.
