No, Frog and Grod just call literally /anything/ a "prank". Harry becomes emancipated? Great prank! Harry murders Voldemort in his sleep? Amazing prank! Harry tells Dumblesnore what a meanie he is? Harry, we are not worthy. That was the greatest prank in existence.

Ironically, Fridge and Gorge are the only weasleys to /actually/ deserve a little bit of a chewing out. They're bullies.
