Indie!Harry's whole clique in indie fics is just bizzare tbh.

They turn Fred and George into actual bullies while having Harry throw tantrums about bullying.

They erase Neville's whole identity by pretty much saying that all he needed to do to improve was follow Harry.

They turn Luna into this... abberation that is a mix of "random and quirky" and "Sybil Trelawney"

And let's not forget his usual romantic interest, Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass who's typically the rudest, most arrogant person in the fic at the start. You know, at the moment Harry meets her, just after Harry literally cut his entire social circle out for having those traits.

I get that it's a story about magic where logic shouldn't apply too much, but some of this shit requires way too much suspension of disbelief. And that's before you get into the whole "untrained 14 y/o outmaneuvering literally everyone" trope.
