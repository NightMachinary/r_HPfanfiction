I like the stories where Daphne is just a regular rich girl who likes normal stuff and maybe combat magic on the side and helps Harry understand how the world works all the while having to deal with the rest of her house and the prejudice of some people in the other houses.

But noooo, it`s child politician, utterly rude Daphne that melts as soon as Harry shows he knows how to wave his wand around and use parseltongue spells.

Can`t we have some regular Romance without all the edgyness, how about them trying to dodge curfew to meet, or Harry being his reckless self and sitting down in the Slytherin table to eat with her and her friends once in a while?
