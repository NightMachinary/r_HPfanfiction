That's one thing I'd love to see in fics. Characters having proper social interactions that fit their age. Harry having moments that remind you that he's a teenager. Stuff like dates that make sense (seriously, why does every relationship have to start with a ball?!) or even just casual interactions, having an actual interest in anything other then being the Good Guy(tm). Normal teenage stuff like Harry and Ron sneaking out of the Burrow to have some beers by the creek, then dodging around so Molly won't find out.

Hell, I feel like it'd raise most fics' quality by a shitload to just show the characters' vices. Swearing, smoking, irrational behaviour that isn't justified by the author. Not as a centerpoint, just included in normal fics. Just some natural behaviour that shows us that these characters are /human/.

And on the Daphne note, I don't get why she's the most rigid character in the fandom. In like 90% of the fics, it's ice queen. Even canon characters have more variance. The whole point of a named OC is that you can make them into whatever you want. Hell, the same authors make Harry into whatever they want. But then they turn around and copy-paste Daphne from another fic, sometimes literally.
