Oh God I remember this fic where he was the heir of Merlin and went into the vault and his hole grimoire was basic ass cleaning charms, a healing spell for paper cuts, etc.. It cracked me up at how he played that trope. Especially because of all the hype he played on it, the foreshadowing, and even a cliffhanger like he was about to get a pet dragon that can talk, a better Philosophers Stone, unlimited good and artifacts, but instead he got a book of outdated cleaning spells ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
