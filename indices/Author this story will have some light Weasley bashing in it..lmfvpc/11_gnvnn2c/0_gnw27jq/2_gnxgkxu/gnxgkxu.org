I'd like one where the goblins are more tricksterish. In my mind the blood test things are real and it will show up a lot of old names such as Gryffindor. But everyone is related to Gryffindor just due to the sheer amount of time the house has been around. Like Charlemagne really. Seeing as the vaults have been there for a very long time with no one using them they have accumulated some /slight/ fees.

People familiar with them know that this means you could essentially 'buy' the name by paying these off, but the unknowing may sign contracts to get the name thinking the relation means something and ending up in massive amounts of debt to the goblins.

The best part? I imagine the purebloods/upper class knowing this happens and finding it a sign of new money and turning their noses up at these 'lords'. The people doing it wanted prestige and riches and now they're a poor (possibly massively in debt) laughingstock.
