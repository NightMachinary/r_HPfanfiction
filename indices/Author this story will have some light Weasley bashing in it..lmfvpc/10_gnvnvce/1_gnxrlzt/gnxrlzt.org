It's almost impossible to come up with a reasonable AND non-malicious reason for a lot of things that Dumbledore did, especially as the series goes on. JKR was NOT a good planner, so things like Dumbledore riding a fucking BROOM from Scotland to London at the end of book 1, rather than flooing, apparating, or taking a portkey... well, you need something to fill that void. It wouldn't have been a void at all had JKR planned out her world rather than adding random elements book by book that negated large elements of prior plot. Evil or incompetent Dumbledore is not difficult to get to. Evil Ginny is tougher. Molly can be a bitch, and she's unthinkingly cruel at times, but she's no evil mastermind either. And Ron... well, he's kind of an asshole a LOT. He IS jealous quite regularly. He does betray his friendship with Harry at least twice in canon. So it's not a large jump to turn him worse. But the only one that almost has to be either bad or incompetent is Dumbledore. The rest are open to interpretation.
