Ah, yes, the summary words that make me very, very likely to not read a fic.

"light" Weasley, Dumbles(WHY? WHY!?), bashing...

Or the worst "Specific" or "Limited" Weasley bashing, and you just KNOW it`s Molly, Ginny and Ron...

And instead of just making Ron give a bad first impression to Harry(something that would be possible, just look at he and Hermione...) they make Ron extremely bigoted and greedy.

And let`s not talk about turning a complex character like Dumbledore into either a "Light" Lord(what`s this LOTR) that`s evil and ruthless and /incompetent/ or a senile old man that does bad stuff.
