We could spend an entire thread on Ron's treatment in the movies hahaha but I rewatched some bits of Deathly Hallows pt 1 on some channel the other day and was really impressed at how they really changed some details and characterization to the complete opposite? That scene at the diner, and then when they are traveling there are all those scenes of her and Harry Acting Friendly and Ron Looking Jealous when in the books it was really Harry that constantly felt isolated by the two.
