“Light Weasley Bashing”

The bashing: 11 year old Ron Weasley goes out of his way to try and manipulate another child because his mother and/or Dumbledore told him to. All other Weasley's are also in on this plot for the “Greater Good” ---Except for Fred and George who are the only red heads Harry can actually trust because reasons.
