I do see Ron as someone who may have some bad table manners at the start of it due to growing up with a bunch of brothers.

But less talking with his mouth full and more grabbing some food before it's gone, maybe stabbing someone with a fork if they reach towards his plate. Eating quickly too. I can't see Molly letting actual bad manners pass though although he may have some, in the way hungry teenage boys sometimes do.
