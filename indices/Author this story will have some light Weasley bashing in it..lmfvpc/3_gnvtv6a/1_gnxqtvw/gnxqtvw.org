I always assumed it was mostly from her not-so-kind letter to Hermione in GoF, her treatment of Sirius AND the kids in OoP (I mean, honestly, one competent wizard with a wand can clean a house in an hour! Who needs weeks?), her treatment of Fleur, and a few other things. But mostly it's just copy/paste laziness. There was ONE bash-fic that started off all of the tropes, and then like an avalanche waiting to happen, it... uhh... happened. Which is why all of them are so similar.
