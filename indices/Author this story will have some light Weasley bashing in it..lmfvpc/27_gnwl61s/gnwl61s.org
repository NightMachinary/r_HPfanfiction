Honestly the only Weasleys that I ever slightly understood bashing were Ron and Percy because of the betrayals. But they both came back, people make mistakes and war is extremely stressful, like I get it. Percy probably never had a great relationship with his family so he likely didn't feel it was a huge betrayal to stick with the lawmakers rather than a vigilante group. He came back once he saw the true horrors Burge didn't want to break the law for his family. And Ron was a jealous 14 year old and then a 17 year old who had never gone hungry so when times got tough he left. He felt super guilty and returned but he did leave.

So yeah bashing those two maybe, the others no.
