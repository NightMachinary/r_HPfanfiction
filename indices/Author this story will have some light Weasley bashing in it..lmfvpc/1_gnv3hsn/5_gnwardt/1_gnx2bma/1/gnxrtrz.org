So I'm a huge harry potter fan, and therefore had all the prior knowledge required to read hp fic when I started, but I read fics from other fandoms without having seen canon. Generally, it starts with crossovers in fandoms that I do know, or self explanatory situations that make sense without much intro. For example, I got into miraculous ladybug fic because I really enjoy stupid secret identity drama, and that fandom is full of it. It's not hard to figure out the main love square there (it's actually just two characters with secret identities, and they're listed as both characters in the tags, soooo) and from that it's easy enough to understand what's going on. And sometimes fics are so au that the author has to explain everything (or most things) anyway. So it's definitely possible for a fic to be readable fandom blind without quoting canon directly. Will the reader miss references sometimes? Yes, probably, but it's still possible to enjoy the story
