At one point I was such a person... I cringe so hard when I think about this.

I think just the fact that Harmony fics usually use these tropes to sideline Ron is the reason this is so prevalent. So many good Harmony stories I have had to stop reading because I saw "the red-head was gauging on the chicken with no manners" written unironically. Oh the sadness.

It's so hard to find stories where Harry and Ron actually feel like friends with proper banter...
