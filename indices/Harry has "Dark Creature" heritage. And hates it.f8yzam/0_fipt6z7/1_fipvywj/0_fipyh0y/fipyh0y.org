I read an interpretation once, which was that House-elves are a corporeal manifestation of a small spirit like a brownie or that nordic one. They come to your house and take care of it, but leave if you offend them.

I can definitely see wizards capturing one and then twisting the bond to their chosen house to them, and robbing them of agency at the same time.
