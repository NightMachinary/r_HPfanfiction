This is woefully underrepresented, yeah. Additionally, I'd like to see more fics where Harry or some other character resists a soul-bond, or that weird Veela "mate" thing - citing that at that point, it really is just the magic overriding his free will. I think the worst example of this trope I've seen was when Harry saves Fleur's and Gabrielle's lives, and "ancient veela magic" demands that they do a sex ritual, and Fleur is bound to him as a slave. The author didn't write little gabby as a participant, thankfully, but it was still extremely disgusting from a moralistic standpoint. This was Identity by Highbrass, btw. Wouldn't recommend it though.

I mean what the fuck, why is that even a thing, what sort of species would willingly invent and then bind itself with magic like that?
