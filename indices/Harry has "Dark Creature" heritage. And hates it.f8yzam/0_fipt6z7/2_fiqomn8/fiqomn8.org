There's Nature of the Beast by Lomonaaren [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/362231]]

where Harry finds out he's a veela's mate and basically laughs it off, before facing a lot of people who are confused he's not falling into Malfoy's arms (though he does in the end, of course. oh well)

Lomonaaren is a decent writer, but has characters argue (a lot) in a really repetitive and formulaic way.
