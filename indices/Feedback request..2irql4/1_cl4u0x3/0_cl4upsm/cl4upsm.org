Thanks for the reply.

Good feedback, though I tried to make him out of character because I want to revamp the character, or rather have him be a very different person in private than what we see publicly. But true, it's what I "want" rather than what "is".

Also, this is not a fem!harry/Snape romance, Snape is her father in this story. So yes, this is Snape is different because I intended him to be different, but I'll take the rest under advisement for sure, but I disagree that Snapes canon portrayal disqualifies him from showing these kinds of emotions and behaviors in situations that are never shown in Canon.

As for the fem!harry "twist" itself, I don't consider it a twist and it's the main point of the story, really, but I want to create something that isn't just "what if Harry was a chick".

But I see what you mean, I went a bit heavy on the exposition here... :/
