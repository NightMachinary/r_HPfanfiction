--------------

Style thing, but I'd use spelled-out numbers only, unless it is a time or address. Under 10 numbers as numerals is correct in business writing, but not creative writing.

I skimmed over the chapter for content, so I might very well have missed stuff. Not doing line edits at the moment, but I do want to make a suggestion.

Try breaking this up. Start at the end. His "losing" his memory there makes a great point. Start the entire story with Snape saying the word. That hits hard.

Then Snape takes a potion, keels over, and Albus has some 'splaining to do.

Then have him later flash back to the potion making itself. And, /separately/, flash back to the unlocked memories and compare those to what he previously remembered. If he is explaining this to someone, not just internalizing it, that would really help and would avoid extra flashbacks.

Maybe Snape is explaining this to Holly?

Good luck with the story, and good writing.
