Lord Silvere - Delenda Est

That's really the only one I got. I thought this would be easy but to my surprise I've only got one long fic that isn't H/Hr. Funny, that.

I could probably find others which are decent that I've read but they wouldn't be as good since this is the only one on my favorites list.
