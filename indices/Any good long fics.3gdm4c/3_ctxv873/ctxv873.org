Generic title is generic. Please be more specific in your request; barring that, please look at previous threads, or at places like the DarkLordPotter Forums.

That said, I'd recommend the Denarian trilogy (first - linkffn(The Denarian Renegade), no knowledge of the Dresden Files needed) and the Wastelands of Time duology (first - linkffn(Wastelands of Time)).
