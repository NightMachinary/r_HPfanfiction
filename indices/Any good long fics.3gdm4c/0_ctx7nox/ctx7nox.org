A Year Like None Other by AspenInTheSunlight.

This is a pretty popular story, so you may already be familiar with it. It's quite long, and is part 1 of a trilogy. I am unsure if the final story is complete. It's been a very long time since I have read it. It's about a relationship between Harry and Snape that grows from teacher/student to more of a father/son. There aren't any romantic pairings involved IIRC.

I have a few Snape/Hermione long fics I can recommend, if you would be interested in those as well.
