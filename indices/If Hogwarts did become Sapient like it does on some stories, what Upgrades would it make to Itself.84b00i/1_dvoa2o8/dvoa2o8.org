ITT: No one discusses anything useful and OP gets blamed for an argument they didn't start and were correct about.

But, on topic, it feels a bit far fetched that it would create a human form. It's be neat to see a Hogwarts interpretation of the world around itself if it ever woke. I imagine it's first course of action, like most creatures, would be self-preservation.

It could decide for a time, using its sapient-level reasoning, to simply do nothing. No one expects a castle to be capable of thought, let alone reasoning. It could determine its safest course of action is to do nothing.

That'd be pretty boring, though.
