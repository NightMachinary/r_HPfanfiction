Sapient is an unnecessary word to use here. It just barely means what you commented down below. Sapience is the ability to reason, and sentience is perceiving. To reason is to be cognizant of your surroundings. You can't have sapience without sentience and so the word is completely redundant and a bad word choice. I agree with [[/u/AbuIncelAlAustrali][u/AbuIncelAlAustrali]] and don't get why they received to many downvotes.
