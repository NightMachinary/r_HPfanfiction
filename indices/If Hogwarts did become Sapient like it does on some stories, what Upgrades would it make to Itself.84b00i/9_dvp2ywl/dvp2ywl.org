Add a wing for adult visitors to come and do research or attend post-graduate lectures. The library would extend into this space, but all books loaned are simply Gemino-copies of the originals which dissipate soon after being taken off the grounds.

Those visitors staying on-campus to do research may be asked to perform guest-lectures in their best subjects, and the lectures are always transcribed for later review. Eventually, Hogwarts will become the world-wide leader in magical knowledge-sharing.
