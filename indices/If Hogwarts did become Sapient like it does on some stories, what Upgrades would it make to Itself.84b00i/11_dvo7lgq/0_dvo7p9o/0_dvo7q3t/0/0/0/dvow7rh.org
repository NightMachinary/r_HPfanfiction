  it *had* to think and reason about Umbridge being head

Why? Why did it /have/ to reason about it to make a judgement? If you put your hand on a hot stove, do you have to wait, and reason, and think about whether you should take your hand away or not?

(The answer, btw, is no, because the stimulus doesn't make it all the way up to your brain, it gets to your spinal cord and is turned into a motor impulse that makes it back to your hand and you jerk away.)
