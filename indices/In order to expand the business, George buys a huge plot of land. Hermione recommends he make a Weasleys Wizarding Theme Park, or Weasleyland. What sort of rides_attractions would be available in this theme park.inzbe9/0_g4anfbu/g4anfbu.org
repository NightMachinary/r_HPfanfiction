Dangerous Dares (safety charms required): I think theme parks would be more a collection of areas where things can be experienced. Rides in the muggle world replicate experiences. Why bother when magic means you just experience it directly? With exceptions, of course.

Daring Drops - you floo to a platform suspended in the air. You jump off. At the end, someone casts immobulus so you don't die.

Brawling with Beasts - you're put into an arena. Someone transfigures an animal (so it's ethical) and you fight it. You can even get prizes if you choose to make it harder by not using magic and using muggle methods (guns, grenades, swords, etc). Quidditch is basically a blood sport.

Goblin constructed rollercoaster - even wizards can appreciate a good rollercoaster with no safety precautions.

Flying on literally anything - why bother with a ride when you can just stick people onto thestrals with a sticking charm and give them the scare of their life flying on an /invisible flying horse that eats flesh/? Or giant transfigured birds. Brooms. The list goes on.

Swimming with mermen - self explanatory.

Jungle Quest - try and get through a jungle filled with plants, mundane and magical.

Daydream Charms Area - perfect VR that lets you experience anything. Want to kill a dark lord? Pretend to be Dumbledore at magic?

Another actual ride - entrancing experiences - sit on a ride restrained that moves through a bunch of alluring enchantments.
