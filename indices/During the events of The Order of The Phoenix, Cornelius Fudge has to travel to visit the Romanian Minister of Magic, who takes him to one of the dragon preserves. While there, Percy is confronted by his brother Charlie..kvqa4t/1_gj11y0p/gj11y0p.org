Percy gets lost and bumps into Charlie who gives him a piece of his mind about what he did to their family. He is scared Charlie's going to hit him but his brother just lets him go and grunts in the direction he needs to go to get back.

Percy regains his composure and struts away, feeling good about he handled the situation. Until he walks through the door Charlie pointed to. Where a family of Hungarian Horntails are kept.
