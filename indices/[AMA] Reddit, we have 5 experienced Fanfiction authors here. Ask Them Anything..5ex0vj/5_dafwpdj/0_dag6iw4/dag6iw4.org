I like lazy days reading post battle healing fics but I would never write one because they're all the same and have to rely on rather forced drama. I have my own headcanons for what happened but it really wouldn't make for an interesting fic so I don't write it. I also don't mind reading sex scenes but feel very uncomfortable writing them. I don't know why. I've written one where they get interrupted and it causes conflict between Harry and Ginny but that's it - it wasn't exactly titillating. I'm not sure if it's because I get my boyfriend to beta it or because I'm worried people will leave reviews like "you have weird sex, you're doing it all wrong" but I can't bring myself to publish my sex daydreams.
