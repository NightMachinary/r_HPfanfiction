The best advice I can give you is not to be a weakling.

There are some writers who will whine and cry because someone didn't like their fic, and told the author. Or legitimately criticized something in the fic, like extreme OOCness, bad grammar and spelling, or plain writing terribly. This isn't a "flame". A flame is "I hate you and your family: kill yourself".

People on the internet can be mean and nasty. Ditto re: the publishing world.

If people tell you things are shitty, listen to them. You don't have to defer to the reader on everything, but they'll have useful things to say.
