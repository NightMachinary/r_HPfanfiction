Don't try to please everyone. Lots of readers have very narrow-minded views and lots of pet peeves, and will try to tell you that unless you write to their expectations, you suck. There is constructive criticism around, but you need to know the difference between criticism that helps you write the story you want to write, and criticism that boils down to "Write another story! One I want!"

A good rule of thumb is that if a review or comment is written in an insulting or mocking manner, then it can be dismissed right away - constructive criticism and insults do not go together as anyone who has experience at work will tell you that insults simply breed antagonism; the exact opposite of the goal of constructive criticism. In effect, such comments are mostly pandering to an audience.
