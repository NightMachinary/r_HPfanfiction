Mine would be to keep yourself grounded and write only for you. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others or feeling like you don't have enough reviews, but fanfic should be something fun, not another way to feel bad about yourself. Write with authenticity and enthusiasm and ignore the stats.
