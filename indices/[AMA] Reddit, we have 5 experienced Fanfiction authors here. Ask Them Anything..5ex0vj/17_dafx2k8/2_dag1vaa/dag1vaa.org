Hi [[/u/sir_skier][u/sir_skier]], thanks for your question. I would say the best advice is to draft your story out before typing and publishing it, take note of reviews about grammar and punctuation and have fun.

You'll occasionally get some bad eggs "reviewing" but as they say, you can't please all of the people all of the time.
