Sorry if I'm missing the byplay or innocuous banter as I haven't been following this sub that closely lately, but why are there questions (mostly jokes) issued to someone who isn't a designated author?

I enjoy some of Taure's responses as much as the next person, but this seems rude to the authors present.
