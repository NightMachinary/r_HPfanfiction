Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett have had a lot of influence on me over the years. Gaiman's easy, flowing, fairytale style and Pratchett's ridiculously funny sense of humour (ditto with Douglas Adams) have really lingered with me.

Philip Pullman and Stephen King have taught me a few things about writing more serious situations, and Cornelia Funke is someone I take inspiration from for worldbuilding.

My absolute favourite writers, though, and the ones I take inspiration from simply in the act of continuing to write and create, are Victor Hugo and Jules Verne.
