Haha - you know, I think I included in that description a note about how what is posted in that 'chapter' is literally all I had worked out, and that really honestly is true.

I'm not one of those organized authors that plans the whole story out ahead of time with an outline and ending already sorted. I literally don't know how it would have ended either. Yup. Seriously. I'm kind of awful like that.

I always start with an idea that's sparks some interest and then it's sort of like a character study from there. I let the character tell me where to go, and I make stops along the way to come up with some challenges they could face and see how they overcome them. I guess this is why my stuff goes on and on and on and I rarely finish anything. Ha. Yeah, I'm awful. But I tend to see the stories like ongoing shows, rather than a single self contained story. Like - I know I'll aim for finding a good place to tie things up eventually, so like a series finale, but until I get there, there are mini plots and challenges along the way.
