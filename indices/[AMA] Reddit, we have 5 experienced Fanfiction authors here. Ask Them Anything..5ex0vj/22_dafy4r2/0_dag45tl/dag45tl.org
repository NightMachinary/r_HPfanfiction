Haha - Voldemort/Harry is my super unconventional OTP. I'm a weirdo. I don't even remember how I got onto the pairing. I think when I first started reading some HP slash fiction, I read a lot of drarry. I've written some drarry too, and /one/ snarry fic, but somehow when it comes to writing, I always end up coming back to tomarry.

I think I like writing the pair because it's such a challenge to come up with a reasonable scenario where it can work. lol

The pairing /is/ utterly ridiculous by any reasonable measure. Making it work requires some real finesse and doing it well is a challenge that I enjoy.

Getting the two together just for the sake of fulfilling some kinky fantasy is lame and easy and almost always comes off as horrible and stupid. Getting them together in a way that doesn't come off as horrible and stupid is difficult, and I find that fun.
