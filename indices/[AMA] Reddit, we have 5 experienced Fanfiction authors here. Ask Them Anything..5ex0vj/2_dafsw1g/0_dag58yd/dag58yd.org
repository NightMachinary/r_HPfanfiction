Hi [[/u/capitolsara]], the aim is definitely to one day write my own fiction and try and get it published. Every now and then I think of an idea but can't settle on it/find the same sort of enthusiasm I have for fanfic. I'm sure with a few changes I could make Aurors into a standard police procedural, but I'm not sure how well it would translate. Ifor I do write some original fiction, I will definitely use Theia as a character somehow though, because she's my favourite and I know her so well.
