I - Am - Horrible. I hardly outline a damn thing, and I don't even usually know how my stories will end when I start writing them. I tend to write character driven thought-experiments and see where they take me.

I'll often have an idea for what will happen for the next few chapters worked out in my head, but when I hit the end of 'the plan' I have to sit down and actually start to work out what the hell should happen next and that's generally when I end up switching to another story for a while.

I'll go back after a month or two and re-read a story I haven't touched in a bit, and then I'll usually get some new ideas and find that I can block out the next few chapters and move forward again.

But this is probably a big reason why my stories go on and on and on and practically none of them are finished.
