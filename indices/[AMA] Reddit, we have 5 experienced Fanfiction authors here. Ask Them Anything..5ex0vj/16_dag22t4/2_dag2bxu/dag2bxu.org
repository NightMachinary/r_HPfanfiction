Hi U/Selethe I usually write a full chapter outline, including dialogue or scenes that have back stories, like the scene in The Betrothal Situation where I explain Bellatrix's back story and how she had severely got into the Dark Arts because she had been raped as a teen.

I would say 15-20% of what I write down in my notebooks get cut from the final uploaded version.
