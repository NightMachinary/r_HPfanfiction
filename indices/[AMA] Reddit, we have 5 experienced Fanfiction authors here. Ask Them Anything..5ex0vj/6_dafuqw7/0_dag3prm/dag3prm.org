Hmmm..... it has been about 3 and a half years since I first started writing that story, so it's hard to remember where the idea came from. lol...

I think, in general, I find villains more interesting. They're more complicated, I guess. I really prescribe to the idea that no one is ever the villain in their own head. The idea that everyone is the hero in their own story, and it's interesting to me to get into someone's head and try to work out how their internal logic works to allow them to see themselves as justified in their actions, even if they acknowledge that their actions may be considered villainous by others.

I think it's also why mob movies are often popular - especially when people who are by all means murderous criminals, still operate by their own internal code of ethics. The Godfather movies and others of that ilk fit this idea pretty well. Yes, these people are horrible, but they don't see themselves that way. They may even see themselves as honorable in some fashion.

I think the only really evil villains are sociopaths because their brains literally work differently. Right and wrong are totally different constructs to them. They don't feel things the way normal people feel. You can't predict a person's actions very well when you take emotions out of the equation. I also have a really hard time writing a character like that - and I find them really boring and crappy to write too - lol. So if we stick with the idea of Voldemort being basically a sociopath/psychopath, he stops being interesting to me. So I brainstorm for interesting ways to make him not be that. hah.

I like the idea that Tom Riddle could have been a relatively functional human being /before/ mutilating his soul, but it was the act of creating a horcrux in the first place that set him down the path of turning /into/ a sociopath/psychopath. The idea of restoring his soul having the potential to fix that mental/psychical deficit that prevents him from experiencing love and remorse intrigues me, because then it opens the window for 'how does he deal with his choices if he can feel?'

With Again and Again he has regrets and he does feel bad about his past crimes - but not bad /enough/ to drastically alter his goals because he still sees his goals as justified. It's that justification and exploring how a person on this side would manage to work it in their own minds, to excuse their actions, that I find an interesting challenge.

In Meddling of a Mischief Maker my Voldemort decides to totally change directions, but finds it difficult to do this - both through outside things pulling at him, and through his own hesitation in giving up things, even if he knows he /should/.

(Wow this turned out super-long.... is it any wonder my longest story is 282,932 words long.....)
