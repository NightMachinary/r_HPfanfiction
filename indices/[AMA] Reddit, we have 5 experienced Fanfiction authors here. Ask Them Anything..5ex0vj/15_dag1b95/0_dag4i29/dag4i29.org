lol... You know, as much as I honestly do think that canon would have been better with H/Hr over R/Hr, I almost never read any H/Hr fanfiction. Even back when I was regularly reading het fanfics, I rarely read H/Hr fics. Not even sure why... I'd probably even like to give some a shot, but I have so little time to actually read fanfiction these days...
