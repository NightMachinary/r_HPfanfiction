Why wouldn't it be? The whole concept of alternate universes is that things are /different/ there. Say in this alternate universe, the Prewetts are a racist family. The other side of the pureblood supremacy coin, exactly like [[/u/GryffindorTom][u/GryffindorTom]] said.

I don't really understand what other explanation you are wanting. Some dramatic scene where a muggleborn wrongs Molly? That's not really how racism works, most of the time people are just racist because they don't like change, fear people different from themselves, and learn the attitude from the family they grow up with.
