There's plenty support for it in canon. The Weasleys don't have any muggle friends. They have a Squib relative who they don't talk about. Their whole lifestyle is very magical. Molly has no patience for Arthur's (even then patronizing) interest in muggle machines and memorabilia. The family is Pureblood and seems not to have ever (until Ron's generation are adults) married muggles or halfbloods; they are only seen as 'blood traitors' for being associated with Dumbledore.
