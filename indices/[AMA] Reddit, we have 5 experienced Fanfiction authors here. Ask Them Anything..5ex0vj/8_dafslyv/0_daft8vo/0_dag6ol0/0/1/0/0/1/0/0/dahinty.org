That's the point of fanfiction, and interpretation in general though. To cherry-pick facts in order to support your side of an argument. Have you ever been to a debate or a similar kind of discussion?

We are not chasing an objective truth here. I certainly don't agree with the interpretation I put across, and I don't believe for a minute it's what JKR intended either. But the fuel for that interpretation is there within the textual information.
