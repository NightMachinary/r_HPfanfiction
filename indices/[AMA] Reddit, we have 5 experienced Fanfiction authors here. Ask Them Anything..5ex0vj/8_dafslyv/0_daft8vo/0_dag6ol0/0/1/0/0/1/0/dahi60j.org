  The Weasleys don't have any muggle friends.
#+end_quote

This is inaccurate. Arthur reaches out and befriends the Grangers immediately when he sees them them in Diagon Alley. Given that Hermione henceforth spends the her vacations at the Weasleys, it is clearly implied that they are friendly acquaintances with the Grangers, at the very least.

  They have a Squib relative who they don't talk about.
#+end_quote

They have hundreds of relatives, as pointed out in DH. Of course they don't talk about most of them. There is absolutely no indication that they don't speak to the squib because he's a squib.

  Molly has no patience for Arthur's (even then patronizing) interest in muggle machines and memorabilia.
#+end_quote

Good. I would be exasperated by someone collecting plugs, too. If that someone starts enchanting muggle objects to break the statute of secrecy, then that becomes a greater problem.

#+begin_quote
  The family is Pureblood and seems not to have ever (until Ron's generation are adults) married muggles or halfbloods
#+end_quote

There is no indication of this in the books, and is incorrect by Word of God. The Weasleys have ties to many muggles, which is why they protested being placed on the Sacred 28 list.

  they are only seen as 'blood traitors' for being associated with Dumbledore.

And for introducing pro-muggle bills, to the point that Lucius Malfoy is persuaded to try and kill their daughter. But I see that you chose to ignore that little point. Your selecting choosing and interpretation of facts is amusing.
