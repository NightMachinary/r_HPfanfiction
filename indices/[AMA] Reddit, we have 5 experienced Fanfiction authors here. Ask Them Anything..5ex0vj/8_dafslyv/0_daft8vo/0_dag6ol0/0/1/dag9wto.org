That's hardly an answer. You cannot just stick your fingers in your ears in response to any criticism of your characterisation and repeat that it's an AU. I fail to see how "Ron as the other side of the same coin as Draco Malfoy, being of a more Pureblood Supremacy supporter" makes any sense whatsoever. I also fail to see any amount of influence from Molly would make Ron call Hermione a mudblood.
