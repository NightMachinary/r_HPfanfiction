I generally have a rough outline - start, end, some points in the middle - but when I write, I let the characters act and react and shape the plot. Even major outlined plot points can be changed like that - like in "Uncle Quentin's Spy". Originally, it was meant to feature Hermione playing a cat and mouse game at Hogwarts against Umbridge, but the first confrontation quickly led to developments that prevented that. Still, I do plan ahead when writing.
