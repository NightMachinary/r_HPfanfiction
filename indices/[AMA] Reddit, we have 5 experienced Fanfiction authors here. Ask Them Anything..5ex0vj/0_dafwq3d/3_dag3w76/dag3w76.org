One-shots I normally play by ear.

Long fics are a different story. The Serpent's Gaze is maybe 220k at the moment, and upon its conclusion it will be around 400-500k. I know exactly where the main plot's going, as well as a few of the sideplots, so I'm sorted, haha.

It just makes it easier to plough on.
