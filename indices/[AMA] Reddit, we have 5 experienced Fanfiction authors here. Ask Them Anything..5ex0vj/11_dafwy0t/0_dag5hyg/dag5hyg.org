Hi [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]], aww you do flatter me.

1) I am a word of God believer, so anything Rowling writes or says is canon for me. Books, Pottermore, interviews, tweets. When she says something contradictory I just pick whatever I feel makes the most sense. I also consider CC canon but I'm unlikely to ever write anything relating to it (I've written one one shot that alludes to Scorbus but nothing else). The movies I allow to fill in any missing gaps but otherwise aren't canon. There isn't really that much of a sliding scale for me, something is either canon or it isnt.

2) it depends what I'm writing. For certain chapters of Not From Others I had DH open in front of me as I wrote, and I was fairly continuously checking canon to keep the timeline accurate. For silly one shots like aunt marges even bigger mistake, I just used the wiki if I needed to double check anything like names.
