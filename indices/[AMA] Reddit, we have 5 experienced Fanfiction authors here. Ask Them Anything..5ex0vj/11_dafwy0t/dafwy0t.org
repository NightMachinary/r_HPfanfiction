[[/u/FloreatCastellum]]: At this point, you've pretty much established yourself as one of the best go-to authors for canon-compliant fics. Since your stories are so successful at evoking that elusive, authentic HP feel, I've got two questions here, rolled into one:

1) What do you personally consider /canon/? Is there a sliding scale? i.e. (Word of God>Pottermore>Books etc.)

2) While writing, how often do you refer to the source material? Is it mainly a fact-checking exercise or something more?

Thanks! :D
