Awe, thanks ^{_^}

And I've gotta confess - I haven't read either of the continuations of Breeding Darkness.

As for updating other stuff that's up right now, I did actually just post some updates. I added 4 chapters to Again and Again just recently, as well as posting a plot bunny called Mirror of Paths to my ffnet page. It's been on my Ao3 page for a while, but I added another 3 chapters to it, and then went ahead and posted the whole thing to my ffnet page.

I'm currently poking away at Meddling of a Mischief Maker again and then I'll probably go back and keep poking at Again and Again. I'm working out what sort of things need to happen in the coming year because it's in desperate need of some drama as everything is kind of too perfect right now :P
