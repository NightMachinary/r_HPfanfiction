His father certainly did use that argument, but since Pettigrew killed Cedric (although on the order of Voldemort) it's rather easy to blame the underling instead of the Dark Lord. Pretty easy to sneak that in once it's clear that Sirius's exoneration can't be delayed any longer. Maybe even blame the boy, for fighting the Dark Lord - it's not as if all the details of the scene are known; Dumbledore certainly wouldn't want to spread knowledge of the ritual by having Harry be interrogated in too much detail.

When it comes down to it, Cedric was just one among all the victims of Voldemort. The latest, and one after Voldemort's return, but not that much of an obstacle to appeasement. If people want to avoid a war at all cost, a dead boy won't carry much weight.
