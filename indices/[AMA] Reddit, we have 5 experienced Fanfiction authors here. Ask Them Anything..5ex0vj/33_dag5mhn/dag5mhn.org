To [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] , something that's just been niggling at me with Divided and Entwined...is Cedric Diggory's murder ever used to argue against forgiving/appeasing Voldemort?

I can understand why it doesn't come up from a writing perspective; the anti-muggleborn dark-lord-appeasing laws need to pass in order for the plot to exist in the first place, but is there any point in the story's timeline that Cedric's murder was used as evidence?
