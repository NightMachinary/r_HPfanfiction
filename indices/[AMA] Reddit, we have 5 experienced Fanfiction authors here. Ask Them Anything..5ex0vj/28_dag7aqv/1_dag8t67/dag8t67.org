I don't actually think people change him as much as people often think in AUs. The thing is, with a story that covers different plotlines and different moralities, et cetera, it would be impossible to have a Harry that stays the same.

I tried with TSG to start Harry off exactly the same, except that he had a copy of Hogwarts: A History on the top of his pile. Now, of course, he's very different, but I try to keep the elements that make him Harry the same - the bravery, the focus on self-sacrifice, the cunning, the genuine want to be good to people.

Basically, my answer is that different stories require character development. Every step away from canon can have an effect.
