Hello [[/u/Mu-Nition][u/Mu-Nition]] - thanks for the question this afternoon! I think both of us can say that it's not just Harry that gets portrayed in a kind of generic way by some authors, but also Luna and Hermione does, Luna as either a nut or a Seer and Hermione as the bushy haired bookworm.

The reason I usually have Harry as a main character within my Fics is because if you look at it, he is the reason that most of the stories are quite often eventful. I mean, without Harry, Voldemort may have won until the Muggles got involved, Ginny would have been left in the Chamber, nobody would have known about Moldywarts coming back until it was too late for Wizarding kind.

I think that the reason you say that as FanFic authors have changed Harry in their Fics, and I know I do it, is because Harry is one of those who have, reluctantly for him, had greatness thrust upon him and because of that elements of his personality are shown more than others.

An example in The Betrothal Situation is Harry unwittingly saving Hermione from a worser fate by him taking her as a Concubine, he stops Ron and Dumbledore from having any further control over her.
