To all authors... why are you so drawn to taking Harry as a main character, but then changing his character?

(note: I personally find the character of Harry to be the singular low point of the HP stories, as he is generic and dull especially in contrast to characters like Hermione, Luna, Snape, Lupin, and so on)
