to be honest after watching the New Movie; When i though of it? It was a Dream about two Werewolf mating at Full Moon during Eclipse. After the puppy was born they left it for adoption because of The Hunt(an imaginary event like Hircine does from ElderScrolls:Morrowind but in Harry potter Universe). Since adopted he was raised by an environment that didn't acknowledge Magic. The pup would mentally suppress the Magic(thinking it wasnt right) until it did something with his Wolf form. Think of it as a rare Mutation between Genes & Magic properties. Then my cell phone ranged waking me up from that dream......back to Real world(Cashier punchin)
