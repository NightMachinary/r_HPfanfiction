I saw something like this on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], I think it's like a brainteaser of some sort over there at the moment, almost like a meme. Like could a werewolf even be an Obscurial? And if Obscurials always die, what happens if one is the master of death? Apparently there are lots of ramifications to these questions.
