If fanfics I write don't get many readers, it's fine. I don't think I need courage to deal with that. I like to get feedback on my stuff, so if work is unpopular I usually don't bother finishing it, but I've found that virtually anything can gain a following if you keep working at it.

My only hesitation in plot is usually in character deaths and ships, just because you occasionally have that ridiculous overreaction from certain readers. I still upload them, obviously - I just usually plan to be away from the keyboard a bit afterwards.

Dream like experiences living my own stories sounds... Incredibly undesirable.
