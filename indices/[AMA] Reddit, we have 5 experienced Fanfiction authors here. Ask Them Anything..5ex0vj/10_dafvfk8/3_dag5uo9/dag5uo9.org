Everything I write I have usually been daydreaming about for a long time. When it comes to focusing, this is something I'm struggling with at the moment because I am both busy and very happy, but was easy for me last year because I was using writing to escape and going on long train journeys every weekend, which is when I wrote best. I never expected people to read it. Now that I know people do follow my stories I feel a different kind of pressure and can feel quite nervous about posting something, especially if I've put a lot effort in. I definitely feel hesitation about certain plots because I can almost picture certain reviewers being unhappy with it. I always just go ahead and do it though, because I think it's important that I do it for me and not anyone else.

I'm not sure. Perhaps I'm boring but your scenario is a bit too out there for me! My stories tend to focus on emotional journey rather than magical objects of power.
