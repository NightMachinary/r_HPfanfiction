Hi [[/u/TazKidNoah][u/TazKidNoah]]. When I drew the initial plot up of Assumptions - linkffn(Assumptions by GryffindorTom) - that was inspired by a story the late Broomstick Flyer, I actually felt sick to the stomach and was hesitant to publish it.

Some of the stories I wrote or scenes I wrote were actually published based on dreams I had of myself with a fly on the wall view in them. There's a scene in one of my stories, The Betrothal Situation, where it was actually conceived whilst I was asleep. This scene was the argument between Harry and Hermione at The Burrow.
