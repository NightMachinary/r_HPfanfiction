No dreams to date. I generally write the stories I want to write, I don't really try to write according to what I think many readers will like.

I found that you can't please everyone anyway - a quick glance at the pet peeves threads which crop up from time to time will tell you that many readers will dismiss a story at the drop of a hat.
