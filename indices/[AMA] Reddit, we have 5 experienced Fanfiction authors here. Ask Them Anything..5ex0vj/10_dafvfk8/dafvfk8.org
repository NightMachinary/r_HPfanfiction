Where in ur thoughts do u find the Order(focus mind) and Courage(Trust that ur Story will be loved by many readers)? Has there ever been hesitation when drawing up Plots etc........ Have you had dream-like experiences as if u were living in ur own stories?

Also, What would happen if Obscurial(Conceived by Werewolf Parents) came across Cloak of Invisibility, Resurrection Stone, Elder Wand during its lifetime?(regardless if it died or not?{within Young Age to Later Adolescence, its up to u if u want it to reach Adulthood/Elderhood})
