When I was very little and I had trouble sleeping at night my mom would tell me to just come up with stories in my head, like making up my own tv shows, and just imagine those stories until I fell asleep, and I don't think I've ever actually stopped doing this. lol

So 'Have you had dream-like experiences as if u were living in ur own stories?' -- yes. Yes I have. lol...

The reason I started writing was entirely because I wanted to organize the more elaborate stories I'd dream up at night so I could move forward better. Whether or not anyone else would like the stories was never part of the equation. In fact, I always assumed that no one would give two shits about any of it, and never intended to post anything ever. It was only about 7 or 8 years ago when I first started coming to ffnet that the idea first occurred to me to actually put things out there for other people to read.

As for hesitation in drawing up certain plots... yes, I've had that. In fact, I find that if I'm starting to worry too much about whether or not other people will like something I'm considering doing, I realize I need to take a step back and refocus. It messes things up if I'm too concerned with other people's opinions, and it screws up my motivation.

It's one of the reasons I like to write huge chunks of story and then post them at once, rather than post a chapter as soon as I've got it written.

As for your prompt... hmmmm. I dunno. the Obscurial concept is still fresh and I haven't gotten much chance to play with the idea any. Someone did post a question about what would it have been like if Harry had been an Obscurial due to his treatment by the Dursley's that made me go 'Oooooo.... that's a neat idea to explore' but that's about it. haha.

Taking a child, conceived by werewolf parents, who has suppressed their magic enough to become an obscurial, is a complicated enough concept on it's own, but throwing the Hallows into the equation... it's a pretty convoluted idea and I'm not even sure where to go with that. haha.
