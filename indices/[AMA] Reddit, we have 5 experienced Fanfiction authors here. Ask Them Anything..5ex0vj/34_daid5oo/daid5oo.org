I feel a bit weird asking a question since I've actually interviewed you before ;)

In the minds of many readers (myself included) your stories Not From Others and The Aurors are essentially canon. It is also a pretty good assumption that Rowling herself will never right or approve of a story set during Ginny's 6th year or anything between the battle and the epilogue.

Do you have any desire to write anything else set between that time period, particular an immediate aftermath story? If not, do you feel that there isn't any story there beyond the typical "struggling with grief" that would feel in canon?

Along those lines, as a Harry/Ginny writer, I know you and I have had slight disagreements over whether there would be any issues between Harry and Ginny in getting back together/staying a couple in the immediate aftermath.

Of everything you've seen on that topic, which possible issue do you think it most plausible and would you ever consider writing a fic that dealt with this? This is my way of asking for you to write the definitive post-Battle fic so I can move on with my life.
