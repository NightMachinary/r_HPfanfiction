Ultimately I agree that right after the battle would not be the time for conflict between the two. When things settle down and Ginny goes off to school, perhaps then there might be conflict purely based on the two not seeing each other much and both having jealousy streaks in them. That would be realistic both to their characters and to relationships at that stage in general. I think it would be interesting to explore the dynamic of this couple who risked their lives for each other yet had only dated a few weeks before taking a break and then a few months before Ginny goes off to school. There would be a lot of pressure for the relationship to succeed based on what happened during the war but a lot of things her final year of school that would try to come between them. Surprisingly, I've only read a few fics that actually deal with this specific story.
