I will be writing more canon compliant stuff during the time of DH, but not about Harry/Ginny and probably not an aftermath fic. I'll definitely be covering Remus's time in DH and possibly Dean and Seamus at some point. Anything I write about them will be a at least a year or two after the battle. I can see that healing process clearly in my head but it really wouldn't make for an interesting story. Any conflict between the would arise later, I think, when the dust had settled and grief stopped driving people's daily lives. I have to be honest and authentic in my writing; as a favour to people here I tried to write a Marge meets muriel fic once, but I just couldn't find it plausible and nothing I wrote of it was any good. I don't think I could write a realistic conflict between harry and Ginny within the first year because I don't think it would happen. I think the earliest I might be tempted to write post battle would be a Harry and Ron Aurors adventure while Ginny was at school.

For more Harry/Ginny stuff, I will be writing their engagement/wedding, probably as a fluffy one-shot, and their story will be interwoven with others.
