For me, it depends on the mood. Sometimes I'm super wide awake and will be writing scenes to like, pumping Nicki Minaj through my headphones. My general iTunes is very eclectic, but it's mostly dumb pop (through several eras) and showtunes. The lyrics can be distracting, is the issue.

Mostly I put on a soundtrack of specifically instrumental or choral pieces - like, there are a few things like Mozart, Verdi, Handel, but the majority is game soundtracks. I really like the music in FFX and FFXII, and thenI have a lot of the music from Xenoblade Chronicles!

You get a good musical line and deafener from everything else while keeping the musuc engaging.
