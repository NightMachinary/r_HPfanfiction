Hi [[/u/bunn2]]. I think my fic the Aurors (linked up top) is probably my best long piece of work. I have one shots I prefer but Aurors has a bit more going for it. I tried to balance an OC with plenty of Harry, and without the usual traps OCs often fall into, and I tried to create a plot with lots of tension and suspense and an interesting villain. There's no point trying to make a new Voldemort, so I used a villain who was highly emotional, not particularly skilled at magic and was someone you want to be innocent. This provided a twist perhaps halfway through the fic, and from then on a lot of the tension is driven by the reader knowing more than the characters and the dread they feel as they watch them falling into his trap. I also focused quite heavily on the platonic relationship between Harry and Theia - I wanted it to feel realistic and rich without it being romantic and without rushing it. They have a slow transition from colleagues to friends and it was important to me that the reader cannot pinpoint exactly when this occurs. It should grow in the background while the story focuses on the plot.

It wasn't a perfect fic. Lots of people here know how frustrated I got with a certain magical solution, which had to be corrected later. The OC is also quite flawed, and though she noticeably grows and develops as the story moves on, she was not immediately likable and I think a lot of people gave up. For future fics, I need to make sure there's a save the cat moment to prevent this.
