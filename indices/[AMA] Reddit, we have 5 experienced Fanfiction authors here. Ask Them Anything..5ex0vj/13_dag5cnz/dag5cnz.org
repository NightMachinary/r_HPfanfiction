I am quite excited to see you guys doing an AMA, especially during Thanksgiving break, one of the only times of the year I have free time to binge read, as I am unfamiliar with any of your works.

My question is to each author: as an avid, (self-proclaimed) impartial reader who tries my very best to judge fics not by pairing, genre, or timeline, which one of the stories that you have written is the best and what makes it the best/what makes it a good fan fiction?

I know you guys aren't here to advertise your material, and honestly the onus is on us to find good material to read. However I really couldn't resist, and so I will chance this question at risk of appearing rude. But Thanks for your time and for doing the AMA!
