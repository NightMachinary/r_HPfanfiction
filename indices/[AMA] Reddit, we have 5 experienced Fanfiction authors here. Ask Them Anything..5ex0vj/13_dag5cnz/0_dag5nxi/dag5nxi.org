Hi [[/u/Bunn2][u/Bunn2]], Thanks for the question, it's a hard one I'll give you that!

I would say The Betrothal Situation, my flagship story is the one I would say is my best. I've spent a significant time on it trying to explore different themes within it, themes of betrayal, deaths, hurt and comfort and the sense of friendship within.
