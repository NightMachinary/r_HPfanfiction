Yes.

I have a character death coming up at the end of the current book, and I have a scene with Harry and Snape written that's a good bit into the next book.

I have a few of the more fun character deaths written already too.

The scenes that I just keep visualizing and can't get away from are the ones I write way in advance.

I actually wrote the scene in Betting On Blood, with Harry furious in the Great Hall about his name being drawn from the cup, while I was writing Slytherin's Secrets, so there's a draft of it with Mad-Eye Moody instead of Cecilia.
