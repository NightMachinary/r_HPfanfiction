For The Betrothal Situation and Assumptions I had written the Epilouge about a quarter of the way through the story. When drafting individual chapters I usually write the scenes within as they appear in my head, so for example with The Potters v The Longbottoms, my Christmas Day layout in my notepad was something like a disorganised menace, with scene 4 towards the start and scene 1 towards the end of my notes

It depends on what's in my head at the time
