I have yet to watch the new movie, but I generally pick and choose what I use from canon anyway. It's unlikely that I'll use Magical USA, since in my stories, there's no united magical USA, but the fascist vibe I get from comments will fit in well with some of the American enclaves mentioned in my stories.
