I actually like to go back and reread my stuff. When I come across something I wrote like 5 years ago, it's usually like reading something for the first time because I totally forget it by that point. lol...

My memory is crap, so I don't even remember my own stuff very well.

Rereading my old writings usually results in me writing more on it, after not having touched or thought about it in years. I recently read through a story I wrote about 4 years ago and it's like, I remember why I liked the idea so much, and I got ideas for continuing it and went and wrote another 30 pages on it before I set it aside again. I do that shit all the time, which is awful and stupid and probably one of the biggest reasons my things don't get updated for ages since I don't see a point in posting 20 pages I added to some abandoned plot bunny.

I had one of these stories where I'd posted a 20 page first chapter to my Ao3 page and called it 'abandoned' but every few months I'd go back and re-read it and end up writing another 10-30 pages on it. At some point, someone posted a review on the 20 page plotbunny asking a question and I realized that I'd written stuff that addressed their question. I checked the word doc and found that it had reached 200 pages at some point when I wasn't paying attention. So I had more than 180 pages written but not posted, and I went ahead and posted it. Recently stuck it on my ffnet page too, so this weird tendency I have to re-read ancient stories usually ends up in them growing bit by bit, even if I've officially toss them into the 'abandoned bin' in my mind.
