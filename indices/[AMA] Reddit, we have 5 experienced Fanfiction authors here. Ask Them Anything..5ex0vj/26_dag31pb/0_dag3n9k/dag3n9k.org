I usually sort of enjoy the thoughts and memories of the writing experience. When I read through older works, I usually take note of errors and the like, but also take note of strange phrasing that I need to stay away from.

Part of the writing process for me is to experiment and play with stuff, so I like to keep track of things I've done and not done, how things work, et cetera.

An example is probably the use of bracketed side- thoughts in dream sequences and the like. I've played with them in one form or another over the years, but now I've settled on a version I like.
