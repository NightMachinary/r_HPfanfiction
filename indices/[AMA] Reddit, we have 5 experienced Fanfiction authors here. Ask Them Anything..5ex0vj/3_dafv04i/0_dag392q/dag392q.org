I already have work published in poetry and short story collections, but I want to get some of my own collections and novels published later on. At the moment I'm in a really active city, so I read and compete a lot at different readings, poetry slams and stuff.

Fanfiction is pretty cool in that I can have good craic and still be working a bit, but it's just a fun hobby I play with parallel to my career stuff. Similarly, I've published erotica on Amazon and written furry commissions - paid work, in that case, but still not the main goal.
