Hi [[/u/NarfSree][u/NarfSree]]. That scene in The Betrothal Situation was, as I pointed out in story, was in the Room of Requirements.

I am thinking about repackaging that as a story in the same universe, but to a different character as the Assumptions OS rewrite, if I decide to do a original story rewrite of it.
