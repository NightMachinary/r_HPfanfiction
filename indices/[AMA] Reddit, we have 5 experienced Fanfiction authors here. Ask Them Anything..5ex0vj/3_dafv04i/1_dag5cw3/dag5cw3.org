I would love to publish original work one day. Every now and then I have an idea that I get enthusiastic about for a couple of days and then convince myself is stupid. "A fantasy matriarchal world in an area like the Pacific Islands!" "An account of a French girl in ww1!" "A dystopian world that clones famous people and puts a ridiculous amount of pressure on the clone-babies!"

Nothing seems good and nothing sticks for more than a few days. But for HP, I'm thinking about it so much that whatever I'm writing is usually my headcanon that I've been thinking about for a long time and can see clearly. I just need to find something to obsess about on the same level.
