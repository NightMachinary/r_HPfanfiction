I just do it for fun. I might enjoy getting published some day, but I'd have to come up with an idea of my own that interested me enough to keep me working on it for an extended period of time - which I'm bad at. lol

Mostly I just enjoy writing fanfiction, which kind of negates a lot of publishing opportunities.
