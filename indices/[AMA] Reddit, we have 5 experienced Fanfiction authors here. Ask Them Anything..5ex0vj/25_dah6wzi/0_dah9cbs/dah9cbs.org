You know what really sucks? I haven't read any fanfics in ages. I just have absolutely no time for recreational reading anymore.

Prime example - During the last 30 seconds of trying to type a response to this, I've had my son interrupt me 3 times. I run my own business from home, look after my kids, and my marital life blew up a year ago, turning into a monstrous fireball of despair and misery and it's been a very slow and shitty journey to recover enough to feel functional again. But whatever - I just have no time to read anymore and it's a major bummer. If there's anything good I can say about it, when I looked at my old favorites list I see that several stories I used to follow are now finished, so if I ever find the time to go back to them, at least they're done now.

But yeah - I hardly remember a darn thing about any of them outside of thinking 'I remember really liking that one... but I don't remember what it was or why I liked it'.
