From a programming standpoint it was fun to work with something that had a text output (it'd be a stretch to call it a "narrative" output!) rather than a numerical output.

Using Harry Potter as my input text changed the project from "Huh, this is interesting" to "This is so cool!" Every output I've gotten so far has made me giggle.
