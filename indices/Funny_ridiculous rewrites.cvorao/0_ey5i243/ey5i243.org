Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is a rewrite of first year with supersmart Harry, crazy Dumbledore, competent Quirrel and confused Draco. The first chapters have some ridiculous scenes like the omnipotent Comed-Tea that always causes something funny or unexpected to happen. Or the game that can only be played once.
