That's basically another form of marriage law. Those who beat Voldemort and his sadistic genocidal terrorists are going to react very violently to this nefarious scheme cooked up by a weak government.

Unless, of course, it's a total AU in which a very strong Ministry or Order defeated Voldemort by itself, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]], linkffn(4269983). Now, that government would have the power and perhaps enough popular support to push through something similar.
