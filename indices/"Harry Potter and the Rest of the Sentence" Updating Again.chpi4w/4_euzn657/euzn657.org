Is this supposed to be a crack fic? Well, it's shit. It's bad and you should feel bad. Shame on you.

After a few bouts through Google Translate:

What is the flu? In fact, this is fun. Evil and evil. You should be proud of yourself

I feel, as an AI-generated story, it deserves a... computerized response.

Harsh initial sentences aside, this is hilarious to read through. I hope one day, when the world is taken over by AI, they'll look back at moments such as these fondly. Like, when you wrote your first story as a child and were so happy that you showed your parents, and they praised you despite how shit it must have been.
