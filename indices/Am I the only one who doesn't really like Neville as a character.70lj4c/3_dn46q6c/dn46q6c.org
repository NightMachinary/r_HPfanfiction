One of my favorite characters actually. I can really relate to him a lot. Him and Luna were always some of my favorite characters. (Along with Severus Snape but never mind that now).

I just love those kind of characters that's socially shy and then becomes a badass which Neville does, I mean heck he killed Nagini which was awesome! Wish he had been the one to kill Bellatrix, but hey we have Molly to thank for that!
