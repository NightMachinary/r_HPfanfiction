Remus is generally treated like Draco - people have created an image in their heads that has very little to do with the actual character. His tragic backstory certainly generates sympathy, but his actions from 1981 all the way to his death showcase one blunder after another. Viewing only the canon facts, it doesn't paint a pretty picture about his character.
