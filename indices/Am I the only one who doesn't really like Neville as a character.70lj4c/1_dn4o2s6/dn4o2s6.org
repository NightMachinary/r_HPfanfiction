Neville is actually one of those characters that I'm pretty indifferent to overall. When written well, he can be interesting, but otherwise I just don't really care about him one way or another.

I understand the feeling of disliking a character it seems like everyone else liked though. I have a, perhaps irrational, dislike of Remus Lupin.
