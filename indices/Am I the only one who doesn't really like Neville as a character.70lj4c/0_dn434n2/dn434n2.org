Neville is an awesome character. He's like the Magikarp of the Potterverse; he's weak to start with but if you work patiently with him he evolves into awesome.

Ofcourse, this metamorphosis is hard to portray. Sometimes he gets stuck as a Margikarp, sometimes he evolves into an OP legendary instead of a Gyarados. It can get annoying, but I really love Neville's character so I usually don't mind.
