It's hard to decide, really. I've got so many tie ins, but it's hard to separate them all into individual stories. The most viewed one of my fics isn't even really in the same universe as the others, but A Glance Askance is the series I'm working on, and my favorite out of that would be [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5094914][Odorless.]] /since it's the only one complete.../

But when I get it shoved out; my personal favorite is titled Wizarding Vacation: Ibiza. But again, with all the tie ins, it's hard to keep plots moving!
