I only have 2 one shot fanfics, one is a fluffy one shot of Ron and Draco as drunken friends post war. The other is a total 180 on the feel good of the first story. They're not connected, but in my other one Harry was taken prisoner for a time during the war and given the Dark Mark, and now post war he is haunted by it. They are both very short i.e. less than 1000 words.

I'm a fan of darker, more psychological stories so I probably prefer the second one. But if anyone wants to read either.
