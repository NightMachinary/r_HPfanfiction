I'm tempted to say it's my amazingly terribly awesome blogfic I wrote 8 years ago, which had vampires, swordsmanship and griffons, but since this is now archived as a hard copy in a secret vault below the Kremlin only for my bestest friends to ever read, I'll go with my current WIP, Lesser Evils.

It started out as a terrible challenge fic and went through two more meh iterations before becoming what it is now. I'm really quite proud of myself for coming up with some of the stuff in it and if you tell me any other fanfic did a better job of fleshing out a minor canon character, I'll stick fingers in my ears and sing Hakuna Matata at the top of my lungs.
