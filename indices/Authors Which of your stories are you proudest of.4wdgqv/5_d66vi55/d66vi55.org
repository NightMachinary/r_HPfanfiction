Well... I'm most proud of my novel that I'm currently writing.

But as this is hpff, I guess it would be linkffn(The Bloodmoon Rises)

I do like it a lot and I like whats coming. Its unpolished, not triple-edited like my novel, the plotline is literally written on an scrap of paper and well... its fanfiction. But I do think it is at least fairly entertaining and by far not the worst FFN has to offer.
