Some time ago, my keyboard puked all over the screen due to over-exertion (I was updating Untitled Tome twice a month at the time - it didn't last), and Harry Potter and the Fruits of Ennui was the result. It was scarcely proofread or polished and received marginal attention, but the few reviews I did get called it funny. Like "ha-ha" funny.

It had a profound effect on my self-esteem for a week or so, before I wanted to set fire to the keyboard for not typing the right words again.
