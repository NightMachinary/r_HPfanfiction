I try to maintain a biweekly posting schedule - every two weeks on Sunday. Occasionally, because of real life, a chapter will come out a week late - or I'll have two in quick succession.

I just posted CH12, but I'm already almost done with 13. I suspect it'll be out this Sunday - as an apology for the tardiness with the current chapter.

In any manner, I do have my fic planned out, so even if it takes a while to finish (length-wise) there won't be many - if any - long dry periods.

Cheers
