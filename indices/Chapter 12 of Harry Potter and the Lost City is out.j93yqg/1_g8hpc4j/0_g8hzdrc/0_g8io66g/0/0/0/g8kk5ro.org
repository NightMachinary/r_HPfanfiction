Honestly - I haven't put much thought into a definite pairing. Harry might have some romances, but I don't know which will be 'the one'.

However, I do have some idea of pairings which wont show up:

Harry/Hermione Harry/Ginny Harry/Luna

That's all. The rest, I think, are all open for consideration.
