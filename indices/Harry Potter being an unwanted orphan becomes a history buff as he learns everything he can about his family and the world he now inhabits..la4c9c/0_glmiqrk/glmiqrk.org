I'm at work so I just kind of threw together some ideas on break.

Year 1: A brand new world to live in with a whole family, and Harry has to learn it all to be the best that he can be. Harry becomes a history nerd learning all he can about his family and the wizarding war that took them and the greater wizarding world as he becomes friends with all of hogwarts ghosts asking them about their time alive and what they have seen since death. Professor Binns becomes his mentor.

Year 2. Harry goes to Nick's deathday party and stays late into the night conversing about history with all the ghosts. Knowing about myrtle the chamber is found but that isn't stopping the heir's attempts at revenge.

Year 3: harry is jealous that Ron got to see the pyramids. Harry is not allowed to leave England. Harry finds out about lupin and learns history from a non wizard perspective.

Year 4: Harry knows the full history of the tournament and is horrified when his name comes out. He remembers a case where one of the champions had to be reselected and recreates the situation so he does not need to compete.

Year 5: professor Binns having received too many complaints is replaced by Delores umbridge who has a unique outlook on magical history.

Year 6: professor bins is back and Harry has joined his class as a TA.

Year 7. While researching the hogwarts founders Harry comes across the horcruxes and sets out on a quest to destroy them before Voldemort can return.
