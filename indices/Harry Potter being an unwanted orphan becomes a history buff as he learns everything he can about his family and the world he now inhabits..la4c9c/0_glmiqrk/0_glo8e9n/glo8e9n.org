I'm all about it. I think this is a great angle to explore the castle, include cool worldbuilding by having conversations with the paintings, and finding forgotten places that have been lost due to the study of history falling out of fashion.

If you extend it to post-Hogwarts it would be a great basis for him to get into Curse Breaking, possibly even including an arc where he spends time learning under Bill at some point. There are only a few fics where we get to see a curse breaking expedition but I'm eager for more.
