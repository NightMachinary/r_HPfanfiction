I've read a bunch of fics that are post-war and involve Harry trying to learn more about his family, and they're always super interesting to me. But I'd love to see Harry dig into his history while he is at Hogwarts! I think it would have made his walk into the woods even more poignant, since I recall feeling like James and Lily were basically strangers to me even at the end of the series.
