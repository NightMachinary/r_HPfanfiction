I was always wanted to read something similar about Tom because it does take a lot of perseverance to go through all the books to track down your heritage. Unfortunately most of these scenes are either mentioned off page or Tom already knows about his past by the time he's introduced. However probably it's hard for most people to detail a personal research (considering that many fans even mistake canon for popular fan theories so they don't even get a lot of things right) and it's even more boring to write about it. I know I did a lot of research for a rather obscure topic in my thesis and I was at least able to use the internet so only a click away... but going from book to book and highlighting all the relevant parts would have been a nightmare. I spent almost a year doing that and at the time I wasn't a very interesting person except if you wanted to hear little known fun facts about the topic I was researching.
