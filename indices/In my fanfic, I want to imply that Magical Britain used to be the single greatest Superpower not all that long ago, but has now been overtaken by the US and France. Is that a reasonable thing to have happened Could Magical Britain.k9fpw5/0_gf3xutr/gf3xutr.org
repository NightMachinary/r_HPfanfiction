Yeah, I'd say France and Britain would almost have certainly been very strong world powers, but not because of population (which is hard to compare, given that wizarding populations are almost certainly more stable and entirely separate from muggle figures), but because of their schools. Hogwarts is a historically premier magical school as is Beauxbaton. Skill correlates to magical ability and power in HP. I would expect France and Britain to have access to skilled wizards, and thus be able to project more power. You can make changes accordingly to fit your world. Perhaps Beauxbaton only became one of the best schools in more recent times.
