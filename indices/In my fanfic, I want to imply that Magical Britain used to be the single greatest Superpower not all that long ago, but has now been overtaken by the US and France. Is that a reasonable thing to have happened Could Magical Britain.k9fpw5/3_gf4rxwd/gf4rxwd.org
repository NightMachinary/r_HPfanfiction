So long as you include reasons, because Britain still has Dumbledore who should be the player on the world stage.

The idea you should run with is that the blood purity war took its toll on the country and its slugging along, the post Grindelwald population was lost, so they are stumbling is an option.

US is difficult, since its such a large country, did the native american wizards manage to hold out? are they unified.

France is a contender, due to having a world class school in the country, same with possibly Germany/Russia/Scandinavia, it all depends.
