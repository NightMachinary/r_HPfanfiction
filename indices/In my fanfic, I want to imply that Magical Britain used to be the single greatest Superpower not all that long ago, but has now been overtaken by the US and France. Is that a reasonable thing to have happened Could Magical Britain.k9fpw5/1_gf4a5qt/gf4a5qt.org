Certainly it is possible. Not sure of the exact specifics of how, but I have a concept: After the First World War, there was the rise of the Blood Purity rhetoric in Britain, as such like most influential players, it began to collapse from the inside, and became increasingly isolationist. The petty infighting kept it from maintaining its soft power on the outside. It was this hotbed of infighting that allowed Voldemort to exploit it and rise. Whilst Grindelwald's War ravaged the continent, it healed so to speak and this led to a post war economic boom, but Britain in the midst of rising tensions and the brink of civil war.

It really depends on how Britain rose to prominence in the first place. Did your version of Britain become an imperial power like its Muggle counterpart? Or is there perhaps an ancient superstition about the Power of the Britons, like the Romans had (One of the reasons Rome irl originally had trouble going to Britannia in the beginning of their conquest, is because many of the Legionaries believed that Britain was a mystical island that belonged to the Gods, and they were afraid of setting foot there. Couple that with the Swells of the Channel being notoriously rough and treacherous, and Legionaries refusing to sail, its part of why Caligula declared war on Neptune.)

Does it have to be the US and France that become the dominant powers? I freely admit to being jaded by the number of bad fics where â€˜Backwards Britain has to be saved by the much superior US/France', but the values that govern the balance of power in the Magical World could be really interesting, especially if one of the major players is not one of the usual suspects i.e Western Europe, and instead Greece, Egypt, Transylvania and Peru etc, are the major magical players.

Just my two pence, no offence intended, this really just turned into a bit of a ramble
