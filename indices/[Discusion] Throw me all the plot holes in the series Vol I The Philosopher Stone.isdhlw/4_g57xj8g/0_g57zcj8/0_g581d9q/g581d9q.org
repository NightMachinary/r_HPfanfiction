I don't mean Ron, I meant Percy. The guy talks, a lot. Never mentioned a pettigrew before. The twins got the map during Their 1st year(89-90), that's more than a year they had to catch a glimpse of the rat near Percy. And then later see that same name near Ron.

I'd rather bring in the ancient monster instead of a troll. A troll that can be very easily traced back to Quirrel, by the staff anyway. And yes, AK would make way more sense. My guess is he wanted to leave the path as untouched as possible. That goes out the window if Fluffy is found dead the next time they show up to feed him.
