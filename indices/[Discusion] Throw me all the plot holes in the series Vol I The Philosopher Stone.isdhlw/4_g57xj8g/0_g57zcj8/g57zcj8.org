Marauder's map has often been explained as Fred and George not knowing all Ron's classmates and dismissing him as one.

With regards to Fluffy, I think Voldemort could have easily dealt with him with a killing curse... no need to bring in an ancient monster who could potentially kill/hurt others... especially when you are trying to be as quiet as possible.
