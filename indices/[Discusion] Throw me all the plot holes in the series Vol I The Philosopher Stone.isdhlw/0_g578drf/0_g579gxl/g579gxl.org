I was thinking on making Quirrel less cartoonish. And more skillful at fooling people.

I am actually going to make Hogwarts the only school, and no homeschooled people. So I am really going to make it big. And at least a second professor per subject. I can totally pull a 20k magical population with something over 1k students at Hogwarts. Also, limiting number of professional Quidditch teams to something like 3 in the uk.
