  Also, limiting number of professional Quidditch teams to something like 3 in the uk.

My own headcanon is that most of the Quidditch teams are semi-pro, and use the old 'Gentlemen & Players' model of old-fashioned cricket clubs. Maybe one or two all-pro teams, the Harpies being the prime candidate for this one.

The Cannons, meanwhile, are utterly devoted to the Corinthian Spirit. They not only refuse to have any professional players, they often fill out the starting lineup with whoever was least hungover from last night's shenanigans in the members' bar.
