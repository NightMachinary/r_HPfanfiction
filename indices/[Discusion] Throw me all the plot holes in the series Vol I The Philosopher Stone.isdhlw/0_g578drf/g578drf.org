For point three the easiest way to explain it away is that Hogwarts is the /best/ school in the UK, but not the /only/ school.

As for book one plot holes... one of the more egregious that I can think of is McGonagall dismissing their concerns out of hand. Either have her legit investigate or have Quirrel be confounding the staff all year to assume that their protections will keep the stone safe.
