I think that many of the things in Book 1 can be attributed to Dumbledore's intentions. Though it is still off that Dumbledore left so many possible problems to the luck,many things could have gone wrong there. Also, the professors were surely more informed of Dumbledore's intentions there than on the rest of the books
