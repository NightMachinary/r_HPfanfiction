The only good one I've seen other than the one you mentioned was a chapter in someone's one-shot collection called Chameleon. There are more out there, but I didn't enjoy them enough to save the links.

If you wanna find more, you could do a sub search. I know this request has been made a lot of times before, so there'll be a wide range for you to grab yourself. If you go to the reddit search bar and type in 'harry metamorph' or similar, then click the box to limit the search to this sub, you should get a whole load of results. Have fun! :)
