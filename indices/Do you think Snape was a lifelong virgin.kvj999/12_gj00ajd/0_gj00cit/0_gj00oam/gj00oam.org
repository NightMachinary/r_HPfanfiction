Lol no... My version of Snape is in platonic love with Lilly. He's just a human... Faulty and confused. He did what he thought he wanted to do... If nothing else, he tried... Always.

I don't worship his character or anything and definitely don't want to see two of them ending together (if somehow James dies and Lily lives). I'm just a fan of angst and as much as an accomplished occlumen Snape is, he has a lot of potential for angst.
