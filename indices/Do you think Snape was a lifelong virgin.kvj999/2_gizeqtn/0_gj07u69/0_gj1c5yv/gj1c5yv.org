I'm not saying he won't have /urges/ - as you said, sex and love are different in a certain sense.

However, for a great many people they are intertwined - you're taught, from the moment you ask what sex is, to /only do it with the one you love/. I'd imagine this is no different in the Wizarding World.

He'll have the urges and /refuse to give in to them/ because of his obsession.
