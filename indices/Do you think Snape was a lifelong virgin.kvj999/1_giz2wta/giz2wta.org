To be honest, it's not really something I've been pondering. Maybe? Does it even matter? Plenty of people go through life without sex, it doesn't make anyone less for it. If Snape legitimately cared (which I doubt), and he never got around to it as a teenager, he probably visited a prostitute at some point.

I doubt he ever fucked Lily, if that's what you're asking. If they did, I don't think he'd have ended up with the Death Eaters, because I could see Lily threatening to leave him way before it event went as far as the explosive canon break-down of their friendship if they were that close.
