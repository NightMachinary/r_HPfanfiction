Depends on multiple factors. I was one of the souls whose father bought their first time when I was 15. That's an experience I don't recommend.

If you're the type who thinks it should be special? Then definitely not. But that's fairly obvious.

However if your first time is something you're anxious over, a prostitute is a decent method of getting past those jitters imo. It won't be awesome probably. But realistically first time sex rarely is. With a prostitute you're in a controlled scenario. You know if you don't perform, worst case you're out max a couple hundred bucks. (It varies wildly depending on region, legality, employee quality, and work performed). Unless the employee is an asshole they won't care. Lot of them try to be nice about it because like any service job repeat customers make the business.

More impractically. Don't think of it as performing. It's just a fun thing to do with someone you care about. Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's just a quick hit of Oxytocin. Focus on having fun with your partner, not the act itself. Sex isn't special. Making each other feel good is, regardless of how it's done.

Or ignore this entirely. I'm just some anon on reddit. Nothing I say matters.
