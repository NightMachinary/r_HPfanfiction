Not really. Im from the US. Its just something his father did for him and etc. Ha, no conversations. My father didn't do conversations. Things happened, or there were consequences. Told me he'd bought a woman, to go in, and she'd teach me “what i needed to know”. Nice lady. Very professional about it. I appreciate that now that I'm older. She could've seriously traumatized me.
