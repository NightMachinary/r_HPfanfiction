It's never mentioned in cannon in detail what Death Eaters do on their raids .. killing or more disgusting things? it's mentioned I think about Fenir turning/biting children and forcing them into his pack but would these upstanding members of society sully their bodies with mudbloods & muggles? .. if so, that's very hypocritical of them just like their noble leader Tom.
