  Smolly Weasley. Molly is Kermit the Frog in his role as Captain Smollett in Muppet Treasure Island.

  I just had a mental image of Kermit/Smolly in a cross between his captain uniform and a French maid outfit, plus a redhead wig, getting railed over the Burrow's kitchen table by Albus Dumbledore.

  Is miss piggy Albus

  With gonzo as a strap on and rizzo as a beard?

  Gonzo as a strap-on... Like, his head strapped to her crotch, bucking Smolly with the nose? Or with his nose up her to hold him in place, bucking Smolly with Gonzo's back end?
