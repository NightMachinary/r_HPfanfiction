I aim to displease! Honestly though, this is tame compared to some of the filth my friend and I think up. Last week's "Muppet horror sex nightmares" conversation comes to mind. It was based on a fic where Albus Dumbledore is Ginny's biological father, which is traumatising enough on its own, and got considerably worse from there.
