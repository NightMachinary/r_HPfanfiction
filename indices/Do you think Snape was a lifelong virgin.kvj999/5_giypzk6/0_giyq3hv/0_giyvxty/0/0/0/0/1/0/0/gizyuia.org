1. The only evidence of his prejudice is that word, so yeah an aversion to the word is all the proof I need.
2. This wasn't a trigger in the sense you're assuming. If the painful memory alone had been the cause of his aversion he would have scarcely been able to spy on people like Lucius.
3. HE IS A HALF BLOOD
4. Why did he save... Draco, the silver trio, Hermione, Dumbles? Why did he try to save Sirius and Lupin?
5. Why did he ultimately accept having to send Harry to his death, thus failing Lily again?
6. Since Harry only did what he did because Voldemort killed his parents, and Dumbledore only did it to atone for his Dark Overlord phase, are you willing to dismiss them and their arcs as well? Snape is an honourable man, the end.
