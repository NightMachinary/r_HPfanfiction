The only evidence of his prejudice is not just that word, he was a death-eater before he heard the prophesy, he is not the type to take action before knowing the facts so he would have known about Voldy's goals and even if he didn't agree with them, didn't care enough that he saw his way to power/revenge through that cause ... all the changes from him came only when the war and his own actions threatened someone he cared about ... Just because he worked towards Voldy's downfall later does not negate his earlier sins.

I am not saying it's a trigger and I am not questioning his role as a spy, I fully believe he worked against Voldy, just for his own personal reasons ... Lilly's death and scolding a painting in his office where he can be relatively free is different from playing the role of a spy.

He took an unbreakable vow to assist Draco and even without it, Draco is his student and Snape didn't have a reason to act against Draco, I am not saying Snape is a monster or that he does not honor his responsibilities or promises but you can't just say he is an honorable man ... Meaning he deserves respect or high regard.

Saving Sirius and Lupin? He abhors both of them and he has history with them and likely wouldn't lift a finger to assist them if he can get away with it and with Dumbledore he may not have had a choice.

Why does agreeing to send Harry to his death to facilitate Voldy's death make him a good person? .. he is the last piece of Lilly so he would be sad and to defeat Voldy, Harry has to die as far as he knows.

Harry did what he did not just because Voldy killed his parents, Voldy likely killed many people's families ... They didn't go after him like Harry did, Harry has no choice as he knew Voldy will have to see him dead and due to prophesy there is a certain expectation and hope that he will be able to succeed unlike others who did not even come close and Harry had more info about Voldy than others next to Dumbles.

Dumbles did not have a Dark Overlord phase but a Overlord phase .. he did not trust himself with power due to that and Tom is his problem likely because of no one else that powerful ready to stand up to him and yes I am willing to judge him based on his actions too .. he is as flawed as the rest of them.

There are several shades of grey, can't be so black and white .. I am not disputing Snape played a large role in the war or comparing him to death eaters like Lestrange or Fenir but he is not pardon the pun lilly white either.
