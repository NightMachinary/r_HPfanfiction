  The only evidence of his prejudice is not just that word, he was a death-eater before he heard the prophesy, he is not the type to take action before knowing the facts so he would have known about Voldy's goals and even if he didn't agree with them, didn't care enough that he saw his way to power/revenge through that cause ... all the changes from him came only when the war and his own actions threatened someone he cared about ... Just because he worked towards Voldy's downfall later does not negate his earlier sins.
#+end_quote

The Death Eaters weren't that much more prejudiced than was mainstream, and Sev's been groomed into them by Lucius since he was 11, on top of being abused by his Muggle father and having crimes against him enabled and covered up by the Leader of the OOTP. JKR expressly said he sought to impress Lily with that move, and that he acted out of a sense of insecurity and powerlessness. He is not the type to take action before checking the facts... as an adult. Because he learned a tragically painful lesson.

  I am not saying it's a trigger and I am not questioning his role as a spy, I fully believe he worked against Voldy, just for his own personal reasons ... Lilly's death and scolding a painting in his office where he can be relatively free is different from playing the role of a spy.

And indeed the way he acts when he's alone or with Dumbledore and not wearing a mask is the real Snape.

#+begin_quote
  He took an unbreakable vow to assist Draco and even without it, Draco is his student and Snape didn't have a reason to act against Draco, I am not saying Snape is a monster or that he does not honor his responsibilities or promises but you can't just say he is an honorable man ... Meaning he deserves respect or high regard.
#+end_quote

I can definitely say he's an honourable man because he is. Snape is the only one who lifts a finger to keep students at Hogwarts safe. He didn't have to take an unbreakable vow, and he didn't have to promise to euthanize Dumbledore, and he didn't have to do anything, including going to Dumbledore in the first place, because all of this meant grave personal danger, but he did it anyway. Honourable.

#+begin_quote
  Saving Sirius and Lupin? He abhors both of them and he has history with them and likely wouldn't lift a finger to assist them if he can get away with it and with Dumbledore he may not have had a choice.
#+end_quote

He didn't have to warn Sirius not to go to the Ministry. He didn't have to try to save Lupin in the 7 Potters battle. He didn't have to save Dumbledore who would have died if not for him. What are you talking about? Also, he didn't have to carry Sirius back to Hogwarts on a stretcher at the end of POA. He could have called the Dementors. Honourable.

#+begin_quote
  Why does agreeing to send Harry to his death to facilitate Voldy's death make him a good person? .. he is the last piece of Lilly so he would be sad and to defeat Voldy, Harry has to die as far as he knows.
#+end_quote

You say he did everything he did out of love for Lily. Then he does something that cannot be explained by his love for Lily, to defeat Voldemort. So you're wrong and his main goal was to defeat Voldemort, regardless of Lily. This point is also driven home by Cursed Child, which you can ignore if you want, but JKR didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Harry did what he did not just because Voldy killed his parents, Voldy likely killed many people's families ... They didn't go after him like Harry did, Harry has no choice as he knew Voldy will have to see him dead and due to prophesy there is a certain expectation and hope that he will be able to succeed unlike others who did not even come close and Harry had more info about Voldy than others next to Dumbles.
#+end_quote

Meaning, by your logic, Harry is not a hero and there's nothing particularly brave, inspiring, or honourable about the boy who constantly put himself in danger for others, who always chose love, who willingly walked toward death at 17 to save the world?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbles did not have a Dark Overlord phase but a Overlord phase .. he did not trust himself with power due to that and Tom is his problem likely because of no one else that powerful ready to stand up to him and yes I am willing to judge him based on his actions too .. he is as flawed as the rest of them.
#+end_quote

He definitely had a Dark Overlord phase because Grindelwald was his co-tyrant and Grindelwald is Dark. Not that I care about this classification because it's meaningless. By the logic you present, Snape is more honourable than Harry or Dumbles because Snape could have thrived under Voldemort's reign and Dumbles and Harry couldn't, and yet Snape chose not to. Honourable.

#+begin_quote
  There are several shades of grey, can't be so black and white .. I am not disputing Snape played a large role in the war or comparing him to death eaters like Lestrange or Fenir but he is not pardon the pun lilly white either.
#+end_quote

I didn't call him lily white (nice one!), I called him honourable. Granted, it's a matter of definition, so you may avail yourself to dutiful, moral, remorseful, reformed, redeemed, devoted, conscientious, your choice.
