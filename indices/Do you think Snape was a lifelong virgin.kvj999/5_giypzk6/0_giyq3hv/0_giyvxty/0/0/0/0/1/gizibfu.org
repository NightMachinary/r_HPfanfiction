Voldy sent him to get a job, he couldn't even get an interview, so he told Voldy what he had eavesdropped on. Many wizards think divination is nonsense, Sev may well have, and may well have assumed Voldy did too. Incidentally, the half of the prophecy he heard /doesn't/ actually suggest a fetus. I won't say being a DE and delivering the prophecy was honourable, but it was honourable to spend the rest of his life atoning for these things, saving as many lives as possible, at no benefit to himself. And of course he thought what Voldy was doing was wrong: "Don't use that word", to Phineas's portrait. Is it not enough of a spoonfeed for people? I don't understand.
