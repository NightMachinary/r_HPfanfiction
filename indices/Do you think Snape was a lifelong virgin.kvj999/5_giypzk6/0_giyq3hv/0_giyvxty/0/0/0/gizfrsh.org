Really? /I/ believe that's because he had a deep streak of a conscience, honour, and an understanding of what love was or wasn't. That quote you pasted... from Snape's point of view, it's exactly accurate. He thinks James died because of his faith in Sirius, and he has indeed just ran into the shrieking shack to save Potter, and unlike the sorcerer's stone incident, he is doing it in Harry's plain sight.

My question, you see, was ironic. If you assume Snape is evil and obsessed and entitled, he becomes nonsensical. Why would the Dark Arts and Potions genius (and Slytherin) not use his gift to get what he wants? As for attaining Lily organically, false on both counts, I'm afraid. He never even asked her out. And JKR confirmed that Lily might have chosen him if he had not been drawn to people like Avery and Mulciber.

"Yes. She might even have grown to love him romantically (she certainly loved him as a friend) if he had not loved Dark Magic so much, and been drawn to such loathesome people and acts."

So I guess Snape should have pulled a James and gone on ahead with whatever bullshit he was pulling before, but lied to Lily about it.

Speaking of bitter entitlement:

  “What is it with her?” said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him. “Reading between the lines, I'd say she thinks you're a bit conceited, mate,” said Sirius. “Right,” said James, who looked furious now, “right ---” There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside down in the air. “Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?”
