  /I/ believe that's because he had a deep streak of a conscience, honour, and an understanding of what love was or wasn't.

He went and reported the half heard prophesy to Voldy, where was his conscience and honor in that? if so, that tells a lot about the man .. he only went to Dumbledore when he realized it's gonna be Lily's child and Lily might get killed .. so it's alright with him if it's someone else's child? what did he think Voldy was gonna do? a child to be born that has the power to vanquish him? not kill him at his lowest? .. I do pity the man but he is in no way is a good man, he only helped Dumbledore and acted as spy for his love for Lily .. not because he thought what Voldy was doing was wrong.
