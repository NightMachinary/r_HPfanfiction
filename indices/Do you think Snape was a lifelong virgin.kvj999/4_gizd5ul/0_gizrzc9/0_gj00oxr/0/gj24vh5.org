I agree with most of this, except that I personally don't consider paying for sex to be something to mock/accuse someone for. But yeah, I don't really understand why OP brought this up. I figured what they were really trying to ask was "did he ever do it with Lily" but wanted to avoid the inevitable downvote storm, and answered as such. If he was truly wondering about Snape's sex life.. well then, I have nothing to say to that.
