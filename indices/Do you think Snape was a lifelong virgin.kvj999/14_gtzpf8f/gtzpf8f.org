This thread is disgusting. I do not understand the obsession some people had with Snape's sexual life.

That said, almost certainly not. As Harry Potter is a children's book series, we get basically no evidence that /anybody/ has had sex unless they have a child. Snape is one of the few exceptions.

Snape loved Lily, truly and purely. Voldemort's downfall came from the fact that he couldn't understand that, and believed him to be both obsessed with her and only lusting after her. (/"he desired her, that was all"/) Snape had to convince him that that was the truth and that he had moved on to be able be an effective spy and get Voldemort to believe he was still loyal. That involves feeding him memories. We do not know exactly how Occlumency operates, and while we do know that one can make fake memories, the only example we see in the books of a modified memory is easy to distinguish as fake. While it is possible that Snape had the skill to do this, it is not certain, and will always have been more risky than just providing him real memories.

And indeed, Voldemort seems convinced that Snape had moved on. /"and when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him-"/

So yes. We have evidence that Snape did indeed had sex, with more than one pureblood woman, for the purpose of being an effective spy. Is this /proof/? No. But it's more evidence than any other adult in the series who has not had a child.

This doesn't mean that Snape had relationships (sex != relationships). I don't believe he would ever willingly enter one unless by some miracle he had survived the end of the war. The specter of Voldemort's return and his return to spying would haunt any potential relationship he might have. Additionally, he doesn't really have the free time for.
