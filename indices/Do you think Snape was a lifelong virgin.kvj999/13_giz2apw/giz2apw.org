These are the kind of questions that shouldn't even be asked much less assumed. It's unnecessary. Almost like jkr trying to force inclusivity after years of the books being published. His sex live has absolutely nothing to do with his character. Absolutely nothing is implied on that account. It would be interesting to see how in fics that would be portrayed but honestly- it feels invasive. Making these kinds of assumptions taint the character, his development and everything that is canon.
