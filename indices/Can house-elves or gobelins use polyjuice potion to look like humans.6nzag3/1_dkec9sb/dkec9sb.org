Polyjuice is sympathetic magic, it's the subtility that Snape venerates, not a blunt instrument. It's effect is hard to obtain (a month to brew it), need preparation (the part of the one you want to turn into), is very limited (1h, only humans), is only cosmetic (you aren't magically able to act like the one you copy); but, in a prepared hand, it can be extremely powerfull (see: Uther's progeny; bank robery; flying cakes).\\
Now, it could probably allow a house elf to impersonate another house elf, a goblin another goblin.... would Flitwick or Hagrid be able to use it with human hairs? What happen if you try it with a werewolf hair under a full moon? These are probably the questions that keep Snape greasy!
