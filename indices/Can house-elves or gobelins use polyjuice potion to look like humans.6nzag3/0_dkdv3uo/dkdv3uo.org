I would say no. Potions are delicate and temperamental in canon. To me that suggests they are very specialised and would therefore be restricted to human to human transformation. Hermione and the cat suggests this might be true. It might be possible that modifications could be made to the potion to allow cross species transformations and compared to some of the things I've seen in fics this wouldn't be too immersion breaking for me.
