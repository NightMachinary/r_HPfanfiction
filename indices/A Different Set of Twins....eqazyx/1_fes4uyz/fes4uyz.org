I imagine Ron being against the relationship, but not in the usual bashing sense. Rather, he's freaked out by the twins' expressionless and emotionless fa√ßade and is worried for Harry.

Harry though learns to roll with it. So when the twins bring him Pettigrew's head, Ron goes "see? they're insane!" while he's like "aww, how sweet, you shouldn't have".
