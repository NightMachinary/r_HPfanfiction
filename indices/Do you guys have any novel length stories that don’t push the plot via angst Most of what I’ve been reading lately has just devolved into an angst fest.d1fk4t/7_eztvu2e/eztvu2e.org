The two things I can't stand are angst and politics so I have a whole list of suggestions. The following are complete and above 100k words:

​

Fantastic elves and where to find them linkffn(8197451)

This and its sequel form a fairly self contained novel length piece. Harry is definitely an elf, he has the ears to prove it and will shoot anyone who says otherwise. As a real elf, Harry believes that angst, depression and the like are for lesser races like humans, goblins, werewolves and anything else that isn't an elf.

​

For Love of Magic linkffn(11669575)

This story drags on in places and has a lot of smut. But it is complete and enormous. It features an evil Harry who slowly falls into darkness but is pretty cool with that. No angst that I recall.

​

weeb linkffn(12350003)

Harry is a weabo. 120k words. Obviously comedic, rehashing cannon, not a whole lot of angst.

​

Moving to incomplete stories I can offer a few more:

​

Harry the Hufflepuff linkffn(6466185)

A series of 3.3 books so far and about 50k words. If it ever finishes (sadly looking less likely) it should hit 100k.

No angst. Angst is effort and Harry is against that. Well written, comedic, cannon rehashing.

​

The Fire that swallowed the world linkao3(15832620)

Still in the early stages and already at 70k words.

Harry is a fire elemental fused into the body of a little girl.

Turns out fire elementals aren't big on Angst .

​

Harry is a dragon and that's okay linkffn(13230340)

Over 250k words and still going strong.

What it says on the tin. HP is a dragon, human sized and for some reason I can't fathom still dressed in robes and glasses. No angst, captures the whimsy of the first book and runs with it, light hearted but not played entirely for laughs, well written, wholesome I guess. If you don't find the initial premise too distracting this might be worth a look.
