  The twenty-four-year old Auror Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.As the Master of Death, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Now, not really sure what to do, he decides to see what time will bring.Perhaps a change in the Ministry won't be too bad. Voldemort might be insane, but that doesn't mean, that all his plans are stupid.Accompanied by Death, Harry chooses that this time, he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
