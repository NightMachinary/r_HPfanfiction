If you haven't already, I'd suggest trying out Methods of Rationality. Some love it, some loathe it; I think it's a funny and thought-provoking read, and worth making up your own mind. The expanded introduction is linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMOR), which smooths out the first four chapters.

Note that it's actually more series-length than novel length.
