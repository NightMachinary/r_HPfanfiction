There are so many stories that I can recommend, but off the top of my head [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] is a great author for non angst fest novel length stories. Linkffn(2318355) Make A Wish, is my favorite story of his but any of his stories are fun and interesting.
