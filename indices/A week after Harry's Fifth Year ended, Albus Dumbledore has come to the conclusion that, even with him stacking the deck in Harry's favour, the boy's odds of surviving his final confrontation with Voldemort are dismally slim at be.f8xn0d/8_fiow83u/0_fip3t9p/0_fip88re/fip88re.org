"Potter, Is that you?" Draco asks a completely inebriated Harry, who in question was downing some sort of muggle liquor. Harry just raised an eyebrow and offered him the bottle of harsh smelling alcohol.

The morning light stung Draco's eyes. He rolled over only to encounter a warm body. Draco buried his head in the stranger's chest to block out the offending light and noise. After a few minutes of blinking and squeezing his eyes shut the blanket of sleep started to ebb away from his mind. The heaviness that dragged his eyelids down started to disappear. When his eyesight focused enough to make out the features of his one-night-stand, a very familiar mop of unruly black hair and tanned, wind-bitten skin greeted him. Right as it registered that he, Draco Malfoy had just slept with, and most likely fucked Harry Potter. The hotel door slammed open, causing Draco to bolt up to see Dumbledore in flowery shorts barge in and yell "Harry? Harry! You need to get up, my boy, we'll be late to the L'ourve. Har-?" Dumbledore was stunned into silence as he realized that a) Harry wasn't in bed by himself and b) that Draco Malfoy was in bed with Harry.
