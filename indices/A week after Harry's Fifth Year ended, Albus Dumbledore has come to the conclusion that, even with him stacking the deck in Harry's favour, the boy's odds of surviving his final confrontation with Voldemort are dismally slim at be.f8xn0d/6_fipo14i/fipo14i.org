'Harry.'

'Headmaster.'

'I have grave news.'

'Really,' Harry said, mildly sceptical that anything could be worse than Sirius' death.

'Well...,' Dumbledore took a deep breath. 'You know that line about how one cannot live etc? It means that, at your final confrontation, both you /and/ Voldemort, will die. I've tried to prevent it, believe me, but you chances of survival are abysmally slim.'

'No different from the snake then,' Harry laughed, slightly hysteric. 'Or the 100 dementors you let me up against because the great Albus Dumbledore couldn't possibly be seen defending S- Sirius.' He very nearly seemed to choke on his words before continuing. 'Or that bloody tournament you could have gotten me out of.'

Dumbledore /very nearly/ defended himself against that unfair accusation (he couldn't subvert a signed (magical) contract!) but he knew Harry would need to let this out before he could continue.

'Goddamnit, Dumbledore! I could be so. Much. More! I have -had- my whole life in front of me!'

He threw some stuff off the table, pacing around. 'I- I don't want to die,' Harry ended tearfully.

'I know, Harry, I know. Which is why I've got a surprise planned. One last holiday with this old man here, in which you shall have everything you could possibly ask for.'
