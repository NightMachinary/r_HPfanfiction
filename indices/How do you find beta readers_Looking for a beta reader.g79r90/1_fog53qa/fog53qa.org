Well, you can post like you are doing, you can go to the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] sub and enter yourself into their scheduled event (I forgot what day it's on, but the timetable is in the sidepanel thing), or you can go through the beta function on FFnet (check the top bar under the blue one and it's the last option from the left, then you filter through to get Harry Potter people and just go through profiles until you find one you like).
