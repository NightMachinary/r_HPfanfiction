Well, the way I did it was just by PMs on FFN. I mentioned that I was not a native speaker, my to-be beta offered his services, and there you go. Obviously, that requires someone already interested in one of your fics with the skills and time required.

You also should tell what exactly you are looking for. Someone to help you with the plot, ideas, themes and the like? Someone who can Britcheck? Someone to find the mistakes the spellchecker missed?

It is also important that you and your beta have a similar outlook on the universe. If someone is a diehard Snape fan and asks me to beta their work, I would end up marking a lot of it as "to be reworked" because Snape would be, in my opinion, totally OOC. You don't have to agree on everything (preferred pairings, favourite divergence), but you should not clash over the fundamentals of your work.
