For context, mine is a Good Dursley Family fic - afaik, these are few and far in between and haven't been done in the way I'm doing it (so I took it upon myself to write it myself). I'm rewriting the entire series and am currently about more than a third through PS, and you can see what I've published so far on AO3 linkao3(Mr. And Mrs. Dursley-Evans' Very Extraordinary Morning; Harry Potter-Dursley-Evans and that Supremely Surreptitious Stone)
