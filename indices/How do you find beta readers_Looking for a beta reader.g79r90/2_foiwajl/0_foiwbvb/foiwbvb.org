  Why were the Dursleys so mean?Harry's personality, his actions, his choices, even those in the later books, are all influenced by his upbringing at the Dursley's horrid household. Had he been raised differently, would he have made the same decisions? Would he still have been on the side of the Light? Would the story of Harry Potter still fundamentally be the same as we know it today?What if the Dursleys were good? And not only good but kind? And raised him right, in a loving household, as he deserved?Open the fic to see the real summary - this is just an introduction.
