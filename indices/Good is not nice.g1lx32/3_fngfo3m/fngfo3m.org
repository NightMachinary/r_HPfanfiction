I have not actually read many fics that fit what you want exactly. But I am recommending fics I think you might like.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12402654/chapters/28221378]] Men of War, Harry travels back in time to the period just before Grindelwald War.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19889305]] Outrages so hideous. Harry acts outside of the law as a last resort. This is a post war fic but I thought you will like it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12676941/1/The-Howler]] Harry goes vigilante in 5th year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12820209/1/A-Serious-Hunt]] The war is stopped before it can even begin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13266686/1/Not-Dumbledore]] The death eaters really should not have gone after Hermione. Another fic set in the post war era
