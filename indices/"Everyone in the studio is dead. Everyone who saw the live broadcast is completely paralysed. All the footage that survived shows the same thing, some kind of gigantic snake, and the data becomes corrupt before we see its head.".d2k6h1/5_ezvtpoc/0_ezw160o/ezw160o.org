Mandrakes would probably confuse muggles a lot if the Statute of Secrecy went down. A plant that looks humanoid, moves around, throws parties, et-cetera, how certain are the wizards that it's ethically alright to cut them up to make potions?

Hey, I just had a funny thought; with the massive damage caused by the rogue basilisk, the Statute of Secrecy becomes untenable in Britain (assuming that's where it happened). But the British Ministry don't want to admit to a screw-up of /this/ scale to the ICW and other magical countries, and the muggles don't want to forget about magic, so with a great deal of very quick negotiation, the wizards/witches and muggles come together to make their own Secrecy Statute, working together to hide the big breach from other countries and those terrorist groups/crime syndicates that would abuse magic.
