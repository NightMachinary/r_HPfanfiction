The petrified muggles are essentially dead. Even with total wizard cooperation, the population doesn't support mass scale mandrake harvesting. Apparently they are rare enough that it was faster to grow them at Hogwarts than purchase them elsewhere.

As for covering it up, it would be virtually impossible. Someone investigating is bound to happen to know that magic exists, if nothing else. The only way for magical beings to stay hidden would be unbreakable vows forced on everyone, and obliviating anyone a muggleborn ever met prior to joining the magical world.

Best excuse to buy time would be blaming it on aliens, a basilisk could be from space just as easily as magic exists.
