Just give a weird pseudoscience explanation regarding signals received by the image that short circuits the brain and you'll fool the general public. A few confundus charms and it just seems like another wacky thing that came from deep below the sea or some shit. Once there's an official, if outlandish explanation, people are going to be a lot more likely to believe that than to believe magic exists.
