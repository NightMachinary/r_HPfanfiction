Keeping the existence of magical society hidden might be possible, but I find it hard to believe the weave doesn't unravel when you pull out a major thread like that.

There is a /huge/ difference in hiding what no-one is looking for and hiding what everyone is looking for. At the very least we are never shown wizards dealing with the latter so it would be a new/stressful, potentially dramatic situation...

Reguardless, once magic has been acknowledged, even a single creature, two very challenging new realities occur:

1. Muggles will be actively developing technology to find/understand magic. They would have to after such an event. This would not bode well for secrecy.
2. Perhaps more important, you can no longer assume anyone who goes ranting the truth to a muggle newspaper would be ignored. "Well if you told who would believe you" is a pretty common idea. That is completely out the door after something like this.
