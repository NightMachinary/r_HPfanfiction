There is no way that doesn't end with the discovery of magic by muggles. It already stretches the imagination to say that a magical society described in the books would actually be able to keep the secret, and you have to rely on "Well, no-one would believe people if they tried to tell the truth".

​

A massive, widespread, physical evidence that the laws of physics do not function would be the target of intense, very public scrutiny by the entire world. There would be really no way to paper over inconsistencies or surgically target specific people. Every scientific effort in the world would be explicitly trained looking for anomalies, so the standard 'magical side effects get explained away by other phenomena' would probably not slide.

​

Just a studio shutting down? That could be explained (magically mind wiped) away. Images that can petrify through the television/over the air? You would literally have half of all the military budgets in the world working on the sole project of trying to reproduce it....

Also, people would be scared. You know the whole "Wizards are worried muggles discovering magic will go on a rampage" trope always felt super fake: There is just no way 'we found some people with extra abilities' translates to 'kill them all'. You can explain it away a bit by it just being the paranoia of wizards, but it always seemed farfetched.

​

But in this scenario? Thousands to hundreds of thousands paralyzed in a way indescribable by the best science in the world, with the constant fear that any screen you look at might kill you? Yea, the fear and paranoia that comes from that could easily result in a VERY hostile reveal compared to your standard discovery...
