Well, then the wizarding world is just another name on the list for those people ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's not as if the world couldn't have helped them before. If anything, wizards have a better reason not to help. They've been hunted, and there's a limited amount of them.

What would they help with specifically? It could only be one major problem. And even then, not really. Wizards couldn't cure all cases of cancer. There's just not enough of them. So how could they even help muggles in any significant way? It'd have to be minor, and that's all with the risk of being hunted.

And it's not like these people could do anything to wizards anyway.
