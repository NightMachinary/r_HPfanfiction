I feel like X-Men type stuff would happen. Plus all the magical creatures. If people learn about them they could begin being hunted to extinction/captured for a zoo, stuff like that. Plus I remember reading a fic where there was a magical way to cure cancer but only about 5-6000 every few years. How would people choose who gets cured?
