  It'd have to be minor, and that's all with the risk of being hunted.

  And it's not like these people could do anything to wizards anyway.

They why hide? That's the problem with these secrecy debates. Either they're hiding because they were being hunted and afraid of the Muggles, or they're hiding because they want to be left alone. This "we hide from Muggles because they could kill us but we're better than them" bs is really annoying. Grindelwald and Voldemort are awful wizards but they made a point about not wanting to hide in their superiority.
