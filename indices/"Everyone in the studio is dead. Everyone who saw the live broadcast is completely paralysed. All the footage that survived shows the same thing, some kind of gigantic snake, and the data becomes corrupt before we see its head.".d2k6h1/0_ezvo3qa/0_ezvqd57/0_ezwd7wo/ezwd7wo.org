Oh I completely agree.

However, I was more commenting on the extreme characterization of "revealed society -> mass witch burning".

A good author has it as a misinformed magical opinion, which... Actually fits the wizarding world's knowedge of all things muggle

But so many seem to take it dead serious...

(I mean, something like "Justice, Justice You Shall Persue"? Totally fits.)
