  Also, people would be scared. You know the whole "Wizards are worried muggles discovering magic will go on a rampage" trope always felt super fake: There is just no way 'we found some people with extra abilities' translates to 'kill them all'. You can explain it away a bit by it just being the paranoia of wizards, but it always seemed farfetched.

IMO, that sound extremely realistic. Human history is full of people killing others because of their differences, war being started because of different beliefs... And let's not forget about the military and various governments, who, I think, would take a "you're either working for us or a danger to us" stance. And while I don't think every muggles would be out for blood, I think there would be a lot of violence simply because the stupidest are also the loudest.
