Hiding it would require something like a fidelius charm on knowledge of magic- it'd be very complex magic on a global scale. Granted, I also think that's the only way magic stays hidden in an age where everyone has a camera on their phone and is constantly connected to the internet, so I assume that they figured something like that out.
