As for why it's fairly simple, some dark lord has decided the statute of secrecy only exists to protect muggles from wizards, when wizards are clearly superior and should be controlling the world.

This breaks the statute of secrecy nice and thoroughly, giving the wizarding world in general little option but to sieze control of the muggle one, for even those who aren't prejudiced have little interest in being ruled by muggles.\\
It also provides an excellent first strike against the muggles, with a massive body count.

This is the sort of reveal that can really only lead to conflict, no peaceful relations here.

This basalisk lord isn't just relying on the superiority of wizards in combat (and since all his troops wear shield hats and cloaks to protect agaisnt surprise attacks and dwell in unplottable muggle repelling areas they have a very strong advantage indeed), he's got basilisks with portkeys.\\
it's not just a single TV studio, it's every live broadcasting studio in the world, parliament, the white house, the kremlin and similar locations. Billions of muggles fall in the first attack and their only real options for fighting back are to bombard their own cities with artillery and aircraft, as noone can actually aim at the things withough keeling over.
