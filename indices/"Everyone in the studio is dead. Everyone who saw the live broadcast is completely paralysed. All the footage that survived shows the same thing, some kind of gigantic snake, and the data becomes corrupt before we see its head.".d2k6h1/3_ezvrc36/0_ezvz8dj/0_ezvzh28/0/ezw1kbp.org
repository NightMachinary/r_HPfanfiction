I disagree. While its certainly possible that they could plant that story in the media or scientific community, I don't think it'd be widely accepted. Consider that [[https://news.gallup.com/poll/19558/paranormal-beliefs-come-supernaturally-some.aspx][21% of people in the US believe in witches,]] even without there being any real evidence for it. This varies from country to country, but the media landscape is so fragmented and trust in science/the government/the media is so low that I just don't see a 'scientific' explanation being widely accepted, particularly when it would be a fabrication.

Granted, this isn't the same as people finding out about the wizarding world, but it'd be a crack in the foundation for sure.
