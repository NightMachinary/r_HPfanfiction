But the Basilisk is magic, its beyond science, how would they figure out what's going on? Is it confirmed that nobody was confunded to hide what happened with the platapus? Because that honestly doesn't make sense to me.

On an anatomical level, platypi definitely aren't hybrids of other animals, and are shown to be most closely related to the echidna. If a wizard created the platypus, then that wouldn't be true, so it seems like there has to be some sort of deception on behalf of the wizarding community.
