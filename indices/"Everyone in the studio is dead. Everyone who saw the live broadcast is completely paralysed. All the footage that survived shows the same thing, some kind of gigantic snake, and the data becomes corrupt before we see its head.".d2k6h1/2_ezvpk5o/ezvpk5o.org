First, given what happened to Colin's camera, it's not clear that the basilisk's gaze would actually transmit over the airwaves instead of just destroying the equipment, and that's before you account for the six-second delay that live broadcasts usually have, but we can assume it does for now. Second, we don't know for certain, but people who are petrified would probably register as dead to muggle science--as in no signs of life--but they also don't decay and are as immobile as stone while still appearing to be flesh and blood. I'm not sure muggle biology or materials science would be capable of accounting for that.

But even if you handwave that, I think it would be an end to the Statute of Secrecy. It would be impossible to hide from the muggles that something defying the laws of physics was happening. There would be enormous pressure for muggle-borns especially to reveal the existence of magic, and even if the Ministry prevented it from getting into the muggle news, it would spread by word of mouth, and people would /believe it/.

The petrified muggles would be in a serious predicament, though. They could only be revived by planting enormous quantities of mandrakes, which are things that could be just as deadly as the basilisk itself if misused. At that point, I feel like the whole thing just dissolves into a lot of infighting, and I don't know who comes out on top.
