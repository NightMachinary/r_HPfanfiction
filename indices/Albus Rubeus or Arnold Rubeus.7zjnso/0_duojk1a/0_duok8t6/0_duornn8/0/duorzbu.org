/Edit/ because my reasoning was confusing... This quote from GoF

"'...the Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.'

Malfoy looked up.

'Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It's almost as though he's a complete nonentity, isn't it?' he crowed."

And with everyone saying, /Hedwig Dobby is better than Albus Severus!/ ... Arnold would be pretty tame for a name coming from a pet.
