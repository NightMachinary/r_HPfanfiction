Grey character lmao.

He is a evil man that did some good things out of revenge. He never did them because they were the right thing to do.

And grey character is just a lame way to escuse evil shitbags. Any person is capable of doing good and bad things, you dont call Harry a grey character and he used the imperious and cruciatos.
