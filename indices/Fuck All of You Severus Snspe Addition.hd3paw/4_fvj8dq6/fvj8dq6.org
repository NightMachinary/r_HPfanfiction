Oh, we're not going to judge him for the crimes that he committed in the past, eh?

Ok. He bullied a child for six years /just/ because he looked like his father. He bullied another child for six years... just because.

Snape never shows remorse. NOT ONCE. He doesn't show one ounce of guilt for being responsible for Harry being an orphan. He was almost responsible for Neville suffering the same fate as Harry. And he bullies him even more.

Snape wasn't grey. He was a shit person from beginning to end. He was just forced to do the right things because his childhood obsession died by the hands of his master.

Also, the books aren't strictly from Harry's point of view. There are times when we see it from a different perspective. If Snape had done anything useful as a spy, we would've known, even if we only see things from Harry's perspective. Something would've come up. But it never does.
