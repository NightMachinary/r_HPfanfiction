I personally think that Snape is bitter, first of all : he lost everthing he may care about in the past, so clearly he doesn't give a damn if people don't like him now.

In the books, I clearly despised him because he was portrayed as a douchebag who did everything he could to mock and belittle Harry. When we saw his revelation in book 7, I was like 'meh', not really shaken.

But in most of the fics I read, he is much more fun to follow because you see all the idiocy he has to endure from the students
