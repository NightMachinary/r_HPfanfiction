Tired as shit so I'm only gonna say a couple of things. It's fine for you to have an opinion but if you wanna convince people of that opinion use evidence. I saw a grown ass man taking pleasure from picking on a child for 6 years as revenge for actions said child did not commit. He saves Harry, not because we're given any indication of the kind of person he is changing, but ultimately because Lily is his mother. He abuses Harry and then saves him, not for his own merits but for his relation to his parents? Harry only matters to him one way or another because of his parents. Just like the Wizarding World only sees the Boy-Who-Lived, Snape only sees "that Potter brat" or "Lily's son" in the end. That is the sum total of what I see in the character. You're not going to convince me of anything else if the best you can do is talk shit about people who disagree with you.
