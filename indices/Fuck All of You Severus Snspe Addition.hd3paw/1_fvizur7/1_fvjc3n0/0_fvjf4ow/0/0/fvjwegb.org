As a child and even teenager, he was a victim at the mercy of other people. As an adult, he had power to at least try an improve his life or attempt to find love in someone else but he was caught up in his self pity. His actions were wrong yet he still chose them. And he doesn't earn any morality points because he betrayed Voldemort for "Lily's son" and not "Harry." He hadn't changed from the person who only saw Harry for his parents, it was just in this instance that he saw his mother and not his father. It wasn't for Harry it was for Lily, the target of his obsession. It wasn't because he cared about the morality of what he was doing. It wasn't to keep Harry alive, he wanted to keep a small piece of Lily alive.

Basically, what I'm saying is his actions on their own were righteous. The issue is that the motivations behind them keep them from making Snape himself righteous because they were to further his own ends, regardless of whether or not he would live to see those ends. His ends not being Harry succeeding, but instead they were vengeance for Lily and protecting "Lily's son." He was self-serving to the bitter end. It was just that what he wanted also happened to fall in line with what was right.
