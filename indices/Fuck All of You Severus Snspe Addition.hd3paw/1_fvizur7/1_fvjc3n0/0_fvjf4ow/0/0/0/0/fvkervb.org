I'm a simple-minded idiot so the most of that quantum stuff went entirely over my head so I'll just try my best with my limited understanding of what you've said and end off with a few last things. I don't feel it's entirely valid to forgive Snape's action through a cosmic sense of a lack of free will without also doing the same for Voldemort and the rest of the death eaters.

And I personally do feel that free will I fair to judge Snape by, especially when considering that our choices and the motivations that fuel them are the best measure of morality that's available. From the moment he fucked up his friendship with Lily to his death, the bulk of his choices are selfish or outright malicious and the vastly outweigh the few good actions he has to his name, especially since those actions are also selfishly motivated.

I agree that Snape is grey, but only because I believe everyone is a shade of grey. But Snape is a very dark shade. It's like the fact that even Hitler liked dogs. Neither person is without their good points, but their bad points are too numerous and/or significant to place them in the middle of that grey area. At least, that's my best take on it.
