You're making a good argument, so I'm going to fall back to what I consider the final layer: free will. The argument I'm making goes like this: 1. The only layer of randomness in the universe is at the quantum level. 2. Humans can't control the quantum level. 3. Every layer of complexity from atoms up is deterministic. 4. Humans don't control the basic movements of atoms because they result from basic quantum fluctuations. 5. Thus, everything a human does is predetermined, and thus a human has no free will. 6. The only real form of character/morality becomes the likelihood that a human will commit a good act rather than some special soul-like quality. 7. Snap's consistent pattern of both good and bad actions until the point of his inevitable death means that he is morally grey.

To unpack this more clearly, the argument from motivation is a flawed one because he died and knew he would die. The reason that motivation is important is because a flawed motivation creates a propensity for sin farther down the road, but Snape didn't have a road, so I consider this point moot.

Additionally, I would argue that Lily was more of a metaphorical anchor to the light than an object of love. I believe that he used her as an excuse to be where he knew he should be in his heart, and that she was more of a pure symbol of what he was trying to save than a person he obsessed over. There was no mention of Lily from Snape's perspective during any of the first five books. The point I'm making here isn't necessarily that I'm correct, but rather that the interpretation of his motivations is far more subjective than many believe.
