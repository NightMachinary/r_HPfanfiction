The Lily point is definitely an argument. It shows he hasn't genuinely changed from the person he was during the war. He's a bad person and the few good things he did are only good for the world but they don't earn him any morality points because he didn't do those actions becauee he believed in the cause he of the side he was fighting. If Voldy hadn't killed Lily, he'd definitely still be on Voldy side.
