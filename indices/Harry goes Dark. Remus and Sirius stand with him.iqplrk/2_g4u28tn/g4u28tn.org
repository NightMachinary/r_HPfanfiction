[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8195669/1/The-Rise-of-a-Dark-Lord][The Rise of A Dark Lord by Little.Miss.Xanda]]

“Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.”

Harry turns into a dark lord, is partners with Voldemort, has his own mark and uniform, has followers (16 of them, in all houses - and schools), is a Slytherin, Sirius and Remus are shocked but supportive.

WIP, 239k+ words, 22 chapters

THIS IS SLASH AND TOMARRY/HARRYMORT WHICH IS HARRY/TOM OR HARRY/VOLDEMORT, SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE SLASH OR ARE OPPOSED TO THIS PAIRING DON'T READ AS IT IS A BIG PART OF THE STORY

I would recommend one that is gen, or het, as this isn't the slash subreddit, and Tomarry isn't a very well liked ship, but it's the only one I could think of.

THIS IS PROBABLY ABANDONED AS IT WAS LAST UPDATED 2015
