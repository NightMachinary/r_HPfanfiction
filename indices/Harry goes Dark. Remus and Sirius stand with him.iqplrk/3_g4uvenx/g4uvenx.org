I have been OBSESSED with exactly this premise ever since I read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir][The Black Heir]]

Honestly, the way this writer comes up with shizzz to build her worlds is truly friggin amazing. A WIP unfortunately---this is just part 1 (part 2 is called Vindico Atrum)---but you will spend daaaaays and weeks probably working through it. I have to add: it's Harry/Voldemort and I do believe there's some underage in it. I had a really hard time believing Harry's age with the way he is written as a character, and I say this in view of how mature and adult like he is and the slash relationships, so I wasn't too eeked out about reading it.

The world is amazing and Harry is super charged as heck. Which I highly enjoy. Remus and Sirius are supportive as Harry discovers what Dark Magic is and what this means for magic in general (and politics) and convinces them, even though they don't morally support what he and Voldemort do at times, but they still listen and understand. Harry is extremely powerful and wants to fight to bring the Dark back into the light. Amazing magic and theories. And it becomes so GD plotty, I legit blasted through both parts in days (871k and 722k words).
