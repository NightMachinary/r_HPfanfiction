Ooh, and perhaps the Baron has refused, finding it amusing when Nick is left out of the headless hunt, which has fueled the house rivalry for a few centuries.

It would be interesting if they can interact like that, there could be epic ghost battles happening where living things are just getting on with their lives, able to see it all without it touching them at all, though I'm inclined to say that they could only do magic to each other, like a ghost potion could work because it is magic which makes it do the thing and they still exist as magical beings, but a sword has a physical effect so it wouldn't work since they don't exist as physical beings. So magical coma and magical solution yes, something which would be a physical cause and effect no... I think that's where I stand on this
