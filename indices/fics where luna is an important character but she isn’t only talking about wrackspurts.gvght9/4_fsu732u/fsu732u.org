Several of Bobmin's stories use Luna: linkffn(8837257), linkffn(7390178), [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] and its sequel, [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise over Britain]] (login possibly needed for the previous two).
