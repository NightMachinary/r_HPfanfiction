There's another story that I'm having trouble finding (obviously using poor search terms) where Harry finds out that all of the creatures that Luna talks about are real just in a parallel dimension/reality attached to ours which Luna is able to see into. Harry/Hermione (eg don't remember who) charm glasses that allow others to see this reality and Luna's creatures.
