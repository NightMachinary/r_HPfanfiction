I have no story on my computer with a title (full or partial) containing the words "Prince of Slytherin" so I'm pretty sure that the story you're referencing is not the one I read (my normal method is just to download any story I'm interested in and read it at my leisure versus chapter by chapter on line. And a story would have to be absolutely putrid for me to delete it).

Which story are you referring to? The one by The Sinister Man or the one by Lord Cartwright
