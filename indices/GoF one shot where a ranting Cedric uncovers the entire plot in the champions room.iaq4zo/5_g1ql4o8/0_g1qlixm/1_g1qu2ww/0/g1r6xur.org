This sort of post is usually downvoted to place it at the bottom of the thread, so any relevant post would get seen before the RemindMeBot spam - the bot-spam doesn't really contribute to the discussion after all.

Tbh it /kinda/ bugs me that it's at +2 now because new posts, including maybe the correct fic, will appear below it.
