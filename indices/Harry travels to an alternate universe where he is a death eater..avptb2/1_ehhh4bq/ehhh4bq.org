The closest I know is linkffn(Imprisioned Realm) where he DT during the Horcrux hunt and ends up in a world where Voldemort never died, neither did his parents, so the other Harry had like 3 siblings. He's also Voldemort's right hand, or close to. Fantastic fic overall, full of twists and angst and plain awesome world building. Not for the faint of heart though.
