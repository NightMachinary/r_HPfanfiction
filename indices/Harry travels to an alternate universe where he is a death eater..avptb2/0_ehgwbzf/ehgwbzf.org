I know that harry universe hops into a universe where he is a death eater in linkffn(*A Stranger in an Unholy Land)* but I don't think his sister is the GWL, although he does have a sister (I think) and his parents are alive. Also he wasn't dead in that one.

Actually, based on my google-fu, it's more likely to be this one based on the description: linkffn(*Serpents and Sorcerers* by Midgards Ormen)
