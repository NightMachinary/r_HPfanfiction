No. A potion is still magic. It's a spell in a physical form. Polyjuice is basically human transfiguration, something I imagine Dumbledore doesn't need a potion for. A potion is mixing a bunch of strange stuff together, I think the magic in the potion is a spell cast by maker and the spellcasting is the process of brewing. Similarly, I don't think a squib could summon a broom with the 'up' command.
