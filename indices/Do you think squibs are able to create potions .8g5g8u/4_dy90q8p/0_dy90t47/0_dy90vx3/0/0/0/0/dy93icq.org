book 1 snape "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic."

implying that there is wand waving in potions, just not much.

i mean it's not hard proof like seeing someone wave a wand over a potion or seeing it as an explicit direction, but it is more solid proof than choosing to disregard pottemore as canon just because they don't fit your narrative of canon.

We also see them use wands in potions during half-blood prince, in the process of creating antidotes to poisons, it is never said explicitly, only implied that the wand usage is to reveal the composition of the poisons.
