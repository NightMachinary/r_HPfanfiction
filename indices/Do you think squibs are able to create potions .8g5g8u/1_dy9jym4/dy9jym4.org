Technically, the answer is a straight-out “no”, because Pottermore says that there's wand-work necessary.

That said, the books themself do not do a good job at showing the above to be true: Snape claims that there's “little wand waving”, which could be and up to a certain point is, via lack of proof of the opposite, shown to mean no wand waving at all, and the one time we do see them using their wands there is the implication that this is done to find out what ingredients are needed rather than because it is a necessary action to creating a potion. Madame Rowling has had a lot of time to do /something/ about it, and yet only chose to go clear about it via Pottermore, so I will not blame anyone for choosing to think differently (i.e. that squibs can brew potions) nor will it be something that breaks the story or whatever.

That said, even if one does ignore the Pottermore thing, clearly magic is required to change what would basically be a nonsense soup into a potion. For potions that use clearly magical ingredients it could, at least to a degree (decreased potency?), come from those ingredients as catalysts, but potions the ingredients for which just aren't magically potent enough for their needs would need quite a substantial insertions of the brewer's magic, and those potions squibs just wouldn't be able to brew, not on their own.

The squibs' ability to see magical buildings and dementors and stuff most likely comes from the fact that having magic changes how one's senses develop, and until a certain time after their birth, time that may even be years after that points, squibs do have some magic, the left-over magic of their parents, so though they are on the level of muggles when it comes to the ability to have magic there are still changes in their development stemming from having magical parents. The fact that the changed (wizardly/witchy/whatever) development does not complete but instead stops at some point when the squib's parents' magic evaporates from them fully may be the reason why Figg could not see the dementors fully but only vaguely.
