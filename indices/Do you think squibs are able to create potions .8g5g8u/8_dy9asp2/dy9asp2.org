Also to levitate, carry, and summon are 3 different generalized spells with 3 different purposes and functions.

There is a spell to levitate anything the caster intends to levitate, not individual specific spells to levitate specific objects.

You cast the levitate spells at a table in which sits a feather, a book, paper, and an ink bottle, and you can through the power of intent levitate just the paper. Or just the book, or the table with all the stuff on it. That is how intent factors into spells...
