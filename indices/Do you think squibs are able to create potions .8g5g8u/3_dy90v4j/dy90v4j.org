In my headcanon they're complete muggles who just happen to be born of wizards. Anything a muggle can't do, a squib can't either. Ms. Figg was lying about the dementors to help Harry out (her description was very shaky and she was anxious and unsure about it) and Filch would need someone to bring him inside Hogwarts before he could see it.

But I forget if Pottermore actually wrote anything that contradicts that.

Edit: or Filch could just know that despite the fact that he sees a pile of ruins and a sign telling him to keep out, he just needs to push past that and keep walking until he's inside, then those "ruins" become Hogwarts to his sight. He might not need a wizard to bring him in. Or he might have an amulet or other spell on him to let him see Hogwarts.
