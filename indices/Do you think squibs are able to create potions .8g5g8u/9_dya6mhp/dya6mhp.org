For stories I write, my default is that squibs can interact with magic items in a variety of ways. There will be some potions they can't brew on their own due to required spellwork, but they can do at least two thirds of the curriculum up to OWL level. (And almost nothing after that due to the requirement to incorporate spells.)

In theory, you could have a potions manufactory in which the majority of the work is done by squibs, with a handful of full mages to do the necessary wand-work.

If I'm going to go into more depth about the process, I'd have it so you can use enchanting to get around the spell requirements, and you can use slow and resource-intensive means to enchant things as a squib. So if there were an island with a curse on it that ensured everyone would be a squib, you'd get a more industrialized and less personally effective magical society.

Other people write it differently, and that's fine. Saying that squibs are basically muggles from magical families simplifies the world, which makes it easier not to write yourself into something silly.
