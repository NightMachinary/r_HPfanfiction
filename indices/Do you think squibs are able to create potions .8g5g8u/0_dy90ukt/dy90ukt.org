It is possible, but the most realistic answer is probably, no not really. Let me grab my laptop, get off mobile, and I'll expand on what I mean.

Edit: Have laptop.

Even Rowling is vague on the abilities of squibs to perceive and interact meaningfully with the magical world. It is however important to remember that for all of their similarities magic itself sees Squibs and Muggles differently. For evidence of this i point you simply to the fact that Filch is even able to work at hogwarts, when in GoF we are told that muggles would just see ruins and a sign telling them to keep out. You could make the argument that this is a special exception for Filch, however pottermore has more examples of squibs at hogwarts. Rowling even telling a tale of one sneaking in in an attempt to be sorted.

So what does this mean for us and potions?

Well if we look to pottermore ( [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/potions]] ) the answer does not look good.

Rowling says "It is often asked whether a Muggle could create a magic potion, given a Potions book and the right ingredients. The answer, unfortunately, is no. There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion (merely adding dead flies and asphodel to a pot hanging over a fire will give you nothing but nasty-tasting, not to mention poisonous, soup)."

So just looking at that specifically the aspect of wand work being needed, we can see that it would not be possible for a squib to make a potion, as they can not use a wand, as we learn definitively from Filch's failure with KwickSpell in chamber of secrets.

That being said I believe there to be a passable work around for this. We know from apparent differences between muggles and squibs in the canon, that squibs can to a degree interact more meaningfully with those things that are magical than muggles can. So i think you could make a compelling case that if a squib were educated in the art and interactions of potions ingredients, and there was a wizarding overseer around to do the wand waving needed, that a squib could complete a potion with help. A muggle likewise could do the same, if not for the statue of secrecy breaking that would be involved.

So if you want to work it into your story you could have an enterprising muggleborn student who was good at potions, but could not find someone to help him achieve his mastery or whatever, but instead finds a bunch of squibs teaches them to make lots of the basic potions, does the wand waving in his potion warehouse and bada-bing bada-boom muggleborn/squib potion factory.
