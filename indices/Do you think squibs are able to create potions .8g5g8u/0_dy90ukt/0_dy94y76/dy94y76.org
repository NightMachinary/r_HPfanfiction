  So if you want to work it into your story you could have an enterprising muggleborn student who was good at potions, but could not find someone to help him achieve his mastery or whatever, but instead finds a bunch of squibs teaches them to make lots of the basic potions, does the wand waving in his potion warehouse and bada-bing bada-boom muggleborn/squib potion factory.

Ha! What a cool idea! This could go into Harry's "weird case files"--that time I had to bust a Squib potions ring.
