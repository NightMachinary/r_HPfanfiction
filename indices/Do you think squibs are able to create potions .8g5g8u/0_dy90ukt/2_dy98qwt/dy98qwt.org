  For evidence of this i point you simply to the fact that Filch is even able to work at hogwarts, when in GoF we are told that muggles would just see ruins and a sign telling them to keep out. You could make the argument that this is a special exception for Filch, however pottermore has more examples of squibs at hogwarts. Rowling even telling a tale of one sneaking in in an attempt to be sorted.

We know magic works through intent, though. Meaning if the spell casted to keep muggles out was intended to keep muggles out, but not squibs, it won't keep squibs out.\\
The thing is, you don't need magic to discriminate between Muggles and Squibs, you only need Wizards to do the distinction.
