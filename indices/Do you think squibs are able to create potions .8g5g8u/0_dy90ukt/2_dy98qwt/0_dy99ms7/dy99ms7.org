We don't actually know that magic works though intent. We know that some aspects of magic and spells are influenced by the intent of the caster.

Conversely we do know that magic has laws and underlying universal rules that outline and define its limitations and interactions with the world.

For instance. You want to conjure a chair. There is a spell for that, the intention of the caster may influence the type of chair, or size, etc... but at the end of the day it's still a chair.

You're also not going to get a chair if you cast the levitation charm.

So even so assume intent matters, if you want to keep muggles out, your intent is going to be to keep out people without magic (because that's literally the only difference between muggles and wizards) and since squibs don't have magic, bingo bango squibs would be kept out too.

But that doesn't happen when you cast a muggle repelling ward/spell so there has to be some measurable or meaningful difference between squibs and muggles.

Edit: if you only need wizards to make the distinction with intent in those sorts of spells, why not just cast a ward to keep death eaters out of hogwarts or wherever really? Why not cast a spell that doesn't let people who have murdered someone in cold blood pass through a door, and use that as a way to test guilt?
