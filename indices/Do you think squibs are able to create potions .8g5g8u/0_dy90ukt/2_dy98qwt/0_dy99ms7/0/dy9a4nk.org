No. Your intent is to keep Muggles out. Intent has to do with language. If you want to keep Muggles out, you're gonna use a spell that keeps Muggles out. Because Muggles are a valid category. Magic knows perfectly well what you would consider a Muggle. I imagine you could use the same spell or a similar one to keep out blue eyes people. In this cas you'll cast a spell to keep out blue eyed people, not people who lack melanin in their eyes. That's because magic doesn't work like physics. It's both very literal and very symbolic, as is obvious from the books. Hell, the spell to levitate something is different from the spell to carry something, which is in turn different from the spell to summon something. All 3 of these spells do basically the same thing. The only difference is in the purpose aka intent of the spell.

Also. There isn't a single insight, that I remember of, in the way conjuring works in canon. So I'd like to hear your rational about that chair thing.
