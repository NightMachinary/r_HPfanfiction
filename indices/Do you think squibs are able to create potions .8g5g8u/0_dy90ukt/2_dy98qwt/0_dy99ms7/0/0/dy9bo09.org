I think you just kind of argued against yourself at the end. The only difference in those three spells isn't that the intent is different - it's that the spell is different. To go along with your argument, you should say casting a spell to levitate something but with the intent to summon it to you would summon it to you.

But you didn't. And you can't. Because the spells are different for a reason.
