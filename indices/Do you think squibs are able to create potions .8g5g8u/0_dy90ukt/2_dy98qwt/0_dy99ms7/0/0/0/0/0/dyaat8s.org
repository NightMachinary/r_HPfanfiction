Interesting. Thanks for the quote from Adam's, I didn't know it. I like it.

Something else to keep in mind, too, is that a spell which encodes your intent somehow, as a part of magic's operation, or a spell that reads your mind to know what to do basically achieve the same thing (if we put aside flavor or esthetic concerns about how magic should feel) with one difference. It's more complicated, it requires more magic to work. In the first case magic just needs to do is effect, in the latter it still needs this but also to read the caster's mind as well. It's amusing because it reminds me of Ocam's razor (between two hypothesis you should choose the simplest) though it totally doesn't apply in this case.
