That's because you don't understand my point. If magic didn't work through intent, it means every spell has a very definite effect that doesn't rely on intent. Which means the spell to levitate something, the spell to summon something and the spell to carry something will be one and the same. It will be a spell that can move things around. The single fact that summoning, carrying and moving things around are seen as different by magic means that, fundamentally, a spell is the traduction of an intent in an action. It is obvious that the difference between those 3 spells is in the intent they traduce far more than in what they physically do. It is different, for exemple, in the Wheel of Time, where magic is achieved by the 'physical' manipulation of magic, and the effect comes from the way different threads of energy are weaved around each other. Can you see the distinction? The important thing isn't whether or not you can modify your spells through intent, but that the spells themselves are a direct traduction of the intent of the caster.
