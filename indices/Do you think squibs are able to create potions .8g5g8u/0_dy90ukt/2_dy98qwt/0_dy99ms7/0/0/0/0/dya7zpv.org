  Which means the spell to levitate something, the spell to summon something and the spell to carry something will be one and the same.

Not necessarily. If spells don't work on intent, they are essentially machines. You could design one to move a thing away from Earth (but not from side to side), another to hold something to a fixed location relative to you, and a third to move something toward you. These are just limitations on either geometric translation or application of force.

You could even create a conjuration spell with a mind-reading component that could conjure a chair of the type the caster is thinking of. (Similar to how you can build a hands-free web browser with eye tracking and an electroencephalograph.) But that would be an explicit part of the spell, something you specifically added, rather than a general aspect of magic.

It's hard to tell the difference between a world where magic itself responds to intent and one in which nearly every spell includes a mind-reading component. The former requires one of the basic parts of magic to be a certain way; the latter merely requires a bit of technology and a widespread desire for convenience. But I'm reminded of the Douglas Adams quote: /the impossible often has a kind of integrity which the merely improbable lacks./ Magic responding to intent has that kind of integrity; witches always writing their spells to read their own minds doesn't.
