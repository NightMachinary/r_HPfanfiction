Hmm...tough assignment. I can't say I've ever read a fic where Draco plays with his apple. Here's my suggestion.

- [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxreplace/][Get this Firefox add-on]]. Don't have Firefox? To bad.
- Next, have "Apple" replace any instances of "Harry" in the substitution list.
- Open up any trashy Drarry fic and turn that Suspension-of-Disbelief all the way up
