The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.

  Ginny sighed and slumped back in her seat. “You're letting him win. He's winning the breakup!”

  “Everything you're saying is ridiculous! You can't win a breakup.”

  “Obviously you can, and Ron is doing it!”

  “You're being childish. Not everything is about winning and losing.”

  Ginny frowned at Hermione's nonchalance. --Ron and Hermione have recently broken up, and Ginny --- concerned for her best friend --- has decided that the only thing for Hermione to do now is to date someone new to make Ron jealous. And who better than Hermione's best friend (and coincidentally Ron's younger sister) to drive him absolutely mental?Fake Dating AU

  Everything changed in the blink of an eye. Harry Potter was dead and the war was lost. The remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix go into hiding and Voldemort's rise to power is complete. In a twist of fate, Hermione finds a Time Turner and makes plans to fix the mistakes of the past. Little does she know, she's not the only one making the time jump.
