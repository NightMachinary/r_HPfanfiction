It's very possible, but I see the American spelling way too often, even when they use British slang or terms. If you've written colour as "color" for your whole life, you tend to automatically write it that way. They will also use the American metric system, too, which is simply because they are familiar with it.

That's why I said that it was most likely a Canadian, especially since Canadians use UK English naturally compared to Americans, who don't.
