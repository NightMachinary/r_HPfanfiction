Just fyi, if someone is using UK English but are not from the UK or Australia, they are most likely Canadian. We still include "u"s in many words, like colour and favourite, and we also tend to write with "s" instead of "z" for words like analyse. Canadians do have similar phrases like Americans, given that our media is intertwined, but we do tend to use UK English as opposed to American English for spelling. So, if you see an author using North American slang/terms, but UK English, it's most likely us maple syrup loving, moose riding, igloo building, and hockey playing Canadians.

As for your question, I can always point out an American the second I see "huh" or terms that even us Canadians consider American. That, or a horribly misplaced "eh". British authors stick out, too, because their terms and spelling remind me very much of JK's without sounding forced or awkward. It flows naturally.

Non-native English speakers do sometimes stick out, primarily on grammar and verb issues. Simple mistakes that I see my francophone friends make whenever they speak/write in English. It's quite cute, actually, and I always applaud their effort, because it's not always easy.

I believe that's it...
