Absolutely.

Each country uses different lingo, and a lot of that seeps through into their writing.

I'm Australian too, and I will always notice when someone is American if they use American terms. There was one fanfic that I read a while ago where Hermione put a /diaper/ on her baby then placed the baby in the /crib/.

They also spell words differently, like colo*u*r and color. The British version is the former, which is what I'm familiar with, but Americans will always drop the /u/.

I won't usually notice differences between Australian and British writers because like I alluded to, we spell things the same way and use the same terms. I think that the /only/ time I picked it up was when Harry spread /Vegemite/ on his toast, as opposed to /Marmite/.
