Snape is Voldemort's right hand. I think we can all agree on this. The Carrows are quite far down the pecking tree compared to Snape - Voldemort has been known to acquiesce to Snape's requests in the past as well.

Snape is also the Headmaster of Hogwarts when the Cruciatus Curse became an acceptable/preferred form of punishment.

Make of that what you will.

  I can't recall a single scene where Draco displays overt bigotry or uses slurs in front of Snape that he then ignores.

Only one that I can think of is when he yells out, "You'll be next, Mudbloods!" in front of a large crowd of students, but Snape hasn't arrived there at that time. But then, Albus and Minerva also don't do anything about it then (or later) so it's basically everyone giving their go-ahead to Draco.
