Snape begs Voldemort to spare Lily, and Voldemort does give her two chances to step aside. Considering the fact that Lily's son is prophesised to kill him, that she's a muggleborn, and that this is Voldemort we're talking about, him giving her a couple of chances is sort of the equivalent of Voldemort being merciful.

He also doesn't kill Snape on the spot for attempting to thwart his attempt on the Stone and for being late to the reunion of the Death Eaters in book 5 when Snape does show up. Karkaroff does not get any such favour from Voldemort - as soon as he reaches Karkaroff's spot in the circle, he announces that Igor must die.
