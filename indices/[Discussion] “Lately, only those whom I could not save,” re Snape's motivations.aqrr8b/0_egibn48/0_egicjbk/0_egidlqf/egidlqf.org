You can't take orders from an animated painting, no more how hard you try.

  none of the other staff do anything either- they can overpower snape, or use their combined magical ability to come up with some solution to prevent the torture of students, but don't.

And bring Voldemort's wrath on themselves and the school full of students, of course. They should definitely be doing that.

Let's be real here, Snape can tell the Carrows to back down and they would do it thanks to Snape's elevated stature with Voldemort. Snape might not be the one who's using the curse himself, but he definitely has the power to stop it from happening, and he doesn't. The other teachers have no such power.
