  Snape is also the Headmaster of Hogwarts when the Cruciatus Curse became an acceptable/preferred form of punishment.

snape is also directly taking orders from dumbledore then, as well as conversing with the other headmasters. none of the other staff do anything either- they can overpower snape, or use their combined magical ability to come up with some solution to prevent the torture of students, but don't.

we see snape agreeing to protect the students, and we know he directly gave light 'punishments' e.g. sending them with hagrid

tbh, i think jkr used DH as an opportunity to let neville shine, as she does several times throughout the series where having effective adults would take away from teenagers

we /see/ snape stopping harry from being cruciated in hbp. i don't see any coherent, IC reason snape would allow students to be cruciated unless the plot made it a necessity
