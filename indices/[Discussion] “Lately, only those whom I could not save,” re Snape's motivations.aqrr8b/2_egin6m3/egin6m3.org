I hope this isn't considered off-topic, but considering how there's like 2.5 anti-Snape threads in the top 4 posts of this subreddit at the time of my typing, and I assume this is a pro-Snape one in response to those; I'm going to post a thought or two about him.

I'm going to start off by saying if people dislike him because of his actions, then of course that's fine. People hate assholes and Snape is a massive one, though for me personally I find him amusing because of his antics. The thing I don't get is why people try and throw modern buzzwords at him when pretty much none of them apply.

Incel - This seems to be a favorite one these days. Snape shows zero signs of hating women or attractive men in general. He hates a lot of people, but not because of those traits.

Stalker - I've seen him called this a few times, but once again don't think it applies. After Lily severed all ties at the end of 5th year there's zero mention of Snape ever following her or harassing her after his first attempt at reconciling. Snape wasn't following her around the corridors, or looking through her window after she married James. They went their separate paths, with Lily going one way and Snape going his darker way.

Friendzoned - This one has been used a couple of times. This term is usually used when a woman rejects a man's romantic advances. Nobody ever owes anyone else anything. I don't like this term because it puts undeserved blame on women. I'm including it here because Snape never blames Lily for their falling out. Though it's never stated I believe that the bulk of the reason that he hates himself is because he knows he's the one responsible for the end of their friendship and her death. He blames himself and not Lily.

Creepy - Snape is very, very mean, but I don't think he's that creepy. The creepiest thing he's done is rip a picture and keep the part that had Lily with him. The other part where he rips the part of the letter with Lily's love is something that people do when they lose a loved one. I have family members who keep personal items like that of deceased ones. I also don't buy into the belief that he tried to spare Lily so he could try and get with her after her husband and son died. Snape's biggest priority was to get her to live. Voldemort doesn't really understand the concept of love, so his rationale for Snape asking to spare her is because of desire (lust). That doesn't make it true.

The point of this post isn't to try and convince people not to dislike Snape, but to just stop using these words to describe him. I don't mean to be rude, but when people use these words for Snape it seems cheap and as if they can't form an actual argument. There are plenty of valid arguments to dislike him out there.
