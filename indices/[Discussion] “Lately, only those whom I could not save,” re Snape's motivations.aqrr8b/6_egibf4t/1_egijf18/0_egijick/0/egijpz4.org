Yup. The main issue people have with his redemption Imo is that it was selfish reasoning. Snape is a vindictive asshole but he did have a redemption. What I think people also forget is that he joined the death eaters when he would have been under 20 and that's not something I'd imagine you can leave easily. I'd probably be a moody angry person too if I was forced to do something I didn't want for over a decade. Doubly so since it seems to me that snape is a potions prodigy/perfectionist who can't understand why other people aren't as good as him. The bullying, yeah it's dickish and wrong.
