“Selfish Reasoning” not that he was selfish. I always saw it as snape wanted lily to be safe, he didn't really care about everyone else. That's when snape goes to dumbledore I believe. No sooner. The other characters did what they did because it was right or they didn't want others treated like that or whatever. Snapes reasoning seemed more personal to me if that makes sense.
