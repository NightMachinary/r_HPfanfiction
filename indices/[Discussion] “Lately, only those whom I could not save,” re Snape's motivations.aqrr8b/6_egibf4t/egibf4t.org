Returning to lay out some of my feelings about Snape:

Snape was childish, a bully, petty, all these awful things.. but he wasn't an entirely bad person. Snape also spent a large part of his life lying to everyone around him in an attempt to atone for his past sins, and tried to save everyone he could, but that doesn't make him an entirely good person either. Too many times, I see people talking about how they never agreed with Snape's supposed "redemption" and still dislike him as a character, and I'm like, what?? He's not /redeemed/. He's fleshed out. He has a story +which actually might be what redeemed means but whatever+. My point is that it's not supposed to make you like him, it's supposed to show you that there are incredibly complex characters out there and not everything is black and white, a reminder HP sorely needed at the time. You can have a character that remorselessly bullies young children, and that doesn't make them rotten to the core, and it doesn't mean they aren't capable of being a Good Person^{TM} sometimes.

I agree with your thoughts on revenge too. What could Snape possibly want revenge /for/? I definitely don't see it being a source of motivation for him.

Also, that scene with Hermione's teeth is waaay overcited and I'm sick of people using that as the end all, be all of any discussions regarding Snape, ugh.
