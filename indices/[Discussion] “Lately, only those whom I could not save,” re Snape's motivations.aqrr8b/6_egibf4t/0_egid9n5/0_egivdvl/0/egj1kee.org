Nah, use it. Pretty solid evidence about Snape being a bully. I'm just tired of it being used as a "so, there!" arguement -- as if you're automatically an equally awful person if you don't think Snape is 100% awful after that scene. Yeah, he is awful, but he's other things too.

This entire thread has people angrily saying that OP is ignoring all his bad faults and "cherry-picking" what's good about it. Not denying that either, but those same people are doing the same exact thing with what's bad about it. Hate him all you want, but don't act like it's unreasonable for people to see good in him, too. Snape ain't all good or all evil.

If you're using it to prove Snape is a bully, Snape is petty, Snape is abusing his position of power to psychologically damage those weaker than him, then by all means, go ahead. But please stop using it in unrelated arguements, like his stance on blood purity and its associated slurs, for example.
