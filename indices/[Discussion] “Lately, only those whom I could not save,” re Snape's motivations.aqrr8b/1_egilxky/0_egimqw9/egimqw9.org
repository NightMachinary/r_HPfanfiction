i always thought your opinions on snape were disappointing, since you seem decently logical in analysing other areas of hp canon

#+begin_quote
  Snape's motivation is entirely unchanged since 1981
#+end_quote

no, snape's love for lily remains unchanged since 1981, but how he expresses that love and the dynamics of the love itself have

#+begin_quote
  when he would happily see the husband and child of the woman he supposedly loves die so that he could have her for himself.
#+end_quote

nothing in canon suggests this. he was committed to saving her life, and indifferent to the deaths of harry and james. that's different to actively wishing them dead, and nothing suggests it was done so he could 'have' her. he turned himself in to dumbledore and said he'd do 'anything' to keep her safe. can't have her if he's in azkaban, or dead

#+begin_quote
  You cannot love a woman and simultaneously want her child to die
#+end_quote

he doesn't want harry to die

#+begin_quote
  He still does not care one iota for Harry
#+end_quote

he doesn't care about him personally, true

#+begin_quote
  Nor does he care about what is right.
#+end_quote

you have no evidence of this

#+begin_quote
  If he was genuinely carrying out Lily's wishes he wouldn't treat Harry like shit.
#+end_quote

you can care about and act on behalf of someone's wishes without caring about or acting on /all/ of them. it isn't all or nothing. had she been alive, she'd have wanted voldemort gone. that's what's he's working towards

#+begin_quote
  So he's taking actions on behalf of a dead person, but not in that dead person's interests, but rather to satisfy his own obsession. Since he's acting on behalf of someone who was killed against their killer, yet not in the dead person's interests, nor in the interests of justice itself, "revenge" seems to be the only suitable classification.
#+end_quote

this...doesn't make any sense. you don't establish motivations by process of elimination, you establish them with evidence. he shows no desire for revenge

#+begin_quote
  “Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?”

  “Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape
