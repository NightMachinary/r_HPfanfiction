ah.

i think snape is motivated, primarily, by a desire for atonement, which he seeks to actualise by opposing voldemort and protecting harry, and risking his life to, or just the act of, saving others

i do think his actions are self interested in the sense that they're mostly about the type of person he wants to be i.e. snape does things he thinks are good because he wants to be someone who does good things. there's something almost catholic about his behaviour
