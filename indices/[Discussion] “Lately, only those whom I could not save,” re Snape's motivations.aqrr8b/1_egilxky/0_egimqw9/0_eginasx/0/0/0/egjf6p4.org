...i know how the conversation went. i said in the thread that his love for lily is unchanged. i never said he cares for harry. he doesn't. he dislikes him severely

this is what taure said, and what i responded to

#+begin_quote
  There is no basis for saying this. Snape's statement "always" was in direct response to Dumbledore questioning his motivation ("Surely you have not come to care for the boy?").
#+end_quote

snape doesn't love harry, he loves lily

#+begin_quote
  Harry is tangential at best to Snape's motivations, and that only because he is Lily's son.
#+end_quote

'protecting harry' is a significant part of his motivations. 'lily's son' is an intrinsic part of who harry is
