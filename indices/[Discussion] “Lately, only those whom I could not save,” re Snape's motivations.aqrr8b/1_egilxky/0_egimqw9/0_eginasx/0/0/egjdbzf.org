  no? his 'always' was in direct response to dumbledore questioning snape's feelings on harry
#+end_quote

Noooo, his "Always" was a response to Dumbledore questioning his continuing love of */LILY/*. Allow me to remind you how that conversation went:

Dumbledore asks, in his Dumbledore way, if Snape perhaps might have come to care for "the boy" - being Harry.

Snape's response: *"For /HIM/? EXPECTO PATRONUM!"*

And out comes the dove, following which is the oft-quoted "Always" exchange.

Snape's line is pertinent here, because if you take the entire exchange into account rather than just the end of it, it makes it perfectly clear that the reason Snape turned spy, the reason he did everything he did is */for LILY'S sake/*. Harry is tangential at best to Snape's motivations, and that only because he is Lily's son.
