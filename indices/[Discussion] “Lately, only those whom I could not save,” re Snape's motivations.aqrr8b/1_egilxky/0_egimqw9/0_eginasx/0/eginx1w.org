  Snape's statement "always" was in direct response to Dumbledore questioning his motivation
#+end_quote

no? his 'always' was in direct response to dumbledore questioning snape's /feelings/ on harry

  If his actions are for Lily, then that means he is not doing things because he considers them right, nor out of genuine concern for the people he is protecting.

  This leads to the classification of revenge not out of "elimination" but by meeting the definition of revenge: following a person's death, he is seeking the downfall of that person's killer for reasons other than justice. That is pretty much the definition of revenge.
