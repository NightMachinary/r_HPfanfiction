You're hanging onto that "only those whom I could not save" quote closely, but it doesn't chime with his actions. In HBP Snape arranges for the death of Emmeline Vance, an Order member, to cement his position as a spy. He could have saved her easily - he simply had to choose not to be the cause of her death. But he actively causes to her death in order to advance the war against Voldemort. It's simply untrue that he considers saving lives more important than defeating Voldemort.

As for the rest, it more or less all hinges on this point:

  no, snape's love for lily remains unchanged since 1981, but how he expresses that love and the dynamics of the love itself have

There is no basis for saying this. Snape's statement "always" was in direct response to Dumbledore questioning his motivation ("Surely you have not come to care for the boy?"). He is saying that his motivation remains his loyalty to Lily. If his actions are for Lily, then that means he is *not* doing things because he considers them right, nor out of genuine concern for the people he is protecting. Indeed, the context of the statement is to rebut the idea that he is protecting Harry because he thinks Harry merits protection in his own right.

Once you have established that his sole motivation is Lily, this leads to the above analysis of his relationship with a dead woman being completely unaltruistic in nature. This leads to the classification of revenge not out of "elimination" but by meeting the definition of revenge: following a person's death, he is seeking the downfall of that person's killer for reasons other than justice. That is pretty much the definition of revenge.

Requiring the books to explicitly state that Snape's motivation is revenge is not how literature works.
