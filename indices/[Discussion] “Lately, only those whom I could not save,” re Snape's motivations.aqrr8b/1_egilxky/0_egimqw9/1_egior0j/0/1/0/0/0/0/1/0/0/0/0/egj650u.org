...you read the rest of the books. snape often criticises and berates the students he encounters. he'd have to hear over the sound of his own voice, and their responses. and there's still the sound of the cauldrons, materials, etc. the students are silent, nothing suggests it's deathly silent

it even specifies that draco speaks 'loudly' when he was addressing snape. nothing suggests he heard him

my post was an /example/ of how these discussions go. omg. i don't think anyone actually claims he bullies students because of colours
