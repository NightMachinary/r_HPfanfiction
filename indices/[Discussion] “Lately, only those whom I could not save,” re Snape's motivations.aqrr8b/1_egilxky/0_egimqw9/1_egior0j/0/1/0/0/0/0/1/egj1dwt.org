no, it's an explanation of his behaviour.

i think snape haters react to every instance of snape being cruel as if it's some sort of gotcha!, as if it it invalidates anything else about the character, and react to disagreeing with any instance of snape hate and criticism as if it's a defense of approval of his actions

here's how these discussions go:

[snape hater]: snape MURDERED puppies and bullied kids because he hates the colour blue

me: snape never murdered a single puppy, and he bullied kids because he hates the colour purple

[snape hater]: so that makes it okay?!!
