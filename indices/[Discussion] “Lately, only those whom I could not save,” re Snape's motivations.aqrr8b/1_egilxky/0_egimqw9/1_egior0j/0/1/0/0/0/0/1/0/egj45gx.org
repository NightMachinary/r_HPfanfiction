[[/u/AskMeAboutKtizo]] is right - you're really having to work hard to pull anything good out about Snape. Your last post is nothing but a strawman argument.

This is a man who humiliated a child in his first week at a new school by asking questions he could never hope to answer. Who later humiliated a young girl who'd been assaulted by a classmate (Malfoy's teeth-growing curse on Hermione). Who ignored the use of slurs when used in his classroom (chapter 15, CoS - Malfoy used the term "mudblood" in an audible tone of voice - there's the proof you apparently asked for).

I could go on.

If you want to defend that kind of a man, go for it. But you'll always be in a tiny minority.
