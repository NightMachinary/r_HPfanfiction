You're seriously suggesting he can't hear the ONE other person talking in a room? You really are clutching at straws. Especially as the text says "Malfoy went on", not "Malfoy went on in a quieter tone of voice".

And you're doing it again. It's the form of your argument that's the strawman, not the specific.

And I'm done with you now. There's no point arguing with someone who won't listen.
