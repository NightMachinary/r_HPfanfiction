And that's ok??? You are completely white-washing his actions over a few cherry picked quotes. Want me to cherry pick some stuff too? He's a kids boggart. As a teacher. He literally made fun of a teenage girls teeth after she got them hexed resulting in tears. The only motivation he ever truly showed for changing sides was that he wanted to save Lily. Just her, not her son, not James, just her. He 'protects' Harry just for Lily's memory all while bullying him and allowing people like Malfoy to be a bully as well. He's childish and cruel and you're overlooking so many horrible things he's done.
