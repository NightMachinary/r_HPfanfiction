After all this time?

Always.

That is: Snape's motivation is entirely unchanged since 1981, when he would happily see the husband and child of the woman he supposedly loves die so that he could have her for himself.

He still does not care one iota for Harry. Nor does he care about what is right. He does good things not because they are good, but because he has a twisted obsession with a dead woman. JKR calls it love because she has some weird ideas about love, but the reader can make up their own mind as to the moral worth of Snape's actions. You cannot love a woman and simultaneously want her child to die. That isn't love, it's a dangerous, stalker-ish obsession. The books even foreshadow this, with Slughorn in HBP warning the class about the dangers of obsessive love.

So Snape's actions are entirely motivated by his obsession with Lily. We should be clear that he doesn't really represent what her interests would have been, had she been alive. His motivation is not "What would Lily want?" If he was genuinely carrying out Lily's wishes he wouldn't treat Harry like shit. Even though he considers himself to be acting out of love, in fact his actions continue to reflect his self-interest. That is consistent with a stalker-like obsession.

So he's acting on behalf of someone who was killed /against their killer/, yet not in the dead person's interests, nor in the interests of justice itself. "Revenge" seems to be the only suitable classification.

This was how things were left at the end of DH. JKR has tried to rehabilitate Snape in Cursed Child, but that was in an alternate universe where he lived for 20 more years. At best it shows that Snape had the capacity to start doing good things out of a desire to do good, but as of the end of DH he wasn't there yet.
