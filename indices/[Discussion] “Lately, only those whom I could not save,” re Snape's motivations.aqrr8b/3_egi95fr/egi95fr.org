"I did a quick scan for "Mud" in All except for DH, and I found no instance of it happening in front of a teacher except for Draco when he was in the Astronomy tower at the end of HBP. So, no. There's no time where we know it happened. But as we've seen other times it doesn't make it impossible for it to have happened off-screen, it isn't like we see everything that happens at all times. Only what's relevant for the larger story.

  Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione's hand away from her face. It wasn't a pretty sight. Hermione's front teeth --- already larger than average --- were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin --- panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry.

  “And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice. Snape had arrived.\\
  The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, “Explain.”

  “Potter attacked me, sir ---”

  “We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted.

  “--- and he hit Goyle --- look ---” Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.

  Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.

  “Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Look!” He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth --- she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape's back.

  Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.” Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight. It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however. “Let's see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it'll be a week's worth of detentions.”

Does that seem like a man that will bother?
