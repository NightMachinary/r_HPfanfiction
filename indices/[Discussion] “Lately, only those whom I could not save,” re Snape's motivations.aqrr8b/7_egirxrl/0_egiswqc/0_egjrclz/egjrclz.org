We were never told Voldemort's goals were in canon. All we know is he fought for the Pure blood agenda, despite being a half-blood. A popular fan theory is that the horcruxes he created caused him to go insane, which isn't that unbelievable. Perhaps he joined when he believed in the Dark Lord's ideals, and like many others, could not leave when these changed for fear of death. Or perhaps not, the books are notorious for not fleshing out characters.

He bullied children --- it's been shown abused kids are more likely to grow up and be abusive. Frankly, it's Dumbledore's fault for letting James Potters bullying have no consequences, and then hiring a traumatised person who had bad experiences as a child to work with children. Again. Snape needs a therapist.

He arranged someone's death --- somebody else has said: we don't know if he actually did it or not, he was telling Bellatrix and he may have been lying. I'm actually not too knowledgeable on this subject, but I do believe Dubledore would have known what he was doing, yes?

Letting children be tortured --- the entire last book, he was taking orders from the portrait of Dumbledore, AND he hates children.

Look, Snape is mentally not okay. He can't be okay after all he went through. Some things he did cannot be justified rationally, but that is because his mind is /irrational/. I still stand by my point. Snape needs a therapist, not haters.
