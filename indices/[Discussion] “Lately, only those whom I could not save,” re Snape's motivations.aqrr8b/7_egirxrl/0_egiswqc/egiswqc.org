Of course we can say he's a bad person - he joined the Death Eaters. You don't do that if you're a good man. You don't do that if you're a decent man. You only do that if you're scum. And he only left them after Voldemort targetted the one person he cared about. Not before. Not when innocents were murdered.

And even after he left them, he showed that he was scum. He bullied and abused children who never did anything to him. He arranged the death of Vance. He let children be tortured by Death Eaters.

Fighting Voldemort doesn't mean he was a good person - his sins greatly outweigh his good deeds.
