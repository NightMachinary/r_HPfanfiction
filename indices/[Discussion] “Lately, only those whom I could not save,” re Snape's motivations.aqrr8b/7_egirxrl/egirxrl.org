A firm belief of mine is that there is no such thing as a good person, or a bad/evil person. There are bad choices, and evil actions, but then again there may also be a good reason behind the evil action. The point is, the world is not black and white.

In the case of Severus Snape, we cannot look at his actions as if he is a normal person who had a normal childhood and went through normal experiences. His father was abusive, and he had to watch as Eileen Prince was beaten and abused and still would not leave his father. I do believe he loved his mother, and this would have been a horrifically traumatic experience.

Then, he meets Lily Evans and befriends her - his very first friend. His only friend. When there is one person in the entire world who will stand up for you, you latch onto them, and fall in love (or at least become infatuated).

The next big plot point is Lily and Snape's argument, where Snape calls Lily a Mudblood. Let's remind ourselves - Snape had an abusive father, and children growing up in abusive households will often have anger issues. He had just been humiliated by James Potter and his gang, and Lily Evans, a woman in a rather backwards, old fashioned society, had swooped in to save him. Embarrassment from the ordeal itself and the need for help prompted a rather rash outburst. Calling Lily a Mudblood was a bad choice by Snape, however, in the heat of the moment, with his sort of background, what happened was the logical sequence of events.

Lily cuts herself off from him, and the one thing stopping Snape from embracing the Dark Side was gone. However, he still cared deeply for her, so he asked the Dark Lord to spare her. He didn't ask him to spare her husband or child because he cared about neither. James bullied him for years, and for no valid reason at all. He had never met Harry, and the child of his only friend and his childhood enemy... It would be logical for him to harbor some resentment, and for that resentment to grow when Lily dies because of him. James eventually grew up, and Snape didn't, but James had loving parents and money and he was the most popular guy at school. Snape was abused and probably not very well off and the teachers ignored the bullying. James would eventually mature like a normal person. Snape never was /normal/. But I digress. The Dark Lord promises to spare Lily... but then does not. Lily was the only person he cared about in the entire world now his mother was dead. The Dark Lord broke his word and now was gone. He had been spying for Dumbledore, but I doubt he would trust him after he stood by for seven years of bullying. He took his best option: Staying out of Azkaban and working for Dumbledore, the only person who would give him a second chance. But there wasn't anyone in the world that he genuinely cared about, not anymore.

After this analysis, my final thoughts are: that Snape doesn't need haters, he needs a therapist.

He made some bad decisions and did some bad things, but he was probably mentally unstable from a childhood of abuse and seven school years of bullying. I don't think we can say he was a good person, but we can't really say he was a bad one either, because I don't think either exists. Good people can do bad things, and bad people can do good things, but does this make them the opposite? A better question: Is this something we can really judge? And I believe the answer is no. Humans are immensely complicated. Actions and intentions are interwoven and tangled and just a complete mess, and Snape is no exception.
