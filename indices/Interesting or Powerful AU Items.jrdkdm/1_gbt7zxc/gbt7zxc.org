The mirror of Erised in the versions I've encountered it is extremely powerful, more than the sword of Gryffyndor and probably more than the Goblet of Fire.

Orders of Magnitude has a few more super powerful artifacts. Minor spoiler: the Goblet of Fire in OOM goes all the way back to before Merlin's time. In those days it was called the Cup of Dawn. It's mentioned as a semi-throwaway factoid that it was also the Holy Grail. There was also a Cup of Midnight and a few other such items.

I think rather than Potterverse artifacts per se, you might like to read some large scale science fiction, that will put your imagination into a high enough gear.
