Sorry, I think we're talking about different roles.

A research assistant or intern in the US often does similar work to the researcher or full-time employee, at least from what I've seen in STEM.

I'm talking about a young, at most fresh out of Hogwarts Hermione working in a research lab. You don't give the head role to someone inexperienced.

For something Hogwarts age, she shouldn't be a plot device.

Remove the Buckbeak distraction and extra irrelevant classes, third year could be about piecing together what happened with Sirius Black back in 1981.

I want the research to be actively written.
