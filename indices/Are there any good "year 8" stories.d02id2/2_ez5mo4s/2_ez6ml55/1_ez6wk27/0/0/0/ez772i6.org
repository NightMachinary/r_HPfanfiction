To be fair, Hermione as a /good/ research assistant would be cool.

Someone who managed to crawl through the library and deduce a basilisk as well as it's method of travel is something that's rarely touched on. I'd argue she deserved a special services to the school as much as Harry did that year.

I always liked the end of year deduction by Harry and Hermione in the chamber of secrets.
