I have three versions:

1. [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War]]

2. Series by [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewuser.php?uid=13604][Northumbrian]], which is a way longer, but for this time period, it is linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian;Grave Days by Northumbrian;Aurors and Schoolgirls by Northumbrian), unfortunately, exactly the latest one these three, which would cover whole the eigth year is WIP, unfinished, and most likely never to be finished. There are more one-shots from that year, which make some idea what that eighth should look like.

3. linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) it was my first large fanfiction, and as with everything there is only one first story ;). Very angsty (dealing with PTSD is a substantial part of the story) covers first two or three years after the war.

All of these stories are more or less canonical, all of them Hinny.
