All the good eighth year fics I've read all are Drarry. Look for eighth year tags sorted by Kudos

[[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hogwarts%20Eighth%20Year/works]]

I can vouch for all the top fics which has Draco/Harry Pairing in this search (Sort by Kudos)

Maybe there are good Draco/Hermione fics if you don't prefer Slash ( I hear that 8th year is popular with this pairing as well, I don't read this pairing so I can't vouch for the results.)
