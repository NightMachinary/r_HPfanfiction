This is interesting

I've never read a fic that bashes him before or really seen him in a negative light-except for one, kind of. I cant remember the name but if I'm remembering correctly, it was after the war and some of them were returning for their 8th year and Neville had dated Luna over the summer but they broke up and now he was dating Hannah Abbott. And I think the fic was showing that he was kind of flaunting his new relationship with Hannah in Luna's face, sort of.

That's about as negative towards him as I've seen
