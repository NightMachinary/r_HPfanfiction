actually I'm in a bunch of pain and can't trawl for ones without the trio in there, so if you don't mind I'm going to just leave a link to my bookmarks [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/gladheonsleeps/bookmarks][page]] address on ao3 because I do try to read ones without the trio. Admittedly most in there are Hermione or Regulus Black. You can use the filters to try and get something you're interested in

I do find a lot of gold from using the filters in the main HP tag on both ao3 and ffnet. You can put in the name of someone you're interested in ie:Regulus Black and you'll get fics with them tagged in them, though it's still a lot of searching. of maybe you could just make another post on here that says ‘good' instead of ‘food' because that changed the post so much!

good luck! sorry I can't be more helpful!
