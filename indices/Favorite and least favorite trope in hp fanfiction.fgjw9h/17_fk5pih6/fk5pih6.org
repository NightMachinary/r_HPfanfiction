My least favourite trope in any fandom is when the author plants the characters in a totally AU setting so all they end up having in common with the canon characters are their names.

I enjoy when authors take the time to give minor characters a ton of back story that isn't canon but you totally believe could be.

Neither of those are specific to HP though! My favourite stories to read usually involve Hermione and Draco post-war being snarky with each other!!
