Was reading one other day, Brutal Harry, I think it was called. Skeeter and the Prophet was doing their usual thing during the tournament. So Harry goes to the Prophet and has a meeting with the owner. He pulled out a dozen gold bars and offers to buy the Prophet. Then he noted the offer is good for ten minutes. After that, he's going to buy the Prophet's paper and ink suppliers. He makes Moody editor.
