Hermione bash is just so wrong imo. Worse though is when they kill her for angst factor. Read one where she was severely injured in a car accident after Sirius died but hung on long enough to say good by to harry and tell him she'd used to magic to impregnate herself with his kid cause she was a seer knew she was gonna die and knew he needed someone to fight for. It was well written but killing hermione is just wrong
