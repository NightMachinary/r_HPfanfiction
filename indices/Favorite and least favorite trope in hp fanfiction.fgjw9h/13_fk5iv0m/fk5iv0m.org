I don't think I have a most or least favourite. Every time I think I do, a fic comes along that proves me wrong. Oh, I hate Potions Ginny and Molly, cue Faery Heroes; Oh, I hate WBWL, cue Three Black Birds; Oh, I hate Dumbledore bashing, cue His Angel. Oh, I love time travel, cue... half the time travel fics in the fandom. :D

It's not about the trope, it's all about how you use it. A good writer can make any trope work.

That said, I've not yet found a bad 'Gloriously Camp and Gloriously Evil Villain' fic yet. And I've not really been able to get around the Nazi-Victim tone of a Lily-Snape/Muggleborn-Deatheater pairing enough to find a good one of those yet. So, I suppose those are probably my best guess for favourite/not-so-favourite atm.
