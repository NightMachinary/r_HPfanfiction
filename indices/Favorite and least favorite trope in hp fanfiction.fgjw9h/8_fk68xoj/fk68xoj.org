Hate: Parings that have no weight or have nothing to do with the plot of the story but its sure advertised in the summery and tagged so if your desperately searching for it you get excited only to read for 8 hours to find out the pairing tag was just because they have one conversation that one time in chapter 58.

Hate: 3 page fall in love for no reason love stories. I don't even like pre-book relationships. Like if your story is about nev/ginny then you better show they are in love, maybe tell how they fell in love, hopefully it has something to do with your story and its not just, Oh Nev how did I never know you were so hot, lets get married.

Hate: 1 date in hogsmeade = relationship courting. like damn maybe they just wanted to have a butterbeer it doesn't mean when you walk back to the castle one of you has a relationship betrothal that makes zero seance all ready filled out.

Hate: How no one can change their mind. Like Cho when she wished with everything that she would have gone to the yule ball with harry but then doesn't back out of her date and it is a auto disaster. Like oh my god I wished you would have asked me, I've pinned on you for 5 years but i cant' love you because this side character asked me to go with him and now im locked into a relationship with him with no way out. (rolls eyes the hardest)
