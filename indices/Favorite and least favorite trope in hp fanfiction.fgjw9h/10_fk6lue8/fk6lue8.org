My least favorite is any 8th year head boy/head girl. They're not cohabitating in a private turret room with a shared bathroom. Nuh.

My favorite trope is probably anything with a broody hero/redemption arc. I'm a total sucker. Close second is Ron Bashing. Canon Ron really doesn't deserve it, but I love when fanfic kicks his ass.
