Favourite - Harry gets his head out of his arse in OotP or HBP and actually prepares for Voldemort. Dumbledore helps him on the path instead of being a Greater Good obsessed dimwit.

Least Favourite - Snape/Malfoy justification. Snape is an arsehole. Plain and simple. All that bullshit about regretting calling Lily a mudblood and he calls Hermione a mudblood in Deathly Hallows (in his memories while talking to Dumbledore's portrait). Malfoy is a coward whose only concern his is own pitiable self. Snape didn't fight for the right reasons, and Malfoy didn't give a shit about right and wrong - only himself. Fics with DHr, DMHP, SSHP, SSHG are absolute balderdash.
