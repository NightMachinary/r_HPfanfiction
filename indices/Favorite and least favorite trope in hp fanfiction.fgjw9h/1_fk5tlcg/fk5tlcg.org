Honestly, I like a well written manipulative Dumbledore. Not necessarily bashing, just fleshing out a character who had to be a little manipulative for the common good.

My least favorite is probably evil Molly Weasley. She's not my favorite character, and I don't agree with her a lot of the time. I still can't see her being a woman who pushes her kids towards Harry just for his money.
