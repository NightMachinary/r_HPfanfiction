My favorite trope (in any novel or fandom) is time loop.

For OC Harry, my favorite type is rational Harry, especially with grey or amoral Harry.

My favorite crossovers are HP with the ASOIF or GOT universe. I generally dislike all other crossovers as I'm not pop culture literate and don't watch many movies.

Least favorite: fix it fic with no time travel, just obstacles disappearing and enemies inexplicably becoming friends (often because Harry is ridiculously wealthy Lord Potter-Black). I especially dislike it when Slytherin characters are OC (mentor!Snape, Drarry, etc.).
