Favorite? A well done, slow burn, marriage law between an older male and a younger female (of age). I love the process of learning to cope with a preexisting power dynamic, trying to communicate with someone from a different generation and just learning to “love the one you're with”

Least Favorite? Anything starting more than like 5 year after DH with no reason for it. What have they been doing the last 5 years? Why has nothing exciting or notable that will influence their future happened?
