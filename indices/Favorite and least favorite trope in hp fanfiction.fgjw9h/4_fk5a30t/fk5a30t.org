Least favorite: Weasley and/or Dumbledore bashing. I don't even read Harry/Ginny stories (unless it's a side pairing) because for fanfiction purposes I don't find it interesting but none of the Weasleys deserve that. And the evil!Gryffindor/good!Slytherin reversal. Like, why can't both houses be a little of both? Idk, it's a bit of a lazy trope. I also skip soulmates/soul bond and polyamory fics but that's not exclusive to HP.

Favs: Eighth year, Harry decides to do something else besides being an auror. Ron being an awesome best friend.
