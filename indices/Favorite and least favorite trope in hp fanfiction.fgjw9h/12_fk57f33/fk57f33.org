Favorite: GeniusHarry, overall not so bad by themselves, it's when we put others with this one that the story gets bad.

Least favorite: Muggle world over-glorification, when the magical world is show to be hellish while the muggle one seems perfect and gives every opportunity to the muggleborns that were rejected by the WW even without them having any formal education after 10 years of age. When Voldemort is killed by muggle means and the rest of the WW seems like a band of idiots too.
