Most favorite: Canon divergence around OOTP/HBP. Does this count as a trope? Someone makes a different decision that drastically changes the course of the story and the war. Usually it's Severus or Draco in the fics I read but theoretically it could be any major character.

Least: Tie between overworked-ministry-employee Hermione and Indy Harry.
