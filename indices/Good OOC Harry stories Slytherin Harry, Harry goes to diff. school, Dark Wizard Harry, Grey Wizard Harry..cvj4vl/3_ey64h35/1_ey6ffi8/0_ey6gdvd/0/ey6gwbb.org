Hello!!!! Ahhh!!!!! Thank you so so much! It was a true labour of love, one that went on far too long and made my high school teachers angry when I was writing. It's absolutely 100% a chaotic wild ride, lots of plot twists especially that....one....specific one.....heh Thank you so much!! It's so great to see people still enjoy it even after its finale!
