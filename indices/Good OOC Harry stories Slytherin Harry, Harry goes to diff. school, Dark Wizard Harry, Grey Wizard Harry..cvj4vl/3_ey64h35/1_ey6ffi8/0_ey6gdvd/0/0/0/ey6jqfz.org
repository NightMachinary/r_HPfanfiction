Aww man! 3 years of work chewed up and chomped down in only a day and a half! Some of those plot twists were ridiculous to swing. Some of my close friends read the story and they pestered me constantly about spoilers- the last twenty chapters were absolute chaos for everyone. Screaming on both sides of the computer! I have never in my life received so many cumulative swears in reviews than after the....forest chapter plot twist. You know the one ðŸ˜… I'm super proud of the ending, especially with how emotional everything got and how I SOMEHOW managed to make it work with an insane time crunch. I think I was making a chapter every 5 days towards the end there!
