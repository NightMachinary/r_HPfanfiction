well i mean its not like I just saw the fic and was like 'wow this is really great high quality material I'm sure I could get addicted to this!!!'

my thought process was more like 'hey i just finished exams, took four hours to scroll through a weeks worth of material on tumblr, and theres absolutely nothing to do at 4am so you know what I'm going to go back to that one website where some mad writer paired Hogwarts Castle and a Giant Squid'
