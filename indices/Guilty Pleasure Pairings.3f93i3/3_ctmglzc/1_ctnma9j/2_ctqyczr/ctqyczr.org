Here's the thing, though--we know that from cannon /now/. I started reading fanfiction with Snape as a main character (or at least a primary influence) only a bit after the fifth book was published, and much of it had been written before (or ignored) the fifth book. Back then, Snape was very much an ambiguous, intriguing character. Was he on Dumbledore's side or wasn't he? He was a complete arse to Harry, but he was trying to help him and protect the Stone in the first book, and he went up against a werewolf to protect the students in the third. We find out that he had been bullied by Harry's dad and his friends in the fifth.

By the time the sixth book came out I had come across many different characterizations of Snape--both good and bad, but mostly good--for years and that definitely clouded how I interpreted cannon, how I reacted to it. Then afterwards we had two years to wonder--was Snape actually on Dumbledore's side, or Voldemort's? Tons of new Snape-centric fanfiction (ok, a lot of fanfiction in general but I mostly read Snape-centric stuff) came out in this period exploring his motivations, his excuses, his background, everything. Every time I'd read an intriguing opinion, I'd think to myself, "I wonder if/how Rowling will cover/explain/include this in the real book?"

Unfortunately, I found myself having the same thoughts while reading the seventh book shortly after it came out. I had to remind myself that this /was/ the real book, it wasn't just another fanfic that I could ignore and dismiss as unimportant if I didn't like it. And I was so, so disappointed by the way Rowling wrapped up Snape's story. I had seen him as an unpleasant man who did the right thing not because he wanted people to like him, not because he thought he'd get anything out of it, but because it's Right. He had made a grave mistake in his past and he was doing everything in his power to make up for it despite thoroughly despising the other people he worked with and for. Instead, Rowling made his primary motivation his obsession with another man's wife and Dumbledore's manipulations.

/That's/ why I'm drawn to fanfiction involving Snape--not because I love his characterization in cannon, but because I don't. I read Snape-centric fanfiction so I can read about the character I "knew" before the seventh book came out. I read Snape-centric fanfiction so I can read about a man who got the short end of the stick time after time after time--an abusive childhood, parents with a broken marriage, really unpleasant looks, a complete inability to socialize normally, an unpleasant personality/disposition (no doubt exacerbated by his upbringing), being sorted into the "evil" house, being endlessly bullied by the "popular" kids in school, whose only friends (besides Lily) were only his friends to use him for his abilities, who made a horrible mistake that affected for ill the whole rest of his life--and who nonetheless is able to redeem himself and find peace with himself and his past and find his version of a happy ending instead of dying cold and alone on the floor of the Shrieking Shack. I read Snape-centric fanfiction because it shows that the world is not just black and white--unpleasant people can still be good people, and you don't have to fit in someone else's cookie-cutter mold of "that's just what nice people do!" to be admirable. I read Snape-centric fanfiction because it gives me hope.

The romance aspect is just icing on the cake. :-)
