I'm curious as to what the draw of Snape paired with anyone is. My interpretation of him from canon is a petty, abusive, vindictive, arrogant, asshole. His only redeeming qualities are intelligence and magical talent. Many call him brave but he only turned on and fights against Voldemort because V killed the women he was obsessed with.
