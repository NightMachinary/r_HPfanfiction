No, I get that people see Snape as a sort of self-made martyr and feel sorry for him and I'm sure you could come up with good things he's done like protecting Dumbledore's army or saving Harry in first year quidditch.

I always feel like Snape could have said to Voldemort: "I had to act like a decent human being to convince Dumbledore." but instead chose with Dumbledore to act like a bastard to convince Voldemort.

If you've got some pro-Snape points then please let me know them but they'll have to be bloody good to convince me after he tried to have Lupin kissed.
