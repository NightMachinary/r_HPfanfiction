I agree with you.

A lot of people don't see this, they like to romanticise Snape and tend to forget the bits where he tries to get Lupin the dementor's kiss because he doesn't like him, where he enjoys tormenting Harry while he's trying to save Crouch Sr, where he forces kids to do horrible, painful detentions, where Snape was a willing death-eater for ages before the prophecy, where he forces Harry to dive into a freezing pond to get the sword for lolz or where Snape sells the Order out with the seven Harrys thing even though he's already Voldemorts right-hand man after killing Dumbledore and doesn't need to prove himself any further.

I can't remember what other crap he's done but the sum of it is that Snape is an arse who deserved a much more painful death.
