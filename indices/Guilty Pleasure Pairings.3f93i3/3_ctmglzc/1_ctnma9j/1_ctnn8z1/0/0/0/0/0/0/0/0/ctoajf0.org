All the while 3 children are proclaiming Black's innocence, which Snape should instantly be able to see as true if he's as much of a super!Legilimens as the later books claim him to be.

Also, depending on when Snape looks at the map (which doesn't show the shack) he either sees Lupin chasing after Sirius, Ron, Harry et al. or he sees Lupin going into the tunnel by himself. If he saw the earlier he would have no reason to not assume that Lupin saw the map and is off to confront Black (in which case he could have taken the wolfsbane potion that was with him at the time to the shack) or he sees Lupin going to where he was able to transform safely by himself and he had no-reason to go at all. There is no reason for Snape not to bring the Wolfsbane other than him being an arse.

I can see how Snape reacts in the shack from your point of view, but even then with Granger asking him to stop and listen to them he doesn't. He acts in an unreasonable and arseholic way because, although he is one of the good guys, he is in fact and unreasonable arsehole.
