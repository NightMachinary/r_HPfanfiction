So, different readers and writers have different reasons why they find him interesting to pair off with people.

Certainly, the best fanfics preserve the canon traits he has, such as having a truly appalling temper, being vindictive, arrogant, snarky, intelligent, and an asshole -- but they also tend to ascribe to him the /positive/ sides of those traits. In canon, Harry (our sole viewpoint character) is the person absolutely least likely to ascribe any positive traits to him whatsoever, but inherent with a such a limited viewpoint is the possibility that /other/ characters interpret him /differently/, and fanfic takes advantage of that.

In Snape-centric fanon, he's generally presented as a snarky, cynical, brooding, passionate (in canon, this is generally seen as anger, but you can see some of his passion for his craft in his opening speech in SS/PS), brilliant (frequently emphasizing his canon skills in creating/refining potions and spells), /sexy/ (essentially never for his appearance, but most often for his voice and the way he moves and his manner), confident, strongly principled man.

His defection from Voldemort in 'fic written either after the revelation of his love for Lily or with that as the author's headcanon (a very common headcanon, even for people who ship Snape with other people), was due to /love/ (which you interpret as "obsession"). His fanon reasons for /joining/ Voldemort in the first place (not discussed in canon, to the best of my recollection) are generally not due to any adherence to Voldemort's racist rhetoric, but other causes -- often, an interest in Dark Arts or a thirst for revenge against someone (frequently James Potter and/or his own father) -- which means that when Voldemort betrays Snape by targetting the woman he loves despite him begging Voldemort not to, Snape turns coat to try to protect her. (Remember, Snape /did/ turn /before/ the Potters were dead.)

His status as a double agent is almost always a subject of interest for fanfic writers, too -- the tension inherent in such a position and the need for him to maintain his cover /despite/ any personal feelings he might have allow for a lot of leeway regarding his outright cruelty towards others. (After all, even in the years when Voldemort was believed dead, Malfoy and many of the other Death Eaters were at large and could easily make his life hell, if not murder him outright if they suspected he /hadn't/ been trying to play Dumbledore for a fool.)

So, basically, a lot of it comes down to interpretation and personal opinion -- like everything else in fanfiction. :)
