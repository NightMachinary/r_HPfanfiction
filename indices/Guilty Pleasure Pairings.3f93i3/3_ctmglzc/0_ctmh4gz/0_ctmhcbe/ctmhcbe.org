Yup! That's totally how I fell into HG/SS, and now I've got a largeish collection of "as-good-as-the-average-great-fic" on the low end to "just-plain-amazing" on the high end stuff, lol. It helps that a lot of the HG/SS writers tend to be older (20s-40s), imho.

My only complaint is that a lot of people who write het pairings in general seem to have NO FUCKING CLUE how the hymen works. (Pro tip for writers: it's not a tamper-evident seal that you have to punch through.)
