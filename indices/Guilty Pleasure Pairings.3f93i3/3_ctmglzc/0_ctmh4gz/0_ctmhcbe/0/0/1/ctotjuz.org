Thanks for the recs! HG/SS has also been my primary pairing of choice for the last few years, but there's a few on your list that I haven't read! I definitely second The Fire and the Rose, though--I read that one for the first time pretty early on (I re-read it every couple years because I liked it so much, haha) and would definitely recommend it to those new to the pairing.
