Sure thing! I love getting to share my favourite contributions to the HMS Prudence and Potions. ;)

Fair warning: I tend to like epics, and I don't shy away from explicit material. Though not everything I like is all that long, I don't typically do one-shots. And not everything I like is NC-17, either, but I don't tend to mark out most stories in my head by the presence/lack of explicit content. So, basically, I don't remember relative lengths or ratings on the vast majority of these. If those are concerns for you, I recommend reading the authors' synopses before beginning reading! :)

Anyway, here're a few for you to take a look at. :) If there're any recs you'd like to make in return (I haven't read everything!), I'd love that! :D

- [[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/][Fire and the Rose by Abby and Anne]] -- The one that got me into liking the 'ship. :) I frequently rec this one to people to introduce them to HG/SS in general.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2981][Somewhere I Have Never Travelled by Strangeland]] -- Time Travel, but not the usual way
- The Phoenix Trilogy by grangerous ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763572/1/Phoenix-Song-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-HB-P][Phoenix Song]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5129305/1/Phoenix-Tears-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-DH][Phoenix Tears]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7600629/1/Phoenix-Fire-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-EW][Phoenix Fire]]) -- companion 'fic to HBP, DH, and replaces the epilogue. All three are epics and wonderful.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=1574][Cloak of Courage by WendyNat]] -- Written pre-HBP; features lots of interesting Dark Arts theory.
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=12541][Vanity by Wartcap]] -- companion 'fic to HBP; time travel; very funny in places
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2665][Unfinished Business by Ramos]] -- Ghosts!
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2002][Soul Searching by Quillusion]] -- somewhat older 'fic, but kind of classic, imo
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=20534][The Problem with Purity by Silver Birch]] -- Epic length, innovative magic ideas. Also involves H/D (ancillary pairing)
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=250][Time Does Not Heal All Wounds by WendyNat]] -- This is in my to-reread pile; it's been a while and literally the only thing I remember is loving it, LOL. It also has a sequel, [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=646][Some Scars Never Fade]].
- [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=1480][In Annulo by ladyofthemasque]] -- post HBP; replaces DH
- [[http://restrictedsection.org/story.php?story=1284][For Someone Special by ladyofthemasque]] -- VERY long (575,984 words), very explicit, but very well written. Involves one of those psychic mental/emotional/telepathic bond things.
