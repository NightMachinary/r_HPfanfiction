Read this great Harry/Fleur one once...wish I could remember the title, but it involved Harry spending his summer in France for some reason and getting to uh, know Fleur better.

Likewise, read this Sirius/Tonks fanfic but now that author has deleted it and I haven't come across such a well written story with those two since :(
