I would love to see more Sirius/Tonks as well--their personalities seem like they'd mesh so well! Unfortunately, they're first cousins once removed which, although acceptable among purebloods (especially in the Black family), is probably too close of a relationship for a majority of people. Though people write incest/twincest all the time, so what do I know?
