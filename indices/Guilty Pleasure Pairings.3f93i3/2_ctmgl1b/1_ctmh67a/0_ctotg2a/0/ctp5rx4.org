I'm totally fine with non-sibling incest in fanfics, I don't give a shit. The cousin thing is fine with me as well, especially if they're not first cousins than it isn't even a remote problem. And well, even if they're first cousins - its a fanfic guys. And it was (is?) still a part of culture for some.

Calm down, folks.

On the other hand, I very rarely read sibling-incest and don't do the whole "parental-incest" thing. Not...something I'm into in all honesty.

I REALLY want some Sirius/Tonks fanfics. Somehow the thought of such opposite personalities together amuses me - I think they'd work together really well! (And wait a minute, if I recall...wasn't Tonks' mum Sirius' first cousin? Doesn't that make Tonks and Sirius second cousins?)

Anyone know any good ones fics with Sirius/Tonks, don't be shy - LINKAGE!
