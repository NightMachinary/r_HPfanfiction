Harry/Fem!Voldemort, Harry/Lily, Harry/Charlie, Hermione/Charlie, Snape/Lockhart.... as long as both characters actually have canon characterizations (none of this Daphne Greengrass stuff) and stick to them (/cough/ Harmony /cough/), I'm a happy camper. The more surprising the better.

Plus, if you can convince me of Snockhart, that already says loads about your talent as a writer
