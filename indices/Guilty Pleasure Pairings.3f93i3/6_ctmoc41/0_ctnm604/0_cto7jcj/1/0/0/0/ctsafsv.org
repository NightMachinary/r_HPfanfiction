She's often written as this nihilistic character who already shows a hang for the darker arts and mindsets. Not yet insane, but headed there. Often because of her family. I have only seen her be written with a mental disorder once in this fic: linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds)

I think she's schizophrenic in this with a heavy case of abandonment issues.
