That's why "A Good Elf" exists.

But seriously in retrospect, I think that the ending that was originally given to THAW is the one that is the most realistic in that situation, and it almost feels like a Shakespearean tragedy in that respect. It's what the consequences of the plot threads lead to, and it tears your heart out of your chest, and that's the end of the story. It achieves a sort of catharsis, and while I love reading "A Good Elf" because it turns that around and is likewise also cathartic (because we get to see them reunited once more as they were in the beginning), THAW proper has a perfectly legitimate ending.
