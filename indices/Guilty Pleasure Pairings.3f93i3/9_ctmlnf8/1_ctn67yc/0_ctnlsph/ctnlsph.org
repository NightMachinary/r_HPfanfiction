I highly recommend linkffn(The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie), though it's quite long. It also has some Hermione/Remus.

There's also this one linkffn(roundabout destiny by MaryRoyale) that I recommend, but there are (well explained) alterations made to Hermione that make sense in the context of the story.

I really enjoy linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine by Mrs J's Soup) but I know some people felt like it dragged on a little bit. Has some scenes that made me crack up on the first read through.

I enjoyed the interactions and overall story in this one, but felt like it would have been much better expanded and broken up a little bit. linkffn(temporality by fangirlwithak)

I think linkffn(reason for life by ladyseradereturns) is a good one, and if you need smuttier smut, I believe the uncut versions are also on her blog that you can find through her bio page. She's got a couple good stories.

*Note*: the bot did not post them in the order I linked them, so careful Lol
