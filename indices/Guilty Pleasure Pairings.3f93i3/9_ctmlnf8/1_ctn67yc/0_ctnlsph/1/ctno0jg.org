Ages ago I read this Sirius/Hermione story called Lavender and Lace - I thought it was going to be some smutty, trashy crap...boy was I wrong!

It was this fantastic non-magic AU set in mid-1800's England where Sirius is a roguish, charming man who is losing his fortune thanks to his own bad behavior and recklessness while Hermione is a bookish young maid working in his household who becomes his confidant. It had a very slow developing, very realistic relationship/romance and correct mannerisms/behavior for the time with very in-character characters.

SUCH a good story, but sadly I think the author deleted it. I cannot find it anyway.
