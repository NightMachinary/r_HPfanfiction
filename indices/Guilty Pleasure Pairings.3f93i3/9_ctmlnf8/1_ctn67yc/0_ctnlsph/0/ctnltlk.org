#+begin_quote
  Hermione uses the Time Turner to go back before the Potter's death, not to change things, but to change the outlook of Sirius's life. She went back for the sake of Harry, the Order and for his salvation. She didn't do it to fall in love

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. COMPLETE!
