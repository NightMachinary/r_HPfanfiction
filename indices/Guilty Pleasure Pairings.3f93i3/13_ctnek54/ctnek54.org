Probably Harry/Fleur or Harry/Tonks.

Er... I may also be one of the few who actually ships this but I do like Harry/Ron/Herimone. As a trio. There aren't many fics like that out there. Also quite like James/Sirius if it's implied but not overt, ya know? Or Sirius/Lily (same as before, implied not necessarily overt). Or James/Sirius/Lily. As a trio.
