Thank you. I feel as though I'm not as sheltered as I was thinking I might be. My sister and I (both adults with adult-ish children) are planning a prank for Christmas this year, but it's not something we do often, maybe gag-gifts, but this is our elaborate scheme:

We have a White Elephant exchange at my father's. It started because my father, my step-mother, and my aunt are all teachers and (sorry to disappoint you kids) they often recycle the presents they get from well-meaning kids that aren't "World's Best Teacher" mugs. My aunt however has slowly built it up to include entire Bath and Bodyworks sets, booze, and other pretty expensive items so that the rest of us feel like cheap bastards. Now, my ex moved out a few years ago, but he left 90% of his crap in my apt. His mother is the Queen of Garage Sales and Thrift Stores. I have small plastic bulldogs, ceramic pig heads, a sculpted wooden eagle, a crap ton of cheap novelty stuff, you have no idea how much schlock this woman felt was absolutely necessary to stuff into my apt. So we're going to collect a couple of crates of it, wrap it all, and make sure that my aunt is required to take home about 25 items of the garage sale reject variety, because the one rule is you don't open the stuff from your family section's donation pile. Aren't we crazy?!
