Yikes! Glad you found a way to at least avoid some of that. When my kiddo was in HS the bullies did shit like shove people down the stairs, destroy their clothes in gym and throw them away, and throw food at kids at lunch. One 13 year old had her head put through a window because she was pregnant which meant she was a slut in the bullies' minds and that made it okay to them. I don't really know which would be worse. The bullies never really got in trouble at her HS, I'm assuming as it seems like something that happened often that they didn't where you went either.
