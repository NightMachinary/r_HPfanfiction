It seems that might be a difference in what people would get away with in day school vs a boarding school perhaps? Hopefully things don't escalate to that degree anywhere else, but perhaps boarding with people and knowing you were going to be around them all of the time as well as more adult supervision (I assume?) rather than being able to just go home or bolt from school after doing whatever raised the level of atrocity in their behaviour.
