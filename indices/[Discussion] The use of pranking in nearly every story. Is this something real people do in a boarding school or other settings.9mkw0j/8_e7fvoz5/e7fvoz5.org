My school didn't have much pranking. More traditional bullying which was terrible. An example would be getting ripped out of bed at 3am to be thrown into the shower. One would have to strip naked and sing a song while the older students showered the younger with ice-cold water. Luckily, my roommate and I locked ourselves in the bathroom the moment we heard the door open.
