The school bitch, Chris(tine), was banned from Prom because when Carrie had her first period in the gym locker room and was scared that she was dying, Chris and her friends were taunting her and throwing tampons at her and then Chris skipped out on the detention she was given for it. One of the "nice girls", Sue, asked her boyfriend to take Carrie to Prom because she felt bad for her. This pissed Chris off more since Carrie would be going and she couldn't. So, a night or two before the dance, Chris and her boyfriend and crew went on her command to a pig farm to slaughter pigs for their blood. Then Chris had her friend rig the vote for Carrie to be Prom Queen. They balanced the bucket of blood over the stage and waited until she was crowned, then they dumped it over her and started laughing and mocking her until she lost it. Chris was the orchestrator behind everything.
