Pranking really only happens when you're in an enclosed area with nothing else to do, with other people, and you don't have transportation to leave.

And its mostly dudes.

If we have to be bored out of our minds we're going to find someway to entertain ourselves. Most of the time its more of a Nodding of the head, coming to terms, then swearing vengeance and getting them back. So, all in good fun.

Most guys know theres certain lines can't be crossed or they get punched in the face. Which is tend to be why most girls view pranking aa bullying, becauase around other girls theres no social heriarchy that can be maintained or overturned by simply punching the other girl in the face or stomping her out, which is why most of the "pranks" tend to be maliciuis in nature (Because theres no potential consequence). The physchology of the acts is different.

Why is why you tend to run into "Fred and George are bullies" interpretation sometimes
