I have two theories:

1. I think when you don't have TV, movies, internet, video games, etc., kids come up with creative ways to entertain themselves. And I think that's where pranking comes in.

Or...

1. It could also just be a narrative device. It's the most entertaining way for readers to watch kids entertain themselves in a way that moves the plot and character development forward.

EDIT: OK, I've thought about this a little more, and I'm remembering now that the boys I grew up with did come up with a fair amount of pranks. Most of them just weren't very memorable. I remember the ones that went badly the most vividly --- like when they started to shove a Port-A-Potty after our camp counselor went inside, so that it seemed like it was almost going to tip over. They got sent home after that ðŸ˜¬

So, dumb kids doing dumb pranks is definitely a thing.

I also know that the author John Green has talked about the pranks that his friends pulled at his U.S. boarding school.

EDIT2: I'm doing a really terrible, neurotic job answering your question, lol. I also just remembered a story my friend told me about, when she was in high school, that she and her friends would constantly prank the administrators. They broke into one person's office and replaced a ton of the stuff in her room with penguin figurines. She told me the administrator got her back her senior year by giving her an envelope that contained a very real-looking letter from the college she'd applied to, which said her acceptance had been rescinded. She said she was sobbing in the hall for like an hour, until she saw that the letter had CC'd the Society of Penguins at the bottom.

My friend told this story to a large-ish group of people. She was laughing, but we all looked completely horrified, lol
