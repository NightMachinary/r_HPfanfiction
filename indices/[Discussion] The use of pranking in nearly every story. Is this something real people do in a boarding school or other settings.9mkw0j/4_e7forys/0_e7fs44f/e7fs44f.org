Thank you for your answer. It looks like the others seem to agree on the closed environment thing. I was in a rural HS where a bunch of small towns sent their kids together. The 'bad' things we did included sneaking off to the dock with the janitor and/or some of the teachers for a smoke (you didn't get in trouble if you bummed them smokes) or, as you mentioned, just skipping school.

Edit: the part about supplying the teachers with cigs.
