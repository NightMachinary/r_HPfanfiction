I think it does happen in very closed environments. I went to public school, where you spent most of your time outside of school, relatively speaking (even if most of your waking hours were in school). Most of the mischief at my schools involved skipping classes, sneaking off campus for lunch, or similar. Why pull a prank when you can skip class and go see a movie? On a closed campus like at a boarding school, where every aspect of your life is subject to (potentially draconian) school rules, I can see people pulling pranks as a way to let off steam.
