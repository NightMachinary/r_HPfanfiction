It depends. I remember there being quite a few pranks when I was in elementary and middle school, though relatively few comparatively in high school.

I grew up in the days where you didn't usually get a cell phone until 8th grade at the earliest unless you were one of the spoiled rich kids. So we had to entertain ourselves in between classes somehow.

In elementary school, I remember the pranks mainly being spitballs, jump scares, licking your finger and putting it on someone's neck, writing swear words on desks (mostly 'ass' lol), etc.

In middle school there were more pranks on the teachers and staff, like moving their stuff around on their desk, making farting noises when that one absurdly fat lunch monitor lady walked by, and plenty more pranks on each other like farting on someone's pencil or backpack, pantsing, twisting ketchup and mustard packets so that they would burst when someone stepped on them or sat on them, rearranging furniture, drawing mustaches and anime hairdos on every portrait or picture hanging on the walls, etc.

High school pranks usually involved messing with someone's powerpoint presentation or speech, printing out gross pictures or dirty jokes and taping them to the walls (usually the restroom), writing the names of hot girls on the restroom stalls, drawing dicks on things, etc. By that time most of us had cell phones (though almost no one had a smartphone until college iirc), so we looked at the early memes, stupid youtube videos like Powerthirst and the early fanmade Lego Star Wars videos, and paparazzi pictures of whatever celebrity was popular at the time looking for nipple slips or whatever.
