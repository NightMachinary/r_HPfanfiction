Not so much ‘pranks all year round' but I went to a private (not boarding) school in Australia and the graduating year had muck up day until the second youngest Nangle boy crash tackled his cousin in my year and got it banned. I distinctly remember lines of ‘cocaine' (flour) spread around the school, desks and chairs stacked and zip-tied together to block off an entire hallway, forcing people to walk all the way around the building to get through, and kids running around with water guns. Also, a staff member (not a teacher) once got kidnapped, gator-taped to the top of a lamp post (yeah, our school had lamp posts) and held ransom for money to go to charity. Other than that, we'd disappear on teachers, hide the whiteboard eraser, draw dicks on the board and just generally be shits.
