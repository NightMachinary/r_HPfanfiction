I was about to write and say I didn't find it all that common either but then I sat down and really thought about it and actually, yes, we did a lot of it. While I didn't go to boarding school, we sure as hell pranked our most irritating teachers. I'm not a big one myself, but I appreciate the amusement nonetheless.

Highlights include:

- once all looking at one spot and when she looked at it, choosing another.

- one teacher liked to blow a whistle, have you stand and answer his questions. it's a lot funnier if someone begins doing the sound of music. he is forever known as captain von trapp now.

- moving the entire furniture in the classroom backwards then waiting for the teacher to come in sitting quietly

- letting loose one of those ferrets on balls you get for toys and then all jumping and screaming like a tom and jerry cartoon.

- creating an evil fairy ('miss tilly') who would leave calling cards when stuff was moved

- all the printers were on the same network so if someone in classroom 2 printed 'HELP ME' or a variety of other things it could come out anywhere across the two buildings or sixth form.

- we had two sets of twins. you can imagine.

There was also a variety of student on student pranks such as overloading the toilets with washing up liquid, several food fights (I will never look at tuna again after getting pelted with it), wanted posters, waiting with water pistols full of orangeade (this backfired when the deputy head came round the corner) and being a 90% white british area, having students called Jesus and Midas on the student council in Sixth Form meant people loved to leave jokes like spray painting things gold or leaving Jesus puns on the white board.

There was also one day a year, usually the last day of term before Christmas or summer holidays, teachers would do things and wouldn't say anything. For example, our male science teacher showing up in a blonde wig, white dress with two balloons in his shirt and not commenting on it even when a balloon burst or when our head of year was supposedly late for assembly and rode in on a motorbike dressed as Trinity from the Matrix and just got on with reading the announcements.
