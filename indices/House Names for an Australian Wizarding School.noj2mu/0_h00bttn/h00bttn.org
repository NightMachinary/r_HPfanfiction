Lunulata, Cubozoa, Cassowary, and Atracid after four of the most dangerous animals in Australia (Blue-ringed octopus, Box jellyfish, Cassowary, and Funnel-web spider).

The founders of the school did this to ensure that the students never forget the mundane creatures that they need to watch out for.

Lunulata favours intelligent students, Cubozoa takes the more friendly and community-minded, Cassowary the brave, and Atracid the cunning.
