They might as well be with all the times magical 'protections' in some form show up. Ward by another name. It's not just the persisting ones like Fidelius, blood protection, or anti-apparition charms, sometimes they go 'active' and form giant glowing domes like in the Battle of Hogwarts and Fantastic Beasts.

I think it's the fanon runes that get most people, not that transcribing arcane symbols on a stone and channeling magic through it to 'set' the ward is that big of a jump given how much is left to the imagination with HP's magic system.
