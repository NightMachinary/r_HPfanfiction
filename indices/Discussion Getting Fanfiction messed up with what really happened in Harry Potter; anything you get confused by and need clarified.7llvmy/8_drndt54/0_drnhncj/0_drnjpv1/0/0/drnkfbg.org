  I can sort of get your point, but take the profession of mediwitch for example. We generally accept that the field is a mix of charms and potions (and probably some counter-cursing), but I just don't see how classifying those spells or potions with the same general function as 'healing' to be somehow less than canon.

I refer you back to my TL;DR. If the fic uses the word "wards" in such a way that it is clear that it is not considered a branch of magic but rather is a shorthand way of referring to magic of a certain function, fine. But I have literally never seen any fic do this.
