I can sort of get your point, but take the profession of mediwitch for example. We generally accept that the field is a mix of charms and potions (and probably some counter-cursing), but I just don't see how classifying those spells or potions with the same general function as 'healing' to be somehow less than canon.

Just as I wouldn't gripe if a curse breaker(?) was called a Warding Specialist and concentrated on taking down (or erecting) magical protections in the field of Charms (or Runes, as the case may be). It may simplify a definition, but it's still a generalization and thus "messy".
