In HP, magic is generally grouped into branches which share similar properties: Transfiguration, Charms, etc. By using the term "wards" the natural implication is that the magic within that area is a branch of magic in the same way that Charms, Transfiguration etc are.

But "wards" are not a distinct branch of magic in canon. They consist mainly of Charms and Curses. "Wards" classifies magic by function rather than nature and in doing so it clashes with the rest of the HP magic classification system.

In doing so the use of the word "wards" can lead people to forget that it is not a distinct magical field with its own rules but rather simply a shorthand way of referring to a variety of magic which more properly belongs to the other branches of magic. That in turn will generally lead to these items of magic being mistreated (said abuse generally involving runes).

Ultimately this isn't about being /different/ to canon, this is about being /worse/ than canon. Like many fanon inventions, "wards" take something which is interestingly complex in canon and make it simple. Having magical protections be composed of a mix of magic of different natures and governed by different rules has a messiness to it which makes it feel more realistic - the real world is a messy place. I don't understand why anyone would want to get rid of that in favour of neat categorisation.

TL;DR: the problem isn't the word "wards", the problem is people treating wards as a branch of magic. Which happens in basically every fic which has ever used the word "wards".
