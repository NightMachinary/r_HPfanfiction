1.  How smart Hermione really was?

2.  Was Sirius seriously a cassanova during his Hogwarts years?

3.  Lily being this perfect mary sue in 99% of fanfics. Was it true in canon too?

4.  What are these "raids" voldemort conducts on muggles/wizards? How exactly did the war pan out during mid 70s?

5.  Fred and George doing stupid stuff or bullying and naming it as a prank.

6.  Luna Lovegood just a weird girl. Not a seer nor some special girl who could see invisible stuff.

7.  Severus Snape. Canon Snape did not loathe Harry as most of the Snape bashing fics convey. He was a complex character overall, but fics make him one dimensional sometimes.

8.  Voldemort's true motives. He's been portrayed by many ways in fanfics, but eventually he was just a power hungry manipulator.

9.  Slytherins. I feel the books were a bit biased against Slytherins. But as a whole never really got a good insight on Slytherin characteristics.fanon portray slytherins with wide variety of their own additions.

10. Harry. Harry was a genuinely average teenager in books with special circumstances. His character literally eveolves book-wise and is different every book, POA onwards. Fanfics generally have a point of divergence, and add their own characterization as to how Harry should have been according to them. Some have become such common tropes that it's sometimes hard to remember what's canon and what's fanon
