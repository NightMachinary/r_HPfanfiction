  The humble Warming Charm. A simple charm you can place on your robes to prevent them from getting chilly in the winter, or reheat muggle food following a breaking-and-entering-and-obliviating. Never actually seen in canon, I think.

There's no direct "make it warm" Charm but there is a "blast of warm and drying air" Charm which Dumbledore used on Harry in the Cave in HBP.
