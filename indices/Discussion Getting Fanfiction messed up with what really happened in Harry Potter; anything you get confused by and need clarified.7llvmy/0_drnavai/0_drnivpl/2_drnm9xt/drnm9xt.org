I think Dumbledore followed the prophecy as well. He was 'training' Harry since year one. When Dumbledore knew he would die in the HBP, he gave all the information to Harry. Not Order, Minerva or Kingsley, but to a 16 year old boy. Would he choose Harry if the prophecy would not exist? I don't think so.

Btw, if Voldemort did not believe the prophecies, it would not exist because it would not come true.
