  Dumbledore himself didn't follow the prophecy like a rabid dog. I remember an argument in the 6th book, where Dumbledore says something along the lines of, "Stop taking the prophecy so literally"

I know, right? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5kc8wq/rt_if_dobby_worked_smarter_not_harder_xpost_from/][Way back when a mini-fic I wrote was cross-posted to r/rational]], someone actually commented that they thought it didn't make sense, because there's no way Dumbledore would let the all-important child of prophecy out of his grip.

Seriously, where did the whole 'the prophecy is binding and unbreakable' thing start? Is it just selective memory, maybe? People going 'It was the big reveal at the end of book 5, Scrimgoer comments on Harry supposedly being the Chosen One, Harry himself makes a joke about it, he really is the one who defeats Voldemort' but forget the small scene in the middle of Book 6 where Dumbledore explicitly states that prophecies are powerless except for belief in them?

Or maybe they're getting Harry Potter confused with another series. Tell me, does anyone know any stories where a prophecy ISN'T self-fulfilling? Where it actually has power of its own?
