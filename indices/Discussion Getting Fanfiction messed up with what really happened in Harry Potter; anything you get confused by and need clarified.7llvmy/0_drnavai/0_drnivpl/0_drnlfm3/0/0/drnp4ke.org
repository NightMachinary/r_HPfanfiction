  Then at the end of the book, the prophecy turns out to be exactly right, excpet that it was an interpretation no one understood.

This part at least goes for Harry Potter as well. And that would be a common canon misunderstanding as well.

It was actually just that Voldemort didn't know Harry had the elder wand on his side.
