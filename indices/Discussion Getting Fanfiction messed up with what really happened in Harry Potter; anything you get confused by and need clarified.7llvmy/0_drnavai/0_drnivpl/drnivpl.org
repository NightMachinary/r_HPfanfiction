The Warming Charm has some canon basis. Hermione is shown using a charm that expels warm air to melt the snow in front of them as they're walking in one of the last 3 books.

The prophecy really gets my goat. Mostly, because it shows a shallow interpretation of canon. The prophecy only mattered because Voldemort acted like it did.

Dumbledore himself didn't follow the prophecy like a rabid dog. I remember an argument in the 6th book, where Dumbledore says something along the lines of, "Stop taking the prophecy so literally"
