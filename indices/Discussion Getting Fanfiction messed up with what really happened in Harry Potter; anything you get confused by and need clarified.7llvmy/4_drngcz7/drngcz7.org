remus lupin isn't mentioned as having any scars on his face, or at all. his face is lined, and his hair is graying, and he does look older than his age

lucius malfoy doesn't have long hair, or a cane. in fact, if we go by draco in the epilogue, he probably has less hair than average. there's also a larger trend where people seem to think that long hair on men is a wizardy cultural tradition which i'm not sure is true. the malfoys are wizard high society preps, so his hair is likely exactly like draco's: short and slicked back. we also see a lot of hair loss among pureblood men: arthur, salazar, draco's receding hairline, slughorn. plus, a lot of the men who do have long hair are usually eccentrics or rebels of some kind e.g. snape, the dumbledores, xeno, bill. and molly, a pureblood mother, decidedly doesn't like bill having long hair

sirius didn't know that DEs had dark marks pre-GoF
