I remember reading on here (or somewhere) that the only time the word "Marauder" was brought up in canon was in reference to the Marauder's Map. James, Sirius, Peter, and Remus were never explicitly called the Marauders. It's led me to think of a funny gag if this is true.

Fred and George stared in shock at Professor Lupin.

"You're one of the Marauders!" they yelled in unison.

Lupin stared back, confusion written clearly on his face. "I'm a what now?"

The twins quickly looked at each other, then back at their professor.

"You just said your nickname in school was Moony."

"The same Moony that's friends with Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs, right?"

"That same group that has personalities in our map?"

"The one that boldly proclaims itself 'The Marauder's Map'?"

Professor Lupin only became more confused as Fred and George explained their reasoning, but then it finally clicked when he realized what they were talking about. "Ah, that map! I remember that! We made it in our fifth year because of all of the exploring we did, and we constantly added enchantments to it over the years. As a last great prank on Hogwarts, James and Sirius let themselves get caught by Filch with it near the end of our seventh year, knowing that it would go straight into his drawer of confiscated items. I think that's why they named it the Marauder's map, it was for any Marauder brave enough to raid the drawer. We were never actually arrogant enough to give ourselves a group name!"
