Ah, that is true. So from that then them being called Marauder's is simply fanon made, the only thing called Marauder is the map. Interesting. The group itself isn't called Marauders, fanon has just made it that way.

Edit: But even if Rowling did state in a interview, I tend to think of things she says in interviews as merely a possibility of canon, but just depending on what you want. (Same with Pottermore actually). I like Pottermore but only use it when I have to or it makes sense.
