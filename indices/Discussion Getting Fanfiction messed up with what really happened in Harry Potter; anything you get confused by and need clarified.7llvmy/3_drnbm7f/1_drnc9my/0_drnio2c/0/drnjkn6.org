  In the fifth book, Moody says Death Eaters murdered Edgar Bones and his wife. Of course, it could be a Charlus and Dorea situation. But, unlike most fanon, there is some canon background to it.

It's exactly a Charlus and Dorea situation. That is: just like Charlus and Dorea were never realistic candidates for James' parents, those who know their canon also know that there's nothing to suggest Susan was raised by Amelia.

The passage in OotP reads thus:

#+begin_quote
  There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, *who had an uncle, aunt, and cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten*, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry.

There's nothing vague about it since it lists out those relations of Susan who died and her parents are not among them.
