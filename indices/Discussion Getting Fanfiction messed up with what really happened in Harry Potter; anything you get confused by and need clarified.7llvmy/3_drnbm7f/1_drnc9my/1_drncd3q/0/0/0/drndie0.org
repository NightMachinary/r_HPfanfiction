Fabian and Gideon are three years older than Molly and Arthur in my headcanon. I haven't thought about Luna's parents, but probably I would think around Molly and Arthur's age, or since I have Fabian and Gideon as older than Molly and Arthur, than maybe around Fabian and Gideon's age.

I just don't like pairing off everyone's ages with the Marauder's since that would be unrealistic in my opinion.
