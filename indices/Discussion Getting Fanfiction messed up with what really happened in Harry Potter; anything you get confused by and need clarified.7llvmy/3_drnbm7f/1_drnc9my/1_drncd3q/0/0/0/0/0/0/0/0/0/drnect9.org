Edgar and his wife and children were killed by Voldemort, if I remember right Edgar is suppose to be Amelia's sibling, could be wrong about that.

Amelia was also killed by Voldemort later on, so it's likely that her parents or at least one of them at the very least was still alive, likely one or both of Susan's parents weren't related to Amelia because man having all of your relatives being killed by Voldemort and Death Eaters would be brutal as all heck.
