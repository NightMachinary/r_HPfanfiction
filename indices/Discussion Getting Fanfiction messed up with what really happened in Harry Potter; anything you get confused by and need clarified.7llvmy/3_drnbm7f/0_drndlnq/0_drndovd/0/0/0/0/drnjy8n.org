True, but I've called people aunt or uncle when they weren't related to me, just because they were close to my mom. That could be what Susan does, or it could just be that they're related.

Edit: As for the last name thing, if her parents had been in fact killed at a young age Amelia could have always given Susan her last name. But yes, she likely is her biological aunt.
