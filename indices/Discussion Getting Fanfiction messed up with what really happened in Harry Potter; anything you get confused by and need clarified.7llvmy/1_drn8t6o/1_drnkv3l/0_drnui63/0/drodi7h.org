I think a lot of people just like to rag on the old man. Personally, I see him as someone terrified of power (because he fears he'll end up killing more people like his sister) extremely reluctant to use violence or force (because of Gellert and his sister) and far more interested in teaching and studying and pursuing his own hobbies (backed up by him being odd and quirky as a teacher who was beloved but considered mad).

However, he had the problem that because he was a genius who was also the most powerful wizard of his age people kept expecting him to do all the things he hated. They wanted him to be a war leader, even against a man who was his friend and possible lover. They wanted him to lead the country, when Dumbledore feared of what he would do when in power. I even suspect he was reluctant to be made Headmaster of Hogwarts and had to practically be dragged out of the classroom because he feared he would have too much influence.

Of course I expect all that to be thrown out the window when the new Fantastic Beasts movie comes out and he becomes a generic badass.
