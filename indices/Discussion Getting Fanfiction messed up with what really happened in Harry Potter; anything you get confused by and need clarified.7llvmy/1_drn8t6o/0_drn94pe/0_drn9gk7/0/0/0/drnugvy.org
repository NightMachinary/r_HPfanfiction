People like Regulus seemed to be the extreme minority among Death Eaters. Even Snape would happily have gone along murdering and torturing Muggles if his boss hadn't been such an insensitive ass. Draco tried until the very end to capture the Trio and regain his favor with Voldemort.

Most other named Death Eaters were sadistic mass murderers through and through.
