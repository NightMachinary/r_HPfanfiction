While I don't plan on arguing in favor of the Death Eaters, it is worth nothing that we see most of the after extended stints in Azkaban. There's probably a good fanfic to be written that shows them as more, sane? with their beliefs and then how spending a decade plus in a prison designed to psychologically torture you could turn you into, well, what they are.

Granted, we're not really led to believe they weren't exactly the same way before prison, but I feel like there's something interesting that could be done there.
