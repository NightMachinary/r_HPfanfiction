Would be a hilarious 'justification' for a Magical Jurassic Park situation. :D

And it could fit weirdly well with a world of Pureblood Bigotry. I can totally picture a Muggleborn finding out about the park and being like:

"But the Dinosaurs lived ages before any Humans came along, and they were killed by a Meteor, not Humans!"

And then the Pureblood responding haughtily with:

"Actually, it was both. How do you think Muggles got to this planet in the first place? All the Magical Creatures down here, and you thought you were the locals? Pshah. You came down here, hunting all our dinosaurs, until we had to hide them! It was the first Statute of Animal Secrecy."

Wouldn't necessarily have to be true - could be some interesting bigot mythology - but the explanation for both does mesh weirdly well together. :D
