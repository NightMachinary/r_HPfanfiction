It's great. The subtle and not so subtle changes to canon are very well crafted. There are also tons of details about everything spy-related.

Among other things, it made me see the potential Ron had for greatness - and completely erased all the "Ron's a traitor, Ron's dumb, Ron's a coward, Ron's a bad friend, Ron doesn't deserve Hermione" influence from various fics. Plus, their romance was very well put together, with Hermione crushing early on, Lavender meddling, and parents trying to prevent their relationship.
