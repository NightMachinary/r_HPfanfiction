It's interesting, as I think about it now, there are many fandoms which happily and (objectively) successfully remove the fundamental elements of the universe (non-vampire Twilight, non-19th-century-France Les Miserables) but I have never come across that in the HP fandom (or at least, its not nearly as prevalent). Anything can be changed, but you can't take away the magic.
