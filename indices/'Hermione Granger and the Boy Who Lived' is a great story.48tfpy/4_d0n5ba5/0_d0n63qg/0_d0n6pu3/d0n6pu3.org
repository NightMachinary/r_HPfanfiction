In the context of the fic I can understand why as a character she'd use it but as a reader I just got burnt out on hearing about Hermione course schedule, her course work, the way she triangulated the gps on the phone jammer through the means of interfacing with the transmitter blah blah blah, it was just too much and so boring to read at parts. Which is a shame because I liked the interpretation of some of the canon elements on a world without magic. Maybe I'll give it another shot.
