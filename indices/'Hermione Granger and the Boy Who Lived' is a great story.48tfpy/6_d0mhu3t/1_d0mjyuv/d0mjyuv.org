Of course a fanfiction story can be better than canon. Improving upon an existing work is how many works of fiction we revere were created. Shakespeare, Goethe, many of the greatest authors used existing stories and tales as a base - they wrote fanfiction, you might say.

What you are saying is that an original idea can never be improved upon, which is plainly wrong. We see that each time in fanfiction even, when we encounter a good, original idea that was not perfectly executed.

Just because JKR wrote it doesn't mean it is perfect.
