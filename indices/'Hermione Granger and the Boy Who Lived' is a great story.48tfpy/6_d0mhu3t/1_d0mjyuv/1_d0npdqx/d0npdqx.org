  What you are saying is that an original idea can never be improved upon, which is plainly wrong.

I love how you reduce picking off an entire cast of characters and/or an entire world to an 'original idea'. That's not an idea, that's years of somebody else's work. As with everything in this world, scale matters. Using a trope or an idea inspired by another work and using the characters of another work are hardly equivalent.

And this still applies:

  In fanfiction, you're using either the reader's connection to the world or the characters (or both, as it is in most cases). Creating this initial connection is one of the biggest challenges any author of original fiction has to face. But in fanfiction, this connection and familiarity is already there, created by the original author.
