And yet it remains unpublishable, while borrowing ideas doesn't, for the most part. There is a clear line there. The unpublishable kind cannot be better than the original because (among other things) it lacks an identity of its own without the original work.

Indeed. I certainly can't understand how you can take the setting, the characters and a major portion of what makes the story what it is from another one and claim to be better than it.

e: Also, since I suspect this is the part you're hung up about, Harry Potter can indeed be improved upon, as can any work. But you /still/ can't claim to be 'better' than it since a very significant part of it isn't your work at all. As long as that remains, you aren't the better writer and you work isn't better. The only one who can 'improve' upon it in that sense is the original author. And the difference between borrowing ideas and what happens in fanfiction is outlined above, so the comparison is not valid.
