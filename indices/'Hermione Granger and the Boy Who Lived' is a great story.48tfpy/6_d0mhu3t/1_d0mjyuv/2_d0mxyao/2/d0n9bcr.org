This is incorrect. The "quality" of a story depends upon the author's skull. Characters, plot, imagery, tone, whatever.

The inspiration for a story has no effect on its quality.

Example: Let's take a terrible book. How about, Twilight. If a good author took the basic concept and characters of Twilight, and wrote a great story, then that would be an example of the fanfic being better than the source.

The simple fact that the fanfic author didn't invent the idea of Harry Potter/Twilight doesn't mean that the fanfic will always be worse.
