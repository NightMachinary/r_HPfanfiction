  than what the actual author of the series wrote

I was actually talking specifically. I was certainly not talking about any old piece of fiction.

And I did not say that no one can write better than JKR /generally/, of course there are a few more talented writers. But would fanfiction be better than what JKR wrote? No, precisely because they have not had the same input into the series that JKR has.
