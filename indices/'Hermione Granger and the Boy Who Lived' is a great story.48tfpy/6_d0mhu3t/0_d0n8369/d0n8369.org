  As long as you're using this aspect, you're leeching off the original author, and as long as you're doing that, your story can't ever be better than the original story.

This is an utter non-sequitur. Loaded and prejudicial language ("leeching"? Really?) aside, why does an author borrowing concepts from another story inherently limit the "goodness" of the product to that of the things being borrowed from?

For that matter, how would that even work for crossovers? Is the fanfic "limited" by the better of the crossed-over settings, the worse one, or an average of some sort? It's silly.
