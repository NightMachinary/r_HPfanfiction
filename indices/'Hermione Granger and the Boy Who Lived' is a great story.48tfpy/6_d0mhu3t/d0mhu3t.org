  I would say it's even better than canon.

Yeah...no.

No fanfic can ever be 'better' than canon. In fanfiction, you're using either the reader's connection to the world or the characters (or both, as it is in most cases). Creating this initial connection is one of the biggest challenges any author of original fiction has to face. But in fanfiction, this connection and familiarity is already there, created by the original author. As long as you're using this aspect, you're leeching off the original author, and as long as you're doing that, your story can't ever be /better/ than the original story.

I haven't read this story, but even if it is technically better written than canon (which I doubt), it can't be better than canon as long as it is using the characters Harry Potter and Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
