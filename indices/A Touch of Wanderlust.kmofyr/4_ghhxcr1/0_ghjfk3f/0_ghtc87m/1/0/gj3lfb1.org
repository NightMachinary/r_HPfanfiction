Thank you so much! I actually started this story at kind of an inconvenient time in my life (big exam in a week) so at the moment I have no schedule at all - definitely not one I'm confident enough in to tell you to stay up for the next chapter! The next update should be in a few days - it's about once a week. Once again, thanks for your kind words; they mean so much to me :)
