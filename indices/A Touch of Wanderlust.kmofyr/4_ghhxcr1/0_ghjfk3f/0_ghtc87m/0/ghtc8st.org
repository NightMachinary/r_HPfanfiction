[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13784563/1/][*/The Grand Tour of Messrs Potter and Riddle/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14441654/RoyalCamelot][/RoyalCamelot/]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary on his first trip into Diagon Alley and finally sees someone he can look up to. Unfortunately, he's not quite right -- at least, not yet. Follow the unlikely duo across all seven continents as they embark upon a Grand Tour, finding knowledge, adventure, and maybe, just maybe, something like family. NOT a Tom x Harry story!
