I love these sorts of fics! Literally just yesterday I started writing a fic with the premise that Harry finds Tom's diary when he first visits Diagon Alley with Hagrid; eventually, they're going to go on a globe-spanning adventure together in a teacher and student style fashion. Lots of shenanigans and scrapes abroad, with an emphasis on character development and growth. If that sounds good to you I could send you a link in a couple of days?
