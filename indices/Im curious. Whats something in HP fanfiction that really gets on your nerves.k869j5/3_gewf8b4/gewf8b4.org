- Making Harry cry so easily or giggle a lot. Please learn to write male characters

- bashing Percy. He's my favorite

- Or forgetting that Percy likes quidditch. So many fics write him as disliking it

- No matter what, even ir Harry is the son/adopted son of a dark family or something, he's almost always friends with Hermione
