Overpowered characters. You can make characters powerful just don't overdo it or make it out of nowhere.

Perfect Hermione

Muggle AUs. They're not bad themselves I just don't get the point in them since magic is literally the biggest part of the wizarding world. Though they're not awful they just annoy me a bit.

Slytherin muggle borns. I'm pretty sure muggleborns can't be in slytherin so there better be a good reason to have one in slytherin or it'll seem kinda Mary Sueish.

Almost like canon. Fanfics are supposed to be different from canon so it's annoying to see ones that are really close to canon with only a couple lines changed or whatever.
