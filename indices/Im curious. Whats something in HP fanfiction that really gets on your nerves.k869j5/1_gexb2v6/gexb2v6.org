▪Bashing in any form.

▪Hermione always ends up as Harry's friend but Ron is the jealous git you don't want to be friends with. Or post Hogwarts fics in which Ron isn't as important to Harry and Hermione as they are to each other. That especially gets on my nerves. Please no.

▪11 year olds that act like adults. Especially 11 year old Harry to Hermione "Miss Granger". Honestly, stop that shit please.

▪ Slytherin has special privileges

▪ Missunderstood Slytherins. They are not. In canon Draco and his group act like gits.

▪Snape and his dear Snakes.

▪Dumb Gryffindors, Adorable but stupid pet-like Hufflepuffs, and ok Ravenclaws (ties into Slytherin fics)
