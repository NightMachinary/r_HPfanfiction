-Bashing of characters in general

-Misunderstood Slytherins. They can change of course but you can't just erase the fact that they were bullies and racists with ‘misunderstood' and ‘didn't know any better'

Gringotts as this super helpful bank where you can remove compulsions and love potions and with a drop of blood you can find all your titles and lands and lordships

Stereotypes for characters based on their houses. (Ex Loud, bullies, dumb and introverts)

Snape as this nice misunderstood guy. I do enjoy a good Snape fic but I can't stand those fics which make him as some poor bullied kid who only joined Voldemort because he was being bullied by James and Sirius

WBWL fics where Lily and James abandon Harry. Lily died for Harry, as if she'd give him to an orphanage or Petunia.

Perfect!Genius!Prodigy Hermione and Dumb!Stupid!Ron

Good Lucius Malfoy. He tried to kill Muggleborns and gave a Horcrux to a 11 year old girl

When 11 year old outsmart 40+ year old politicians.

False Prophecy fics or it was made up by Dumbledore as scheme
