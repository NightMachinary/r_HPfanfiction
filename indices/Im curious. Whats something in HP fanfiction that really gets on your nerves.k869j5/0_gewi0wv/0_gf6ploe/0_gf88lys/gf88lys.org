I hate the PerfectPrincess!Hermione thing so much because they always end up taking away her edge and agency, and it really goddamn sucks. Hermione is arguably one of the most complex characters in the series. She is good and kind but also scary and definitely not nice. She believes in justice, and will crush anyone with no mercy if they go against that. She keeps reminding Harry that he isn't alone, but dear god, she's fucking terrible in asking for help or receiving it.

Just, Hermione isn't some perfect princess who sits there, does everything right, and has to be rescued. Arguably, she does most of the rescuing in the series with the exception of Harry himself. Hermione's canon self is brilliant and I always get so pissed when authors make her personality smaller than it is to be someone's perfect arm candy.
