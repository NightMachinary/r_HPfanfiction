I've never really seen any, but isn't that because Ron is the most anti-Ravenclaw character there is? You'd have to make him so OOC to be a ravenclaw it'd just be an OC.

Ravenclaw isn't even about being smart or intelligent, which Ron may be, but about thirsting for knowledge, about being studious, which is about as far from Ron Weasley as you can get.
