Being studious is Hufflepuff's thing actually, hard work and all that.

And while a love for learning is part of Ravenclaw's desired qualities, it's not the only one (Ron probably counts as having wit and a decent amount of widsom). Furthermore, learning is not just about academics, Luna is into weird things and isn't especially noted for being a straight-O student : Ron's love for quidditch could lead to learning a bunch of trivia, statistics and so on and you just don't become good at chess without loving learning new ways to play it.

And he would actually fit pretty well with a number a known Ravenclaws : the Ravenclaws of Harry's time are aither quidditch players (Cho Chang, Roger Davis), judgemental cliqey people (what happened to Luna) which Ron can be or really into their hobbies (Luna), wich Ron is with Quidditch and Chess.
