My point was that Ravenclaw seems to have space for a /lot/ of different kinds of intelligence, and it wouldn't take THAT much of a tweak from canon to put Ron - who has an excellent mind for strategy and problem solving...we know he's great at chess, in the later books he makes observations which *Hermione* of all people considers "brilliant", and it's him who does a lot of problem solving on the fly; he found Harry in the room of requirement, he found the brooms that saved them from the fiendfyre, and it was his idea to use basilisk fangs to destroy the Horcrux - in it.

Honestly, I think you could put any of the trio in any of the houses.
