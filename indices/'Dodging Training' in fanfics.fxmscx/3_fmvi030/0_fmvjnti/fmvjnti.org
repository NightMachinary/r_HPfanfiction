It is canon, actually. In the graveyard duel, Harry jumps behind a tombstone and Voldemort's Killing Curse misses him.

Whether that is dodging after a spell is cast or dodging as it is cast to be a harder target does not matter. Moving to be harder to hit is canon and works even against Voldemort.
