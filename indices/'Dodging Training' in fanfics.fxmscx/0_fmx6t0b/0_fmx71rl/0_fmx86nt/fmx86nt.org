Rich people could pick any difficult art, ballet for example, to make their kids look distinctively rich and cultured. There's no reason they would pick ballet over other arts, though.

I dance in a lot of different styles, and it's always funny to see a dancer who obviously has ballet training trying to dance in some other style, since they're generally very bad at it. Ballet turnout is inappropriate and looks stupid when applied to other dance forms. Ballet training doesn't confer generic physical grace, it just marks someone as having paid for a lot of ballet training.
