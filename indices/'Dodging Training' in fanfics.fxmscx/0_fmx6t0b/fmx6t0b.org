Do they? That's odd. Ballroom dance is a modern muggle invention.

I can see wizards having their own dance traditions, possibly in common with pre-Statute of Secrecy muggles. But if wizards want their kids to be good at dueling, they'd give them dueling lessons. It's standard for rich muggle kids to get martial arts lessons, so it should be standard for rich wizard kids to get training in wizarding martial arts.
