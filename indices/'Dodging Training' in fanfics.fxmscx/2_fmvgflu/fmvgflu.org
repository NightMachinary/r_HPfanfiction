I have my doubts on the efficacy of dodging in magical combat. Besides that, I doubt authors who view dancing as practical for dodging practice thought it through beyond "this would be cool". Ballet would most certainly not be a good way to train dodging. Seriously, excellent pointe technique is not going to save you from a killing curse to the chest. I suspect it also allows authors to bring in some pureblood superiority doctrine for wish fulfillment.
