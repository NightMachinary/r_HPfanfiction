I don't know if it's the portrayal of racism in media or the divide in modern society between progressives and everyone else that makes people view it this way. But racists aren't necessarily one-dimensional haters of everyone different. One can absolutely be a racist without being a homophobe or a misogynist.

And racism can be insidious. I'd actually argue that it's more often insidious than overt. The most outwardly normal people can be horrible racists, and you would never know from a casual interaction.
