Okay, I phrased things in an unclear fashion: The most active and overt racists - whether it's black pointy-hooded robes and silver masks, white pointy-hooded robes and white masks, or swastikas and stars-and-bars with tiki torches - tend to be very particular about who falls under the heading of "us" or "real people". Sure, they probably have one distinction that they focus on most heavily, but they don't tend to restrict themselves to just that focus.

Also, the misogyny of bigots tends to be less overt than their other facets: If you actually look at the kind of stuff they say to themselves, each other, and outsiders, you discover that sex and/or reproduction are frequently the linchpin of their issues. Most of the most active, vitriolic, and violent bigots are male, and they often have a lot to say about how these [insert epithet here] are stealing and/or raping women. They're of the delusional belief that they themselves are highly desirable, and so obviously the reason that they're not getting the sex they're entitled to is because it's being denied them by others, not because they're the human equivalent of what I'd scrape off my shoes would scrape off its shoes. It certainly can't be because women have agency and bodily autonomy. Also, since they're so desirable it's obvious that gay men will harass and/or assault them if given the chance, because that's what such bigots would do to attractive women if they could.
