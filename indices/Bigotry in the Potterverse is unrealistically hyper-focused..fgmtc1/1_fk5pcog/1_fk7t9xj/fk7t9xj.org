Even Umbitch is never shown dumping on Lee, Dean, Angelina, Alicia, Padma, Parvati, Cho, Su Li, or Kingsley for their ethnicity. Nobody in canon is shown to be LGBTQ+ and so there's obviously no bigotry shown towards that demographic either. Ditto for religion. Overall women seem to be treated at least as equally as in modern society, though obviously we don't see their pay slips or know what their male superiors/coworkers say and do out of the public eye.

So all we see is anti-muggle, blood-purism, human-centrism, and classism. For the kind of bigot that goes so far as to engage in organized violence and/or organize an act of genocide, that's a pretty paltry list. IRL bigots of that level of extremity tend to go all-in and "other" pretty much everybody that's not just like themselves.
