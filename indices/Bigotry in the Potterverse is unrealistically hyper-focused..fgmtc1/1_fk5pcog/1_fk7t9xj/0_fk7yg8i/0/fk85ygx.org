By and large they tend to use their religion as an excuse to say/do/believe what they already wanted to. Sure, some are indoctrinated to believe "God/Jesus/Allah/Whoever wants you to hate X", but that's mostly kids; by the time they grow up, they're likely to either internalize the ideology and all its supposed justifications or recognize it as the crock of shit that it actually is. What people get out of their religion depends mostly on what they put in and what they're looking for.
