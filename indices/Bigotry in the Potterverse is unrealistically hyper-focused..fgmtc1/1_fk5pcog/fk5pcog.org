This is Dolores Umbridge erasure.

Voldemort was able to take advantage of werewolves and giants because they were bitter about being ostracized. Madam Maxime lies and has a negative reaction to being called 'a half giantess.' You have a werewolf registry and Remus flees in DH when Scimgeour comes calling.

The Weasleys are the 'trash' of the wizarding world because they are poor.
