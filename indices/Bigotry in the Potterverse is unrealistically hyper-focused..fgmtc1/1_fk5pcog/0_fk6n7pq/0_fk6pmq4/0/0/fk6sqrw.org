A blood-traitor is a pureblood who sympathizes and/or associates with muggles. The Potters were blood traitors. As were the Prewetts and Longbottoms. We know that the Potters and Prewetts were upper middle/upper class. However, the Weasleys were poor, which is the difference between Lucretia, Callidora, and Dorea marrying who they did vs Cedrella.

Why would Fudge and Slughorn outright mock Arthur/the Weasleys in front of Harry Potter? It was only that Ginny hexed Zacharias that got Sluggy's attention. The vast majority of the Slug Club were wealthy and connected students.
