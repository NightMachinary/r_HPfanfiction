Oh dear... I totally missed it. Quite a coincidence. My bad. I apologise to everyone for bringing it up back again, I was not aware. It somehow slipped my attention, probably because it was way lower than normal for new threads. It only has 1 upvote so far.

I dunno about your answer. I can understand the afterlife argument, it makes sense. Wizards know that afterlife exists (ghosts). I'm not sure about your comments regarding devotion though. Most insular communities tend to become very spiritual and religious (call it God, Manitou or Flying Spaghetti Monster). I can see the same happening to the wizarding world. I mean THEY can control reality. Muggles can't. THEY can do things similar to the prophets and gods of different religions.

You see where I'm heading?
