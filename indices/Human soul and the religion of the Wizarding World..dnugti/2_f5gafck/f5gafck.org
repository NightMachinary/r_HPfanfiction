You know there is already [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dnks4a/discussion_a_question_of_faith/][a thread about this,]] it hasnt been even 18 hours since it was posted.

I am just going to post my answer from the other thread.

  I think Abrahamic religions make most sense for wizards.

  The worship of Pagan Gods usually had some purpose in mind that a wizard could easily achieve with magic, like there is no reason to pray for success in something when magic already guarantees it.

  With Abrahamic religions the promised reward lie in the afterlife, which wizards know nothing about beyond its existence, they are also as religions go much more well suited for international communities rather than pagan gods which were often bound locally.

  And I doubt atheism would really be a thing among wizards since they still have a lot of questions about the universe like where everything comes from or what happens after Death, while at the same time they know that the supernatural is absolutely real and that muggle science is wrong, so they have lots of religions which offer a variety of (potential)answers to these questions.

  I don't believe everyone is very devout though, I just think that while they would in general believe in god, they would only really practice religion when its convenient and probably have some interpretation of holy books that are somewhat less strict.
