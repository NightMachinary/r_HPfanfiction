  They separated in the 17th century, at the time when the majority of Europe was Christian in one way or the other (apart from Muslims in the Empire and various minorities). So if we consider a pure historical perspective, as canon lays it down, then the wizarding world in Britain should be very much Church of England (Catholics are disenfranchised for instance, poor Seamus).

This conclusion does not follow at all. Wizard can never have been fully integrated into muggle society.

Hogwarts, for example, would have been in hostile territory for most of its student body for one time or another if muggle borders ever mattered to wizards.

Pureblood ideology predates those times as well. How is it imaginable one of those wizards accepted a muggle king ruling over them? Wizards have /far too much/ power to be ruled over by someone without the same abilities.

Every influental position in society would have been held by someone with the ability to control others with a flick of their wand if those wizards would have cared to do so. There would never have been a witch hunt if the king and the pope would have been wizards.

The only model of wizarding-muggle history that would vaguely hold up to any scrutiny is that wizards never /bothered/ with ruling the masses, preventing famines, winning wars, healing the sick.. And that only makes sense if they were up to their own thing most of the time.

You didn't meet the local witch in your sunday mass or by waving over your garden fence to your neighbour. You sought her out in her remote little cabin in the woods where she and her coven were minding their own business.

Sure, they celebrate a gift-giving holiday they call christmas. Just like easter, these are just repackaged versions of whatever the previous society already celebrated.

If the wizarding world were christian, we would have noticed.
