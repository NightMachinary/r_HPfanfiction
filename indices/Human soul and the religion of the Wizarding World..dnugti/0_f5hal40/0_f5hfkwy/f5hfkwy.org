It's a very interesting point, but I think you ignore one very poignant issue, mainly that the 17th century and before were not the modern world. You equate history to current reality, which is a fundamental error. People in the year 1000 AD had a very different view of the world than you do now. Hell, people from the early 1900s had a very different view of the world than you do know. Current cultural biases have no place in historical analysis.

Pureblood ideology is a non-issue in this context. It's mostly a clannish problem, not a religious or even cultural one. If the wizards were just living among muggles, as canon leads us to believe (remember that), then the differences in culture would be minimal. They spoke the same language, they bought the same food on the market, they drank the same beer in the tavern, etc. The only problems with muggleborns, would be the same as in canon (that they come from non-magic).

In fact, you can see the British historical world in JKR's wizarding one (which is of course intentional).

And yes, if there was no separation then you would meet your local witch on Sunday Mass. It just stands to reason.

I can give you credit, that I can believe in some reclusive society of wizards that didn't want to interact with the predominantly Christian muggles in the 1600s and went into hiding. But that would require no muggleborns, which were a point of contention back in the 1000s, no contact with muggles and no cultural contamination. It would also require wizards to not use Latin, which they do. All the Romans left in the 400s AD on the Isles were Christian, there's no escaping that.
