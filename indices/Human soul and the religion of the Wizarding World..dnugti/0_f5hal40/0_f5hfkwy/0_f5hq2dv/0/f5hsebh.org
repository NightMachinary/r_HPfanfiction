ehhh what? Middle English most likely. Old English in the early medieval period. French was only used by the invading nobility after 1066 and was quite quickly abandoned in normal parlance. Gaelic and Welsh was mostly used by local and national minorities, not common when you wanted to trade. Latin was the Church language and the language of the intellectuals.

I don't understand your objections. It's like you don't realise the realities of a pre-modern world.
