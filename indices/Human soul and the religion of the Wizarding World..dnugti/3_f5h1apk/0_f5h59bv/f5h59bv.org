I agree. Most fanfiction authors have no idea about mysticism or religion in general. The origins of religion in culture (heaven forbid) or the apparent necessity of religion throughout history (even more heretical) are concepts foreign to them.

That's why I made this thread. So that I could gauge the level of awareness on the issue, since it's very important to proper world building in many fanfics.
