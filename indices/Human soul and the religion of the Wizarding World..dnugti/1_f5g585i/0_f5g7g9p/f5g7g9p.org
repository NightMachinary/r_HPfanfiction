JKR was very unspecific about the witch hunts, which causes some confusion in the fandom. At first it was Wendelin the Weird route, when they were mostly ineffectual. Later, when she went the revisionist route (Black Hermione, Gay Dumbledore, Cursed Child etc.) she stated that they fled persecution. So I don't think it's a strong argument, since it's self contradictory. Damn JKR make up your mind for once.

As to spells mimicking what Jesus did. I agree that many miracles in the Bible could be magical in origin. Apart from the raising the dead and resurrection.

I can totally buy an atheist Wizarding world. It makes sort of sense with their power over reality. But, again quoting historical precedent, wouldn't they think they are God's chosen people even more?
