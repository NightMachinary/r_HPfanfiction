First point. No. Harry was learning that as part of History of Magic course in his second year. At that age you are just learning the main points not the nuances. Therefore she was the image that the teacher wanted to plant in the minds of his students. So your argument makes no sense. If they were effective, they wouldn't teach 12 year olds about Wendelin the Weird. It makes no sense. It's like teaching children that war is very nice and nobody died, ever.

??? I don't know if you read the same Bible I did, but even Voldemort would struggle to replicate some of the feats that are mentioned there. Parting the sea? The most we saw wizards do is making a small stream of water appear from their wand. Turning a river into blood? Killing every first-born in the entire nation? Resurrecting people from the dead? Yeah, you're just plain wrong.

As to adopting their religion and belief. In canon, there was no separation between muggles and wizards before the Statute. Which is late 17th century. Considering the muggleborns that would constantly enter the society and the fact that wizards celebrate Christmas, it's evident that wizards and muggles before the Statute were a single people, with very similar beliefs (at least according to canon).
