Not the only pertinent part but okay.

Except there are? Them changing witches and wizards to celebrate Yule implies that they did not celebrate Christmas even before the Statute and I don't see any problem with that.

You claim you see a problem with it which is fair, I can't discuss it though because I don't know what those problems are that you see and I would believe that the writers don't see a problem with it too because it would be an implied change that doesn't require too much if any discussion.

The only real problem I see with it is what you brought up about wizards being slower to change, I don't see that as a problem if the wizarding world never started celebrating Christmas or any of the religions that do celebrate it which would be implied.
