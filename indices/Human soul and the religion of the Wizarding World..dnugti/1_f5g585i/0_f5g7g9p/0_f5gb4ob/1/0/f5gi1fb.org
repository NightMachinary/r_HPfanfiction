  No. Harry was learning that as part of History of Magic course in his second year. At that age you are just learning the main points not the nuances. Therefore she was the image that the teacher wanted to plant in the minds of his students. So your argument makes no sense. If they were effective, they wouldn't teach 12 year olds about Wendelin the Weird. It makes no sense.

Why not? You teach them about it all, and mention that one such method was ineffective because of the flame-freezing spell. We get a very small glimpse into the course itself, for all we know the witch hunts were bad and Harry was narrating that part specifically because witch burning is a big part and that was the one part that was ineffective (edit: that he didn't know about). At no point were we specifically told that the witch hunts were ineffective, just that burning a witch was pointless. It could be something like this

Main Points:

- Witch Hunts - was a bad time in history (no reason he would narrate it, witch hunting was a prevalent thing in the muggle world too)
- Witch Burnings - part of the witch hunt, ineffective because flame-freezing.

There main point, both get taught, not contradictory. I'm not saying you're wrong that the witch hunts were ineffective, I'm just saying you have no basis for that and it isn't contradictory by Rowling claiming wizards chose to flee the hunts despite witch burnings not being effective.

  I don't know if you read the same Bible I did, but even Voldemort would struggle to replicate some of the feats that are mentioned there. Parting the sea? The most we saw wizards do is making a small stream of water appear from their wand. Turning a river into blood? Killing every first-born in the entire nation? Resurrecting people from the dead? Yeah, you're just plain wrong.

Like I said I don't know the bible too well so I'll just hit on your points.

- Parting the sea, why not? You say all we saw is making a small stream of water appear, but that isn't remotely the same thing. I'd have to double check if its in the book, but in the movies, Dumbledore took control of the water and created a sphere to surround Voldemort, who says he couldn't have just parted the water as well he could control it.
- River into blood, one word: Transfiguration
- Killing every first-born - how is that not replicatable? I'm not sure how that was done, but I mean it seems pretty replicatable with enough followers, as shitty as that sounds.
- Resurrecting people from the dead? That's fair, but it could just be an exaggeration. If they were making fun of muggles and making them believe in the Bible, why wouldn't they sound far-fetched at points? So no I am not "plain wrong"

I'm not even going to touch your last point because I don't really care enough about what the religion is and don't see the problem of pagan witches and wizards that you seem to find with it. The only thing I'll say about it is that just because they celebrate Christmas in canon, doesn't mean fanfiction can't change it up and choose to have them be pagan and change the history because that is the point of fanfiction.
