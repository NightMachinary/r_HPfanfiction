Even if the witch burnings were a huge problem, every culture edits their history a bit to make it look more palatable.

Wizards see themselves as vastly superior to muggles, of course they would focus the narrative on what make them look better.

I'm also very unconvinced magical people were ever truly integrated into normal society. What we know of our muggle-world history is either heavily censored or magic just never had a lot of influence. And that can only ever have been by choice of those who could have ruled countries with a flick of their wand and won wars with another one, while healing epidemies and preventing famines left and right..
