Witch hunts were ineffectual against powerful witches like Wendelin, but not against everyone. Muggleborns, children, anyone not capable of a wandless flame freezing charm would be in trouble. Maybe a flame freezing potion or powder would be invented to make surviving a witch hunt easier. Maybe with a built in escape feature.
