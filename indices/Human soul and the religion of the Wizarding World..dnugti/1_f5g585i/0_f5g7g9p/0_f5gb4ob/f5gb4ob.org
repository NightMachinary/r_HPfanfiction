  At first it was Wendelin the Weird route, when they were mostly ineffectual. Later, when she went the revisionist route (Black Hermione, Gay Dumbledore, Cursed Child etc.) she stated that they fled persecution. So I don't think it's a strong argument, since it's self contradictory

How is it self contradictory? There would be more than one way to effectuate the witch hunts, Wendelin the Weird was a comment that made the burnings ineffectual, that does not say that witch hunting was ineffectual.

  But, again quoting historical precedent, wouldn't they think they are God's chosen people even more?
#+end_quote

Why would they? I don't know the Bible extremely well, but from what I do know, nearly everything in it, the witches and wizards likely are able to do, bar creation of earth (and even that might be shaky). They could just think that the Bible was some witch/wizard messing with the muggles.

  So if we consider a pure historical perspective, as canon lays it down, then the wizarding world in Britain should be very much Church of England
#+end_quote

How did you come to that conclusion? Just because they lived with with muggles doesn't mean they have to adopt their belief or religion.
