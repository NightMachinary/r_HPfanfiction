Personally, I've always separated it from modern religion by making it my headcanon that the Greek/Roman Pantheons are the accepted religions. With Hecate/Hekate (I know many think its Trivia, but apparently, Trivia lost the Magic part and Hekate and Hecate are the same, except in different forms - Greek and Roman. This reminds me of PJO/HoO).
