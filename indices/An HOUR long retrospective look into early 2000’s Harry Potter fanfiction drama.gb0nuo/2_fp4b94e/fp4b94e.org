I was a Gryffindor Tower lurker in those days and I had nooo idea all this was happening. I remember being incredibly sad about how and not understanding why it had closed down but this video finally explained why! I had noidea all this was going on... and I'm glad I didn't! I was a 14yo male, getting swept up in middle-aged women drama would've sucked!

The video is really well presented too. I was hooked and watched it all in one sitting last night. 10/10, would recommend if you were even tangentially in the fandom at the time.
