I've been reading fanfiction since before Order of the Phoenix, Cassandra Claire wrote the very first one I ever read and at the time my mind was blown. I didn't know what fanfiction was and I was led to believe that it was a leaked copy of OotP. I only figured out that it wasn't like 5 or 6 chapters in. I thought it was amazing at the time. I tried to reread the draco ones a few years abo and couldn't get even half way through before I gave it up. It doesn't hold up well.

Edit, just watching that video now, damn I was around, but as a 14ish year old didn't give a shit, when some of this stuff was going down. I remember when one of the only active forums to find Harry Potter fanfiction was on fiction alley. I also remember eagerly awaiting updates for After the End, a H/G fic from two of the authors mentioned in that video, the ones who started Sugar Quill. This is all making me feel old.
