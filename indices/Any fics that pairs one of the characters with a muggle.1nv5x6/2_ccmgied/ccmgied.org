Two others occurred to me, but in both cases the muggle-magical relationship isn't the main pairing.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper][Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper]] by clell65619 tells the story of a Harry leaving one world where he just beat the bad guy, only to fall into a new one where pureblood supremacy had taken hold long before. It's a great dystopia with some Very Terrible Things having changed or broken most canon characters. The muggle relationship only shows up in the last few chapters.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][The Refiner's Fire]] by Abraxan is a classic story (and sequel) that starts with Harry working in a local shop over the summer and falling for the shopkeeper's daughter. It has some great character moments within that context, but later evolves into a major uber!Harry epic.

As with most things I recommend, Caveat Lector.
