  It's the summer after the Department of Mysteries and Harry Potter's about to do something drastic, something nobody expects, and he may not be alone. Following the lives of Harry and the Order as they battle against each other.

Its basically a story where Harry runs away with a muggle girl to escape the war. Very Angsty, and as you can tell, kinda a lyric fic. Maybe a little too based off the movie if you can tell by the title.
