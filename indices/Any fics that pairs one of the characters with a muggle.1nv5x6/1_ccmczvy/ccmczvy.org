There is a post-Hogwarts fic whose name I am struggling to remember, but the premise is that Harry left the wizarding world, and has (at the beginning of the fic), been called back to it. His wife, one of the major characters of the fic, is a muggle. I believe the catalyst for his return is that his eldest child is magical.
