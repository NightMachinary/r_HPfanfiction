I've always had a chuckle thinking about Sprout's "secret" greenhouse where she grows certain plants for "medicinal use only", which explains why she's always so happy and giggly.

Basically I see her as Hogwart's Medicinal Marijuana dispensary. She get's a lot of business towards the end of the year from fifth and seventh years because of "stress".

It's probably not a hugely popular idea but it always makes me smile.
