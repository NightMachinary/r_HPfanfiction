I really liked Flitwick's characterization in "The Birthday Present" (a very long Snape Centric fic). Flitwick is a champion duelist and (iirc) a former secrect agent during the war against Grindelwald. He likes to tell Snape stories where he (Flitwick) seems like a ladies' man.

Which is to say, generally any fic in which Flitwick is very competent, and has any personality that seems somewhat plausibly dealing with him compensating for his height is good by me if its pulled off well.

(I mean, I like to think that Hogwarts actually has a lot of really competent people teaching, with Hagrid, Trelawney, and the DADA professors being the exception to this rule).
