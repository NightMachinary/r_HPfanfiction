Well, I probably ought to start with a bit of context. A few months back I started writing a "Dumbledore killed Voldemort in first year thing aka. The trap worked." It had a Harry that grew up with Sirius and his views on girls and sex. Sirius starts a thing with Aurora, resulting in some subplot to Harry's rise as a great wizard artificer.

Anyway, prepare for me rambling.

Aurora likes Russian Pumpkin, which is a longdrink made from pumkin juice and vodka. She enjoys english breakfast, but prefers mediteranean food overall. She also doesn't say no to the occasional hookah/shisha smoke.

Her hobbies include some study into african magics, especially pre-colonial magic. She also delights in the occasional broomride. She doesn't own a pet, per se, but she has opened her house to a family of fairies who occupy the upper part of a cupboard. She is a Holyhead Harpies fan and goes to their games whenever possible.

Before she started teaching at Hogwarts, she was studying the impact of different stars around the globe on a set of potions, charms and rituals. The following essay made her a well known name among the magic theorists and astronomers, as she pointed out the interesting small differences that stars of the Northern and Southern hemisphere have on certain magic practice. She also theorizes that some unique uses of magic around the globe are partly because of the different stars. She is also highly interested in what magic is released during an eclipse, but finds it hard to research. She has a sceptic view on centaur star-seers, but refrains from a definite opinion due to the little knowledge of the practice. She merely states that if its a constellation based seeing, she could easily predict what centaurs see throughout the year.

She owns a house on the Faroe Islands which she uses during holidays and long weekends. She grew up in London, but has a profound dislike of big cities, or rather, light pollution. Her parents live in Norway. They fled during the first Voldemort War because of the stigma on her mothers heritage.

The single most life altering moment she ever experienced was to see the footage of the moon landing by the muggles and especially to see Earth from the moon. Since then she is a constant reader of NASA publications. However, her knowledge of muggle astronomy is her well kept secret due to the bigoted views in the wizard astronomical society. In secret she also researches what it could mean that some stars were dead for millions of years before their light even reached the earth, or what the magical difference between the light of a galaxy, a star and a supernova is. She is also the one who gives Harry the idea to use magic to colonize Mars, as a way to ensure the magicals survival in an increasingly connected muggle world.

During the story, Harry sees her coming and going to and from Lonesome Rock Cottage (the house he and Sirius live in) until eventually before Harry's fourth year, Aurora Sinistra becomes Aurora Black. She has found her equal in Sirius after almost a decade of one-nighters and short relationships. She is a very independent woman and found that Sirius likes it just like that. Aurora never planned to have children, but gives birth to Apollonia and Leonidas Black just after the Triwizard.

I'm not sure if I left something out. If you're still interested, ask.
