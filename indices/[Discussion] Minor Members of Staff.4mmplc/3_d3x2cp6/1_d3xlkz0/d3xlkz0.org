Sinistra has a subject that seems extremely well planned out. I mean, it's the study of something that changes night to night and can be predicted. Wouldn't she have planned everything out for the entire school year? I imagine she's only teaching like a few days a week to very specific classes and certain astronomical transits. Perhaps she doesn't live at the castle full time and hangs out in a cool weird part of muggle Glasgow when she doesn't want to worry about seeing the stars and maybe has a strange hairless cat and eats easily digestible vegetarian food.
