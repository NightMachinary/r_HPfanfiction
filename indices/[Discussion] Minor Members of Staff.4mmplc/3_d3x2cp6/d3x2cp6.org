My unfiltered headcanon (and be aware, theres some stupid shit in there):

Aurora Sinistra: Smoking and aware of it. Is a good teacher, patient and understanding, especially towards the younger years that really take a beating with the late nights. She has the habit of taking midday naps for a few hours to get to the full 8 hours per day. Has on and off flicks with former students. Is half-blooded (muggleborn mother from Kenia) and pureblood father from Britain.

Charity Burbage: Mousy and shy woman, pureblood, with a love for stories and fairytales. Completely uninterested in what muggles actually do, but very interested in what stories they tell. Constantly mixes up muggle movies, books and reality in her lessons, making the whole course a farce of very basic factual knowledge with basically made-up advanced knowledge. Shes a moon-landing truther. No kids, no husbands, but a loyal owl.

Vector: As far as her job goes, she is the "good", female version of Snape. Extremely talented in her field of study, but somewhat unskilled when it comes to teaching it. Blatantly takes favorites among her students and tries to get those out of her class that she has not much hope for. She is know for her strict gaze of unblinking eyes. Has offered several times to take over Divination as well, since she also holds a NEWT in that field. (My headcanon: Arithmancy = Divination with Numbers). Is somewhat personally insulted that her offer wasn't accepted, given the state of the Divination lessons. Owns a kneezle. Her grandfathers name was Vektor, as she is of german decent. Name was changed to something "more english" during the war against Grindelwald during wich the Vektors were refugees.

Trelawney: Next to the stuff we know, she suffers slight madness due to her visions and her inability to remember them. Shes not a seer, but an Oracle, as she needs to be in trance to see the glimpses of the future. She knows that she made prophecies, even though she can't remember them and that drives her crazy. She tries to force them by over and over repeating what she thinks are trigger words in front of important people. Suffers from severe depression and the occasional panic attack after normal slips of the mind, because she fears that she, once again, made a prophecy without remembering. Due to her complete inability to actually force visions through techniques of Divination, she has developed a great, private hate against her heritage from the talented great-great-grandmother Cassandra. Alcoholic and avid drug user during longer holidays.

So... for the rest I don't really have a headcanon. Those four were just those I once used as characters in an idea.
