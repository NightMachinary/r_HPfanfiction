There are lots of such fics, but the real trick is to find ones that don't rehash the canon:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily got Voldemort with a nasty trap and raised Harry by themselves. This Harry has never gone to Hogwarts and has never made friends with the usual suspects. It's a dark war epic with a very original plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Harry was adopted by Grindelwald when he was ten. He only turned up for Hogwarts in Year 7.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Harry ran away at age 6 and was adopted by the Grangers. He and Hermione grew up as siblings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/][The Daring Win]], linkffn(12005755): Harry is raised by Dolores Umbridge, and that has a major effect on his personality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy emerged as the big winner following Voldemort's defeat in 1981. Dumbledore and his remaining followers retreated to France, and Harry is raised by Sirius there. He went to Beauxbaton with Neville and the Weasleys. 18 years later, they are going to have their revenge.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Gilderoy Lockhard found baby Harry on Dursley's doorsteps. Consequently, Harry has become a cunning memory charm expert.
