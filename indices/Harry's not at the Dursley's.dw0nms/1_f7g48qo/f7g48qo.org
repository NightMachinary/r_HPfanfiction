The Dogfather by hollimichele. The Dursleys call the cops and pretend they don't know who Harry is. The only piece of the note left has Harry's first name on it. Harry is adopted by a loving muggle couple and the fic covers from this to the end of his first year. Like the name suggests, Sirius gets involved early. Wolfstar, subtle at first, then not so subtle.
