If you like dry/British humour, linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) is loaded with it. Also contains a very in-character Snape redemption arc.

#+begin_quote
  Snide or not, Snape's commentary on Harry's abysmal Potions skills actually was good advice, if you ignored almost everything he said.

linkffn(What's Her Name In Hufflepuff) is generally known for being a well-executed self-insert fic, but it also has a wicked little sense of humour.

#+begin_quote
  A woman was in trouble at the Ministry for trying to illegally cross-breed pegasuses and unicorns. Well, that woman was just doing God's work as far as I'm concerned.

And for not-entirely-crack-honest, linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary) warrants a mention. Luna comes across the Diary and starts writing to Tom, but how is he supposed to become stronger on a diet of plans to find fump-gizer nests around the castle, and instructions to lure mossy nymphs?
