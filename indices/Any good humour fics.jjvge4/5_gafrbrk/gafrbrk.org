*Through the Veil* - linkffn(13206329)\\
Harry and Ron devise a crackpot plan (that somehow works!) to go back in time. Pretty funny. Goes full-on crack in the epilogue. House Yeet represent!

*Back At Ya* - linkffn(11341834)\\
Harry summons a vengeance demon. Everything goes great.

*Itachi, Is That a Baby?* - linkffn(11634921)\\
Naruto parody/crack. Girl Tobi is the best.

*Gryffindors Never Die* - linkffn(6452481)\\
Bromance! Alcoholics mysteriously go back in time.

*Triwizard Tales* - linkffn(7594305)\\
Harry/Susan - Crack. The Triwizard goes in Harry's favor. He becomes godfather to a clutch of dragons.

*Coven of the Rose* - linkffn(2974749)\\
Harry becomes the Prank Lord with a house elf army.

*Reunion* - linkffn(4655545)\\
Harry/Susan/Luna/Hermione go back in time to fix everything. And to get Revenge. Humor/Crack

*Defendat erit scientia* - linkao3(22273192)\\
Petunia remarries to Mycroft Holmes (crossover). Pre-Hogwarts adventures of Harry, Hermione, and Dudley. Yes, Dudley is magical. Yes, Hermione has a Garden Gnome Army. Yes, said army has an airborne regiment. The grammar is a little wonky, but it's still readable.

*That Universe Over There* - linkao3(23702959)\\
MOD!Harry jumps universes. Appears in front of a girl on top of a school. Yoink. Yes, that's this Universe's analogue of him. He raises her. He's super powerful, has a bunch of lordships, and the goblins want to help him. What's wrong with this picture? He's antisocial, he wants to be left alone, and the Goblins smile all the time, which frankly scares him.
