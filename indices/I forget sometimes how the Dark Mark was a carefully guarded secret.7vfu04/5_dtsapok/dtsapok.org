In addition, I imagine the Dark Mark has powers we have not been told of. We know that it can be used for communication between Voldemort and his Death Eaters (to inform them of the apparition destination) and between Death Eaters themselves (Snape and Alecto, DH). We know that Voldemort has special means of finding his Death Eaters, presumably through the Mark. And in HBP, it is hinted that the mark allows them to ignore certain spell barriers and curses too:

  “I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn't there,” said Lupin. “I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville...”

  “He must have known a spell we didn't,” whispered McGonagall. “After all --- he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who'd escaped up to the tower...”

  “He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not to stop them... *and I'll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier* --- so what happened when he came back down?”
