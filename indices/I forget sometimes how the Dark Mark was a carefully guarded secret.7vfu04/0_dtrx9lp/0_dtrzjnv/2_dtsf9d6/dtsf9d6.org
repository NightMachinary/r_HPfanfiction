Well, I don't think there's anything definitive... you have two choices:

1) The ministry and Wizarding Britain is completely retarded, didn't stripsearch the Death Eaters they incarcerated after the war and didn't ask any pertinent questions under Veritaserum to anyone (this is actually quite plausible, considering that Sirius has been locked up)

2) They knew.
