Oh no, more fuel for manipulative!Dumbledore...

Oh right and in the early 80's Sirius was already arrested and the Potters were already dead. That stuff happened in '80 or '81 I'm pretty sure lol. So they weren't looking for the spy because they assumed it was Sirius. Although that doesn't explain why they didn't use the Mark after the war ended. I assume Riddle marked some non death eaters so that his followers could say they were imperiused if they were caught.
