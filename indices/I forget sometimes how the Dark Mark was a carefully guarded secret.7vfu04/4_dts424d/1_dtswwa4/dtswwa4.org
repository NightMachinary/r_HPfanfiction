So like a Death Eater tramp stamp? :D

Just kidding, there are a few places where the tattoo could go that wouldn't be weird, like the chest (the allegory to the dark mark replacing the heart could be made). But I still think having the dark mark on the hand is a good choice, you could simply have it not appear unless certain requirements are met, like the Death Eater forcing it to appear or a summons from Voldemort. Maybe only those who carry the mark can see it, like only those who have witnessed death can see Thestrals. Kind of how the writings on the One Ring in LOTR faded away and only appeared when cast into a fire.

Something to think about, but I'm confident you will do it justice.
