Yeah, I always assumed the Dark Mark business only got revealed near the end or after the end of the first war. It doesn't seem like something Voldemort would want people to know about.

In my story, I'm thinking of having Voldemort create the mark on another part of the body once he gets resurrected, since many would know about it by that point. That way, new Death Eaters wouldn't get found out so easily.
