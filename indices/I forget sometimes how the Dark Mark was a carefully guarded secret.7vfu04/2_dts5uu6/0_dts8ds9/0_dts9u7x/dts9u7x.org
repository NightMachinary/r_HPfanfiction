From book 4

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort bent down, and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo -- a skull, with a snake protruding from its mouth -- the same image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping.

  ‘It is back,' he said softly, ‘they will all have noticed it ... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...' He pressed his long, white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm.

  The scar on Harry's forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl: Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's Mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.
