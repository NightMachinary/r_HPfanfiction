It doesn't make sense for it to be visible all the time. Even if we assume that they aren't widely known about, they're still the Dark Mark, and having it tattooed on one's arm would certainly raise red flags.

I always imagined that it burns black when summoned, and fades away afterwards. It being bright red on Wormtail after Voldemort regained his body would be down to it reawakening as he grew stronger throughout GoF.
