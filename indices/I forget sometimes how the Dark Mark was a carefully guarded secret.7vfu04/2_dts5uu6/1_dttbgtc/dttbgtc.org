From the context in canon, I think they had basically faded away after Voldemort's body died in '81. During GoF, they were coming back, peaking just after Voldemort regained his body. Then he Summoned the Death Eaters, and it burned black.

Presumably, when not being actively summoned, they fade entirely, otherwise they'd be something of a dead giveaway given that every wizard knows what the dark mark looks like. Even if their existence on Death Eaters isn't known, having the Dark Mark tattooed would raise a red flag.
