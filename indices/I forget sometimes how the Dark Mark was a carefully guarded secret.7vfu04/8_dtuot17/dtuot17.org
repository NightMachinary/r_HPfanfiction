The Dark Mark was meant to be a sign that the person who has it is a member of Voldemort's inner circle and is trusted far above the rank and file Death Eaters. So only really important members like Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix LeStrange, Augustus Rookwood e.t.c. should have them.

So many fics get this wrong, the writer giving the Dark Mark to every Death Eater, even the freshly recruited grunts.

It's meant to be /earned/ not given away.
