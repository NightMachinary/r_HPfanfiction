The only way the Dark Mark can work is if it isn't visible at all times. Whether wizardom knows about the Dark Mark on Death Eaters, they definitely know the symbol. Seeing that on someone's forearm is going to raise red flags.

Snape even tells us as much when he shows the Mark to Fudge. He says it's faded since the Summoning, but it's still visible. Presumably, given more time, it'd fade completely until the next Summoning.
