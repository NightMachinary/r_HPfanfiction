Linkffn(darkness ascendant) it's in the name, though Harry delving into the Dark Arts won't be until after school and it'll be mostly unpracticed. (edit: since it's mine, while I believe it is, well written will be your purview to decide)

One spell, though, is used by Harry before he even leaves school. Fiendfyre (cantrip: MAL-ig-nis) will be a spell he heavily experiments with as he tries to force his will over it and his attempt to create a Light Art version of the spell that only burns the Corrupt, leaving all else undamaged, much like the magical version of a neutron bomb, designed to destroy the enemy and not its holdings.
