imo the only way to do it properly is making Snape a rapist (instead of having Lily be unfaithful or something), who projects the anger and hatred he feels for himself at the product of that. Make him a double whammy, grade-a asshole who both regrets it, doesn't regret it, and hates every part of it, especially himself.

And then, have Harry find out, somehow, confront him about it, and Snape just cracks - he focuses all that chaotic emotional energy into a dark, vicious hatred, and they battle for a while. Both are injured, but Harry less so, and he wakes before Snape. Harry can't come to grips with it, and talks it out with Sirius.

They talk about it, about what it means, and once Sirius is reasonably convinced Harry hates Snape more than James ever did, he reveals a secret plan of his - use the blood adoption potion that's so popular in fics to purge any trace of Snape from Harry and replace it with James, as it should have been.

The end of the story sees Snape experiencing everything as his entire life and existence falls to pieces around him, and he dies at the hands of the young man who is no longer his son.

The end.
