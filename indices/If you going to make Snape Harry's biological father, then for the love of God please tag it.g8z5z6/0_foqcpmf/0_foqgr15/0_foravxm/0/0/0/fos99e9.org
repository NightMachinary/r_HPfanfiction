Intresting... What if Snape were made "good" within an /AU/ universe? Would you hate that portrayal? Or do you just despise the character himself and refuse to read anything that refashions him? I mean, I get where your coming from - I'm sure a talented author could make a great Dramione, if it all occurred within an /AU/. But I wouldn't read it because, ew. Which is probably a similar mindframe.

But isn't the whole /point/ of fanfiction to refashion the characters and world to your taste? If the same characters had the same personalities then aspects of the world wouldn't /fit/ - OOC is a thing.

Idk I'm rambling but I'm quite interested to hear your view on this. I accept Snape is a fucking evil selfish jerk in Canon, no matter what his circumstances. But I also like reading of a Snape who is kinder if he had different circumstances or character. You seem to have a very unflinchingly negative view of him and I understand, but fanfiction is gonna fanfiction.
