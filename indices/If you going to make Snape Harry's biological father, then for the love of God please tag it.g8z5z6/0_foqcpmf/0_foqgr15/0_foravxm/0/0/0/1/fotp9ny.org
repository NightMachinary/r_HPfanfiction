IMO, a good Snape in an AU is essentially an OC who is named Severus Snape. If there's some real reason behind the change from Snape to OC!Snape, then maybe it might be okayish to read...still wouldn't read it because I despise the character himself.

I avoid Draco/Hermione for the same reason - it's so outlandish to think that Hermione could ever like Draco, other than an severe case of Stockholm Syndrome or something, or Draco could ever like Hermione without some incredible memory charms.
