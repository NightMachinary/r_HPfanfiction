Of course an AU changes everything. But it needs to be established - so a character like Snape needs a few AU snapshots that show his altered path through life, which would essentially have to erase all that's hateworthy of him.

But most stories like this don't do that, they make a single divergence point and then go from there, which causes whitewashing and OOC characters that really needed an AU to be as they are.
