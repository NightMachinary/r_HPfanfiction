We don't really know much about Lily to be fair. And we do not even know if really Snape was "totally" on board with Voldemort, he wasn't an actual death eater for a long time and Sirius said many people thought Voldemort was different and they had a change of heart about Voldemort only after a while (like Regulus, he was an year younger than Snape so if he joined them "at the beginning when people still didn't know how bad he was", so did Snape). Yeah, Lily was the reason because he defected, but we really didn't have insight on his feelings about the entire thing, we know he was interested to dark arts and he hoped to gain respect, but we know also he didn't care much about the blood thing and he was worried about "people he couldn't save" (recently, so not Lily) when he is talking with Dumbledore in the pensieve (when Dumbledore is asking him how many people he saw to die). Not the kind of thing a person not caring would say. Revelation focused on love because the saga is all about love, but if really there was not any other feeling in action, Snape would say "nope I'm outta of here" when Dumbledore dropped the big bomb about Harry. Don't forget that a big limit (and beauty, if one is not too stuck up) of the story is we have got just Harry's pov and not much more.
