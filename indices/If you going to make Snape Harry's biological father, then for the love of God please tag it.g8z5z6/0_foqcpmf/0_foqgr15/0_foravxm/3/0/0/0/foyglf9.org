Just gonna say that this goes against the fact that you're using OOB sources like JK's tweets and Pottermore.

Additionally, I think I miscommunicated - not all rape is of the violent kind. He's a potions master, I'm sure he has the ability to make love potions, or some other, more weird potions that would suppress her free will. These would be rape as well. Even the imperious curse coupled with a memory charm would be rape.

And we know that exposure to the dark arts makes you more ruthless and robs you of your humanity, bit by bit. By the time he becomes potions master he's probably stopped, but even if that's the case he's far enough gone to derive joy from the suffering of children.
