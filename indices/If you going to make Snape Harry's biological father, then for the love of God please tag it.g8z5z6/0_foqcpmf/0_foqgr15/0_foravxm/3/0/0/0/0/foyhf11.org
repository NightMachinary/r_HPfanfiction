Sorry, we have got only Harry's pov and JKR's tweets obviously. JKR's tweets are facts, Harry's pov... is Harry's pov. Clearly Harry's pov is important, Harry's pov is the story... a stunted story that doesn't give total insight on side characters and we aren't supposed to take as pure gold. The cool thing about Harry: he is often wrong, so we are confused, then delighted when we read where the story is going (ex: the surprising Remus x Tonks).

Of course love potion and imperio are rape. Merope Gaunt used a love potion and Rowling said Voldemort is a sociopath for that reason, because he was born "without love".

That is the reason because rapist!snape is OOC, he easily could use those and he never did. And he never would, considering the final symbolic use of his story in the plot. Rowling never would have him do it. Or something else akin at rape.

Yeah, he is unpleasant, he is supposed to be unpleasant, if he wasn't unpleasant, he couldn't be such effective spy AND character. I don't think it make him pure evil, a villain or a RAPIST... to think he is a rapist is like to think he is Jesus... you're angry for white moral washing but you have got no problem with dark moral washing... I had a lot of horrible teachers myself, people who really shouldn't be teacher, and I'd never call the pure evil or rapist or would rule out they could be capable of heroism. For that matter, I began to read Harry Potter in 1999/2000 and I never saw Snape like utterly evil, in their confrontations he came out more like annoying than evil, and it was just so darnaly fun to see the main characters suspecting of him every time just to be surprised in the end.
