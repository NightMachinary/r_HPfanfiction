I mean to say that it's the only way to make him his biodad. Because Lily fucking hated the dude, especially what he became after calling her Mudblood.

And don't forget that Snape was totally on board with the death eater movement until Lily was in danger, at which point he asked Voldemort to spare her, and only her. Presumably to erase James and his son from the picture, to do... what exactly? The DEs aren't very forthcoming to Muggleborns. If she wasn't killed for defying their "lord", then she'd be placed under the imperious and gifted to a member. Most likely Snape.

He didn't love Lily. If he did, then he would accept her marriage to James, because that's what love does. It makes you want the person who you love to be happy, and Lily is happy when together with James. The fact that he obsesses over her 20 years after her death, that he hates and bullies her innocent, 11 year old son is fucking abhorrent, and the opposite of love.

JK doesn't understand that this isn't what love is.
