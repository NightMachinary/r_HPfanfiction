Rapist!Snape is totally OOC, the Rowling basically stated his love was real, the entire story is about "the love is more powerful than darkness, Snape could outsmart Voldemort and Harry could beat him because Voldemort didn't understand pure love". Voldemort was all "he just wanted her" and Harry was all "nope, he loved her". Snape run to Dumbledore despite he already asked to Voldemort to spare Lily not because Voldemort said him "nope" (judging by Voldemort's last speech to Harry, he actually said "okay" but Lily refused to move), but because Voldemort got all wrong, he didn't want her submit, he wanted her safe. If Snape wanted Lily with the force, he could have her: he knew enough about dark magic to use on her. He didn't do it because he loved Lily. You can't make a rapist out of him just because you don't like him. What is love and what isn't... it is a plot point. And Rowling said Snape was actually in love. Deal with it.
