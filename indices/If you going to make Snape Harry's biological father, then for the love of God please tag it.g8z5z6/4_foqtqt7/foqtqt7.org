That should definitely be tagged. And a trope like that needs to have an in-story explanation. Otherwise it won't make sense. linkffn(Digging for the Bones) has a great explanation of how Snape can be Harry's biological father. It's possible to have an explanation that doesn't vilify Snape, Lily, or James.
