Im not sure how to warn you properly, I'm pretty desensitized to gore and evil and stuff but King Leopold's Ghost made me sick to my stomach. It's incredible how awful humans can be to each other and I have to hope he was the limit. If you don't like the feeling of wanting to cry and burn humanity to the ground you may want to skip that one. The others are all mostly pleasant.

Storygrid is a writing advice book, not a story.

The others I think anyone who likes HPFF will have a good chance of enjoying.
