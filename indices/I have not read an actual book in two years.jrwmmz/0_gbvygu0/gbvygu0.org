I try to read at least one "real" book per month but I still just keep coming back to FF. I feel like it's a pathological need for the familiarity of my favorite characters and settings but I mean, it's not preventing me from keeping my job or taking care of myself so it's not /that/ bad.

"Real" books I've read lately:

Rivers of London

Lovecraft Country

Storygrid

Dune

Stories of Your Life and Others

Leopold's Ghost (interestingly, this one is nonfiction and King Leopold was more evil and depraved than any depiction of Voldemort I've ever seen, and I've seen people trying to be edgy as shit)

For non-FF web fiction:

Mother of Learning

Worth the Candle
