I haven't read an actual book since I discovered fanfiction 8 years ago (other than one or two when I was at school). Before that I would read a book at least every other day. I felt guilty for so long, but honestly I don't care anymore- at least I'm reading and enjoying it!

I tend to read longer novel length fics that are well written (often my authors or adults etc), but I do hope that I get back into actual books someday! The hp world is so comforting and familiar though, and I don't need another thing to beat myself up about- so I'm just going with it for now and not being too harsh on myself
