I feel guilty for that.

I feel like I should quit my comfort zone that are fanfictions. Especially since I keep buying books that interest me, and I truly believe it is stiffing my own creativity and narrowing my own worldview to stay within the same universe. And thus it's a bad thing.

I really intend to read actual books I buy. But then, there a fanfiction update, a post who rec this one or another, and bam, it's been 3 months since I read a line from an actual book.

I think I should give me a time to read actual book, like from 10pm to 11pm, and then fanfictions as I pleased any other time.
