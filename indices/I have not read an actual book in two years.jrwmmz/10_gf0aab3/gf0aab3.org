Personally, I like fanfics better than “real” books, because 1. I don't feel as bad when I glaze over paragraph upon paragraph, or zone out for like ten minutes but keep reading forward, and 2. I feel like I'm more okay with things not going how I'd imagined them in a non-canon setting. Like, endings that I would have previously thought unsatisfactory suddenly become better in a non-canon story. The Supernatural finale is a prime example of this; I hate that the Supernatural finale is canon, but if it were... say, a HP fanfic, I would be like, “that's some good shit right there.” And I'd read it once a month.

I feel like this says more about me than fanfics as a medium, so I'm just gonna shut up now, and hope that someone knows what the hell I'm saying because I sure as shit don't!
