You could sort them on the requirements to cast the spell. Yes, you can hurt/kill somebody with wingardium leviosa, but to cast it all you need is correct pronunciation, wand movement etc.

To cast dark magic, you actually have to want to harm them. We see this with the killing curse, it requires pure hatred to cast, cruico requires you wanting to cause severe pain.
