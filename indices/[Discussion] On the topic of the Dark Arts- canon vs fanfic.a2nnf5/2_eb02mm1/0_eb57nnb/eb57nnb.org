I strongly disagree. My headcanon tells me that all spells can be affected by strong emotions. By your definition the lightest magic would be a spell which required picture perfect precision and the darkest magic would be wandless magic as it only requires emotion/intent. The implication being of course that accidental magic and wandless magic would be considered dark. Additionally a person improving their ability with a particular spell e.g. Wordless -> Motionless -> Wandless would suggest that a spell can grow increasingly darker. Neither of those implications ring true to me
