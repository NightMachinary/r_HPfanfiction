I think one of my favorite fanon descriptions of dark vs light magic, is that dark magic is based on emotions, and light magic on calculated logic - so for light magic, you would need precise wand movements, precise pronounciation and mental discipline to get a result, while for dark magic the most important thing would be to concentrate on the emotion the spell is taking power from very hard - like wishing to hurt someone for the cruciatus. I especially liked how this definition made the patronus into a dark arts spell :D
