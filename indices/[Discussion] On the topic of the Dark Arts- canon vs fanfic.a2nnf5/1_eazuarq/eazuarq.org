One way to explain it is to see Dark Arts and any other branch of magic as a qualification given to magic by the ministry. It stands to reason that use of the Dark Arts is regulated and prohibited in the law. It then doesn't become an academic debate, but rather just something that is classified.

There are other similar explanations you can come up with that doesn't necessarily involve the nature of the magic used.
