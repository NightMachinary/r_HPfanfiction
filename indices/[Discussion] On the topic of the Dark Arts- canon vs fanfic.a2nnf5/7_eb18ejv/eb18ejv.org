  ‘Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?' she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. ‘You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long - I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson -‘

I think Bella's explanation says everything we need to know, the truly dark spells require more than words and wand motions to work properly. I'd say the patronus is an example of a light spell, while most spells are probably "grey". Most can be used with either intent but don't have the emotional components to be classified as dark or light.
