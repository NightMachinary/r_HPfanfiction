I remember there was a bit of scoffing that Durmstrung taught Dark Arts instead of just DADA like Hogwarts, with the vague notion of it being old fashioned for allowing that, and of course Lily is deeply critical of Snape using dark magic, with the suggestion of them doing something terrible to Mary McDonald.

Tbh I like the fanon explanation better, since the way canon talks about the dark arts and the dark witches and wizards, it implies really messed up things going on, not just jinxing someone to dance or have pimples, but like the entrail expelling curse. Needlessly cruel, excessively violent, or something with criminal intent makes more sense as a definition of the Dark Arts.
