Perhaps go with something along the lines of Dark Magic not being affected by healing magic, requiring a specific countercurse like Sectumsepra. That would leave plenty of useful combat spells for the light side while making a pretty clear distinction on why some spells are dark and some not.

Or, to quote my own "No Longer Alone"

  "The Dark Arts are mostly a catchy phrase for 1001 ways to kill a person painfully. Out of the whole lot only the killing curse, the Cruciatus, Fiendfyre and a few variations of the blasting curse are useful in a fight. Black Magic is part of rituals and usually comes with an immense cost for the caster. Everything else is just bloody showmanship. Why anyone would use a withering curse when he could just outright kill is beyond me." (Andromeda)

  "Because the Death Eaters are sadistic bastards who get off torture and mutilation. Mad-Eye showed me more than one memory which made me throw up. They had a few from Karkaroff and what they did to that little - " (Nymphadora)
