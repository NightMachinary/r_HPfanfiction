I always figured dark magic was particularly violent curses like entrail or sectumspra, or magic used for dark deeds like resurrecting people (LV in GOF).

Perhaps a better analogy is that dark curses seem like an AK47 compared to a knife or pistol of less dark, or non dark magic. If you get shot with certain types of high velocity/high powered automatic, or even semi-automatic, weapons in the leg and it hits your bone, it will rip the bone up into shreds and that leg will very likely never heal completely. You have a much better chance of recovering and walking again if it's a hunting rifle, or pistol that shoots the bullet that hits your bone.

TLDR: My friend in medical school was showing me an article about how extremely violent and destructive certain weapons are to the body and the x-rays were very disturbing.
