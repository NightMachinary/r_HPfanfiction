In reference to the movies I think it is important to keep point of view in mind. The books are firmly in Harry's POV with a more or less age appropriate perception and understanding of what is happening.

Even though Harry is the protagonist of the movies, he is forced to share the POV with the audience. It is still shaded by his age, but is fundamentally altered by the loss of the internal perspective and our ability to externally watch.

On the subject of Dark Arts, I have no problem with alternative view points and enjoy some of the named stories. That said, I really prefer it when a story is able to expand on the world as opposed to adding things out of whole cloth.
