I find that JKs classification of magic was fairly lazy. It's a very ministry way of thinking. Dark magic in the books also seems to encompass most types of ritual magic, sacrificial magic, and even a lot of grey area spells.

I prefer a lot of fanfictions ideas about magic. Eg prince of the dark kingdom, out of the night, the golden needle, the lie I've lived, Hogwarts battle school, Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux, and blindness.

They all have a lot of different ideas about magic and showcase a lot of different kinds/schools of thought. I think one of the major differences between these and canon though is that you realise it's very hard to classify magic. A lot is about intent.

Interestingly, I think that more recently we can see magic changing in JKs world too in the fantastic beasts series. It doesn't seem to be about spells anymore (or as much). Most characters now seem to just have the ability to wave their wand and make things happen. Although, there are of course occasional spells.
