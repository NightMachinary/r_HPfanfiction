I like the idea of the tiered system of jinxes, hexes, and curses. I don't think you really need anything more. Think about it like the gateway argument with drugs. There is a school of thought that says you should never drink alcohol or smoke a cigarette because those act as gateways for further vice. Trying a cigarette leads to trying pot leads to harder and harder drugs as well as the ancillary crimes often found associated (violence, theft, etc). Some people buy into that argument completely.

But then many people scoff at it. After all, if everyone who enjoyed a beer or smoked a cigarette became a hardened criminal and hard drug user, the world would be a VERY different place then what it is. These people will argue that correlation does not equal causation. Just because the VAST majority of hard drug users "got started" smoking as children does not mean that smoking leads to hard drug use.

EXCEPT sometimes it does.

Going back to the topic of the Dark Arts....

Many, many, many students in Hogwarts cast dark spells. A Jinx here, a hex there. Sometimes a curse flies through the halls. For most of those who do, their use of the dark arts will never progress beyond those simple jinxes and hexes. Many probably stop completely once they are out of school and in the work place. Sure, every once in a while you might end up stressed out by a situation and need a fast response, in which case a jinx might fly from your wand. But just the one, then back to being a responsible adult instead of a rebellious teenager Hexing in the boys room (as it were).

On the topic of Lily and Snape, she was very against the Dark Arts (that is something criminals do) and against Snape practicing them (he was hanging with a bad crowd and engaging in the same sort of behavior they did). To Lily, Snape practicing the Dark Arts with that crowd was like seeing her friend who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and had the occasional smoke he stole from his parents start hanging out with the stoners and trading smokes for joints. He didn't think it was that bad (it was basically what he already did), except Lily KNEW some of those kids also liked to snort coke and shoot up....and how long would Snape be able to hag out with them if he didn't also participate in the harder stuff.

Dark Arts don't have to be emotionally addictive or magically coruptive in order to be feared. All they need is an association with the wrong crowd, a correlation with degenerate behavior, and an easy enough way to flirt with them as a child.

Pot was outlawed in the United States primarily on the back of anti-Mexican sentiment and anti-black bigotry. In every elementary school in the country we have a DARE program (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) which teaches kids not to do drugs, starting with the "gateway" examples of alcohol and tobacco. All the kids go through this program, even through they have parents who drink and smoke, see it on tv and in movies, and probably know at least one minor (sometimes a sibling) who does the same thing.

AND THAT is the Dark Arts.
