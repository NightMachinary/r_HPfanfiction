One interesting thing regarding curses is that even they aren't really that much worse than jinxes and hexes. Hermione used the Full Body-Bind Curse on Neville in the first book when her, Ron, and Harry were trying to escape Gryffindor Tower to go after Quirrell. Yes, Hermione is the best in her year but nowhere in canon do we get the impression that Hermione's Full Body-Bind Curse was out of the ordinary for a student her age. Meaning that its not unusual or "above average" for even a first year student to know a curse or two. Harry and Ron had no qualms with it, and they are typically more anti-dark magic than Hermione is throughtout the series.

Yet hypocritically, Sirius of all people said to Harry that he should have used the Conjunctivitis Curse on the dragon's eyes. We know Krum used this curse because Hermione tells them (and us, the reader too) about what Krum did. Yet if most curses were really as dark as fanon makes them out to be, why would Sirius of all people be saying he would have suggested Harry use dark magic in the Triwizard Tournament? For all Sirius knew, such a move could have hurt Harry's reputation even moreso. What makes it worse is that Sirius (and James) bullied Snape for basically their entire Hogwarts years because Snape liked dark magic, yet Sirius is the one suggesting Harry should have used a curse to defeat the dragon rather than a charm (like what Fleur attempted) or even using Transfiguration as a distraction (like Cedric did).

I feel that fanon often exaggerates what dark magic is, making dark magic out to be this mysterious art form that isn't taught at Hogwarts whatsoever... even though Hermione and Draco knew a curse in their first year (Full Body-Bind Curse and the Leg-Locker Curse respectively). Not every curse is as dangerous or twisted as Fiendfyre or the Unforgivable Curses. I imagine most curses would be stuff similar to the Full Body-Bind Curse, a spell which doesn't wear off unless the countercurse is performed, meaning that if nobody undid Hermione's spell then it would last forever or until she died.

Unsurprisingly, Rowling is very inconsistent when it comes to curses. Hermione's Full Body-Bind Curse on Neville is considered normal and not a dark spell, yet Draco's use of the Leg-Locker Curse is considered dark despite being an objectively weaker spell that only binds the person's legs (rather than the entire body). The Unforgivable Curse are portrayed as an evil form of magic worse than other curses... but not when Harry or any of the good guys use them. When Harry needlessly uses Crucio on Amycus Carrow (rather than use Stupefy), its not considered dark. When McGonagall of all people uses Imperio shortly afterwards, its not considered dark. Yet Draco's Imperio usage in HBP is considered dark. When Harry or any of the good characters use dark magic, nobody cares. If a villain, or even just an dislikeable character uses dark magic, then suddenly the narrative paints them as being a dark wizard.

The ONLY exception was Harry's use of Sectumsempra on Draco, when McGonagall basically told Harry he could have been expelled, but even then, Harry doesn't face any legitimate punishment for nearly killing another student on Hogwarts grounds. If any other student had done that to Draco (i.e. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, etc), they WOULD have been expelled from the school. Remember that Harry never told McGonagall or Snape that Draco was trying to use the Cruciatus Curse, so as far as they know, Harry was the one who escalated the fight by spilling blood. Yet because Harry is the protagonist, the chosen one, and Dumbledore's favourite student, he gets off basically scott-free given any other student (especially a Slytherin) would have been expelled, if not arrested.

*TL;DR: Hermione and Draco both used dark magic in her first year. Every Hogwarts student learns jinxes, hexes and curses from their first year at Hogwarts. Sirius is a hypocrite for suggesting Harry should have used dark magic on the dragon. Ginny likely learnt the Bat-Bogey Hex at Hogwarts. The narrative only considers a spell to be "dark magic" when the spell is done by a villain or dislikeable character. If any other student used Sectumsempra or a comparably dark spell against another student and been caught red-handed like Harry was, they would have been expelled or even arrested.*
