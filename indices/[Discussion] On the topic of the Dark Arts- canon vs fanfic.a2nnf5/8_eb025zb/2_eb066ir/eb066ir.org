I think Lily was angry that Snape was creating spells like Sectumspera, which was the equivalent of an AK47 compared to a revolver. Even Harry is horrified at how violent the curse was after he stupidly used it. Also, using dark magic on a dragon when your life is in danger is probably different from creating dark magic to use on other students.

People on this thread are really downplaying how severe the effects of the known dark curses are in HP.
