I really don't agree with your TLDR and don't get how you came to these conclusions? Of course it is still dark magic when Harry or McGonagal use an Unforgivable spell, but they were fighting a war at the time - it was hardly a usual day.

Also, when Neville returns to the Gryffindors after Malfoy hexed him with the Leg-Locker Curse nobody mentions Dark Magic or that Malfoy is a dark wizard because of it, or anything similar. When Harry uses Sectumsempra, Snape says "Who would have thought you knew such Dark magic." Then Snape gives him Detention once a week until the end of the year, McGonagal agrees and tells him he is lucky he wasn't expelled. Probably because Harry was the BWL and they kind of needed him around.

Similarly, Draco wasn't expelled in the same year, although he put Rosmerta under the Imperius and Katie Bell was in the hospital for a long time because of the necklace Malfoy had her carry. - Also because of the circumstances at the time. Just like in Harry's case above.
