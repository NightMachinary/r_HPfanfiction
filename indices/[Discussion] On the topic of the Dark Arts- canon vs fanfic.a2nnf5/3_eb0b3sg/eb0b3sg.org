I don't view Dark Magic as a technical term with one true clear definition, but a concept that exists in magical society, but is regarded differently by different people.

A lawmaker in the ministry might classify spells into dark and non-dark to define different legal consequences for the user of the spells.

A healer might make the distinction based on the reversibility of the damage caused by the spell.

A Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher might just classify Dark Magic as the methods used by possible attackers that students should learn to defend themselves against.

Another might make the distinction based not on the spell itself, but on the intent of the caster. In that view, Snape's use of Avada Kedavra, that is universally regarded a dark spell, might not be considered an act of Dark Magic.
