So...what? Harry rolls into Hogwarts with a drug addiction, insisting on wearing biker leathers instead of his robes, refusing to identify with his House because he already has a Family, a degrading attitude towards all women, and engaging in physical violence at the slightest opportunity? Assuming you wanted the response to engage with the stereotype that is. I'm not sure how that fic works...Harry gets expelled a few days after arriving at Hogwarts after assaulting Malfoy, having already plunged Gryffindor into negative points over the preceding days.
