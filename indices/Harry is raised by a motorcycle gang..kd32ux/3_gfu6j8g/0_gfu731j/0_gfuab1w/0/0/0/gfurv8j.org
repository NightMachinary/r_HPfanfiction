"Hey asshole! Guess who?" Harry crowed, slamming open the door of the Falmouth bar. Pettigrew tried to run, but found Harry's chain-clad fist in his way. His last conscious thought was to wonder how Harry had found him so fast, before he could even flee England. The (mostly drunk) patrons roared in approval as Harry hauled the traitorous rat out of the door by his shirt collar. Harry tossed a balled up Â£50 note in the bartender's direction to pay for the door.

Pettigrew groaned in agony as he came to, then instantly regretted being awake as his eyes focussed on a leering Harry Potter who was inches from his face. He could smell a sharp, acrid scent that he knew to be rat poison; no doubt he was surrounded by it, preventing him from transforming without the risk of dying in agony. The bonds around his hands and ankles left him enough flexibility to sit up, but definitely not run or even stand. "Hello, rat face. We're going to turn you in to the Ministry in little bit. After we have a little fun, of course." Harry leered grotesquely, "I just want you to know something first. This. Is. Going. To. Hurt!". Harry walked away from him, ignoring the whimpering little man.

Seconds later, the quiet of the night was shattered by the characteristic earth-shaking growl of a V-twin motorcycle engine starting. Peter shut his eyes.
