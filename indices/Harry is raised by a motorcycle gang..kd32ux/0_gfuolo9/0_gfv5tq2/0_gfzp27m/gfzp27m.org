Lol... I'm Now I'm picturing Sirius Black in his forties Riding across America with Harry in a side car accompanied by a gang of retired dentists and old hells angels all his this new "biker gang"... The barking schnauzers..... I'm also picturing little at like 8 learning to play pool from an scrappy bar owner named Rosie with a skull and panda tattoo on her right shoulder and a potato cannon loaded behind the bar because the sheriff Told her she wasn't legally allowed to keep a shotgun back their loaded, But no one said anything about a potato cannon, For "special circumstances".... And Harry desperately wanting to grow up to be as cool as her one day.... while Sirius fixes the Speaker system behind the bar in exchange for free drinks and a place to stay for the next couple weeks. Since harry wants to see the Miraculous Flash flooding that is a brief rainy season in the American south west... for some odd reason his godson loves cactus flowers and wants to see them in person, but at the moment learning When to shoot an 8 ball into the corner pocket is a much higher priority for little Harry
