I read "The Smartest Witch of her Age?" and I feel it's ridiculously unfair. All the points of critique can be placed in one of three categories:

- He mentions things that he couldn't have possibly known in-universe. How would he possibly know what happened during that quidditch game and the philosopher's stone or with the basilisk??

He is also ridiculously unfair: because Voldemort and Dumbledore's mindgames tricked a 12-year-old she is therefore stupid?? Nobody else figured Quirrel out either, not even Snape knew the whole truth.

- He invents stuff that isn't canon and proposes solutions out of thin air to make her seem stupid.

Time-turners are not given out every year, there are no easy potions to fix your hair and a flame-freezing charm wouldn't have solved Snape's riddle.

- He arbitrarily decides that inventing your own spells is better than using existing ones and dismisses her accomplishments out of hand because of it.
