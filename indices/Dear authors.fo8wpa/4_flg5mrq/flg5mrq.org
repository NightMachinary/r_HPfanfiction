I'm writing my fic since last year and while I made no longer pause than a month or so where I wrote nothing, I'd have to say enthusiasm comes and goes. Currently I am at ca 160 K words and so I reread it from time to time to get a feel for the story again despite me not having stopped writing. Also you really forget details so I rec you to read your story and your notes again to not accidentally create a few plotholes. I always feel a bit guilty if I don't update for too long but mostly it's the comments that motivate me again.
