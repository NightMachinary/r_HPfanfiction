My stall points are usually because I've reached the middle and discovered I haven't fully worked out the repercussions of the early events. Sometimes I can't resolve this because it's gotten too big, either for the scope of the story or for my ability to sort out the ripples. Sometimes I'll have a shower thought that grows into a way to come at it sideways and make everything come back together.

Often when I try to come back to a story I've abandoned in my files somewhere, I'll realize I no longer agree with the characterization and thus cannot continue writing it. There was one story where I legitimately forgot what the endgame was supposed to be and couldn't figure out how the pieces I did remember fit in with the rest of the story - I eventually recycled what I remembered into a completely tonally-different ending that I liked better (and still don't know how I was supposed to get to the original ending).

I rarely post any of my stories because I know I can be a scatterbrained writer who can't control the mess the story tries to grow into.
