Despite whatever [[/u/rpeh]] says I don't stop working on much. A few things I have but that's a different argument. Sometimes things take a lot longer to come to what I'd consider worthy of being posted. So sure, sometimes there's a long gap. But, despite what most readers seem to think, I'm not just ignoring it completely. I'm usually just stuck or writing an entire story for Christmas rather than working on it. So the answer to question one is mostly just, "When I get it to a point where I'm happy with it."

'Vision for a story' is kind of a odd way to phrase anything. My 'Vision' wont change. The minutia of how I go about getting to that final goal may. I might find a word or phrase that sticks with me more and develop on it, when chatting with my beta I may feel that a different idea work better to get where I want to go. I might find a certain symbol repeats more than I anticipated and focus on that. But the goal of the story has never changed during the writing process.

Almost never. Beginnings are fun, middles are tedious, ending offer a great sense of accomplishment. The middle chapters have always been the hardest for me to write across the board.

Fuck no. But I can recall from memory full paragraphs of some of my stories I've spent so much time on them.
