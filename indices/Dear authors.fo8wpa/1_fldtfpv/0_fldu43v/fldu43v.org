This is exactly what I wanted to know.

As a reader, I just wanted to know what it takes for an author to get back into a story and how they go about doing it.

Cause it is difficult for me to get back into a story when the it hasn't been updated in a long time. When it's difficult for me, a guy who just consumes these amazing works by you great people, I just wanted to know how difficult it is for authors.

Thanks
