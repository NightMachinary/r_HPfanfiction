There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7517496/1/Horror-Of-Our-Love][Horror Of Our Love]] which has Neville as the BWL and (slowly changing) Dark!Harry but also TMR/HP. It's been a while since I read it so I don't remember how powerful Harry is in it, but I think he started out as being your typical not-overly-powerful bloke.

  AU! In a world where Neville Longbottom was declared the Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter grew up in a happy, loving family, but all of that changed when he met Tom Riddle. TMR/HP slash. Dark!Harry.
