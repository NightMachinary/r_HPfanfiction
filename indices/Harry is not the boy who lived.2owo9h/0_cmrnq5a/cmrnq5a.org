There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]], if you haven't read it, give it a try. Sadly it's abandoned, but it's interesting while it lasts.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control]] is great if you like a darker (okay, very dark) Harry.

#+begin_quote
  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724650/1/Death-Before-Dishonour][Death Before Dishonour]] is interesting too. Neville BWL. Slytherin Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est La Vie]] is one of my favourite dimension travel fics. Hasn't been updated since May 2013.

#+begin_quote
  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10511318/1/Just-Another-Orphan][Just Another Orphan]] is a Slytherin nonBWL Harry fic.

#+begin_quote
  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/The-Double-Agent][The Double Agent]] is a bit different from the other stories I recommended.

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.
