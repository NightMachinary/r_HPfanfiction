An interesting story. I had some fun reading it, but it wasn't exactly a masterpiece. The best parts were the well-realized and explored soul bond effects. I was unimpressed, however, by the author's use of OOC hijinks and the overall pacing and plotting.

It is listed as "humor," but that isn't, in my opinion, a license to dump compelling plotting by the roadside or to abuse canon characterizations for yucks -- certainly not without a big crackfic warning somewhere. To me, the FFN "humor" tag means intentional funnies incoming, not crackfic OOC shenanigans. For me, those parts almost spoiled an otherwise interesting fic.

I discuss my reasons for these opinion in general terms more after the break. Avoid if you haven't read the fic and that sort of thing bothers you.

No outright spoilers, though.

This story seems like more of a "tech demo" of the author's idea than a fully fleshed out story. The endless sniping back and forth gets a little filler-y and seems to poorly advance either plot or character development, dragging on long after the problem is established.

To any other authors out there: please, don't waste the reader's time just to try to maintain emotional effects, especially in novel length fiction. Writing about a repeating or continuing situation might be a good time for once to /tell/ instead of /show/ that something is making the characters bored and annoyed.

Still, there was an interesting effect established, with characters' emotions swinging back and forth constantly and endless childish psychic chatter. I quickly came to hate the soul bond myself, but I also started hating the story a little bit every time the same situation yet again repeated itself at breakfast or during classes.

In a non-Ginny/Harry area, I didn't like the author's take on Dumbledore. But that isn't really an objective complaint about poor writing, just that he is a different, entirely OC character in this story.

My biggest complaint is saved for plot, however. "Bad Vibrations" and the new Defense teacher was, in my opinion, the most jarring, most annoyingly OOC, and most pointlessly AU plot line I've ever read outside a crackfic.

So maybe this is somewhat of a crackfic after all, which in my opinion sort of undercuts the author's cool ideas about how serious soul bond consequences might be interesting compared to instant "twu wov."
