I haven't finished either and I don't think I will, if only because taking it where I left of feels like such a chore.

May contain inadvertent spoilers:

First, everyone feels so OOC and although the author justifies her choices on this about Ginny, it's just really annoying having a bitchy Ginny, a weak submissive Harry, an overly childish Dumbledore, a Ron that only lives for food (literaly)... Oh well I just realized the author forced traits of characters so much, they're just not realistic or enjoyable anymore.

The other thing that bothered me is the lack of plot. Where is this story going? I have absolutely no clue. It reads like a sort of day to day account with not much happening, there's no pull, no urgency, no goal (they're not even researching for a way to break the bond for God's sake!). So why would I want to read more of it? That's right, I don't.

And I didn't understand the premise: they are soul-bonded by accident, it's horrible to live with even from the very beginning, but they don't tell anyone? Not even just Dumbledore? Why? Maybe he could have fixed it in an instant after all. I just don't get it.

That said, I know I'm being harsh and it's probably an entertaining story if you're looking for some light reading (I said some light reading, Hermione, put down that encyclopedia!)
