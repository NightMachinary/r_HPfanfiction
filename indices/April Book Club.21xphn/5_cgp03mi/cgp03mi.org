I actually suggested this one, glad it got chosen!

Like I said in my original post, this is one of the very few soul-bond fics that's actually worth reading. The writing is fairly good, not amazing prose, but it gets the job done. You can understand what the writer is trying to get across fairly easily, and it's never bad to the point that you get yanked out of the story by the writing.

It's one of two soul-bond fics that I've read that utilizes the (completely obvious) idea that two people who can suddenly hear each others thoughts, would probably despise it. At least at first. Most other soul-bond fics (granted, there's like 4 soul-bond fics that aren't actually awful) have the two bonded enjoy the experience immediately. Not only is the idea laughable, but it would be even worse considering the age Harry and Ginny are at in this fic. Can you imagine having a hard on at 13, and having a /girl/ know about it immediately? How about having your first period, and the crush of your dreams experiences it along with you. This fic does it right.

The author has a very interesting take on the McNair character, probably the best I've seen. It's a bit contrived, but so it just about everything else in the HP world. I actually found him quite creepy.

You see the authors growth as a writer as the fic goes on. Chapters get longer, dialogue gets better, and descriptions become more detailed. The difference between chapter 1 and 16 are appreciable, and it'll be interesting to see how the writer continues to improve.

Overall, it's definitely worth a read, especially if you're a fan of soul-bond fics. I think Error Of Soul did the idea better, but as EoS hasn't been updated in forever, it may very well be abandoned. This fic, while not quite reaching the quality that EoS did, is still very enjoyable.
