Agreed with regard to the soul bond not being a positive thing, especially at that age.

  The author has a very interesting take on the McNair character, probably the best I've seen. It's a bit contrived, but so it just about everything else in the HP world. I actually found him quite creepy.

I found him impossible to take seriously as a character, which is a theme in this fic. It has more caricatures than characters. McNair, Ron and Dumbledore especially are ridiculous. I'll probably continue following it. It's not great, but it's readable and has an interesting enough premise to be worthwhile.
