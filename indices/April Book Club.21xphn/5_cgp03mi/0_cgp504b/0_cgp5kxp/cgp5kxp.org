  I found him impossible to take seriously as a character, which is a theme in this fic. It has more caricatures than characters. McNair, Ron and Dumbledore especially are ridiculous.

I agree that McNair especially is someone who you can either love or hate depending on how you look at it. Honestly, I lowered my standards as soon as I started reading the fic, just because of the writing level. I just tended not to take it as seriously as I might otherwise have, so that's probably why I enjoyed the character.

Dumbledore...Honestly, I don't even remember him in the fic. Which probably says more than anything else, because I only read it a week ago. Same with Ron really.

  It's not great, but it's readable
#+end_quote

This is exactly how I would describe it. If it wasn't a soul-bond fic, I wouldn't be reading it. It's just that the level of quality in soul-bond fics is so horrible, that I adjust my expectations based on that. Like I said, there are like 4 fics that are actually worth reading, and the rest are trash. The fact that this one /isn't/ horrible, is what makes it stand out, not so much that it's good.
