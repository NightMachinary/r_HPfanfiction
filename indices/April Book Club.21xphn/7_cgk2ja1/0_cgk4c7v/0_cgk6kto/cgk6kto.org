I just don't think the book club is important enough to be "stickied". A discussion about new moderators - yes. A book club discussion? That's just normal conversation that should be as visible as the upvote/downvote system makes it. If it is popular, it'll stay higher in the list. (I don't want to hide the post - I just wish it was part of the normal listing, living and dieing on its own merit.)
