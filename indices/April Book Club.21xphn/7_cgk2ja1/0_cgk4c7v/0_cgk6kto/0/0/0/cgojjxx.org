Do you not get the concept of a monthly book club? People have the whole month to read and discuss the chosen fic. Letting the thread disappear after a week isn't very conducive to the success of the book club.

And given the votes on your comments, no one agrees with you that it's a problem. None of the downvotes are from me, by the way. Why do you care so much about whether this is stickied?
