  Letting the thread disappear after a week isn't very conducive to the success of the book club.

The success or failure of the book club does not warrant the book club getting special treatment. Further, it appears to me that there wasn't any more traffic in this tread, even though it was at the top of the list - and so I don't think that a stickied post actually helps.

I understand the concept of monthly book club. I also have no problem with there being an [[/r/hpfanfiction]] book club.

By having the post stickied at the top, your practically saying "the book club is the most important thing happening in this subreddit". This is what I have a problem with. I just don't understand why it deserves such special treatment.

Do you understand the concept of a subreddit? You've already stated that you know that the thread would be off the front page by the end of the month. That this is the normal behavior of reddit. And so you are purposely and intentionally going against the system as original designed.

Instead, I would suggest that the book club create new book club threads whenever a new discussion point arises. The reddit system will make it visible based on the normal rules. The new link flares can be used to easily find book-club posts.

For example, this original post was declaring the story to read, and that after two weeks spoilers could be discussed. Why not, after the two weeks, start the a new discussion thread?
