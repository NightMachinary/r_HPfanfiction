I think part of the reason it is sticked is because a lot of people on the site upvoted/showed interest in a book club for each month. He presented it as an idea for the sub, and it had a lot of interest. I think the only reason it is stickied is because a lot of people seemed to want this to become a thing within the sub, and it is a monthly thing. No one wants to sift through a months worth of posts to find it over and over again for a discussion. It makes sense for it to be kept at the top.
