It's awful. Don't know if there's any redemption in the story, but the writing is beyond saving.

Seriously not funning with you. From chapter 16, or whatever: „They were bloody stubborn though, both of them equally so. They each dragged on either side of the arrow equally stubbornly, and the arrow would fly perfectly straight.”

„Stubbornly stubborn”.

No stars.
