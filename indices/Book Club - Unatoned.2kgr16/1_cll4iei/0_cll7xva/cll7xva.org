I definitely agree about Harry being OOC. Harry suddenly quitting Divinations and joining runes was excusable (even though it could be handled much better) but his interaction with Fred and George was just plain ridiculous.

What made me drop this fic was the bland and uninspired writing rather than spelling/grammatical errors though. Sentences like the following annoy me to no end:

  Harry got back to Luna that evening. He was agitated. She was concerned about him.
