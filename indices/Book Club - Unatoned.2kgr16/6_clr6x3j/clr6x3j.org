I absolutely hated the way Runemaster was written, but I did enjoy some of the ideas in it. I liked the idea of using the pure essences, and the fact that Harry was able to do potions with them. I thought the scythe was way over the top, but ignoring the writing style and grammar, it was at least a fun 'I have nothing better to do' read. I did enjoy the ridiculousness of the epilogue, though!

I'd love to find more stories where runes play an important role.
