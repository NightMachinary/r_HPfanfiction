It was pretty bad. Cliches galore and overpowered Harry (it's fine if he's too strong - everyone likes that. The problem is the lack of a cogent explanation for it (he's good at runes, so suddenly he's a master of potions and dueling to boot?).

I say "pretty bad" in the sense that it was sub par for the top tier of fanfictions. In general, decent enough story with comprehensible structure that's not not worth a read.
