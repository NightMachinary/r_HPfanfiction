There were a lot of grammatical and spelling errors for the first few chapters, and gets a little bit better by the end.

As for the plot, Harry becomes too powerful too quickly, and the author suffers the same problem several fanfiction writers have which basically means that Harry becomes too OOC in the first 3 chapters, and the character development is completely useless. I personally don't mind OOC Harry, as long as it is justified, and I didn't see it justified here.

I like that he explored Runes in a different way and I think that it was quite fun reading that. I had many laughs while reading it because of how clich√© this fanfiction is.

The end made me cringe. That's all I have to say.
