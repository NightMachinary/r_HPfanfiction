I gave this fanfic a second chance, because the last time I tried to read it I didnt finish the second chapter.

From there, I was quite surprised. It didn't become my favourite fanfiction, but I enjoyed quite a bit. I like a lot the character of Daphne, not only in this fanfiction, but also the "non-canon" knowledge that the "Ice Queen" from Slytherin has become.

I've read better fanfiction, but I have also read a lot worse.
