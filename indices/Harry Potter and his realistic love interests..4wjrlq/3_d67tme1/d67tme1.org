Rowling isn't a great writer of romance and that's being kind. Rowling didn't write secondary characters that well and it isn't so easy to comment on based on those canon characters. Now if you are talking about fanfiction version of those secondary characters paired with someone from Canon then I would like to see him with someone from Slytherin just so that it can be a means to an end to break all the prejudices against Slytherin.
