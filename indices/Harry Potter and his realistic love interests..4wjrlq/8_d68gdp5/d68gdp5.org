With canon Harry? Well, I'd go with somebody on the quidditch-team (Katie Bell might work, but Angelina and Alicia would work just as well - Sorry twins, but I don't think you play in Harry's league as he's famous, has money etc. etc.) or somebody from Slytherin (in order to show that the whole house isn't evil)

I mean Harry needs a supportive witch that shares his interests (basically: Quidditch) and that't it (I mean come on: Canon Harry does have only the one hobby, he doesn't have any side-interests etc....in a way he's quite one-dimensional and should have been fleshed out more!)

ps: No, not Ginny because basically: I don't like her much (trying to make Harry jealous? Come on the guy is DENSE, just kiss him and don't try to - pardon my french - to sleep your way through his dorm in order to make him jealous!) and I still think she'd remind him of his mother (both are redheads after all) and he hates his fame, so why would he bang his number 1 fangirl?

pps: Note: Ginny could have gone out with wizards from her own year or even the year below, but she only ever dated guys from Harry's year if I remember this right, so IMHO she wasn't really trying to move on!
