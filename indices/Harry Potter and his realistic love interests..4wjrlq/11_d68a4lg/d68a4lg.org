Not a specific character, but I think realistically, Harry would probably be more comfortable with a Muggleborn, because he was raised Muggle. Also, they wouldn't have grown up hearing about Harry Potter and so would probably treat him pretty normally.

One with at least some family for him to be adopted by - a sibling, a few aunts and uncles. And who wants a family of their own. Probably someone who enjoys Quidditch, even if they don't play. Someone who wants a quiet life, not tons of events and being mentioned in the paper.
