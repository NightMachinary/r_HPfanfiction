What about Luna, too? I'm surprised people didn't mention her. She isn't starstrucked by Harry. She has a lack of tact; her "uncomfortable truths." And after Sirius died Harry "found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly" after having a talk with Luna. The others y'all mentioned can be passed as OC's, so any situations with them and Harry can be manifested as realistic or true as you want.

Or Cedric, maybe. Or not since it would make that book more depressing.
