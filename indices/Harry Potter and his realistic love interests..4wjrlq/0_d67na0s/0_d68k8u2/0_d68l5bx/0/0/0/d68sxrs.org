Well, to be fair here, she was 14 when she had this talk with Harry. People tend to be childish at that age.

I think, however, that the important part here is that Luna has a way to get through to Harry, which in itself is something quite unique in canon. Add to that a few years and the "ship may set sail".

It really is unfortunate that Luna never got the chance to get closer to Harry. Her role of depth was pretty much done after OotP. The next real chance would have been on Slughorns party, but yeah...

I agree that Luna is very child-like in canon. Its why I prefer fics that have her get together with Harry later in their Hogwarts years, or even as adults.
