Certainly the sexual aspect of it but not exclusively. Luna is whimsical eccentric in a way that feels childish to me. She is smart but has a childlike wonder and imagination.

I love Luna, she is one of my favorite characters and there are even a couple Harry/Luna fics I like, however on the whole the idea of a Luna ship is offputting.

Think of it in a real life context. You know someone who behaves in a childlike way, and then you put the moves on them. Its just creepy.
