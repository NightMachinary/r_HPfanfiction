Katie is only a year older than Harry and they spend a lot of time playing Quidditch together. I think if JK was going to write the series with more focus on characterization and Hogwarts life than Katie would certainly play a part.

Probably all of the Quidditch team really. Fred and George would be like his older brothers, telling him dirty stories and giving him bad advice. Angelina and Alicia would fit that same role probably.

Romilda would have a larger role in this narrative too, to more deeply explore the fangirl aspect. Someone who is willing to slip him love potions is significant, yet in canon is was only a plot device to get Ron to break up with Lavender.

Cho is a realistic love interest. There is a mutual attraction, a common love for quidditch, but it was doomed after Cedrics death. A canon more focused on relationships would tell the same story, but better.

Most importantly of all is Ginny. How their relationship developed should've been a core aspect of canon, even with the lack of romance in the books it should've got more focus. A powerful moment in canon was when they get on the train to Hogwarts and Harry says he forgot Ginny didn't hang around with them at Hogwarts. This should've been a large moment, but it wasn't. It was quickly forgotten until Harry had his ridiculous 'monster in the chest' moments.

So if I were retelling canon but with some focus on romance I'd do a Katie thing in 4th year, Harry misses spending time with her since they don't have quidditch. 5th year is the Cho incident. 6th year Romildas infatuation and his coming to terms with his feelings for Ginny.
