I read a great thesis on why Ginny was the one for Harry in the end. It basically broke down Harry's needs into a few key factors.

I can't remember them exactly but it was something like this:

1. Harry wants some one who shares interests with him.

2. Harry wants someone who can make him laugh.

3. Harry desires to be part of a family.

You can see how Ginny ticks all these boxes.

As I've mentioned before, Harry Potter is more Plot Driven oriented than Character Driven. Most of the secondary characters don't get a chance to communicate a lot of their backstory, it's not important the the style of story.

For instance, Daphnie Greengrass is mentioned in passing in book 5. That is her ONLY appearance in canon. Tracey Davis never even gets a mention.

So in terms of female side characters who get any information we have Hermione, Ginny, Cho, Parvati, Katie, Fleur, Pansy and Marrietta.

Of those he only finds Ginny and Cho attractive.
