The moment you write them as more than sideliners, every single one of the secondary characters becomes, basically, an OC. True, fanon has done much to create a sort of image for Susan, Daphne and others, but nobody could argue with you about a new characterization.

I'd say that you'd have to take quite a leap for any Slytherin love interest. Even if Daphne, Tracy or any other Slytherin finds Harry attractive, the sheer peer pressure would be a lot to overcome, on both sides, Slytherin and Gryffindor.

I think the best chances lie with Gryffindor girls. Parvati, Lavender, Katie, Romilda - because at this point, why not? That is simply because of the "accessibility", for a lack of a better word. The Gryffindor girls have easier access to Harry and have more information on his likes and dislikes to approach him accordingly, should they wish to do so.

Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are neutral ground. I'd say those joining the DA would have the best chances.
