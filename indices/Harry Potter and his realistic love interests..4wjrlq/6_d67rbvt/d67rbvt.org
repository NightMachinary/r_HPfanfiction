I feel as if everyone has reasonable chances. Most of these girls are all basically OC's so you can make their personality as perfect for Harry as you want. Some like Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass do not even have their looks described so as gorgeous as you want.

We treat characters a bit like animals to be honest. Grab two characters, force them to work on a project/go on a crazy adventure/soul bond thats the equivalent of locking them in a room together and suddenly they realise their perfect for each other.

I'm sure there's a scientific word for this phenomenon.
