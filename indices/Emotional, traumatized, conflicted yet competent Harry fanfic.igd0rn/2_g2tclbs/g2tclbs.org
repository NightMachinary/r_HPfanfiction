The longfic I'm currently co-writing sees Harry very much from the perspective you are describing, and progresses along those lines. In our story, Harry is gravely impacted by the abuses and horrors in his past, and is driven to become someone competent, even if he doesn't always know the best way to get there. He suffers breakdowns & depression (though he doesn't know yet what to call it). He needs people. He chafes under Dumbledore's rules & longs to live by his own principles. Snape does not get a pass for his asshole behavior, but neither are we bashing anyone in the fic.

Possible detractors depending on your preferences: not Harry/Hermione, Harry is still somewhat "pure hearted" (though part of the point of the story is to teach him to see more than one side of these issues), Dursleys probably won't heavily feature (they'll be talked about though), it's eventual Mentor Snape, Harry still fights for the world, and our story is roughly a 50/50 blend of canon & OC characters

If you're interested, it can be found on both FFN & ao3: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)
