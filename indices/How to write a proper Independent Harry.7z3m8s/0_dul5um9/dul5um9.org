Something has to light a fire in his gut. Something has to get the point across that /he has a responsibility now./ Any number of the close encounters he's had, from Quirrel to Sirius's death, can work just fine for that. The other thing is learning that Independent does not mean Alone. You can still be independent and follow directions when you're out of your depth, which Harry very much is. Third, mistakes and epiphanies can and will be made. Assuming he is at all self aware, then most of them will be in the "Fuck I'm not as smart as I thought I was/Oh shit there are actual reasons for this" category. The wisest man knows nothing, and all that.
