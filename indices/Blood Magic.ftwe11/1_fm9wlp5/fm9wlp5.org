Stars by the one I recommend the most.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex]] has the main character use Re'em blood to augment their body(ies). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort]] has blood magic used liberally. *

Cadmean Victory has nominal blood magic though it's more sacrificial magic with blood as an identifier. Honestly, in my opinion, overrated as well. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer]] has blood magic as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12896758/1/]] has blood magic in an interesting way, though it's different from the examples you gave. *

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/11/Control]] has blood magic as well (haven't read but it's been recommended for blood magic by others - looks like it's of dubious quality though).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/19/Wind-Shear][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]] has one spell that manipulates blood. Not the focus beyond the spell though the spell is quite important. *

Incidentally, those who are looking at this, if any of you remember a story where Harry placed drops of blood on his wand to increase the power of his spells (blood consumed as he cast), please link it.
