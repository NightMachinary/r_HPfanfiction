The smut and the anti-PC protagonist / narrative are intended major themes of the story almost from the beginning. If one of these isn't why you've started reading the story, I suggest just dropping it. There is some interesting plot and idea potential besides all that, but it's not worth slogging through if these things aren't what attracted your interest in the first place.

Not only that, but in the later chapters the story also drops in quality (if we define it through the "genre" description given above) because of author tracts and protagonist / author displaying more unveiled racism, Islamophobia and Christianophobia.

So my advice:

- if you've become interested in this story because of something other than the smut and the anti-PC protagonist, then drop it;

- if you've become interested in this story because of the smut, but can't stand anti-PC (and/or racist) protags / narrators, then drop it;

- if you've become interested in this story because of the smut and are indifferent about anti-PC / racist remarks, keep reading it until either you grow bored with it or you read through the whole thing.
