No, it gets worse and then adds a whole bunch of unnecessary racism and the author becomes steadily more unlikeable too.

The premise was interesting, the world building was mint, and then it was all wasted on paedophilic sex scenes, and then toss in some rape [soul joining] and you're good to go.

I wasted 4 days of my life reading the whole thing. For a similar effect I could've just jammed my fingers in a door hinge repeatedly.
