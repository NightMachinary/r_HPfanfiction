Dude , I watched Jordan Peterson on Joe Rogan podcast without realizing who he was and well, when i googled him...I had to agree with people who think he is nothing more than an apologist for overall despicable behavior.

​

The thing is that he presents himself in a way you can perceive him as a moderate among "hysterical" people and this wins him a lot of positive attention.

​

I would actually have given him the benefit of the doubt, but he went and stupidily came out with the whole thing about " let´s discuss why women wearing make up on their work palce might not be a good idea" and I was out.

​

You are, of course free to agree with his views, but try not to insult people who see him as Alt Right freak, okay? It was uncalled for, especially considering nobody was insulting you, just discussing a media personality.
