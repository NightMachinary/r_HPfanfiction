  t. I always envisioned wizards as being pagans, atheists, animists, or just anything but Abrahamic, and the fact that a lot of Muggleborns entering this world were Christian/Muslim/Jewish, was imo, one of the reason why pureblood families ended up hating them

Never thought about it like that, but what an interesting point! I also always asumed wizards wouldn't be religious (love fics where they use expressions like thank Merlin etc instead thank God). But as you said, muggleborns must to a degree bring religion into the wizarding world. That would for once be an interesting motive for purebloods...
