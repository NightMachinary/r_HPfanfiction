All three of them say magic is the result of working with/for demons (Jinns in Islam), which led to a massive crack down on every "magician" across the places where these faiths gained dominance. Both the Bible and the Quran (and I assume the Torah as well) sentence the practice of magic to death. Europe in the Middle Ages is a prime example of that. I always envisioned wizards as being pagans, atheists, animists, or just anything but Abrahamic, and the fact that a lot of Muggleborns entering this world were Christian/Muslim/Jewish, was imo, one of the reason why pureblood families ended up hating them.

(As a side note, Im currently writing a fanfic centered around Grindelwald's rise to power and movement, and most of the old, pureblood families are pagan, either really practicing, or just claiming pagan beliefs for cultural reasons. But I have no intention of going on anti-Abrahmic rants, its more of a background, worldbuilding thing.)

Edit: Im personally practicing Muslim lol, I really have no beef with my brother-faiths. But from the perspective of Wizarding society, I see them heavily disliking these religions.
