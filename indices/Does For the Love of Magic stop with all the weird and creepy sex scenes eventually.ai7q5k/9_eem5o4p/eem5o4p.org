That fic is the perfect embodiment of wasted potential and an author willingly destroying his work just to show the world ow edgy and independent he/she is. It started out so strong, and I actually found the weird sex inuendo's of Luna kinda fun, but my oh my, everything falls apart in a really sad way pretty soon. And it really rubbed me the wrong way how racist/xenophobic Harry was. I have no qualms with wizards hating Abrahamic faiths, I actually find it logical. But it became clear after a point that this wasnt about the story anymore, it was the author injecting his own hatred in, for no reason.

Its a shame how that fanfic devolved.
