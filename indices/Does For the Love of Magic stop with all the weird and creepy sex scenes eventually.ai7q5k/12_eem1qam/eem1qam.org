Yeah, actually I really liked the story at the start; I skipped the smut and just focused on the plot. However, in the last 10-15 chapters or so, after Harry gets his own island to rule over, the authors somewhat racism and hatred for the religion of Islam seep in. I do not know whether he had a valid reason or not, but it must have left a sour taste in the mouth of quite a few readers. Yeah, Harry is persuaded into banging Gabriele Delacour too, when she was young-ish.
