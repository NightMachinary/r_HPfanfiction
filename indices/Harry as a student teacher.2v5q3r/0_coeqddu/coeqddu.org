[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] has him teach Potions for a bit (as part of a time-travel thing). He's not very good at it. This story is long, and complete, and has its moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/][C'est La Vie]] has him doing some Ancient Runes teaching. This story is quite good but incomplete.
