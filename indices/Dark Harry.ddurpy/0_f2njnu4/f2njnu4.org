My favorite dark!Harry fics (none of these Harrys ever join Voldemort):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): This Harry is not so much dark, but highly manipulative. He skillfully uses Daphne Greengrass to advance his career and agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This Harry was actually raised by his own loving parents and never went to Hogwarts. The quote "All roads to hell are paved with good intentions" very much applies to him. His actions have brought peace and prosperity to millions, but he also employs torture, assassination, kidnapping, extortion, and sabotage as his policy tools. He loves his family dearly, but will not hesitate to manipulate them for his political goals.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620): As the title says, he's ruthless in his private war against Death Eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel and kill the fuck out of their enemies again. Dark humors.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who had once against escaped justice.
