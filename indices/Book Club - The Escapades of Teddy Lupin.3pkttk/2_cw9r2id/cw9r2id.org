It's hard not to compare this to the benchmark for teddy lupin first year fics which is a hogwarts houses divided. That being said there are some cool characters in here and also I love how close he gets to Neville. I don't like that in these fics Harry isnt as involved in Teddy's life as I would like him to be. Harry didn't have parents growing up so I would think he would be a lot closer to teddy. Overall good fic.
