I tried hard. I really did.

I just couldn't slog through it. I couldn't find the central narrative. Like most next gen fics, there was too much time spent on introducing the the next generation and not enough time formulating an interesting plot. I got through 7 chapters and just found myself bored.

The quality of the writing is fine, but without a strong hook, it's hard to get involved in this fic.
