  Something about this pasta seemed...wrong. Maybe it was the fact that the sauce, while smelling of tomatoes, looked uncannily like human blood. Maybe it was the fact that the entire bowl consisted of one impossibly long noodle, spread out in shapes that looked oddly like nooses and bullwhips. Maybe it was the fact that the dish itself radiated an aura of menace and terror.

Literal creepy pasta from Infinite Pokemon Loops, chapter 15.
