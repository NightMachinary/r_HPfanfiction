[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1712085/1/Exitus-Acta-Probat][Exitus Acta Probat]] -this is a tomione fic that has angst, drama, and also some comedy. I love this story so much, it's so underrated

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13250357/1/Sirius-Black-and-the-Girl-With-the-Terrible-Hair][Sirius Black and the Girl With the Terrible Hair]] -this is by the same author as exitus acta probat and it's equally as good. it's a sirius/hermione pairing
