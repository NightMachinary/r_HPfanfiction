linkffn(12125300). Just finished this, today actually and it was great. The story is still in progress though, just updated a week ago. Daphne and Hermione are secondary characters and are certainly not perfect. You really just want someone to punch Hermione in the face and make her see reason or get over her faith in authority figures in a few scenes. She is definitely not the good know it all from canon, but still her character is pretty much the same, just that Harry isn't as dumb.
