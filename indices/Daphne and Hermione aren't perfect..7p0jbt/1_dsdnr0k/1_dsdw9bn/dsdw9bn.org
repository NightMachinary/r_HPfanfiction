It's one of those fics that are not the best, the plot is not that original, the writing is just okay... but they depict something extremely well (mental health issues, racism, or even sometimes coming out) and that makes up for it. I don't like the way the story portrays pureblood culture for example, but I still appreciate it for how real the depression is portrayed.
