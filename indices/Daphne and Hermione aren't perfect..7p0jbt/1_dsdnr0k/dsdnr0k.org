Linkffn(Good Days and Bad Days by swiggy3000) is a pretty alright on-going fic which has Daphne suffering from a combination of depression/social anxiety.

It -does- get a little tiresome to read at times, but it is one of the better depictions of mental health issues and its effects on people I've seen in fanfiction so far.
