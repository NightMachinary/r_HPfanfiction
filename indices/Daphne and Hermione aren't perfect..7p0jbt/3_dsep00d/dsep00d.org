The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope: linkffn(6995114) .

Harry Potter with a bit of Fate/Stay Night and Naruto. One of the best fics I've ever read and has some amazing characterizations. Hermione and Daphne are his best friends. Eventually, the fic gets away from Lungs and he has to tie it up with a little hand-waving (minor minor handwaving).\\
Stations of canon are hit, but only in name as things are very different since Harry discovers his abilities.

Bit spoilery, but both Hermione and Daphne go a little bit insane dealing with forbidden magics. There's also some very morally questionable sexual behavior in the story (dont say i didnt warn you).
