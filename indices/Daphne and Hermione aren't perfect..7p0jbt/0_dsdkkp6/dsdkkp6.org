Growing Up Black linkffn(6518287) fits the bill nicely, pre Harry/Daphne, but Daphne isn't perfect, she avoids interaction with others, overreacts a bit occasionally, and hates muggles. Now, some might not count that last one, especially as tons of people in that fic hate muggles- but as a muggle I must object.

Also it's Ron/Hermione/Dumbledore bashfest, so of course Hermione isn't perfect in it. Though at least all characters in it have flaws- even the arguably nicest character in the actual fanfic itself- the couple that adopted Harry, didn't do it entirely selfishly.

Really, the characters are what make the fic- they feel like actual people.
