Only Ron and Dumbledore, and very light Molly bashing are in it if I remember right.

In Rons case, he's at least trying to do the right thing since he genuinely seems to believe Harry's evil- and for decent reasons.

Dumbledore... Eh, seems like a tired old man, manipulative as fuck, but he is on the side of angels, even decides, upon seeing how happy he is, not to try to take him away from who he believes to be an evil family.

Molly... Eh, she forbids the twins to talk to Harry, but then again, that's largely because she's worried he's a bad influence on them. She comes off looking the worst of the bashing victims even though we see and hear of her the least.
