Yup, that's right. I had over a dozen readers who laughed about the fact that they accidentally read my fic as "Dermatologist", and after a Reddit thread said, "OMG someone should write this!" I figured I may as well give it a shot myself. :) I wrote it pretty quickly, but I'm overall pretty happy with how it turned out. You'll find a little dedication in an author's note at the start of the fic. Now, here's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Demonologist!]] Also, if the OP is still interested, might I also recommend my series "Perfectly Normal", starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/The-Definition-of-Normal]["The Definition of Normal"]], which has a flawed (but not OOC/evil) Hermione as a prominent secondary character, and Daphne is also hanging around the friendship group. I hope it's alright to rec your own fics? I'm not on Reddit much and wouldn't want to breach etiquette on this point.
