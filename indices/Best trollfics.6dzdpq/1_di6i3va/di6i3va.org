not sure if it's satire of commies from a capitalist perspective or vice-versa, or just making fun of the edgy teens you see who clamor on about anarchy and socialism and etc. and it turns out their knowledge of anarchism and other socialist ideologies comes from a Sex Pistols song, but it's pretty good, if a bit annoying to read with having to constantly change chapters.
