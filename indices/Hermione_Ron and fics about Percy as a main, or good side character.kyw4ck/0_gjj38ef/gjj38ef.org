One author who has written a ton of Percy-centric fics is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/likehandlingroses/pseuds/likehandlingroses/works?fandom_id=136512][likehandlingroses]]. Here are a few of their fics, but there are seriously a bunch:

There's also a beautifully written Percy/Hermione by calebski, called Reflector:

Percy Take the Wheel is good as far as I've read, which admittedly is only a few chapters in, but it's always recommended around here:

If you'd permit me a bit of self-promo, most of what I write these days is Percy-centric, and I've associated it all under a series called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1543966][Perfectly Imperfect Percy]] -- but it's not a series as in connected stories, just a way to put them all together.

Despite Ron/Hermione being my OTP, weirdly enough I don't read a lot of Romione fic these days, and if I do they're not novels, but one that does come to mind is Memory Dust by shadowycorner:

If any others occur to me I'll come back and edit this post!
