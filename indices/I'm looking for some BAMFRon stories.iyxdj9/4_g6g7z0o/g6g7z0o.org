My personal list. There's a mix of stuff unfavourable to Hermione but there's a warning added jic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]). It has 58-year-old Harry and Ron go back to their 4th year. Hilarity ensues. Does contain some Hermione/Ginny-bashing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).
