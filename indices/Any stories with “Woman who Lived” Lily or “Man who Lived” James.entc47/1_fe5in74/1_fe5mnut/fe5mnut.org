In order to invoke the magic you have to willingly die, when having the choice to live, with the belief your death won't actually directly save anyone. James was not given the chance to live. Lily and Harry were.

Edit: I should note the third requirement is just a conclusion I came to, apparently. I can't find a quote for it. But it works for both Harry's and Lily's sacrifices, and without it the sacrificial magic would be far more common, so it's the only thing that makes sense.
