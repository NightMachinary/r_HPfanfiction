In the sense that every action we take is a choice, yes. But, at least magically, Lily's sacrifice was a much different kind of choice. Clearly this occurrence of magical protection is so extraordinarily rare as to be unknown to the wizarding world, so it would have to take something much more than just putting yourself in danger to help another.

(Also James happened to be wandless, so he had even less choice, but that doesn't seem to be a deciding factor.)
