The official word or consensus (I forget which) is that it is because Lily had the /choice/ not to die because of Snape's request, which Voldemort was honoring. He asked her to step aside several times, and she chose to die rather than give up her baby and live. James was incredibly brave, but he never had a choice, thus it didn't count as a sacrifice in the same way.
