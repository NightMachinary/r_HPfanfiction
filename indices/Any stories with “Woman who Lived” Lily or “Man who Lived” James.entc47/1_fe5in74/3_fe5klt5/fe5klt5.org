It could be any of a number of things. We know lily didn't fight back, James did to give lily time, lily was given a chance to step aside due to Snape's request but she refused, James wasn't given that opportunity and finally it could have required a blood connection given Harry had to live with Petunia to keep it, James isn't blood related to lily. It could be any combination of these that caused it.
