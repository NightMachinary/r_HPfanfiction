Wait, people here think the blood wards don't exist? What. They are absolutely a thing. It isn't even debatable, it's literally referenced numerous times in the books.

It's not called blood wards, but Dumbledore explicitly says Lily's sacrifice allowed him to place a protective charm over Privet Drive to keep Voldemort (and his followers) away.

When Voldemort bypasses Lily's sacrificial magic through taking Harry's blood, the protection over Privet Drive continues to work.

Edit: I am aware the words "blood ward" aren't mentioned. Obviously I'm still referring to the protection set over Privet Drive when I say blood wards. Can we not be pedantic for once.
