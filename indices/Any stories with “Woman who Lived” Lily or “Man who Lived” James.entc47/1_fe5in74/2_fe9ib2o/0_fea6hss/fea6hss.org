I think I remember seeing somewhere (the book about the exhibition in London?) where JKR made several rewrites about how Harry wound up with the Dursleys. Early on the Grangers collected him on an island or something. This suggests to me that the details on Lily's sacrifice were probably worked up much later in the plot building.
