I have read, but would /not/ recommend, a couple of Lily-lives fics, as a result of them being basically the 2nd most common setup (after Peggy Sue) for the pairing I like the most (LESS). There's far too many issues with the premise that those fics simply just ignore (the Prophecy tell being the obvious one, but also the complete lack of redemption at this point, among other things), and the only fic of the kind I'd be willing to recommend would be Puzzle, but that one doesn't fulfill your request anyway because Harry dies in it and Voldemort is still at large.

So if you see a fic with the ship with this premise, unless you really like the ship and are willing to brush over the obvious issues, I suggest skipping them.
