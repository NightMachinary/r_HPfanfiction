I like this analysis, although I do think something like a spilt tea or some such could cause the swapping of parental care, IF the James Potter took an equal share in childcare. I suppose this would make for a less interesting fic, though.

My other thought is that Dumbledore probably would still seek the ring without Snape, because he wants to try the resurrection stone to speak to his sister. Perhaps this would not happen if Lily got the cloak back as Dumbledore would have only the want from the triad.
