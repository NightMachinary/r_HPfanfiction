You forgot to mention that if Lestranges and Barty Jr didn't get caught for attacking the Longbottoms, Barty Sr would have become the Minister, and the Lestranges could have found and resurrected Voldemort much earlier.

The political landscape would have become fundamentally different, and I highly highly doubt that canon plot would have repeated even in its slightest resemblance!
