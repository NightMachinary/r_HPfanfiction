"What's this?" Daphne asked, handing over a flower she had plucked.

"That's a rose," Harry said. "Think of it as the most beautiful flower in the world. It has the most vibrant red petals, soft and yet firm, wrapped in delicate and intricate twirls. Lovers all over the world use this flower to show their love."

She touched the petals, counting them, trying to make an image in her mind.

She sighed in sadness when all she felt was like someone had bundled up a few grass leaves. So many sensations just out of her reach...

"This however..." Harry interrupted her morbid thoughts, as he always did, "are called Wisteria." He handed her a stem with a bunch of flowers on it.

"It doesn't look very impressive," he continued, peeking her interest, "in fact, you could find this growing out like wild flowers."

And he paused. Daphne knew he was baiting her, but she couldn't resist.

"What's the impressive part?" she asked as she ran her hand over the bunch.

Harry held her hand, and brought the flowers closer to her face. She could feel his breath on her neck.

"It smells heavenly."

She inhaled, trying to smell their fragrance. Daphne agreed with Harry, it really did smell heavenly.

"Sometimes," he continued, "all you need is closeness."

And just like that, Harry was walking ahead, leading her by holding her hand.

Of the two, Daphne decided, she liked Wisteria more.
