Honest question, if you like Harry/Daphne but don't like lordships and pureblood culture and politics, what is it exactly about the pairing that you like? Because Daphne Greengrass is literally just a name mentioned once. Take away her fanon Ice Queen persona and she might as well be called Tracey Davis or Millicent Bulstrode (maybe not her) or a completely original character.
