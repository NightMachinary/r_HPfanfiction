  Honest question, if you like Harry/Daphne but don't like lordships and pureblood culture and politics, what is it exactly about the pairing that you like? Because Daphne Greengrass is literally just a name mentioned once. Take away her fanon Ice Queen persona and she might as well be called Tracey Davis or Millicent Bulstrode (maybe not her) or a completely original character.

For me at least, I think it's the fact that Daphne is a Slytherin. It creates so much interesting and complex situations and interactions, and gets me hooked instantly. There's so much questions to answer ("what about her family? how will malfoy/parkinson react? how will ron/hermione react? how will harry's gryffindor-ish personality interact with daphe's slytherin personality?")

This is party why I enjoy "The Changeling" so much, where Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. The dynamics between Ginny and the slytherins are enough to keep me reading. Maybe I'm just inherently interested to Slytherins.

Not gonna lie here, but we all know Daphne is as much of a blank slate as the other Slytherin girls, such as Tracey Davis or Bullstrode. But those characters (Bullstrode at least) aren't represented in a good light at most of the fanfics I read throughout my stay in the fandom - thus causing me to subconsiously favor Daphne Greengrass. Plus, most of the fics I've read of this pairing contains those cliches, so it's a bit refreshing to see a completely different take on the so called "Ice Queen." My request is completely based on fanon - if fanon doesn't exist, this request wouldn't exist. But to me at least, after reading so much fanfiction, there is such a thin line between what's canon and what's fanon that I consider Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass as canon, at least subconsciously. I probably worded it extremely poorly, but that's just my take on the whole Daphne Greengrass thing.
