If you want to put Harry with a Slytherin girl without going full OC, you have 4 choices : ○ Pansy Parkinson ○ Milicent Bulstrode ○ Daphne Greengrass ○ Tracey Davis (And maybe a 5th one with Lily Moon but she is less used , dont know why, and not even sure in Slytherin or Ravenclaw )

From these 4 choices, Pansy is showed as just as bad and Draco (and seem to like him ), and Milicent as big and ugly. So these 2 characters are out (not nice for Milicent but yeah physic does matter in stories ). That leaves Daphne and Tracey. And of the 2, Daphne is favored for several reasons : ○ She does appear in the book (even if only as a name ) while Tracey come from Rowling,s notes ○ Daphne is seen as a pureblood, and Tracey as a Half Blood. Having her being "noble " does add some drama with, for example the potential refusal of her family. ○ Especially with after school fics, Daphne has the advantage to permit the entry of Draco Malfoy in the story as a brother in law. Usefull for the ones who dont want to have Draco as some kind of nemesis.

So yeah Daphne is popular because she is the best non OC candidate every time author want to ship Harry with a Slytherin. And people dont use OC because OC dont have the best reputation (cause writing name is hard, and too much self insert I guess ) and Daphne is basically an OC with a recognisable name.
