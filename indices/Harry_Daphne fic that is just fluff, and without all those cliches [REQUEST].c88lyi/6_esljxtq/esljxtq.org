I've been on the hunt for actually good Haphne stories for a while and haven't had much luck. I actually really like the fanon version of Daphne but most stories are just trash. The only thing I loved was Contractual Invalidation and even that leaned heavily on those tropes you mentioned but the author was good enough to mostly pull it off.

So I have nothing to recommend you, but thank you for Ice Cream, it was awesome.
