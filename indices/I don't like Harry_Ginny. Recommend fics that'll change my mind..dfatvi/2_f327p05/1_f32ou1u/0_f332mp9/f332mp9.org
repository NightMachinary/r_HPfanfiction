Actually, I would start with linkao3(Grave Days by Northumbrian) (and before that non-Ginny-related linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian)) and then linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian). I have a bit ambiguous relationship with Strangers (see [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][my review]]): they are excellent, but it is frustrating, how close they got to be REALLY great, and they missed. At least (as 99% of all fanfiction) I would start with cutting them to half, but not only that (see that review).
