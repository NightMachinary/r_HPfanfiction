I have the creature vault book and it is gorgeous to look at. There are many tidbits of information on the creatures, the shape shifters, etc.

How they conceptualised them, pictures of these concepts, when they where in the movies etc. Tons of pictures and text on the single creatures that where used in the films and also the books. I think most of the info can be found on the wiki, but it is nice to have anyways. :)
