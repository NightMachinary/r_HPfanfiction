Character bashing. Dursleys, Dumbledore, Ginny, whatever, I find myself dropping fanfics in the blink of an eye if there's character bashing that turns them into one-dimensional screeching banshees and bumbling idiots.

I used to like them, but then as I grew up I realized that part of Harry Potter's appeal as an adult is that everyone and everything is so morally /complex/. I just can't bring myself to hate any character!

(Also, you know those dark!Harry fanfiction where it turns out that muggles and muggleborns are, in fact, wiping out the wizarding population with their dirty blood, and Voldemort is totally in the right? That too. Lil' bit off-putting.)
