Heram! Oh dear god, just... Harry could like that sort of thing, but due to how society is in those days and even now, it is not something that EVERYONE would like.

Independent Harry! Oh, yes, an eleven-year-old child who has lived in a cupboard will be able to make money making changes to his finances and be go around finding extremely powerful magical items such as a house in a chest or some magical familiar. NO, HE IS ELEVEN OR FIFTEEN, HE IS NOT DOING THAT!

Sympathetic Slytherin house! Salazar can be sympathetic and mostly did the Purist things to protect the wizards from prosecution and have the basilisk there to protect the school... BUT Slytherins, the main group of Slytherins from Hogwarts, are not nice.

Harry is heir to ...! Okay, Harry in canon is heir/descended to The Potters, The Youngest of the Brothers, and the Blacks. No one else. The only way he is Heir to someone else is if they add that in their inheritance. You can have a creative way of doing that like Harry becomes the Heir to Arthur if he draws the sword from the stone, or if something else like that happens, but not having him be heir to every famous being because of reasons.

Other countries are superior! Yes, another country could be a bit more progressive with their policies or something like that, but THEY WILL NOT BE SOME ADVANCED CULTURE THAT LEAVES THE UK IN THE DIRT! No super advanced America that can fix eyesight and kill Horcruxes or so progressive they have Magi-tech, IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY!

I have more but these are the ones that stand out the most.
