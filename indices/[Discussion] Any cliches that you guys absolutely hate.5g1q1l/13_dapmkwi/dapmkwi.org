  I'd have to go for the one where Harry goes to meet the founders (which are inexplicably as respected as Merlin for some reason) and gets awesome powers, owns Hogwarts (who is naturally a lady) and then gets like ten girls to go in his harem. I mean, they're POPULAR but I despise them. Anyone else?

It was very nicely done in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging]]), not the harem part, though. Completely subverted too.
