  Also, characters (other than Lavender) giggling. That annoys me every time I see it, and I see it a lot. It was my main problem with the Draco Trilogy- Hermione is giggling left right and centre, often raising a hand to cover her teeth. I wasn't especially stern, bookish or tomboyish in school, but none of my friends giggled. Rant over.

Have a list of people other than Lavender, including Hermione btw., giggling from canon then:

--------------

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harrys amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.

--------------

I dont mind them dead, said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. I just dont like the way they move.

Hermione giggled.

--------------

The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.

--------------

What do we want to be prefects for? said George, looking revolted at the very idea. Itd take all the fun out of life.

Ginny giggled.

--------------

Oh, what rubbish, said Hermione impatiently. Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else dyou think

That cats got it in for Scabbers! said Ron, ignoring the people around him, who were starting to giggle. And Scabbers was here first, and hes ill!

--------------

Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.

What? said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.

Hes that tall, good-looking one, isnt he? said Angelina.

Strong and silent, said Katie, and they started to giggle again.

--------------

And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as this is stupid kept drifting across it. It didnt help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.

--------------

Im not putting them on, said old Archie in indignation. I like a healthy breeze round my privates, thanks.

Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.

--------------

He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snapes back.

--------------

Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.

--------------

The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.

Lairy fights, thats the one! she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside.

--------------

Myrtle! Harry tried to shout but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.

--------------

There they are, there they are! she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.

--------------

Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. Scarlet woman? she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron.

--------------

He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny giggled.

--------------

Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.

--------------

Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.

Oooh, who tried to get upstairs? they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron.

--------------

Dont ask, Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled. She giggled.

--------------

Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles. No because well it sounds like grunting a lot of the time.

--------------

Assuming they can understand you, of course, said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville.

--------------

Potter and Chang! screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles. Urgh, Chang, I dont think much of your taste. At least Diggory was good-looking!

--------------

And what about Ron? said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harrys robes.

--------------

Oh yes didnt you know? said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.

--------------

She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice.

--------------

Yeah, Im really going to tell you, because its your business, Potter, sneered Malfoy. Youd better hurry up, theyll be waiting for the Chosen Captain the Boy Who Scored whatever they call you these days.

One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle.

--------------

Id be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me, said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.

--------------

Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other people were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling,

--------------

A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.

--------------

Hes not long for this world anyway, if you ask me! said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sisters wheezing giggles. Look at him whats happened to you, then, Dumby?

--------------

Shes not that bad, said Harry. Ugly, though, he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.

--------------

The Orders got one thing right, then, eh? said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.

--------------

Excuse me? said Hermione, giggling. What was that last one?

--------------

Not so fast, Your Holeyness, said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession, he said, Here permettez-moi to assister vous, to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside.

--------------

Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons.

--------------

Hermione, we havent got anything to change into, Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.

--------------

But Im fine, said Lily, still giggling. Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.

--------------

Does he? said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. And are you tempted to join him?
