Harry is, for some unexplained reason, a genius. Despite there being no canon reason for this. Also, characters (other than Lavender) /giggling/. That annoys me every time I see it, and I see it a /lot/. It was my main problem with the Draco Trilogy- Hermione is giggling left right and centre, often raising a hand to cover her teeth. I wasn't especially stern, bookish or tomboyish in school, but none of my friends giggled. Rant over.
