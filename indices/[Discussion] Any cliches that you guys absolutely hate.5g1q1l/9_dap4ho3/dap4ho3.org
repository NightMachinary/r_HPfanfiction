Any fic where Harry is grossly OP compared to everyone else. I do enjoy independent!Harry fics where he gradually develops skills over a course of years (e.g. Denarian Saga) rather than reading some books in his trunk/house over summer following OOTP

Also I hate overbearing romance. I really enjoyed To Fight the Coming Darkness but the mushy Harry/Susan ship made me openly cringe at least a dozen times.

Also I have a raging anti-boner to most anything time-travel, like if Harry can go back why the hell can't Voldy and do shit right in the 1st war? It's a plot-line I find very dubious
