Murder-Hobo Harry, I deal with this enough in D&D I don't need Harry thinking that snuffing out a life is the best solution to everything. There is a difference between what is easy and what is right. Also, I am truly a pacifist at heart. The thought of murder being the answer, yet alone the first answer sickens me.
