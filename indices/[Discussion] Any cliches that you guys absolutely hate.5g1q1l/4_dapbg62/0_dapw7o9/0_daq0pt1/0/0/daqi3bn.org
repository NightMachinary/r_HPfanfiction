I only have one WIP posted so far, linkffn(12059181). I always appreciate reviews :-)

The best Snarry I've ever read, in my opinion, is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714?view_adult=true][Chrysalis]] if you want to give it a shot. It's set after the war, Harry has PTSD, everyone thinks Snape is dead, the relationship is slow building.
