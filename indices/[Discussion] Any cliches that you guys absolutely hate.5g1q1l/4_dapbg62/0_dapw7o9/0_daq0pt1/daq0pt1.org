I'll be honest, I am a huge Snarry reader. Hell, I /write/ Snarry. So I think part of my issue is that you have to have a mature Harry if you're going to pair him with an older character. Having abuse that causes mental age regression, and then having any interaction with a character that I usually (personally) view as a partner, it wigs me out. Also, I am and I know enough abuse victims. While I know that there are cases where an abuse victim suffers so much abuse that they revert to a younger "safer" age, I've never met anyone that that has happened to. I can't relate to it at all, and I highly doubt that the author can either.

On the flip side of that, I have read a few fics that portray abused or after-war Harry as having obvious PTSD. Most of these read very accurately, and are very relatable to me.
