I hate abused blubbering mess Harry. I'm fine with kicking the crap out of Harry if it makes him snap and kill people or go dark or even run away or whatever, but when the author writes an abused teenager acting like a five year old, complete with cuddles and teddy bears, I get a bit offended.

Whiny Draco. Yes, Draco was a spoiled prat with mummy and daddy issues. He was not five.

Ok, I just realized that everything else I was going to say could be summed up very easily. I hate reading about children acting below their age. I have an 11 year old brother. I'm a stomp team coach at a middle school. I know how 11-17 year olds act, and if the author makes them act too young, childish, etc, it bothers me.
