Where Hermione is a massive Mary Sue who's amazing at everything with no flaws and is basically the god of magic and exposition because she read some book about that once in between her correcting that red headed death eater guy that nobody really cares that much about because he's probably fucking his sister to love potion Harry who is even better at magicalness and politics than "Mione" because he's serious and powerful and being a pure blood gives him unfathomable wealth and power but for some reason it doesn't happen to other puree bloods because he's the descendent of Ghengis Khan and Charliemenge's incestuous daughters cousin who killed Merlin or something but nobody else knows this because Dumbledore (Bumbleydoor) and his insert poorly thought out nickname for the order here have conspired to hide it from him except for tonks because shapeshifting chicks are hot and the author really wishes he could bang mystique transformed into an anime character but he can't because he's trapped inside real life and hasn't figured a way to enter my little pony legally in his state but back to potter who might as well be a eugenics test to assure neonazis of the superiority of the Aryan race at this point also has anger issues and overreacts with powerful accidental magical killing intent whenever someone says something bad about his harem usually in the great Hall so that there's an awesome in spired scene and a Dumbledore is useless part and Harry is usually some sort of anti sex guy or something even though he's 17 or something and wants to wait for marriage like the author says he is but it's really because he hasn't had a date in years and hasn't kissed a girl since his mother passed which isn't the case for Harry because his harem makes sure to be as helpless as possible whenever on screen but very powerful off screen which has always weirded me out and made me assume that the author is actually just repressing his furry fetish and secretly lusting after Squirrel Girl because he likes being dominated in the dark.
