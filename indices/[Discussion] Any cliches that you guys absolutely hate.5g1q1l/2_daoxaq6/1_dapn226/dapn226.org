  Everyone is the Heir to a Most Ancient and Noble House.

Actually, it make sense. If you have nobility, their kids are likely to go to the same school. This alone doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that those fics are usually poorly written and thought out.

  Also, every 12-year-old is suddenly speaking and acting like Churchil.

Don't care much. Sure it's better when they sound a bit like kids, but honestly, I preffer that rather than if they were actually speaking like 12 y.o. So, why are they speaking like Churchill? Cause of magic! Works for me actually.

I want interresting characters and compelling plot. I don't care much for realism mot of the time.
