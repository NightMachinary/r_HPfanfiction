  Merlin was some guy who made magic available to anyone who could use it

I directly quote the wiki here:

  Merlin was born sometime during the medieval era. During his formative years, he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,...

So we can deduce that Merlin wasn't the first magic user and he also didn't bring it to the "lowborn wizard". That was the Founders doing. Those 4 bound together to build a school, and here one has to remember what that actually meant. A school in the middle ages was a huge deal. Monasteries and Clerical Colleges were basically all there was next to individual education through mentors and tutors. Building a school in that time meant also building the intellectual hotspot of an entire culture, maybe even for a continent since it would take around 200 years until Durmstrang was founded and another 100 years until France got Beauxbatons going. To put that into perspective, about the same amount of time was necessary to make Bagdad and the entire Euphrat and Tigris region such a intellectual powerhouse that disciplines such as Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics,... directly trace back much of their fundamentals to that era. Its reasonable to say that Hogwarts was to the magical world what the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom]["House of Wisdom"]] of Bagdad was for the medieval world.

So, for all intents and purposes, the Founders were as big a deal as Merlin in the HP lore.
