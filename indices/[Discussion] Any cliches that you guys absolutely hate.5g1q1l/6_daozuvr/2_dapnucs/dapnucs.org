The broom part doesn't bothers me much. Sure it's lazy, but...

I agree to the rest. Although bashing sometimes makes me laugh.

Magical cores are just stupid. There's no better way to remove 'magic' from HP's magic. I'm willing to put up with it if the rest of the fic is good (and if there's not too much of the part about the power levels), but it is always cringeworthy. There's better ways to show that your character is more powerful than usual, I reckon.
