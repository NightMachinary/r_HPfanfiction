Well, to be fair, the Founders were probably as important for magical progress as Guttenberg was for literacy. So its kinda understandable that people would make them out to be (inter-)national paragons.

Personally, I loathe bashing. Especially overly stupid bashing of Ron or the Weasleys in general and most of all the manipulative Dumbledore who for some reason has everybody fooled /but/ a 14 year old "Lord" Potter. I mean, if you want tot write these people as the villains, go ahead. That is what fanfiction is for. But if I read Dumbledore musing about how he "needs to bring Harry back to the light, for the greater good" and then proceeding to do everything to alienate Harry, I'll drop the fic and block it in my browser to remind me what a shitfest it is.

Another little pet peeve of me: Muscles gained from Quidditch. While I can subscribe to the notion that flying a broom requires some good core muscles and probably also some strength in the arm, its not exactly a full-body-workout. If you want your Harry to be athletic, with a sixbag that makes any hetero woman drool, then choose some other reason than "he flew a lot on his broom".

Last one: Magical Cores. I can see why people want to restrain the HP magic system in some of their fics. But I find the Magical Core to be a lazy and uninspired solution. It gets especially stupid when it goes into Anime-esque areas of powerlevels and Shonen-like level-ups.
