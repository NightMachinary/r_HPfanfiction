Poor misunderstood Slytherins who are alright guys bullied by the evil Gryffindors and those ignorant mudbloods. It's one thing to make them a bit more sympathetic than the caricatures we see in the series, but when a story tries to excuse bigotry and worse, it just makes me think "Birth of a Nation 2.0 - it's all the mudbloods' faults".
