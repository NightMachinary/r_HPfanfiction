Well, 'all Slytherins are evil' doesn't make much sense either. I've actually never seen the part with the mudbloods. Maybe I'm lucky...

I've actually not much trouble imagining some bullies!Gryffindors, either. In a Slytherin-centric fic you'll see only them though. Just like in canon we only see evil!slytherins.
