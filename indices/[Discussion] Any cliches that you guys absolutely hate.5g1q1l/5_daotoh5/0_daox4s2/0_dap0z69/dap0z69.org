Slytherin!Harry could be really interesting, but they almost always devolve into Harry becoming this political mastermind who conquers house Slyterhin (as a first or second year no less).

Harry is not a social butterfly, he already had enough problems in Gryffindor, where he is seen as a Hero, who rescued everyone by getting rid of Voldemort.
