For the most part you can compare potions to prescription drugs, which can be abused, but are legal. Usually they are given to you by a mediwizard/witch or healer, and occasionally taken yourself after being prescribed. Or in some rare cases, given to you by someone else legally allowed (like a master potion maker).

However by that same logic you can also compare some of the "darker" potions to illegal drugs of all sorts. And a good potion maker or alchemist could also cater towards the black market, similar to folks cooking up certain drugs.
