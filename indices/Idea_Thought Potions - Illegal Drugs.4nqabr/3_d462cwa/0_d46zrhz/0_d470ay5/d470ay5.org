ooohh no no no no noooo. No. While Snape is an ancillary character in many of my favorite stories, usually shown in such a way to help redeem his character, but in no way do I EVER read SnapeCentric fics. In fact, when I do read bash fics, Snape is often the bashee of choice.

It's just a weird coincidence the stories I find the best written have a character I despise written well enough that I almost regret his eventual and cathartic death.

If you haven't read LittleWhiteCat's Harry Potter/Warhammer 40000 series, you should. Snape's portrayal is hilarious though sadly he survives the story. And Sirius's portrayal is pretty damn good too.
