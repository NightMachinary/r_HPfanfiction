I've read fanfics where addiction to pain-relief potions have been brought up, as well as general narcotic uses of potions: by no means do I think it's never brought up.

I think there are some explanations - for example, it could be the case that potions are only ever made with non-addictive properties, as opposed to a Muggle opiate or the like, and it could also be the case that there are spells and potions to end dependences on certain substances.

I think the limiting factor, as it were, is just the difficulty there might be in writing the topic.

Addiction can be something difficult to tackle, as it's a complex and often subtle thing IRL, and most fanfics don't really want subtlety - they want instant angst.

I've seen fics that tackle alcohol addiction in an interesting way, and I've seen a mix of thoughts on cigarettes and smoking, but consider this: wizards, the original vapers.

I feel like most of what's learned in Hogwarts, re: Potions, is the equivalent of what I learnt in woodshop - I can solder a simple circuit, make a doorbell and a shitty birdhouse, but I couldn't build my own porch. Harry Potter might be able to brew a boil remover and some sleeping draught, but he wouldn't necessarily be able to brew the wizarding equivalent of crystal meth.

Much as I'm sure Snape campaigned to add that to the syllabus, I doubt his request was approved.
