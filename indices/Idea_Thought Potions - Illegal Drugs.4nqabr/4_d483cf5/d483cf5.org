There's Chapter 16 in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file]]), with a Dark!Trio in which Hermione is a drug dealer.

Me, I've been wanting to see a fic where Hermione goes through a similar character arc to Walter White in /Breaking Bad/. I think that it could work: both are very smart, decently socialized if a bit awkward, with a massive reserve of hubris and ruthlessness hidden underneath.
