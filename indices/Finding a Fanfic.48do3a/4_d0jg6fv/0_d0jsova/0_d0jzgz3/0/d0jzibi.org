  Book I of the E're Series: "I can't do the equation without all the variables." Tony Stark has always had to deal with variables. But when he miscalculates a new one everything he knows changes. There is a new player in the game, one that will shake up the world, and leave nothing the same. The very future of every world rests on the unknown. Hp isn't a big factor till book II. R&R
