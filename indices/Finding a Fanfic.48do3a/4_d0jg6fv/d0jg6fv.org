I'm also looking for a fanfic, it is a harry potter/avengers fanfic as far as I can remember, the story is that harry becomes a endless but Fate hates the fact he gets more attention than her because he is the new endless so she tricks him into endlessly reincarnating and in the latest instance of his life he was born a female and is the daughter of tony stark and a woman he used to date in college, she then goes on to begin interning at Stark towers so she can see what type of person her father is but she ends up getting kidnapped along with tony and ends up in the cave with him to which she then confesses to being his daughter after the guy in the cave says that she should. Anyway that's about as much as I can remember about it if anyone knows what it is please let me know.
