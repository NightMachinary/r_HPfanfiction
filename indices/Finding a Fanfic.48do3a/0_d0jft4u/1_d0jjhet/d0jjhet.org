I was going to comment on the fact you called it bad, but then I read the first chapter. You... you aren't wrong. Normally I like to think with longer stories that the author has put a decent amount of time into the story, because god knows I have for my longer ones. However it looks like this person has the ability to write a long time about nothing, not proofread, give no back story, and put out a chapter.
