There was one where Harry was raised to be the Dark Prince and is on the Death Eaters side. Very capable at combat magic and dual wielding. Think Voldemort lived through the Halloween and he and Bella taught Harry to fight. Can't remember it's name T-T, but Specifically he was fighting the order as a young teen and used one wand to create a earthquake tremor while using the order to drill a hole through the floor so he could escape was one of the first scenes.
