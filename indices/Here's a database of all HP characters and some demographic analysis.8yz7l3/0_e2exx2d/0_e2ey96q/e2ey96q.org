Yes, Dumbledore's mother Kendra was Muggle-born and Umbridge's mother was a Muggle according to Pottermore.

Half-bloods are disproportionately important in the series. Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Snape - arguably the four characters who do the most to advance the plot - are all half-bloods. It makes sense given the series is about a war over blood supremacy but I enjoy fanfiction that gives the Muggle-born or even Muggle perspective on it all since it feels like that's missing from the series. Ted and Andromeda Tonks have a good argument for best romance (Romeo + Juliet style) in all of Harry Potter.
