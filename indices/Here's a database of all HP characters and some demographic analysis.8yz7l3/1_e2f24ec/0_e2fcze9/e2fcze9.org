The numbers don't change much for only Harry's year.

It's interesting to reject the entire system. If we consider blood status as analogous to race, I feel that would make JKR somewhat more progressive than most of the world today. Many people acknowledge "race is a social construct" but not many propose that we stop categorizing ourselves that way. To do so feels a bit naive because it glosses over any discrimination that still exists.

I actually tried to compare the blood purity of 'successful' people to see if there was a bias compared to the general population (ie prefects and head students), but the sample size is too small.

The subjectivity of defining 'pure' does make sense when reconciling Ron's statement with these other facts. By the grandparents definition, Harry's kids would be purebloods, though I doubt they would identify that way culturally.
