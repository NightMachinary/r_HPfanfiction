Interesting project, though I feel ultimately that (as you note) we simply don't have a broad enough sample of the wizarding population to know for sure. I'd almost be tempted to limit it to Harry's year, since there at least we have a good cross-section, whereas all the other characters we know of are introduced for plot reasons (for example, we know a disproportionate number of Death Eaters, which likely taints the results).

With regards to the disparity between Ron's comment ("most people are half-bloods") and the stats coming out of this, I think they can be reconciled with the fact of the two main definitions of "pure-blood" you mention.

There's the technical definition, which JKR has stated to be grandparents.

Then there's the political definition, i.e. the one used by Death Eaters and those like them, which is not having any Muggle ancestry at all. The latter is more about politics than actual ancestry, because in reality there would be no "pure-bloods" by this definition (except, perhaps, the Gaunts, who took inbreeding to the next level). To qualify as a pure-blood, therefore, you must gain acceptance of the group that uses this extreme definition, i.e. by aligning yourself with them politically and following their practices, which include obliterating any record of any familial connection to Muggles (see: the heavily redacted Black family tree). It's essentially a group delusion.

The latter is why it's no big deal that Voldemort is actually a half-blood. The whole political faction is premised upon erasing the actual past and making up a fake past for your family.

It's an important point, often missed in the fandom, that Dumbledore and the Order reject both these definitions, not just the latter one. Dumbledore's philosophy is not equality between "Pure-bloods" and "Muggleborns". His philosophy is to reject the entire classification system. He never refers to purity of blood without use of the phrase "so-called".

Anyway, the point here is that the same person can be described as half-blood (by the strict definition) and pure-blood (by the technical definition). I suppose that Ron, who doesn't believe in purity of blood, defaults to assuming that people are referring to the strict definition which is the one used by the most fanatical proponents of blood purity.
