If we look at a list of all the characters we find out that 10% are muggleborns, 30% are half blood, and the rest are pureblood - more purebloods than you might expect.

We know very little about Hogwarts other than Harry's year, but Slytherin is the 'purest' house by a lot. Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are the least pure, but we barely know anything about them.

There are very few muggleborns and the only one the series focuses on much is Hermione. Most of the important characters are half-bloods.
