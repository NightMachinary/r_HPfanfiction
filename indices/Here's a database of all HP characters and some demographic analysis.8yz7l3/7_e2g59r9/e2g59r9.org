How about, instead of downvoting my comment asking for help and clarity, someone actually GIVES THAT HELP AND CLARITY LIKE A DECENT HUMAN BEING PLEASE? I didn't think it was so wrong to want to understand something you can't understand. To ASK FOR HELP with it. But apparently it is. Asking for help is wrong. Wanting to understand is wrong.
