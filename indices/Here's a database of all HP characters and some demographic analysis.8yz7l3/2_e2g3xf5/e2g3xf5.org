I created a mathematical model of the demographics of the wizarding world a while back and got surprisingly similar results to your book survey. The calculation was based on 2 assumptions:

1. 10% of the magical population is muggle-born (which I estimated from the Original 40 list).
2. The large majority of the population marries in the magical world, and their marriage patterns reflect the demographics of the population as a whole.

If you propagate blood status through many generations based on those two assumptions, then based on the broadest definition of "pure-blood" (all 4 grandparents being magical), you get 10% muggle-born, 44% half-blood, and 46% pure-blood. For purists who say that's not good enough, the number of "pure-bloods" roughly halves for each additional generation you require.

I'm sure JKR didn't do the math, but I think it's plausible to say that your analysis actually does reflect her intent.
