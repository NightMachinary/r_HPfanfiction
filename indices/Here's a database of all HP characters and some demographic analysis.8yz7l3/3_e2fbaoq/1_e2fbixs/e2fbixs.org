And then there's supporting the naming of Moaning Myrtle from Cursed Child, which I just totally refuse to do lol. JKR gave her the name Myrtle Elizabeth Warren which is a case of parallel thinking or Cryptomnesia (a term for when you're absolutely certain you've come up with an original idea, only to discover after the fact that you had heard of it elsewhere).

J.K. Rowling has shown herself to be a news enthusiast, especially when it comes to the American media. As well, she has exhibited a clear favoritism toward progressive ideals (I'm not making any political statements here so please don't @ me). One of the leaders of the American progressive movement is a woman named...wait for it... Elizabeth Warren. She's extremely significant to American politics, and a household name here in the U.S.

It's possible that JKR, as a Brit, would overlook this obvious example of parallel thinking. For something that would hit a little closer to home, I'd need to say something like Mrs. Norris had a full name. It was Kate Middleton Norris.

It's a clear mistake. Not that she would ever admit to it. But that's why I can't get behind the name.
