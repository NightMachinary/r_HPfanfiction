While I'm impressed with this list, bravo, I have a few issues.

First off, the problem with using the wiki for your sourcing is that they mix everything together from all available content. You label characters "book canon" and yet give them first names that were never in the books.

Quirinus Quirrell, Garrick Ollivander, Rolanda Hooch, Mykew Gregorovitch, Graham Montague, to name a few.

This is why I think we need to have more specificity in categorizing Harry Potter Canon. If it's explicitly "book canon" (or OS-Canon for original source material), then it shouldn't include the first names given through Harry Potter card sets and video games. Those details would be from a broader wizarding world continuity canon (or WW-Canon for short).

However, big laughs for:

First Name - Fat

Surname - Lady
