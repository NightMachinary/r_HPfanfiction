Thanks.

Yes, I based canonicity on whether the character is simply mentioned at all in the books. Biographical details are often filled in later via Pottermore and other sources. It seems too complicated to attribute each individual piece of information within a spreadsheet to its source, but you can always consult the relevant wiki page which will often have references for everything.

I think Remus mentions his father (not listed on the spreadsheet) in the books once, but doesn't give his name or any other information. Pottermore gives "Lyall Lupin" a full background story. Is the character canon? Well, slightly, but the mention isn't necessary - we know Remus must have a father. So it's up to you whether to go with Pottermore or your own interpretation.
