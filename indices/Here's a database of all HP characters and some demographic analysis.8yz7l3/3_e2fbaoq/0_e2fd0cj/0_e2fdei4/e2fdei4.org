It's certainly complicated! It's MUCH easier to just look things up on a wiki. I guess I see myself as a canon purist when it comes to writing fanfic. Book canon, that is. The story can go wherever I want it to go, as long as it is consistent with established content from the books. Upside to this would be that if the first names aren't listed in the books, then I feel like I am "allowed" to name them whatever I want in my spinoff sort of head-canon. Plotholes can be filled, lingering questions can be answered, and anything that is ambiguous or left unspecified can be finalized by the fanfic author. It's a radical and very specific style of fanfic. And time-consuming. But I love it.
