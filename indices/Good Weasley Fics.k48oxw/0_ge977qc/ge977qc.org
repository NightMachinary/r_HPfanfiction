Well...the Weasleys are generally considered to be "good" in canon. So I would suggest that the majority of fanfics portray them as good.

Harry's interactions with the various Weasleys are a major part of the storyline of linksiye([[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]), if that interests you.
