I can't be the only person that couldn't get past the first few chapters in Child of the Storm right? I really wanted to get into it because it is a fic with 800k+ words,

but the author made so many of the characters know each other, be squibs, somehow related to each other (wizards being shield agents and so on) before the second chapter was even done that the world felt minuscule.

The best part of crossovers is the characters discovering and interacting with the new characters and their new world.

I felt like the author robbed the readers of that in a way by making all those alternative relations and origins stories right at the start.
