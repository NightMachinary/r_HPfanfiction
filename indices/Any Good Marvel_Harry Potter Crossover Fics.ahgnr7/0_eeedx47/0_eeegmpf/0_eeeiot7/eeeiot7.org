I'm very familiar with both universes so it was a nice change to not have an origin story for all the characters. For example, I am well aware of who Professor X and the X-Men are so I don't need half a chapter going over their backstories. So Professor X is Tony Stark's godfather. The Scarlet Witch is Harry's godmother and is {REDACTED}'s mother. Harry Dresden is Harry Dresden. I know those people so I don't need an explanation as to who they are. I'd rather just have the story continue.

Harry is still getting to know the people so there is that. It's just the adults that know of each other, usually because of WW2 or the first Wizarding War.
