I don't really have a favorite because I can't choose and no one story eclipses the other.

*Complete Stories*: A Cadmean Victory, Blindness, Letters, A Forgotten Contract, Half-Blood Romantic, and Too Young to Die.

*Complete Shorts*: Ruthless and Ice Cream by Andrius are my favorite shorts. The latter being the fluffiest Harry/Daphne shit I have ever seen and enjoyed.

*Incomplete Stories:* I'm Still Here, Deprived, and Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived.

I lied, HP and the BWL would easily be my favorite story if it was complete.

I would recommend Deprived based on your fic list. It's a guilty pleasure OP Harry trip. A Champions New Hope and Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent are two enjoyable Daphne fics.
