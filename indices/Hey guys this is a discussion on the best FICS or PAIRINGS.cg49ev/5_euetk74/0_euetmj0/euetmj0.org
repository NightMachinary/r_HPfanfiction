  Of all things Edward was prepared for as the day of reckoning grew near, being transported from one world on the edge of war to another was not one of them. AKA: Edward gets accidentally summoned by Death Eaters, and neither party is happy. (Pre-Promise Day, HP book 5)

  Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter have decided fifth year is going to be their year; the year everything falls into place for them both and the year they show the bullies they aren't afraid of them. Scorpius receives a prefect badge and Albus is going to join the Quidditch team, if Scorpius can just convince him that he should try out. It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?

  COMPLETE! Ed has been MIA for months, and when Roy finally finds him, he is blind and more than just physically injured. With the State honorably discharging him, and no father to speak of, Roy has no choice but to care for the boy and try to put the pieces back together. Parental!Roy. Rating for injury and violence, just to be safe.
