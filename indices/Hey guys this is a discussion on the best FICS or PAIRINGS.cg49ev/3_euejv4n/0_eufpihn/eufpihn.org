  Magical Animagus is just plain unrealistic.

I think this came about because someone thought it'd make whoever has it (usually Harry) seem super duper ultra special and unique, possibly even with a magical power level that's over 9000 too. And then, because of the nature of fanfic creation where concepts (no matter their quality or lack thereof) get copied ad infinitum, you end up seeing it everywhere, and people become convinced that it must be canon, because everyone else is doing it in their stories too.
