Magical Animagus is just plain unrealistic. What's wrong with a nice and simple cat? Fully capable of sneaking around Hogwarts or Knockturn, can easily escape any situation as long as the form isn't known, and perfectly canon compliant.

As for pairings I don't like Daphne too much as she's really just a blank slate for authors to shoehorn any character they want into. I prefer a more well established character pairing like Harry/Hermione, Ron/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, George/Hermione or Harry/Luna.

Fics I like:

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Hermione main, spellcrafting worldbuilding focused, interesting new inventions and badass battles. Worried about magic nukes? Let's win a magical physics nobel prize equivalent.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Epic revenge against the purebloods who framed her. Capable cat (literally) burglar Hermione vs auror Harry and Ron.

Linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)

Interesting political Harry with a furry little secret and an adopted family of dentists.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Openly racist nazi bigoted elitist nazi purebloods, meet our new friends: Semtex plastic explosives, courtesy of the IRA, and SG 550 assault rifles imported from Switzerland. They work beautifully against your outdated wards that haven't been updated in decades. Sincerely, the resisting muggleborns.
