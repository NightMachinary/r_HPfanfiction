linkffn(Harry Potter and the Jade Dragon) has Harry and Hermione going to the school in Japan to finish their schooling after book 7.

Edit: I should warn you that it's a very slow pacing. It takes like 75 chapters for H&H to go to Japan, even though only 2 months have elapsed in the story. Lots of excellent world building though.
