Post book 7. H&H had multiple offers from other schools to finish their NEWTS and they decided in the one in Japan. Ron decided to go straight to Auror training. As such he's barely in the story.

Ron and Hermione are "technically" dating but the extreme distance is putting a strain on the relationship.
