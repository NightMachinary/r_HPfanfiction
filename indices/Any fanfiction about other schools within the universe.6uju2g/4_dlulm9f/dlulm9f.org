Brave New World by Bellerophon30 was based on Harry escaping to America after the end of year 5. It's gone from ffnet but can be found [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/ofc/bnw/a/0/The+Brave+New+World/bellerophon30/40][here]].

linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity) is the first of four excellent fics about a witch attending an American school called Charmbridge. None of the Potter characters show up but the world is meant to be the same, using similar spells and such.

linkffn(HP and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi) is a well-regarded story where Harry attends Durmstrang.
