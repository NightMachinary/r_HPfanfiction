Rowling wanted to write Hermione as being unusually intelligent. She actually wrote Hermione as an unusually dedicated student. It would be in keeping with canon if Hermione were bad at everything by nature but made up with it by working absurdly hard. The reason she gets good grades is that she begins studying five months in advance of the exams.

It would also be in keeping with canon if Hermione were actually that smart, didn't need to study all that much, but used her study habits as a smokescreen in a vain attempt to make people think she's not all that better than they are -- to make herself more socially acceptable. The reason she gets good grades is that she finds the material trivial to learn and recall at need, at least in a school setting.

In either case, it's likely that she would have gotten an O in Defence without Dumbledore's Army. She has enough time blocked off on her calendar to study Defence if she needs to. If anything, she might have scored better if she'd had more time to study on her own.
