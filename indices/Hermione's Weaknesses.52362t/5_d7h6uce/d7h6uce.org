Her weakness stems from practical applications. She can read and understand theories of magic with the best of them, but see her dealing with Potions in Year Six. She has little creative energy to invent new solutions. That's what sets her apart from, say, Dumbledore.

Take the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in Book 5. The killing curse is supposed to be unblockable, but he blocked it several times using ingenious methods, even using Fawkes as a shield.

I think that Hermoine in the exact position would realize fast all the details about the killing curse: mainly how unblockable it is. Seeing no way out of it, she'd lock up and take a full splash of deadly green to the face.

Conversely, Harry sucks at the theory part of magic, but excels at the actual practical use of it.
