I think Hermoine is massively over-hyped when it comes to her 'genius'. To me, it seems like in order for her to do well she needs to know the theory behind it, IMHO she may be good at using spells consistently but she doesn't master them as well as Harry. She may get the disarming charm down on the first try (and repeat it with the same results over and over) but after Harry's third, he would be able to disarm someone and knock them back with the force of his spell.
