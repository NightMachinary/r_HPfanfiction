I absolutely agree with you and just wanted to add that sometimes Hermione would practise a spell that hadn't yet been introduced in class yet. Example: the summoning charm in GoF on the train ride to Hogwarts.

Which means that she got it right on her first try in class because it hadn't been her actual first try.
