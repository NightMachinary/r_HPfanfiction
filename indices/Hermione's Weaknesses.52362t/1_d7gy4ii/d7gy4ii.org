  what types of magic is Hermione not good at?
#+end_quote

I think the answer to this is in a precursor question: "Why is Hermione successful academically?"

In canon, she frequently studies by reading in the library, makes copious notes during lectures, and is an organisational wunderkind. The fruits of these labours frequently appeared whenever JKR needed the plot to advance.

Fanfic authors take a shortcut and often say that Hermione is 'naturally' brilliant (a savant or something similar).

In my view, Hermione is good at types of magic that:

1. Can be learned primarily through texts.

2. She feels confident performing.

3. The author needs her to know in order to solve a plot issue.

Divination and broom riding fail the first test, Defence Against the Dark Arts (pre-OOtP) fails the second, but the third can get fanfic authors out of sticky situations.

It's important to note that Hermione suffers from occasional tunnel-vision, particularly when it comes to researching topics of non-academic mysteries like Nicholas Flamel's accomplishments or the Half-Blood Prince's identity.
