And on a more random note, I will note that this means the whole plot of the Harry Potter series started not because of a prophecy but rather because Divination was taken seriously. Because had Albus deemed it a subject unworthy of being taught at Hogwarts to the point where he wouldn't have even given her a chance, it's likely that she would have been at home when she made the prophecy and thus nobody would have heard it. And this kind of prophecy would have only worked had it been heard, so it might not have been made at all.

Thus, the prophecy was made because Albus /chose/ not to dismiss it, and it got fulfilled because Tom /chose/ not to dismiss it either. Yup, free will there. It's so twisted that it's hilarious.
