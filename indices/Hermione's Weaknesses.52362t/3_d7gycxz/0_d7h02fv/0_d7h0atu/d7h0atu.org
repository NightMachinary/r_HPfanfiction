  Regarding broom riding, I think it's a matter of application

I see your point. My thing is that my read of canon HP-magic puts an emphasis on actions having magical importance, even if it is a very subtle and not quite powerful magic.

  On the other hand, didn't Hermione drop the class because she grew frustrated with Trelawney as the instructor, rather than any particular lack of success? Or, am I misremembering that?

I always figured it was both. The real thing in my mind with Divination is that doing the whole creating tea leaves (man, I don't know shit about tea), crystal ball gazing or tarot pulling is incredibly easy and works because magic is weird. The real magic/skill comes with the interpretation, which is incredibly fuzzy and personal. What for anyone else would be a fairly accurate Grim is for Harry actually his godfather's animagus form. Hermione as a character is someone who likes solid, firm/confirmed facts not interpretation, and Trelawney is the ultimate of that. I figure anything where magic is more of that nature (a la Boggart and Dementor repelling) is something she struggles with.

I feel like I mangled that explanation somehow.
