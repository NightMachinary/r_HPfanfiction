  I see your point. My thing is that my read of canon HP-magic puts an emphasis on actions having magical importance, even if it is a very subtle and not quite powerful magic.

I know, right? People invent all sorts of magical cores or magical power levels, when the "reality" suggested by canon is so much more interesting: personality and magic are inextricable. Lockhart is the ultimate shallow character, who mainly cares about what people think of him, rather than the substance of his deeds, so the only magic that works for him is Memory Charms: that which alters others' perceptions, without altering the underlying reality. Harry's reckless stubbornness and "wearing emotions on his sleeve" give him resistance to the Imperius and an unmatched Patronus, but also cripple his Occlumency (against general attackers; Voldemort is a special case), but also leave him incapable of taking advice and easily manipulated by the likes of Umbridge and Voldemort. And so on...

  The real magic/skill comes with the interpretation, which is incredibly fuzzy and personal. What for anyone else would be a fairly accurate Grim is for Harry actually his godfather's animagus form. Hermione as a character is someone who likes solid, firm/confirmed facts not interpretation, and Trelawney is the ultimate of that.

I like this interpretation, but if that's the case, is anyone shown to actually be /good/ at it? Trelawney certainly isn't.
