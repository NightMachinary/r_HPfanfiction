I'm not a big fan of WoG in general, outside of those authors who are incredibly meticulous about worldbuilding and documenting their process (basically just Tolkien) and the strangeness that was pre-Disney Star Wars canon hierarchy. JKR in particular seems to have particularly flaky WoG that pretty much is aimed to please the largest portion of her audience than fit in with what is present in the books, which is why I try to keep my interpretations of canon based on the seven books as much as possible.
