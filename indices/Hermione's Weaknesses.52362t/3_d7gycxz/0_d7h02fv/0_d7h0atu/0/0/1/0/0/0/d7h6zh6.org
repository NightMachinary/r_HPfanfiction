Well, my view of divination is that it is descriptive of possible/potential future events. Sort of like a quantum mechanics possibilities/uncertainty thing, but not mathematical or really very repeatable (like I assume Arithmancy to be). And the difference between futures here isn't due to quantum randomness but free will and choices. Which I think fits in with how most of the predictions and whatnot seem to be warnings.
