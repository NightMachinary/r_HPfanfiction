Outside of her fascination with predicting Harry's death? Yes.

She tells Lavender that something personal is going to go very badly in the upcoming months (and her pet ends up dying). She also warns Lavender to beware the red-haired man (Ron, who ends up essentially breaking her heart). While the 'grim' in PoA is actually Sirius, Sirius does end up dying, so a death---Sirius connection is made, though that is one no one really cottons onto. There's also the successful prediction that one of the students studying divination wasn't going to be with the class for the whole year. With the tarot reading in HBP, she successfully predicts Harry's presence, though not seeing him nearby she ends up ignoring it. Divination is crazy man, and that's before we even try considering whatever the hell is up with Centaurs.
