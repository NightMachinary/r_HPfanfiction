I think pretty much every prediction made throughout the series comes true, one way or another. I think at one point Harry predicts Ron will suffer but be happy about it, and Ron laughs wildly while being attacked by brains in the DoM.

Edit: I think I probably remembered that wrong, but the point still stands.
