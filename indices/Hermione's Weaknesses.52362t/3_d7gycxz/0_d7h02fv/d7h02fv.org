*Note:* I deleted the previous version of this post, because I somehow missed a part of [[/u/yarglethatblargle]] 's argument. Sorry about that.

Regarding broom riding, I think it's a matter of application: people who are afraid to fly and don't have the non-magical talents and skills that make them good fliers don't get brooms to obey them easily. Do we see any characters whose brooms obey immediately but who then turn out to be bad at balancing, maneuvering, afraid of heights, etc.?

Regarding Divination, now that I reread the parent, I am remembering the bits and pieces where Divination gave some reflection of what was to happen. (How useful it is in practice is left as an exercise to the fanfic writer.) On the other hand, didn't Hermione drop the class because she grew frustrated with Trelawney as the instructor, rather than any particular lack of success? Or, am I misremembering that?
