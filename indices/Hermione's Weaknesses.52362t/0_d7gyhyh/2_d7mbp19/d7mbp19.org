As an addendum, [[/u/Taure]] has argued very persuasively (at least to me) downthread that:

1. Jinxes, hexes, and curses (JHC) are not actually Charms, and actually have more in common magically with Transfiguration than with Charms, which suggests that Charms skills aren't as transferable to JHC as I thought that they would be.
2. Counter-JHC spells are closely related to the JHC spells in the first place, and the skills involved are transferable between the two.

This further suggests that DADA, while a multidisciplinary subject, may, in fact, cover branches of magic not covered elsewhere.

In light of this, we have relatively little data (compared to other subjects) about Hermione's aptitudes for JHC and counter-JHC spells, except that she got an E in DADA, which has a number of possible explanations, from a lack of aptitude/talent for Dark Arts (and therefore for their counters), to lack of nerve when dealing with the practical exercises (because casting a counter-jinx requires being jinxed first, casting Riddiculus requires a Boggart, etc.), to favoritism (because the dialogue suggests that only Harry might have gotten a shot at the bonus points for the Patronus).

Overall, I think that my assessment holds up well, except that I am no longer as willing to bet that Hermione would be able to cast counter-JHC spells better than Harry under ideal circumstances. Evidence is mixed, favoring Harry somewhat: there's the DADA OWL, and Harry seems to have a fairly easy time casting Dark spells in general, though usually via uncontrolled emotion, with the Imperius in DH being the only exception that I can think of; whereas we don't see Hermione casting much Dark magic in the first place, though the Parchment Jinx appears to have been nigh-irreversible magic, cast in cold blood.
