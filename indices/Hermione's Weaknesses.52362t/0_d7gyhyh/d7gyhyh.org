I'd go farther and say that DADA is not a branch of magic either: it's a subject incorporating domain-specific knowledge such as what Dark creatures there are out there and how to recognize them, Charms with applications in offense and defense (shields, jinxes, hexes, curses, and curse- and creature-specific counters), limited wizard-wizard combat practice, and some miscellaneous magical skills useful in combat, such as nonverbal casting.

That said, Hermione's weaknesses, such as they are, are not in branches of magic. Whenever a new spell or type of magic is introduced in class, she is invariably the first to master it; and that includes DADA-type skills such as nonverbal casting. In fact, I would bet that if you put Hermione a nice, well-lit room, and asked her to cast any DADA-related spell, she'd probably do it better and more reliably than even Harry.

However, it is the /non-magical/ aspects of her character that make her less good some /applications/ of magic. Put her in front of a Dementor, and she will falter, where Harry would bite the bullet, push aside the fear and self-doubt that the Dementor is projecting, and just rejoice. Similarly, put her in front of a Boggart, and Hermione --- a perpetual worrier --- would give it plenty of fuel to get at her, whereas Harry's simpler fears are more easily seen through and countered. Ultimately, put her in front of an enemy wizard, and she'd experience analysis paralysis or make suboptimal spell choices (which is what happened at the Department of Mysteries).

Lastly, to answer your penultimate question, do I think she could have gotten an O at her Defense OWLs without Harry^{1} forming the DA? I think that without DA, she would have probably still gotten an E, unless OotP year had gone /very/ differently. In a nutshell, she'd have no trouble getting the theoretical parts down, and she'd have no trouble learning the required spells from books, which is a common practice for her anyway, but she wouldn't be any better at spell selection and aiming under fire, confronting a Boggart, or any of the other things she might have to do on the practical part of the OWL. To get to an O, she probably would need experiences that would strengthen her nerve, the sorts of baptisms of fire that Harry has had at the Dursleys and on an annual basis at Hogwarts.

^{1} --- Technically, Hermione was the one who came up with the idea for, and organized, the DA. Harry had to be roped into it.
