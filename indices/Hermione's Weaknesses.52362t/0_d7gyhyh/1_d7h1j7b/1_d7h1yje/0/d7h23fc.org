  Well, you wave your wand in the right way, you think the right thoughts, and you say the right words (optionally), and a fairly specific magical effect happens

Though that's all true with Transfiguration, where the magical effect is one thing turning into another.

And I'd figure that Charms could be incredibly useful in dueling. I mean, first of all, Expelliarmus is a charm if I remember right, not a curse, jinx or hex. Charms has some animation work to it (though different from Transfiguration animation, I think?), which opens up a whole new can of worm. Cheering charms can be used to make someone laugh to the point of not being able to do anything else. Long story short: I think a lot of people are really boring when it comes to how they write duels/fights in fics.
