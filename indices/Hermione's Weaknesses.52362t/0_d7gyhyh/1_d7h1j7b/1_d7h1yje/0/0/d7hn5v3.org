  Though that's all true with Transfiguration, where the magical effect is one thing turning into another.

Here, I think that it might be helpful to distinguish between "branch of magic" and "Hogwarts subject": the former I would consider a grouping of magical skills and effects with similar mechanics, while the latter was put together as a convenient way to teach students the skills they need. It's a fairly close correspondence, but it's not absolute. (A Muggle analogy might be that a History class would involve using and practicing language skills even though there is a separate English (or other native language) class.)

DADA is an extreme case of this: a multidisciplinary subject incorporating many areas of magic, but there is no reason others have to be absolutely pure either. For example, NEWT-level Potions class on antidotes involved casting a diagnostic Charm as the first step.

Most of Transfiguration the students practice starting from their first year is nonverbal as opposed to spoken, involving limited wand movements as opposed to precise, continuous as opposed to discrete (with failed Transfigurations assuming an intermediate form, rather than producing random effects like Charms), and flexible as opposed to specific: there is no "Matchickus into Needlus" spell to learn, but rather an exercise to train the students to transfigure inanimate objects to inanimate objects of their choice of a similar small size and shape. So, it seems to me to be a distinct way of doing things from Charms.

Some magic taught in Transfiguration does seem to have more Charm-like mechanics (e.g., Vanishing Spell), and it might be taught in Transfiguration simply because it's useful for cleaning up at the end of class.

  Charms has some animation work to it (though different from Transfiguration animation, I think?), which opens up a whole new can of worm.

I think so. It's the difference between making a puppet and raising a zombie.

  Cheering charms can be used to make someone laugh to the point of not being able to do anything else.

In a fic linkffn(The Reluctant Lord by SmallBurnyThing), Harry stops Voldemort from casting a Dark curse by hitting him with a Cheering charm, thus preventing him from mustering the right emotions.

  Long story short: I think a lot of people are really boring when it comes to how they write duels/fights in fics.

No disagreement here here.
