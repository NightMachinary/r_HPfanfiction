Well, you wave your wand in the right way, you think the right thoughts, and you say the right words (optionally), and a fairly specific magical effect happens, so at least for the purposes of the grandparent post, all of the above are a type of Charm; at the very least, skills taught in Charms are directly applicable to jinxes, hexes, and curses.

Also, a random bit of circumstantial evidence: Flitwick, the Charms Master, is a dueling champion.
