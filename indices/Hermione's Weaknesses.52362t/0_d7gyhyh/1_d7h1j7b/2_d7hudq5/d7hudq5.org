I see J,H,C's as Spells that cause pain, discomfort and or physical damage to a enemy person/target. Charms mostly fall under no permanent changes while Curses can permanently change a person or thing, and Jinxes and Hexes are lighter versions of Curses

Jinxes as the most minor, most causing discomfort rather than pain, and can be reversed with a short spell or even a spell canceller.

Hexes are moderate and are probably the widest array, they cause pain or damage that while having to be looked after by someone with magical skill can be cured and solved quickly with no lasting damage, a Few Hexes can be considered Dark

Curses are the worst and if not cared for immediately could be permanent. A larger number of spells called Curses can also be called Dark. Curses cause sever damage.

Thats how I see a major separation beteeen Charms and DADA spells.
