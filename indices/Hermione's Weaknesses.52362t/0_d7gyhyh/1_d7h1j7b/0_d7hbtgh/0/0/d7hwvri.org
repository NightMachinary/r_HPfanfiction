This directly contradicts JK Rowling's spell definitions as referenced:

  Spell Definitions

  Every now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex. Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas. Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:

  Spell:

  The generic term for a piece of magic.

  Charm:

  Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.

  Hexes:

  Has a connotation of dark magic, as do jinxes, but of a minor sort. I see 'hex' as slightly worse. I usually use 'jinx' for spells whose effects are irritating but amusing.

  Curses:

  Reserved for the worst kinds of dark magic.

Counter-jinxes, counter-hexes and counter-curses, which we know are the same spells as jinxes, hexes and curses from Hermione's OotP chat, are not simply Charms which coincidentally have nasty effects. They are a) spells, not Charms and b) Dark magic. There is a fundamental magical difference between them.
