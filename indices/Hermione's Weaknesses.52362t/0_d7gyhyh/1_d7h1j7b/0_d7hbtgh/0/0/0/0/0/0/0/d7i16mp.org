  Yes it is:

You're right. My bad. I had gone back and skimmed for "Transfiguration" and didn't see anything.

  I don't see any evidence that these fundamentally alter the target.

Well, before it was whole, and now it's cut in half. ;) That said, I do get the distinction.

  Incidentally, this explains why it is that you see conjuration in both Charms and Transfiguration. They may appear the same in the way they are cast, and in the apparent effect they have, but they are magically different. A "transfiguration conjuration" will create an object with its own fundamental existence independent of the caster, whereas a "Charm conjuration" is a magical bundle of properties.

Charm conjuration?

  Except from everything we see in canon, understanding of the magical theory (as you say, the "magical causes and effects, their similarities and differences") has a direct impact on whether or not you can perform said magic. The two are intrinsically intertwined. Indeed it seems to be by far the most significant factor in spell success, given the way in which Hermione's ability to cast more advanced spells is based on her having studied their theory.

So you would say that jinxes, hexes, and curses are actually closer to Transfiguration than they are to Charms in terms of the "magical theory", though they are closer to Charms in terms of mechanical components?
