I feel like you're trying to explain away what JKR said rather than genuinely accept it. Yes, she said they were flexible at the edges and admitted that she called the Stunning Charm a spell for its alliterative effect, despite it being a Charm. But that doesn't remove the fact that she identified a fundamental difference between Charms and Transfiguration in general - that Charms does not fundamentally alter the nature of its target, whereas Transfiguration does. And it also doesn't remove the fact that she separated out Dark magic from everything else.

(Incidentally, there's plenty in canon to support the idea that dark magic is magically different too, because dark magic is harder to reverse than other magic.)

I don't think grouping magic by the casting method makes much sense. To me classification by what the magic /does/ is a much more logical division than by how the magic is /performed/. The performance classification would be like dividing up the branches of physics by what equipment you use to investigate it rather than by what phenomena they describe.
