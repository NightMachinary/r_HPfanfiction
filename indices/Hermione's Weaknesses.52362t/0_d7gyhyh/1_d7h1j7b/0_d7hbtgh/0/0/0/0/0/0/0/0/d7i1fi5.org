  Charm conjuration?
#+end_quote

One example would be Aguamenti, which conjures water but was learnt in Charms.

The fact that it is a Charm also helps explain why it is that people can drink it to satisfy their thirst: Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration and its exceptions are a part of the magical theory which applies to transfiguration magic. As such it is not a breach of that law to use Charms to conjure potable water. See also Molly's use of a Charm to create a sauce out of her wand.

  So you would say that jinxes, hexes, and curses are actually closer to Transfiguration than they are to Charms in terms of the "magical theory", though they are closer to Charms in terms of mechanical components?

I think it varies. If you look at the branch of magic as a whole, yes I would say that the Dark Arts are closer to Transfiguration than Charms. However on the level of a specific spell I think it varies.

The "heirarchy of magical theory", as I imagine it, is something like this:

1. General magical theory.
2. Branch of magic theory.
3. Spell family theory.
4. Individual spell theory.

General magical theory would be stuff like the power of symbols, representation relations, the nature of sacrifice, the use of magical tools to exernalise concepts, etc.

Branch of magic theory would be the theory specific to a branch like transfiguration. So for example in transfiguration it might include the Platonic forms, the 4-element conception of substance, etc. Some branches may be offshoots of more fundamental branches. If so they would share some common theory but at some point diverge.

Spell family theory would describe a group of spells within a branch that had theoretical concepts in common. So for example I picture summoning and banishing as part of the same spell family.

And finally individual spell theory would be the theory that is unique to a particular spell. So for example I imagine the fidelius has a lot of theory relating to how secrets are hidden in souls.

The complexity comes when two branches of magic have a similar spell family - such as the aforementioned charms conjuration and transfiguration conjuration. Though they share a fundamental different basis in terms of being based on a different "branch theory", I also picture them as both invoking some very similar concepts at the "spell family" level of theory. An analogy might be if you bake bread with two different types of flour. The flour is like the "branch level", the baking method is like the "spell family level". Because you're basing the two breads on a different ingredient, the result is going to differ in nature. However, the two nonetheless have much in common.
