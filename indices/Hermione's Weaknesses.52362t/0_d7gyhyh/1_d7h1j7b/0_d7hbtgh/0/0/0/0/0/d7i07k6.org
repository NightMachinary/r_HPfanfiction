  I feel like you're trying to explain away what JKR said rather than genuinely accept it.

And I feel like you are confusing map (language used to refer to different categories of magic) with territory (magical causes and effects, their similarities and differences). Rowling's quotation was mostly about the "map".

  But that doesn't remove the fact that she identified a fundamental difference between Charms and Transfiguration in general - that Charms does not fundamentally alter the nature of its target, whereas Transfiguration does.
#+end_quote

That's not in the quotation. Also, there are charms that fundamentally alter their target: Severing Charm (Diffindo), Repair Charm (Reparo), Engorgement Charm, just off the top of my head.

  (Incidentally, there's plenty in canon to support the idea that dark magic is magically different too, because dark magic is harder to reverse than other magic.)
#+end_quote

I agree with that. However, I would view Dark-ness as a trait orthogonal to other aspects of a spell, not a category as such, so a Charm-style spell with a Dark component becomes a jinx, a hex, or a curse. (Now that I think about it, what would a Dark Transfiguration be? Inferi?)

  I don't think grouping magic by the casting method makes much sense. To me classification by what the magic does is a much more logical division than by how the magic is performed.
#+end_quote

Different groupings are useful for different purposes. In this case, performance method matters very much, because the original discussion was about characters learning to perform and being able to perform a particular magic.
