Thanks for locating the quote.

My sense is that it basically confirms what I've been saying. That "the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas" suggests that these are socially constructed distinctions rather than ones grounded in fundamental magical differences. It even gives an example of the "classification" of the Stunning Spell being determined by how its name sounded, rather than any sort of fundamental nature, and qualifiers such as "usually" further reinforce that impression.

A Hogwarts student would look at an spell cast with a precise wand movement and a verbal and cognitive component to perform a fairly specific and inflexible function and call it a "Charm" --- if it doesn't have obvious combat applications; a jinx, a hex, or a curse if it has a Dark component; a Transfiguration if it involves creating or destroying objects; and a "spell" if it doesn't fit into either category. A Durmstrang student who doesn't have the same stigma against Dark Arts^{1} might group spells differently.

So, that "there is a fundamental magical difference between them" is an unwarranted extrapolation, in my opinion.

Instead, I would group them by their mechanics and skills involved in performing them. I would group what Hogwarts calls "Charms", along with very specific and incanted "Transfiguration" spells like Serpensortia or Evanesco, and the Dark spells into one branch; free-form, nonverbal Transfiguration and animation that creates a living thing (or whatever it was that Dumbledore did with statues in the Ministry atrium) into another; Potioneering and Herbology into two others, possibly related; then Divination, which might be grouped with Astronomy.

So, for example, Evanesco (the Vanishing Spell), while it's taught as a part of Transfiguration (because it's useful for in practicing Conjuration), actually draws on skills learned primarily in Charms, as would a curse --- except that one adds on an unspecified Dark component.

^{1} --- To be clear, I am not arguing that Dark Arts are just misunderstood and suppressed by that do-gooder Dumbledore oppressing poor purebloods who just want to practice Dark Arts with consenting partners. They are nasty stuff, though the precise nature of their nastiness is a matter of headcanon that I'd rather not get into at the moment.
