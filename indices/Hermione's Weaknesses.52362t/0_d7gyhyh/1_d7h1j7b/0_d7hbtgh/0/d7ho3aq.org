Charms is, first and foremost, a subject taught at Hogwarts, where magical skills and knowledge are grouped as they are for pedagogical and social reasons, not because of their fundamental nature or mechanics, though there is, of course, a very strong relationship between the two. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/52362t/hermiones_weaknesses/d7hn5v3][I elaborate on that, with examples, here.]]

Going by Snape's speech in HBP and other clues, Dark Arts seem to incorporate Dark creatures (e.g., Dementors), Dark spells (jinxes, hexes, and curses), Dark potions (e.g., Potion used to build Voldemort's body at the end of GoF), and WTFever creates Inferi. A Dementor does not stop being a creature just because it's a Dark creature, and nor does Pettigrew's concoction stop being a Potion just because it involves human flesh and blood taken under specific circumstances. So, in terms of "branches of magic" as transferable skills that one can be good or bad at, dark spells have all the mechanics of the type of magic that is covered primarily in Charms, even if Flitwick would have none of that in his class.
