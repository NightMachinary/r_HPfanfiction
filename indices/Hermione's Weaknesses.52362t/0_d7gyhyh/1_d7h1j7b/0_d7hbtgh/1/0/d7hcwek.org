Aw, I was hoping that you'd ask me to back it up haha.

For those curious, the (partial) definitions of Charms and the Dark Arts were put on JK Rowling's old website, before it got replaced with Pottermore. You can still access it via the Way Back Machine. Aim for somewhere around 2009.

The stuff about DADA involving the use of the Dark Arts comes from Hermione's argument with Umbridge in OotP. Umbridge (and the book she assigned) proposed that the use of counter-curses was no different than using curses generally. Hermione disagreed, saying that she thought they have a legitimate use by people seeking to defend themselves. This indicates that "counter-curse" simply means using a curse in a defensive manner. And we know that in DADA, except under Umbridge, they learn counter-curses. So basically Hogwarts teaches the Dark Arts, they just stress their defensive use.

So DADA involves the use of Dark magic, and said Dark magic is a separate branch of magic to Charms under JKR's spell definitions.
