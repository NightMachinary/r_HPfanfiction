Very interesting stuff about the relationship between jinxes and counter-jinxes; I had completely forgotten. And, that Hermione objected not to the connection between the two but to the claim that jinxes are themselves illegitimate is telling.

However, the counter-jinxes that we get to see still follow the same Charms-like mechanic as the jinxes they counter, and non-Dark spells have specific counter-spells as well. It seems to me to be a distinction without a difference.

That does not mean that someone good at the "nice" Charms would be automatically good at Dark spells, of course. Personality and experience are central to the practice of magic, and doubly so for Dark spells. Lockhart was good at Memory Charms but bad at all others, and there's no reason it couldn't be the same for Dark spells.
