Jinxes, hexes and curses are Dark magic, not Charms. [[/u/turbinicarpus]] is indeed correct that DADA isn't its own branch of magic, but the Dark Arts /are/. And we also know from OotP that much of DADA is learning to use Dark magic in a defensive way. So I'm not 100% convinced Hermione could cast all DADA-relevant magic better than Harry (also his shield charms seem to be better than hers).
