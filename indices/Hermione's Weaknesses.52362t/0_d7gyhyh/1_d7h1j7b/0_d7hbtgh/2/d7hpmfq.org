Almost forgot... Regarding whether Hermione could cast DADA-related magic better than Harry, I think that basically any deviation from the hypothetical "well-lit room" would probably throw her off far more than it would throw off Harry. (In fact, when Umbridge said

she probably didn't realize that those conditions involved actually confronting a boggart.) Hard to judge beyond that.

Not sure where the shield charms bit comes from. We know that Harry casts some rather good Shield charms at the end of Battle of Hogwarts, but it's not clear how much of that is superior skill, how much is that he doesn't have to worry about defending himself, how much is the new Sacrificial Protection, and how much is a general apotheosis. Hermione also casts some variants of Protego that Harry isn't shown casting --- though that doesn't mean that he couldn't and didn't, just like we have no idea how good or bad Hermione's Imperius might have been.
