  Charms with applications in offense and defense (shields, jinxes, hexes, curses, and curse- and creature-specific counters)
#+end_quote

This brings up an interesting question to me. What distinguishes jinxes, hexes and curses from Charms? Are they different subsets, are they as different from Charms as Charms are from Transfiguration? I've been waffling on this for a while, and have some leanings into both directions.
