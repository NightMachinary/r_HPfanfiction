"Wars not make one great." --- Yoda, but I think that Dumbledore and Hermione alike would agree.

In any case, I still don't understand what bearing it has on anything. Tom Riddle lacked in both bravery and friendship, and yet he was certainly a great wizard in terms of influence and effect on the world. Pettigrew as well, and he was a linchpin for no less than three world-changing events (betrayal of Potters, resurrection of Voldemort, and escape from the Malfoy manor).
