I disagree about Ron (how people think him so great is something I will probably never get, because for me he's a bad friend and someone I would not want to cover my ass in a fight (can't trust him to not suddenly decide that he's better off without me or that running is smarter and that he'd be heralded a hero if he survives and I kick the bucket!)) but otherwise? Not badly reasoned (despite that fact that I'd say it's about being a great PERSON, not a great wizard - because neither of the teens/young adults in HP is anything special, non are prodigies (even Hermione isn't all that creative/innovative etc. - she's smart, but she isn't Rowena Ravenclaw!))
