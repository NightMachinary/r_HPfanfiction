Please note that for this entire post (unless otherwise directly stated) I'm using great/greatness only as a descriptor of magnitude, with no moral connotations. Well, let's start by taking a look at the Prophecy (I can't believe I'm honestly doing this, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4rtbig/discussion_what_if_snape_didnt_turn_sides_and/d542lgh][considering my past discourses on the prophecy]]).

  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... *and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal,* but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies....

Bolded for emphasis on what I consider the important part for this discussion. So, I don't think the prophecy is in any way prescriptive but rather descriptive of a possible future, but Voldemort out of ignorance of about half the prophecy basically frogmarches us to that future, so Harry is Voldemort's equal. Yet, Harry is in no way as skilled at magic as Voldemort, except in what I'm going to call the deep magics (the whole sacrificing himself thing, some wandlore stuff) which almost seem to be entirely character based. Tying that into Taure's headcanon document, plus everything not goblin-steel related of the Sword of Gryffindor shows how aspects of character are incredibly magically important. Greatness of character (whether good or bad) directly correlates to greatness of wizard/witch. Dumbledore and Voldemort both fall into greatness and highly skilled, while Harry and Neville (and maybe Ron? I would need to think about Ron more) would fall into greatness but not necessarily highly skilled.
