Consider the context:

#+begin_quote
  ‘You drink that,' said Harry. ‘No, listen -- get back and get Ron -- grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbled ore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him really.'

  ‘But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?'

  ‘Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?' said Harry, pointing at his scar. ‘I might get lucky again.'

  Hermione's lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.

  ‘Hermione!'

  ‘Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know.'

To me, that reads as a mix of "you're a great [person who happens to be] a wizard" and general words of encouragement and optimism.

Once Harry points out that Hermione is, in fact, better at magic than him, Hermione persists in her encouragement and downplays this fact, in favor of virtues generally unrelated to actual magical ability and skill, which Harry has and she perceives herself as lacking.

Also, Hermione is smart, but she's still an ickle firstie at this point, so I am not sure how much weight should be given to her judgment in this case.
