  However, it is the non-magical aspects of her character that make her less good some applications of magic. Put her in front of a Dementor, and she will falter, where Harry would bite the bullet, push aside the fear and self-doubt that the Dementor is projecting, and just rejoice. Similarly, put her in front of a Boggart, and Hermione --- a perpetual worrier --- would give it plenty of fuel to get at her, whereas Harry's simpler fears are more easily seen through and countered. Ultimately, put her in front of an enemy wizard, and she'd experience analysis paralysis or make suboptimal spell choices (which is what happened at the Department of Mysteries).

This is a great observation. I'd also throw in the troll incident from PS as another example of Hermione failing to apply recently learned magic.
