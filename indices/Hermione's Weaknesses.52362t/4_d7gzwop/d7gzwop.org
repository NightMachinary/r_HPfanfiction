I always thought of it like this:

What Hermione does in 3 spells perfectly, Harry does in one spell good enough.

Magic in the HP universe is mainly achieved by knowing about the spell. Knowledge is literally power. There are only a few spells that require emotions such as the Patronus and the Cruciatus. All the other spells are knowledge and execution, both things in which Hermione outclass not only her peers but even some adult wizards and witches.

The difference is that Hermione is not a duelist, she is an academic. What she lacks is fighting instinct. She is also extremely loathe to just wing something. She doesn't do "good enough", she does "perfect" and that makes her weaker in classes like Defense where "good enough, but fast" may be the difference between an O and an E.
