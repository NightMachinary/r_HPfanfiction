Yes, you're of course right. /If/ character traits have an impact on how good or bad someone casts a spell (no additional adrenaline, no outside pressure - in a completely sterile and neutral test-environment) then you're of course right.

Repeating myself, I say again that any discussion is rather futile if we try to find some canonical truth, not so if we kick back and forth ideas for writing and headcanon.
