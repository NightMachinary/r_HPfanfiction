Given that my interpretation of canon magic has your character as a magically real element which determines your magical "orientation", including your disposition towards casting certain areas of magic powerfully, within that system to say that Harry has a fighter spirit is also to say that he is more likely to cast DADA spells better than Hermione (ceteris paribus).

However, even without that I think there's plenty to indicate that Harry is better at DADA spells as well as their application. For instance, he has a tendency to pick them up first try, without any practice: consider levicorpus and sectumsempra. And on top of that, as I said above, his shield charm does seem particularly good: able to turn Snape's spells back at him by the time Harry is 16, and by the time he's 17 able to cover the entire Great Hall.
