I think this sells Harry a bit short when it comes to DADA. I think when it comes to Dark magic, Harry's understanding of it is as deep as Hermione's if not more so. Moreover his entire temperament seems to make him magically inclined to be good at spells related to DADA.

I don't think Hermione has a magical advantage over Harry in DADA.
