I think that it's more complicated than that. I would think that understanding and the confidence to modify complex potions on the fly aren't something one is born with, but are developed through practice and experimentation, and perhaps asking questions. Slughorn apparently encouraged it, but can you even imagine what Snape would do to Hermione --- Potter's obnoxious know-it-all friend, and a Gryffindor who keeps upstaging his Slytherins in every subject --- if he caught her deliberately deviating from his instructions? Can you see Hermione developing any other potioneering habits than she had?
