Not really. I always headcanoned her as the sort of person that gets great grades primarily by studying like the devil. So if she had academic weaknesses, she's studied them out of existence.

As far as actual fields go, the impression I get is she's not exactly a genius at potions, just able to follow instructions and work hard. I can't imagine her doing fantastically at practical herbology, and I'd argue divination is too a proper subject, most people just can't do it (Trelawney included). She seems to be strongest at charms (or maybe we just see more charms classwork in the books?)

So yeah, my 50p. Not sure how much of that is headcanon and accumulated fanon vs actual evidence from the books though.
