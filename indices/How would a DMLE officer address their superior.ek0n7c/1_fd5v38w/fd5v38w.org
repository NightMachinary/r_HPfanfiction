In fanon, the DMLE is usually headed by a "Director," making DMLE both the department and the person. They'd probably be addressed as, "Director."

Sub-department heads would probably just be referred to as Sir unless there is a rank attached to their position, perhaps the head of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is Chief Constable Bob, MLEP but Arthur Weasley, as Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office is just Sir or Mr. Weasley.

The Head Auror would probably be referred to as "Head Auror" but addressed as Sir by his subordinates, unless he gets a rank, too.
