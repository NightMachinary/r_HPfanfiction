Hedwig (as an owl, not an animagus). I think she's really hard to do well, though, as there are certainly an awful lot of poor efforts that have Hedwig doing a lot more than giving reproachful looks.

Thanks for your links to the Slughorn fics. He's an interesting character and I wish he would have had more exposition on his backstory in canon.
