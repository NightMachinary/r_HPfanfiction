I try desperately to include as much Hedwig as possible. I like to make female leads jealous of her, and if possible highlight the link between Harry and Hedwig to the point that other people think they must be mentally linked.

Hedwig as a true Familiar instead of as a Pet is always awesome, though actual mental communication pushes it sometimes. I imagine her to be like Archimedes from 'Sword and the Stone' but unable to talk.
