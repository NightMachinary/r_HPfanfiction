Percy, although I'm not totally sure why. Perhaps it's just because he's rarely paid the slightest bit of attention in most fics (up to the point that it's actually possible to forget that he exists at all).

But out of the Weasley family, he's the oddball. Most the Weasleys seem to be the adventurous sort, so what made Percy such a stickler for the rules when none of his siblings are? As a middle brother, it's easy to be overlooked, but his character is practically invisible, despite not being 'out of the country' for the majority of the series like his older brothers are. His relationship with his family is very distant: his mother seems to think him too ambitious; you rarely see him interact with his older brothers, but when you do it involves them trying to annoy him and teasing him; his younger brothers think he has a stick wedged up his behind and, in the twins case, actively make his life as difficult as possible; and his father never seems to comment about him at all, as if he's forgotten he's there, or is ashamed of him for some reason.

Then, what did he go through in the war? He was one of the only Weasleys to actively work in the Ministry whilst it was under the Dark Lord's control, and in very close proximity to the Minister himself (if he managed to hold onto the position he had under the previous Minister).

How difficult is it to admit to your family that you were wrong, and to reconcile with them? How do you rebuild a relationship with the family you abandoned in their greatest time of need?

Anyway, my point is that Percy's character has a lot of potential that is never realised, and barely anyone bothers with him in fics even though it's a great opportunity to write a character with real flaws and depth, who can see the whole series from a totally unique perspective. There aren't enough good stories with him as a proper character.
