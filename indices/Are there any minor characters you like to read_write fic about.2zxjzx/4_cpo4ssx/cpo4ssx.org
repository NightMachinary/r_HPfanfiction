Gellert Grindelwald. I think that the Grindelwald/Dumbledore relationship when they were young (romantic or not) is really interesting and I'm surprised there aren't more fics about it. War-era Grindelwald sounds interesting too, but I'd especially love to see a "Grindelwald escapes Nurmengard" story set during the events of the books.
