I love reading/writing Lavender and Cho. I didn't like them growing up, but writing fics for them showed me how strong they both are. They're the best portrayals of "normal" people in war and both end up scarred by it (physically and/or emotionally). And we actually see them quite a bit in canon, so their personality isn't a huge mystery.
