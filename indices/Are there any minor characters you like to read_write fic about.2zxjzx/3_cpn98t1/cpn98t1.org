I would love to write and read stories centred around unused characters such as Dennis Creevey, Kevin Entwhistle, Theodore Nott, Rodolphus Lestrange, etc. I think they would be great exercises in character creation, and since both Creevey and Entwhistle are muggle-born, show us the wonder of discovering magic.
