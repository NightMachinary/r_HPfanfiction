I've been reading the "Honestly Harry" series and it was the first time "meeting the Queen" that I actually felt the power and presence of the Crown. I might actually be nervous to meet her myself now because for the first time it was impressed upon me that THIS IS THE QUEEN and not just some ... local celebrity or something.
