Not necessarily read, but I have a huge list of stories that I need to write just piling up like a to-do list. Can't write nearly as fast as I have story ideas, and I have sooooo many plot bunnies. Let's see, after my story about Ginny, I have:

1. story about Percy in the war
2. a two-part/possible trilogy about Dumbledore's childhood heavily featuring his siblings and Gellert Grindewald
3. Black sisters - no idea what, just Black sisters
4. Regulus Black
5. the original Order of Phoenix

Ugh, I'm highly motivated to write stories but never to finish them, so I'm not starting another until I finish the one I'm currently working on. It's tough.
