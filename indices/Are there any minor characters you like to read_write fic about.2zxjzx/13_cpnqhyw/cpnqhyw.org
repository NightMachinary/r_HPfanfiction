Gabby is probably the most minor character I enjoy writing / reading.

Xeno Lovegood ... because he is odd and fun, but also kinda sad. More sad than Luna who I don't consider "minor".

Daphne or Pansy are both very fun to read/write... I think Pansy ended up being my favorite scenes and favorite female lead in 'Searching for the Power' while Daphne was almost too good not to include in the harem.

After reading so much fanfiction, I'm not sure there are many "minor" characters left.

edit: BILL! Bill and Charlie! I love reading them
