I would say Ginny. Canon has an outline of a personality for her, but doesn't really give her much importance in the narrative. I love stories like /Backwards with a Purpose/ and /Strangers of Drakeshaugh/ that show more of her personality.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567446/1/The-Ring-of-Gold][Death Gate trilogy]] is a really underrated Ginny-centric mystery fanfic. I would love to see more stories like that one.
