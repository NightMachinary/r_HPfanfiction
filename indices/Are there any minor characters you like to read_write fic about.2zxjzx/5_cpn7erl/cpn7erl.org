I'm fascinated by characters that seemed to be introduced just to fit a role, but had some interesting but underdeveloped hints as to their depth. A few examples, none of which will be surprising if you've read the story I'm working on :)

Cedric Diggory - didn't get much development in canon, but seemed to be propped up to be kind of an idealized Hogwarts student (good-looking, good at Quidditch, charismatic) so it would be extra-tragic when he died. How did he get that good? What kind of pressure, external or internal, made him that way? How did he handle his popularity? What did he want to do with his life? All questions I'm interested in.

You can apply this same reasoning to characters like Viktor Krum, Cho Chang, and Fleur Delacour - all characters who were shown to excel in one way or another. Characters who shine like that, but you never get a PoV from, I always wonder - how did they get that way, and how do they deal with the consequences of standing out, both good and bad?
