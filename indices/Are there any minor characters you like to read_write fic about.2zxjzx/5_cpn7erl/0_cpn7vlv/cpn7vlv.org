Several good points about Cedric. In keeping with your theme of canon casting him a Mary-Sue, I think Amos' strange attempts to bait Harry Potter fit in with that very well.

In GoF none of Ced's actions seemed to fit with JKR's exotlment of his virtues. It may be cruel to say, but I didn't really feel anything when he died other than 'maybe this will finally shut up his dad.'
