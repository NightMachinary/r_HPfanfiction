Umbridge did almost everything she did in the book prior to Dumbledore leaving. It was the Inquisitorial Squad that caught the DA meeting in progress that caused Dumbledore to leave the school to protect Harry. Her becoming Headmistress functionally didn't change anything. Conceivably, had she remained in charge beyond the end of OOTP, she could have kicked Trelawney out of the school, but pretty much everything else she wanted to do, she was able to just by being the High Inquisitor.
