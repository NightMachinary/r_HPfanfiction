  Wouldn't Harry just have had a normal, smooth year, ironically enough

No because...

  Dumbledore only being forced to leave because of the DA getting caught out, and Dumbledore taking the blame for it for Harry

This all happens in like April. Dumbledore was gone for like 2 months lol. Throughout the series JKR has like 4-5 big moments before shit truly hits the fan. One of those moments is between March and May.

So, Harry still has most of the school hate him, Dumbledore ignoring him, Voldemort in his head, no Quidditch, extra bs from Snape, in addition to Umbridge's detentions and OWLs.

The DA provided him with some peace, tbh.
