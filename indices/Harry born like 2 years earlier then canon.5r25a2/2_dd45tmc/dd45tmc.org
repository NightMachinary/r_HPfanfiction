linkffn(9939304) is one of my favorite Harry/Fleur fics. It gets a bit crack-y at some points but I really like this version of Durmstrang and dueling. Also its complete (the author said they would write an epilogue but its complete otherwise) which is a huge bonus! The characters are really interesting and although Harry is powerful he's definitely not super!harry
