1. It was just two-minutes-thinking idea, so I am not putting my life down for it.

2. I could very well imagine, that exactly because the Battle of DoM happened under the Fudge's administration, Scrimgeour could make The Six into Our Big Heroes (and screw them up behind their backs anyway) and do Something Glamorous like naming them Special DMLE Agents or something (with great photo on the first page of the Daily Prophet).
