I'm all for ignoring the Trace. I mean it just felt way too convenient to me, even while I was still reading the books. But getting someone else to remove the Trace for Ginny, might require a lot of forethought and planning, mainly because the fighting in the DoM takes place under Fudge's administration, as well as a good year before Dumbledore's death, and considering Scrimgeour's attitude towards the Trio (viz. searching the contents of Dumbledore's will before handing them over) makes it rather far-fetched.
