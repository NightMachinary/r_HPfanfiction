That's ... not really it, though, I'm afraid. The request is about some character from another series being really a character from the Harry Potter series because they have the same name, the same as the character has in canon. Think stuff such as Ron being Ronald McDonald, or Voldemort being Tom Sawyer because they share the name Tom. As such, since Harry's canon name is Harry and not Rose, this ... doesn't really count.
