I like this! I would be willing to collaborate on a timeline for Harry's adventures if anyone else is interested

One concern is that with the commute being daily, it increases suspicion about 9 3/4 a million times over. There would definitely have to be a plethora of charms diverting attention away from it.

I like the idea of multiple entrances to the platform, though. Assumedly each station would have a different (fractional) number to again avoid suspicion and also make sure everyone goes the right way home. I'm imagining a whole row of archways with numbered signs, and glancing in each one shows a clearly different place. Fun visuals!

I think many families would have a tradition of taking the train the first day of the year, as a fun way to meet up with all your friends, and then resuming normal transportation the next day.
