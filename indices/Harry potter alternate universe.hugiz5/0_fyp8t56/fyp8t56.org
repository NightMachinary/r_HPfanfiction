I recently read Devil's White Knight on Ao3 it's about Harry kind of being sent to a parallel universe where his family is alive, he has a sister but his other self is basically a git, so he has to prove that he is a better person and rebuild his relationship with his friends and family (including a ravenclaw Hermione who sees him as a rival). It was pretty good but I must warn you the story it's Drarry and contains a lot of slash pairings.
