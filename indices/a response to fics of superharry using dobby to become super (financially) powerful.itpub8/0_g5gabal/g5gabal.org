Harry paced around the room. It can't be. The Taipei-based designer about to release their latest luxury socks collection has sold their prototype stock to a mysterious purchaser. They assured Harry he will get the order once the production queue is cleared, but this still means someone out there is also coveting socks, and even though Dobby will still appreciate the gift, it's still not the best in Harry's eyes. None of the suspected Yanks are guilty, he's seen the billionaire who like to get bitten by mosquitoes check his shoes from a mild Trip Jinx surreptitiosly cast at the charity event, and like his overall wardrobe, his socks is just a regular model normally sold in Walmart. The South African's clothing is far more stylish, but even then it's just a common, if a little expensive, socks available around the world.

The upcoming design to be launched in Seoul should be completed by now, he has been tailing the models and they've cleared their schedule for tonight. What if, he persuaded the designer to sell the first release right after the models wear them? Deciding there's not much risk of the designer freaking out and canceling the line altogether, he apparated to the multi-storey building, still bustling with activity despite the late hour. An Asian man is returning his visitor card to the receptionist, the cheerful staff can be heard saying" ... Osoreirimasu Danburudoa-san" before the apparently Japanese nodded politely to Harry and left. As expected from a multinational company, the staff turned to Harry and ask for his business in flawless English. As Harry carefully spelled the designer name, he glanced at the Japanese walking straight to the gate instead of waiting for a car, in his rather colorful outfit.

Harry can't hide his surprise when the designer, Mr Lee, explain the recently photographed socks has been sold to someone else. This must be his competitor. When Mr Lee said the buyer is a Japanese, most likely the man Harry just saw, he frowned. So far the intelligence he gained indicate that his rival is a Caucasian, definitely using fake names, a Herr Humlesnurr came to New York just few hours before Harry and purchase the designer sock before vanishing from the Earth. There was no record of that surname in the United States according to the private investigators, just like the given identities of Signor Silente in Egypt and Mr Perkamentus in Brazil. Photographic and CCTV evidence are lacking due to technical problems, but everyone he asked mention the buyer is a polite European man speaking in their native language flawlessly. He hurried to the window to see the Japanese man. He's still walking across the large park in front of the office complex, standing out from his outfit, seemingly more interested to stroll despite chilling temperature.

Harry said his goodbye to Mr Lee and directly apparated to the park after entering the bathroom. The Japanese don't seem to realize anything wrong until he walked behind a tree and... vanished. Just like that. Harry immediately cast Homenum Revelio but there's no one else nearby. Muggles don't do that, do they? Their method of instantly leaving a spot usually involve a noisy vehicle or a balloon soon to be snaggged by another noisy vehicle. Not even wizard can apparate silently, no one Harry knows except... oh.
