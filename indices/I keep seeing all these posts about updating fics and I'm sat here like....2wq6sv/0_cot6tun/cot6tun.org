Junior Inquisitor...

Though, lets be honest, after as many years as I've been reading fanfiction, the above list could probably hit 1000 if I cared enough to write them all. There's over 700k fics on ffnet alone, and half are incomplete, and just over 10% of those even updating in the last year. Then there's TQP, AO3, HPFFA, Tumblr, LJ, SIYE, PC, Portkey, MuggleNet, and at least a dozen I've forgotten, and by my best estimate there's at least 5 ideas or scenes that someone wanted to write but couldn't for every fic that's out there. If every one were complete or if every author waited until they were complete to post them, we wouldn't even have 50k stories. It's sad, but it makes the complete ones that much better by comparison.
