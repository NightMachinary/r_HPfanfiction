Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] is heavily (really heavy) AU, with alot of new magic, new characters, new plots, and new everything. It is fantastic. The first and second are finished, but the end sequel sadly is not.

If you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] by mizuni-sama, go read it now. Best fanfiction out there hands down. Competent and extremely intelligent voldemort, great character development, new magic exploration, and also heavily AU. It is not finished yet, and has slow updated (once every 2-3 months) but it is nearly finished.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]] is a more casual read and it is not as well written as the last two. It starts really fast and harry becomes very powerful by the end, but it is an entertaining read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] This is one of the best fics out there. Sadly it is not completed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] This is very canon-esque in the sense that it writes and flows like Rowling's story did. Teenage Angsty, usual character development, nowhere near as AU as the other fics I recommended. It is a WIP and is turning really good up until now.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Wastelands of Time]] First fic I ever read, and along with Prince of the Dark Kingdom it is the best out there. It is the best written fanfiction out there. Next to none spelling and grammar mistakes, great flow, good build-up, amazing suspense, new creative magicks, and a bad-ass Harry with a bad-ass Voldemort to counter him. Sequel is out, yet it is abandoned.

Enjoy! And welcome to the fanfiction world where you will no longer have anything else to do with your life but read fanfiction.
