Harry Potter's most excellent adventure linkffn(11619134)

Does it count if Harry decides to go back after he returns to Earth? Harry is captured along with SG-1 by some Jaffa. After he escapes, Harry decides space is cool. He steals the Al'kesh SG-1 had commandeered and cruises the galaxy. A Fidelius charm is better than any cloaking shield, and expansion charms make the troop transport huge on the inside.
