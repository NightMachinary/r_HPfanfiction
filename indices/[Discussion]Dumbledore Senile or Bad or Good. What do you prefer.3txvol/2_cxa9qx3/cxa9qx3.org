None of the above. Dumbledore is and always will be a "big picture" guy. A significant portion of Deathly Hallows is all about how Dumbledore is not a perfect person, he makes mistakes and has faults. Many of Dumbledore's decisions around Harry were pretty terrible but I cannot even imagine the stress he was under. I mean imagine the situation of Harry Potter:

1. He and Voldemort are destined for conflict.
2. He might have some of Voldemort's soul inside him; this probably scared Dumbledore more than he ever admitted and was probably why he always made it a point to talk with Harry at the end of every year.
3. Death Eaters were out for blood; and I imagine the wizarding world didn't return to "normal" for at least 2-3 years.
4. Who could he trust when Black had already betrayed the Potters... Few people can imagine a world where you can legitimately trust no one. Dumbledore's best choice was honestly to take Harry outside the Magical World.\\
5. Voldemort was still around but Dumbledore had no clue which immortality ritual he even used. Dumbledore could have assumed Voldemort made a horcrux, he never would have guess 5+, let alone what items were used or where they were hidden. I imagine he retracted all of Riddle's life post Hogwarts after finding the Diary.

I honestly just wish that more stories played up the difficult situation Dumbledore was in and write him accordingly.
