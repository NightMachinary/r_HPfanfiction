    I wouldn't say he was focused on redeeming people too much. That is pretty big fanfiction trope. He didn't chase down Snape and get him to turn to the light.

  Well he doesn't chase down Voldemort or any of the elder Malfoys/Blacks either. I think more from the perspective of "he won't take action against people because he wants them to be redeemed." Otherwise it's hard to explain his relative inaction throughout the series.

In real life, headmasters of schools and the ceremonial heads of international organisations don't go around all vigilante style and murder people left, right and centre. Governments do sometimes (for shame), but individuals who do that we call murderers or terrorists. It's baffling to me that people have the default position of "mass murder is right!" when it comes to fiction. Or worse, that great power justifies it. Half at least of all superharry stories are deeply fascistic in the same way judge dredd is.
