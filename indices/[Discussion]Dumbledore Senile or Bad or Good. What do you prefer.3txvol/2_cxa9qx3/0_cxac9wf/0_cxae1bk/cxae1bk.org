I wouldn't say he was focused on redeeming people too much. That is pretty big fanfiction trope. He didn't chase down Snape and get him to turn to the light. I will say that he does want to redeem people but lets go over your points:

Arresting Malfoy or expelling him would kill Draco but furthermore it would also potentially put Snape in jeopardy as a spy, which would be the worst thing possible with Dumbledore dying soon. I do agree that he should not have let him run free throughout book 6 but once again Dumbledore was looking at the big picture in securing Snape's position among the Death Eaters.

I don't quite get how leaving Harry with the Dursleys was for their redemption, redemption from what?
