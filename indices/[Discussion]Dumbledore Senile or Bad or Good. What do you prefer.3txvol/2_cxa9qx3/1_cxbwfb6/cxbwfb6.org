I mostly agree, but if Dumbledore knew that there was a piece of soul in Harry, he knew of the Horcrux issue. When he learned of the Diary, he knew Voldemort had created more than one, and the difficulty just grew. If he didn't know of the soul in Harry until later than that, he was entirely grooming a martyr from the beginning, regardless of the true necessity.
