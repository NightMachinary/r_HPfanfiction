Why not all three?

My favourite characterizations of Dumbledore are those that acknowledge that he sees the world a different way (this is vague intentionally,) and as a consequence his actions are sometimes bad and sometimes good. I don't know if it's really the same as senile!Dumbledore but I /like/ the eccentric, slightly-mad old warlock much, much more than batshit!crazy Dumbledore/evil!Dumbles/anything else so absolute.

He's also my favourite character though.
