That's understandable then. Taking Pottermore as canon does alter the viewpoint a bit, making one thing seem like something else, leading to different interpretations.

I would agree with you though, going by the books themselves Dumbledore's thing was redemption.

However, McGonagall watched the house for a full day before Harry was brought and she tried telling Dumbledore that they were awful people. It had to have been something he considered since he didn't just ignore her. That plays into it, not just the 'living as a Muggle' which truly might be awful when you don't know what's happening. Perhaps it's both, just making a hard decision with little information.
