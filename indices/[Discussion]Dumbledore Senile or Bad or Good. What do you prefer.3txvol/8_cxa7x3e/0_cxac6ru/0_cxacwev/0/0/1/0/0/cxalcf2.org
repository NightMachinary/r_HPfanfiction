Well, she didn't tell him exactly why they were awful. And going with a previously raised point about the “difficult” years bit possibly being about the inability to do magic as a kid due to being with muggles, it was possible for Dumbledore to treat her comment about them as them being the most mugglish muggles ever. Well, that and there's the fact that most of the wizarding world doesn't seem to care about emotional trauma and wizards are quite harder to kill than muggles, so though I do not think it justifies the choice I feel it serves as a sufficient explanation as to why Dumbledore might have interpreted McGonagall's objection as the “he'll be unable to use magic until Hogwarts” possibility rather than the “they'll hurt him” one.

As for Lockhart, honestly it feels as if Madam Rowling didn't think the revelation about Dumbledore hiring Lockhart to expose him through. So let me counter that with a “what if” thing:

What if Dumbledore really had hired Lockhart hoping to expose it because there was nobody else applying for the position and the only alternatives were either relying on the ministry to appoint someone or tracking down some friend of his to take the position? And what if Dumbledore had done it hoping that Lockhart would let his guard down due to the presence of the Boy-Who-Lived and expose himself in September or maybe October at the latest and then he could plead to the minister to lend him one of his aurors to teach after Lockhart would have gotten outed? What if he'd been hoping that Lockhart wouldn't do things as stupid as requiring all the students to buy all of his overpriced books, but he didn't have a say in whatever books any teacher assigns and that was the why of the silly book list?
