Hiring Remus really was a questionable choice. I don't recall if it's canon/Pottermore canon that it had to do directly with Sirius escaping, but it's too convenient not to be related. He also used bribery then as well, promising wolfsbane (and Pottermore says that was the persuading factor).

Remus may have done well in the role, may have been one of the best defense teachers they had, but as we saw at the end of the year he was still directly dangerous to the students when he missed his potion due to a distraction. He wasn't honest with staff about how a murderer (in his eyes) was getting into the school. That's extremely poor judgment on Remus' part.

I really do want to know Dumbledore's direct motives for hiring him, I think it'd be interesting.
