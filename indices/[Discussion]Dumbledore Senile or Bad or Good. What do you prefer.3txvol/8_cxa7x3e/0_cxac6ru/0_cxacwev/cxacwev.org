I agree with the redeeming people thing, but individual things just don't seem to go that way. Returning Harry to the Dursleys every year was specifically for the sacrificial protection, not well being of because he thought the Dursleys would magically become accepting. Perhaps he first time, but not after that. The protection was just more important, "I knew you would (suffer)" "I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years"

He brought Lockhart on specifically to discredit him and reveal him as a fraud, using Harry's presence as bait, and knowing full well that there'd be an entire year's worth of students not learning anything useful in defense (which McGonagall called him on). Plus Dumbledore knew the position was Cursed. There was zero thought of Lockhart redeeming himself, that was straight up revenge for the two wizards Dumbledore knew. At least according to the Pottermore entry, he brushed that off saying students would learn what not to do. To me that says his overall goal was more important than the individual costs.

I don't think it's necessarily a "greater good" thing, just some of the things he does make him not entirely a "good" character, just has good goals and plans.

Edit: spelling, and also I see it kinda like how Hermione is a "good" character with a bit of a ruthless streak in her teen years.
