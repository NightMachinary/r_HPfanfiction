Senile is boring; it's only for crack. For serious fiction, making Dumbledore "Bad" very seldom works- because you see, if you take away Dumbledore's morality, you basically create a Voldemort /who knows how important love is/ and thus you create a bit of a Gary Stu villain. No, I like Dumbledore good, though it often creates the problem of "why doesn't he step in and solve everything."
