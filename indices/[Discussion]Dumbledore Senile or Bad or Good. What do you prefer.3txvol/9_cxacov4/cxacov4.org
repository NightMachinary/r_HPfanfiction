I prefer "Delusional" Dumbledore. He *thinks* he's doing good but in reality he's causing more harm with his "Greater Good" attitude. He's been living off a celebrity high since his victory over Grindleward, people have been praising him to high heavens, heaping awards and prestigious positions on him, he was even offered the position of MoM several times but "settled" for Supreme Mugwump, Grand Sorcerer, Chief Warlock and Headmaster to one of the most prestigious schools in the world.

He's spent so long hearing how he can do no wrong that he started believing it himself.
