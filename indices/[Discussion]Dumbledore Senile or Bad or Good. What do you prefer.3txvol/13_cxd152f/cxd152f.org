Depends on what you mean by "good," doesn't it?

If you are going to deal with the source material seriously and not ignore a whole slew of problems associated with his decisions - some explicit and some implicit - without him being evil, then you have to also incorporate some combination of: making mistakes, overlooking the obvious, arrogance, thinking the ends justify the means, ignoring the suffering of others, not even trying to get the input or advice of others, and more.

You can be a "good" person with all of that, if one focuses on the intentions and goals, but those harmed by your actions won't think of you as very "good" when it comes to their own lives, regardless of how much "good" you might be doing elsewhere.

The key word here is "combination" - if you put all of the blame on any one thing, he'll end up being evil, senile, a caricature, or something like that. If you spread the blame far enough around, you can probably avoid the negative labels. Mostly.

And that's a potentially very interesting character, though it's a difficult balancing act to do. It's what I'm trying in my story, at any rate: a Dumbledore who has the best of intentions and who genuinely wants good things to happen, but through a combination of ignorance, arrogance, focusing on the big picture/end goals, self-isolation, mistrust of others, and more, makes a lot of mistakes that cause a lot of harm - most of which he's unaware of.
