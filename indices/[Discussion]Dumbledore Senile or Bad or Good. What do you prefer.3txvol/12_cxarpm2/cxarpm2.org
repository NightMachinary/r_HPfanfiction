In fluff and romance I prefer Dumbledore as the happy grandfatherly type, who simply enjoys his job and simply doesn't care if people find that some of his behaviours are a bit weird - he's lived for so long, he has earned the right to basically do whatever he fucking wants.

In realistic or dark fics I like seeing him as the same person, only through no fault of his own burdened with too much at once. Some of his favourite students died at the hands of another student of his, who created an army to erradicate a large percentage of the population, the government is infiltrated by agents of voldemort, the pureblood-ideology is rooted so deeply in the heads of the people, that even the moderates are fueling the hate, by not actively opposing it. The enemies try to take away his position as headmaster to get access to the minds of the next generation when they are the most vulnerable to manipulation, former allies like sirius seem to have switched sides, people he wouldn't have thought possible of succumbing to the darkness have turned against those who love them (snape), and the war has killed so many good people that there are not enough experienced and/or trustworthy people to rely on.

Dumbledore hates the greater good with a passion, but life isn't fair and generally doesn't care whether you hate something or not.

Dumbledore portrayed as a politician out of options is - in my opinion - the best portrayal.

People like to say he is evil because he made some questionable decisions - but never consider it from his perspective: he can't give up the position of the supreme wugmump, if he doesn't want the justice-system to fall in the hands of those who consider not being of pure blood a crime, he cannot give up his position in the wizengamot, if he doesn't want the law fall into the hands of those who want the moderates to follow their vision of lawfullness, he cannot give up his position at hogwarts, because it would leave a whole generation vulnerable, he cannot take care of harry, because there is simply a limit to how much a single person (no matter how powerful) can handle.

He's a remarkable man who had to fight a losing battle, and managed to not give an inch for 10 fucking years, until harry appeared, and with him even more problems that shifted his focus to his position as headmaster.

In these 10 years he also wasn't able to find a replacement. Bones can't become minister, leader of the wizengamot or anything without losing her current position, and without an executive force that actually wants to imprison people who break the law, all changes at the political level are meaningless.

He cannot give his headmaster-position to anyone (even if he trusts his staff to a great degree), because the press and opposition would tear him apart, and would probably manage to either install a ministry-approved replacement, or atleast fill up the position of whoever he promotes.

So, now he has the choice of either sacrificing the law, sacrificing the justice, sacrifice a whole generation or sacrifice harry, by basically telling him “you are on your own now kiddo, good luck with voldemort“.

And being the great person he is he choses neither, he doesn't go the simply route of sacrificing a single person for the benefit of the masses, no, instead he decides to take harrys burden on himself aswell, he shields him from the public where he can, he allows him to attend school like every normal child, he allows him to choose his own path.

But at the same time he also recognizes that he cannot shield him forever.

So he tries to show him the right way (or what he considers right), teaches valuable life lessons, all in the hope that harry will grow up to become the replacement he so desperately needs.

And then he finds out that life still is not fair and that harry was destined to die at the hands of voldemort, because the horcrux would revive him.

And still he doesn't choose the easy route of guilt-tripping harry into sacrificing himself, or killing him himself, he allows harry to make this choice for himself.

That he shaped harry into a good person, a worthy successor, who just like him is willing to take the burden for other people, might be seen as manipulation, but that's only the perspective of a person who learned to differentiate between Harry and the boy-who-lived, yet failed to do the same for Dumbledore and the leader of the light.
