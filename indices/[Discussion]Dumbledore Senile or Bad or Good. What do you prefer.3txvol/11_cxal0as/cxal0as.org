I have enjoyed all of those characterizations at one point at least. However, its very specific when which of them tends to work (for me).

Senile: Given his old age, its not surprising that his brain would ask for retirement as well. There are fics out there that make this characterization working by using something a lot of old people do. They deny loosing their touch. In those fics, not telling Harry secrets and forgetting that Lily was not a well-loved relative of the Dursleys comes from his slowly fading memory.

Bad: He is a political powerhouse. Thats just fact. Given that you're either a sycophant or ruthless to make it to the top in the real world political arena (and stay there), the leap is not that far to stating that Dumbles is bad, or downright evil. I like this type of Dumbles a lot if it doesn't end up in bashing.

Good: If you portray him as good, then stick close to Rowlings characterization of the wise old wizard that truly knows best. Theres a reason why Dumbledore is one of my all time favourite characters in fiction.

In all three categories, I love it when he actually packs a punch. I personally always write him as a wizard of immense power/knowledge. Its, I think, one of the cores of his character, to be this legendary warlock.
