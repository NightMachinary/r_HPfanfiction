Not really what I was looking for, as I wanted to find something that fills the backstory of the characters we met, not one that redefines them :P.

However, I do think you managed to find a Dramione story I don't mind reading. I generally reject school-age Dramione as unreadble, but this doesn't really fall into that category...
