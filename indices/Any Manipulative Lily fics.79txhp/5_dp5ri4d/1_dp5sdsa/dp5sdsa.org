Well, I was looking for a characterization that fit into Cannon, so that excluded much Snily, but I don't object heavily to it. It would totally fit the request if it was something like 'so and so went back and time and through their interference the relationships change', as the author would still have to present a believable character that would have worked for the main story and then explain why things go different. Well done divergence fics also do this, and would fit.
