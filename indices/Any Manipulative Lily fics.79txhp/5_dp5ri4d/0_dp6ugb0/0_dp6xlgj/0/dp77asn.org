Haha well I would think that if your characters are taking on personalities of their own, that's a good thing and means you did a good job bringing them to life! Plus I think it makes sense that they keep fighting. Lily wouldn't forgive Severus right away after the things he's done. It makes sense that it would take a lot of time spent working together to build trust before anything romantic can happen between them. That said I /am/ excited for the eventual smooching!
