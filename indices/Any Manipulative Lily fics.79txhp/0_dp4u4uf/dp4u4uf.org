Lily is pretty manipulative in this - before dying, she basically manufactured Harry's extremely shitty situation, in the hope he will fix the world's problems in the future. From the way people speak of her, her personality was driven by pride in her magical skills and self-righteousness.

The other end of the spectrum: Lily is so determined to protect Harry that she doesn't hesitate in taking /any/ measure; dark magic, soul magic, dangerous alchemical creations, endangering innocents, even sacrificing them. She just doesn't give a fuck about anything as long as Harry is safe. Have to say this is one of my favorite portrayals of Lily ever.
