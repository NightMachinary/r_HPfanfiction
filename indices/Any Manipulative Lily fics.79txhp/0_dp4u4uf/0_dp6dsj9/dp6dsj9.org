Firebird is such an odd duck.

Like the premise of the world is interesting. It's a...I don't want say good but...the magic system there works.

Until, like all Marrs fics, it goes batshit insane and everyone dies.

Like Marrs really wants to give Alan Moore a run for his money.

Except he didn't have the nuance to weave the story in such a way you don't realize he's batshit insane in until the end like Moore does.
