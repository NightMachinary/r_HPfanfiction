Download the fanfic in mobi format and then you can plug your kindle into your computer and drag it into the documents folder. You can also use calibre to manage sending fics to your kindle. I think you can email them to your kindle but I've never bothered to set that up.

You can download the fics directly from ao3, use the fanfic plugin with calibre, or the ficsave website.
