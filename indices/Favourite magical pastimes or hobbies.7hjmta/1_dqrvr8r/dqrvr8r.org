Charms like Lily's fish for Prof. Slughorn. "Simple" magic, created for aesthetic reasons or bragging rights.

Cooking kinda comes up but they really never plumb the depths of possibilities for what and how cooking might happen magically. Maybe it would be really easy for something to either look good, or taste good, but be very difficult to do both.

Same for Herbology, it gets more love but I'm sure theres a lot that could be done. How do you cross breed magical plants? How do you make them more potent? Do they grow in magical areas or do areas become magical because of the plants?

I could imagine a world with some kind of face-off of magical skill. Not necessarily violent or antagonistic, but displays of one-up-manship like pyrotechnic displays but with magic.

A practical world would have kids games that build their magic, like blindfolded magic-sensing hide and seek. Or tag using magic paint balls to work on aiming.

I could imagine a story around amateur-built broom racing.
