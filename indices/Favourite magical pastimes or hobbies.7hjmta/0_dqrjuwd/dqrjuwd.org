Enchanted doll fights - like the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5LC0rG6Zco][fighting robots]] in Big Hero 6, except with magic. There could be an underground league at Hogwarts, with betting and everything, and the professors would /officially/ be against it, but there would be rumors about Flitwick and even Dumbledore occasionally getting in on the action.

I wanted to add this to my story but never got around to doing it.
