There's also exploding snap. I actually looked up gobstones on the wiki the other day and it doesn't really explain what it is. For some reason, I imagine it being like a game of marbles.

Some other hobbies could include:

- music

- creating a wireless show

- writing (for the Quibbler or maybe Hogwarts has a school paper)

- theater (we know Hogwarts put on a play of the Fountain of Fair Fortune)

- raising magical pets

- drawing/painting/other visual media (which you can then enchant, like Dean's banner)

- knitting
