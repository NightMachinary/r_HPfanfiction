Od that even though I know why Sirius acts the way he does in OOTP, I still am annoyed with him for that Hogsmeade thing and saying that Harry at least has been able to get out when he was attacked by dementors. That's not very comforting if he meant it that way.And if it hadn't been for his recklessness, there wouldn't have been all those years in prison and all this being locked up in the house he hates. I guess I'm nasty and am risking my life because Sirius's fans will most probably come after me. But I've read too many fanfics where he annoys me so maybe that's why I'm so mean. No matter if Rowling intended us to hate him by the end, she clearly failed, because most people are ready to defend him no matter the criticism. Sirius is perhaps the only character whose actions people are ready to justify.
