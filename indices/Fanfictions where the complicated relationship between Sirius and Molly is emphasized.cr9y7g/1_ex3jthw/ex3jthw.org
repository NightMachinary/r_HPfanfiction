I find Molly so unpalatable in OOTP and the most helpful comment I ever read was essentially: imagine if [Ted Bundy/insert your infamous criminal of choice] was exonerated and now wants to hang out with your daughter. The evidence is there. You *know* it's true. But.../really/?

Sirius isn't framed sympathetically by the text all the time, but it never doubts his innocence. Molly may not have been so sure. I almost get it that way...it was a lot to overcome. But she still went below the belt.

(And I have no doubt he was rising to get in her face. He does the exact same with Snape several chapters later. It's...not a great look.)

I know of one fanfic that shows the aftermath, but it's... angsty, and mostly a vehicle for Wolfstar hurt/comfort. I'll spare you.
