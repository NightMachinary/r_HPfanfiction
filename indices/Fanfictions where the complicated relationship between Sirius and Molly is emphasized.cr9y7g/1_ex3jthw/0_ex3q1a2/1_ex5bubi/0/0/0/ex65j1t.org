I don't think it's about caring what people think of him, just that he only had pretty much Harry and Remus there for him, and he already broke Ron's leg, gave him a fright in the dorm and lost him his pet rat. I feel like Sirius thinks he owes him a bit of peace, and Ron liked Sirius, so I don't think he'd like to afford having yet another person hate him. The Weasleys were also living with him for the time being, and having the entire family hating him won't do much to his mental health as Harry also spent lots of time around them.

I do wonder what he would've said to Molly if Lupin hadn't told him to sit down. Also, why would he just obediantly listen to Lupin, and not defend himself, I don't think Sirius is the type to back down. I also wonder what type of thing he would've said, would he have also gone completely insensitive on her like she did to him?
