I entirely agree about Sirius never backing down from a good fight, I wish Sirius had retorted back at Molly about her housing Harry's actual parents' murderer for years. A good jab under the belt. As for Lupin I never liked him with his so-called peaceful attitude, never sticking up for his friend and I never understood why Sirius would/should have had to obediently listen to him. Seriously, Sirius not retorting back at Molly because Remus had told him to back down was disappointing and quite out of character imo.
