Its so interesting to think that Rowling wanted us to agree with Hermione & dislike Sirius because I've never thought the majority of readers reacted that way.

Now this makes me want to do some kind of community analysis because its got me wondering what other aspects readers took a different way than JKR intended. For example when Hermione is nagging and Harry is annoyed with her, are we /supposed/ to agree with her and dislike Harry? If that was her aim she did not convey it well...
