Do you think it would have been more suited for Sirius's character to retort back at Molly wth a jab under the belt of his own ? You know something like reminding her that *she* was actually the one housing Harry's parents murderer for decades when he was at Azkaban.

Would you have liked it or would you find it disappointing from Sirius ?
