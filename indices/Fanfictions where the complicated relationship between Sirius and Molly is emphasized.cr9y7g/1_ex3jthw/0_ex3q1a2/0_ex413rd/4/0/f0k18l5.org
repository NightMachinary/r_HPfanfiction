I mean, I don't really blame him for it in the first place. The issue is that he doesn't really do anything but rise up. Remus doesn't let him ("Sirius, sit down!")

Her point in that scene is that he was impulsive and got himself into a stupid situation, then he goes and proves that nothing ever changes when he seems ready to /physically/ fight her.

So, yeah. I'd have rather he have told her where to shove it and he could have done so on like six different levels. Like wtf, Molly, your sons told you Harry had bars over his windows in CoS and you're going to act like you're Mother Superior. Sit down. He's trying.
