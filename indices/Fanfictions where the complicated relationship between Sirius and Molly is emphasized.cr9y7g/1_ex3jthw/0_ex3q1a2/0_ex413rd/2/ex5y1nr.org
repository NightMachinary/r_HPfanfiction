I do think Sirius was a classic Gryffindor with flaws and all, so I could see how he's reckless. But I think the only times we do see him as truly and utterly that, he's at a bad state of mind. Look at it this way, in Grimmauld Place and after James's death he was borderline mental. Scratch that after James died he was mental, laughing at a crime scene and then still laughing hysterically as they took him away. He'd lost it then. Poor Sirius.

I just cannot for the life of me make a connection with Grimmauld Sirius and Goblet Sirius. They're different people, so entirely different. I was honestly starting to think in OotP that Sirius of that book was actually informed Pettigrew was killed on a mission or something and all his proof had gone, but he's actually alive and not until later did I realise he was so depressed in his childhood home.

I wholeheartedly believe James was everything Sirius needed (+Remus and Peter, until he betrayed them all I guess), so I don't particularly agree when Sirius has a gf/wife before he goes to Azkaban. As well as a kid? I believe it completely misses the point of his character and his relationship with James. Come to think of it, every fanfiction goes ahead and emphasizes Sirius and Remus, Sirius and Lily, Sirius and Marlene WhoEver, but never actually Sirius and his absolute best friend, James.
