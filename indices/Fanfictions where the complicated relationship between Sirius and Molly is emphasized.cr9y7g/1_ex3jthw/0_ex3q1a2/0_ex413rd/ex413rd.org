Ugh. YES. I agree so much with what you wrote. I would love to run a poll to see his popularity among fans who (i) read the books as they came out; (ii) fans who saw the movie first; (iii) fans who read book first, but without forced pause. I think there would be some significant variation. I read as they were released, and I think part of my undying affection for this character is that we had GoF---where he is at points, frankly, adorable---and a three year period while that seeped in, only to get blindsided by OOTP. It was weird to realize the same godfather who sent a muddy paw print pep talk card to Harry was going to punch Molly Weasley in the face /s.

The only way to reconcile that as a reader, I thought, was the house and this new environment. He was more content eating rats in a cave in his dirty prison clothes. It really said a lot for how he viewed Grimmauld. I think most readers picked up on that and were sympathetic to it, but many didn't and the text sides with them. There was Hermione, the author mouthpiece, calling him “selfish” and implying that he's crazy, and Molly teasing the “fits of the sullens.” The idea of someone who was likely in solitary confinement for over a decade with only the worst moments of his life then left---mostly alone---in a house that gave rise to a lot of those bad memories is unconscionable to me. To turn around and chide him for being unhappy there is distinctly cruel. No wonder he so loved James; he was probably the only person who was ever decent to him! The same James who was prepared to make him Secret Keeper even though it was “obvious” and a terrible plan, almost certain to end with his death or torture. And he feels guilty about not doing that for him! Like...holy shit. What exactly did your mother do to your self-worth?

The unhappy childhood is mainly played for laughs (the knee slapping hilarity of calling your child an “abomination”). Rowling made him the bad guy in the Kreacher arc despite, you know, the fact that Kreacher conspired to /murder/ him, all of which again undermined character traits in GoF. He specifically won over my animal-loving heart because of his treatment of so-called inferiors like Buckbeak, Crookshanks, and Pig. Hell, even those mail-delivering parrots from the tropics. He literally talked to animals. Then in the next book he's slinging Kreacher from the room by the dirty loin cloth. The reason behind the disparate treatment seemed obvious to me, but based on the number of times a week someone posts a ‘Hot Take TM' on [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]] about how he did not live up to his own standards, no one really remembers the other stuff. They remember the house elf.

On the reasons he stayed in the house: he respects Dumbledore, but he does not always listen to him. He does here. I think there are a few reasons. For one, his involvement in the Order would be threatened, and that's the only thing giving him a sense of purpose apart from Harry; I don't see Dumbledore sharing information with him otherwise if he would be a security risk. Pettigrew would have reunited with Voldemort, so his disguise is likely shot to hell, which rules out Hogsmede/England. And he's not going to be willing to leave Harry for some distant location now that Voldemort is back. He stayed from obligation and duty. I think the text again goes for the weakest possible twist on this---he looks like a bratty child under house arrest because he's too immature to be trusted outside.

Finally---and maybe this just says a lot about me---I genuinely do not understand how his defining character trait is recklessness, such that even Rowling herself called him a “loose cannon.” Such that Harry, in a moment that sticks out like a sore thumb in DH, reflects that he will be as reckless a godfather as Sirius was to him. There are two moments where he is undeniably so: breaking into the dorm and going after Pettigrew on Halloween night. (The latter I would say is justified but that's a separate rant for a separate day.) But, going to the train station in disguise? Wanting to meet up with Harry in Hogsmede? The Quidditch match? Supporting the DA (/HERMIONE/)? I think there's a distinction between reckless and unnecessary behavior, and trying to live whatever life someone whose freedom was stripped for /fifteen years/ can make. It's framed as the reason to mistrust this character, but honestly, it's the reason I like him.
