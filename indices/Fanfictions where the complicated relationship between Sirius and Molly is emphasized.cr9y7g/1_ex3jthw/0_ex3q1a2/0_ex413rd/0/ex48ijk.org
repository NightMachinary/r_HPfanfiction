I feel Sirius could have gone down a major Darker path without James Friendship.

I imagine a younger sirius while a rebel against his parents might still have been brainwashed in the blood purity nonsense but friendship with James and the good influence of James parents he was able to shed that.

James was likely the first true friend Sirius had, someone who did not hang around him because their parents are friends but because he actually enjoyed Sirius company

I imagine the two best days of sirius life from his own perspective was the day he met James and the day when Harry was born.

I honestly think Sirius Hating kreacher is quite reasonable, Kreacher reminded Sirius of home, I imagine Kreacher snitched on sirius to his parents often.

Kreacher is not an animal, Sirius is kind to animals, Kreacher is a living intelligent being who is a living reminder of the worst of the blacks.

Sirius behaviour in ootp makes alot of sense too, all his friends are risking their lives, while sirius is stuck alone in his childhood house with his crazy elf and crazy moms painting for company
