Kreacher does more than merely remind Sirius of home. He reenacts painful moments from Sirius' life. He repeats Sirius' mother's verbally abusive commentary. He directs ugly, dehumanizing, threatening slurs at Sirius' guests and friends. When Sirius tries to divest the house of dangerous, dark objects, Kreacher follows him around and un-does the work.

But because Kreacher was Sirius' family slave (who he didn't enslave and who he was couldn't free without risking the health/safety of everyone involved), Sirius is 100% the bad guy, an abuser of the helpless, a reckless hypocrite, at fault for his own death, etc.

I kind of hate OOTP, honestly.
