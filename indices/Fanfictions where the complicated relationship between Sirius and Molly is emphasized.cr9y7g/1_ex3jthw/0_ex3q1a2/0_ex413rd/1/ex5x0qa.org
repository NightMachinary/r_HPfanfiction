Yes yes yes to everything you said. Azkaban also wasn't just (just? I think what follows is more than enough) a place where you are mentally tortured to insanity. Arthur spent a few moments there and he went back all shaking and wouldn't talk about it at all. Imagine how terrible that alone must've been. Now multiply Arthur by 12 years and I'm baffled Sirius wasn't as mentally unhinged as Bellatrix (although he was undoubtedly a bit crazed at first). Hagrid said that he wished he could just die in his sleep and never wake up again. Add to that the coldness of it, it's isolated location (in the middle of the North Sea), and Sirius being thin enough in his own words that he was able to slip through the bars in his animagus form. His animagus form was big and 'bearlike', so he was a bit bigger than the average dog. He must've been starved or close to death. In his mugshot (?), Harry thought that he was so pale and gaunt, he looked like a vampire. Then he's shocked by the picture of Sirius years and years ago and thinks he's indistinguishable from now. He's later described as a corpse. So are the other Azkaban escapees. So Azkaban is so cruel, they mentally torture their prisoners, starve them and possibly even have goes at them for laughs.

What really gets me though is when Hermione calls him 'Mr. Black' and 'Sirius' and he's so baffled and shocked he jumps. He hasn't been addressed politely in over a decade and was locked up alone with all the unpleasantries of Azkaban. Dementors cannot speak so there must have been at least rounds made by human guards. When Remus hugs him, he doesn't even hug him back. He hasn't been shown any friendly contact for years and years and years. That's so sad, he just needs to be engulfed with a big, warm and comfy hug and, you know, get some therapy while we're at it. Dumbledore failed to deliver him anything of that. The problem is I love Dumbledore bit this is just something I cannot excuse. I often wonder about their relationship way before Azkaban and in school.

It's just all so enfuriating for (Sirius obviously who shouldn't be blamed for anything he's gone through and being angry and upset at being locked up at a place where he likely had memories of played hundreds of times in Azkaban, having Molly ridicule what he's gone through by calling it 'fits of the sullens' as her own. Husband. Has. Gone. Through. It) me. And then Rowling goes and tells us on Pottermore 'Sirius was a big black dog animagus'.
