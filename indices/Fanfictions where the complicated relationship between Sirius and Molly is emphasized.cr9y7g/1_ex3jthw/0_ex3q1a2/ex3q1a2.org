To be honest, since Hermione was essentially Rowling's mouthpiece in the books sometimes, I felt she was borderline bashing Sirius in the fifth book. For one, he never saw Harry as James. Secondly, he was in need of therapy, whether by seeing an actual therapist or just not being in a place that triggered his PTSD. It was so likely that he was abused at home, both emotionally and maybe even physically. Yet Rowling doesn't address this. I have this feeling she really wanted us to hate him before she killed him off, so we don't miss him. And for me? It almost worked, by the time I reached his death I was so annoyed with him, but did feel a bit sad. Think Abby Griffin from the 100, like the annoying character everyone wants to die but feels sad when they actually do.

On later rereads however I didn't feel this way at all, I was actually sobbing by the time I reached his death. He was so mistreated by everyone around him, except for maybe Remus and Tonks (Molly, Dumbledore, Kreacher, Harry didn't even have the decency to at least open the gift to see what it was, Hermione was always disapproving of him and freaking Snape).

Hermione wanted to start the DA but when she heard Sirius say it was a good idea she was suddenly reluctant to start it. Why exactly? At the first reading I thought Molly's sentence was a sick burn, true but still a bit sick but later on it was just downright inappropriate. Dumbledore admits Sirius was at a bad state of mind. Dude, if he has a bounty on his head, just let him get back to whichever tropical region he came from and yet he stayed for Harry, who didn't even open the mirror AT ALL. Like, ok if you think it's dangerous why not just look at it out of curiousity (Harry was always too nosy for his own good but now he ran out of it. Why....). Ron was the only one who seemed to get the poor guy.

And then Rowling went ahead and made my favourite line of the series by Sirius completely repulsive by his treatment of Kreacher. By the time his life ended, Rowling had basically thrown Sirius under the bus and it was ugly to read. His life is just so sad. Now however, I appreciate him as a complex character and I also love Molly for who she is as a person.
