I'm not even sure how to put it into words really. Some of the other fans on here and other sites where not the best. Just so unwelcoming. Most of the fans I have met where obsessive fangirls or really emo guys and they both don't really like it when someone thinks outside of their arbitrary norm. Not to mention It feels like I'm Charlie Weasley trying to hang with Ron and his friends. Sure I'm okay one way or another but it seems like two different worlds.

In short I feel disconnected from the rest of the fanbase.

It's not really something too ambitious, I'm not trying to write seven books worth of content. What I'm writing is pretty straight forward and is focused around an OC. Mainly because I have no ideas of what to do with already established characters.

The thing is that I don't think I really mesh well with the fanbase so the way some fan fic writers casually post and write etc just don't work for me. It's just like someone who's writing an article for a company with a boss who they don't get along with at all.
