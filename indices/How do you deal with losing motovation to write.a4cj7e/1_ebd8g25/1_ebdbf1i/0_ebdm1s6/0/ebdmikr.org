The thing is that I grew up with the series and never thought of wanting to join the fanbase until recently. I guess I missed the window and now I just got to accept that it might not happen.

What drives me is other fans, seeing as I don't have any friends who like Harry Potter. The forums and groups are my only way to interact with other fans.
