I do somewhat know what you are saying. I don't really regard myself as part of the 'fandom'. I'm too old and cynical and I neither read nor write what the majority wants to see.

But if there's a story chewing its way through your brain, it has to get out somehow, doesn't it? The best thing to do is get on with it and don't use these forums because they'll make you feel rotten.
