Can you elaborate on this? What is it about these interactions that make you lose motivation? Bad behavior? Envy?

Motivation can be a tricky thing. There are definitely times when I'm just not feeling it and that's okay. You're not on any kind of schedule, you don't have a giant publishing advance you have to justify. You're doing this as a hobby and if you don't feel like doing it right now, then that's fine. Take a step back. I took a step back for twelve years.

Could it also be a possibility that you're overwhelming yourself with something too ambitious? When I started writing in the HP fandom after OOTP came out, I limited myself to self-contained one shots because I had a history of getting too ambitious and abandoning larger works due to poor planning. Give yourself permission to write a smaller story or even a single scene. Some people like to post "drabbles" which are often less than 500 words.

Take your time and don't try and force yourself to write if you don't feel like it. Maybe you'll find it you're more relaxed about it, the motivation will follow!
