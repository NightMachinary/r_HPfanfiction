That's a really good point. I guess I started writing the fic i am on the end of the wave of rereading the books for a second time this year. The initial wave from when I first got into Harry Potter has passed a long time ago. Mainly because I was the only one I knew who liked it, there was only so much I could do.

So now there's no fuel to write with other sources exhausted. It would help I could find my part of the fandom. So I'd have someone to write for and have my muse again.
