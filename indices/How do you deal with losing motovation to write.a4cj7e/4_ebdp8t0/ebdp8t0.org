It's really similar to losing your musical muse. There's literally nothing you can do unless you want to brute force it out. Which works for stories/writing, and for certain music genres it works as well.

Honestly, I'd go back to what inspired you to write it in the first place and read that story again. Or go look at a classic, or current classic in the making to get you in that mood again. There's a chance you'll get that certain muse again, but ere's another chance you might be inspired to do something completely different.

There's a reason why some Authors take YEARS to finish a single published book. With Paid Proofreading. And Editing thats paid for. And book groups for Peer Review. And More Editing thats Paid For.
