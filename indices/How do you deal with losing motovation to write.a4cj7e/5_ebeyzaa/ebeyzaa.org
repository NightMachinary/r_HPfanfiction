A really good thing to deal with loss of motivation is to get yourself a Beta, and not specifically for the purpose of editing, but just someone to bounce ideas off or talk about your fic. It makes a hell of a difference to writing when you have someone who shares your enthusiasm and getting those ideas out there with someone else will ignite your own enthusiasm too.
