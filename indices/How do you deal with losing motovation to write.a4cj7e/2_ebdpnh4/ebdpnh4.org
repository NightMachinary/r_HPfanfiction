Something that works for me is to take a break from whatever story you're struggling with and just write the most absurd crack fic you can think of.

Don't worry about quality or plotting or even if it's funny, just put words on page as soon as they come in your head. I've got a long, rambling Google doc that just pure crack.

Something about seeing yourself write a bunch of words, even if they're crap, helps me get my motivation back to work on the "good" writing.
