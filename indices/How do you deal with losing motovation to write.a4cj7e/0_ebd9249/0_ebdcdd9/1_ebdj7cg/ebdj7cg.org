Yes, Achille is right Full Paragon! You do not have to be scared to update or not update a story! People will understand if you do have writer's block or if you got busy and stuff. :) I haven't updated my Fight For Rights story in a few months now I think, and I don't think Achille is mad at me for it! :) :)
