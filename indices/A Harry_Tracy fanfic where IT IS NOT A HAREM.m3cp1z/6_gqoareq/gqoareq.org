Most stories involving Harry/Tracey sadly are either harem fics or it's a Harry/Daphne/Tracey fic with Harry/Daphne as the main focus.

The only fic that I know of that comes somewhat close to your request is linkffn(4508835). It's only ~27k words, and while Daphne does later on join the pairing she isn't the main focus. (You could alternatively read the first chapter as a one-shot to maintain Harry/Tracey purity)
