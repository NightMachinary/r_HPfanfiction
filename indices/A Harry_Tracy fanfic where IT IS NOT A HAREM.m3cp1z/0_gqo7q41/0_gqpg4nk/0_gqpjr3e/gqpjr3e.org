I agree, but fanon Tracey tends to be Daphne's best and/or only friend/sidekick. Which is why it's almost always Daphne who gets paired with Harry instead of Tracey. Can't have the mc dating the sidekick, now can we.

I have also seen Tracey portrayed as Daphne's bi-sexual lover just to give the mc easy access to a threesome/three way pairing.
