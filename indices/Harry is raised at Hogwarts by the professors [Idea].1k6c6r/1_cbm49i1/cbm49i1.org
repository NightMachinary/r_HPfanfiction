About the only one I remember of even middling quality is Blueowl's, where he uses this premise in the time travel story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4801140/2/Mysterious-Thing-Time][Mysterious Thing, Time]]. The premise is that Harry and Dumbledore go back in time to the night of Voldemort's first fall. Harry finds his consciousness in the body of his infant self. Going by the name Harry Dumbledore, Harry is raised at Hogwarts.

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.
