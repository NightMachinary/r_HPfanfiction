Reminds me of that one where Harry can control shadows. It's slash with Harry/Theo Nott (I think).

Harry can be very ruthless and he mostly wants to be left alone but ends up with marked followers cause he's also very protective of his friends and people wanted in on that.

Can't remember the name or author, but I'll try to find it.
