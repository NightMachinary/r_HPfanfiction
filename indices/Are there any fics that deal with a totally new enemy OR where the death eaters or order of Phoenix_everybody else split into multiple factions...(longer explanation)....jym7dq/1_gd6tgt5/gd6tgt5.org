You might like my story "Divided and Entwined", which focuses on a brutal civil war with multiple factions and its aftermath. Various characters are affected by the war, some sliding down a slippery slope, others managing to keep some of their principles. Often, actions have unintended consequences, affecting the plans of all factions. Even allies can ruin each other's plans.
