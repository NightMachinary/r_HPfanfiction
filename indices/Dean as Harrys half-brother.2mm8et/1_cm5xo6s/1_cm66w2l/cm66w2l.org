You've hit on a problem in a large percentage of fanfic - relationshippy stories are all hat and no horse. I would read this Dean-Harry fic if their relationship lent intensity to a story with a plot. Say, Dean hates Harry out of residual resentment toward James ... Harry is threatened by Dementors and Dean distracts them long enough for Harry to rescue them both with a Patronus ... Dean reluctantly joins Dumbledore's Army to learn more ... Dean finds himself defending Harry in the Department of Mysteries because pettiness must be put aside in time of war ... Finally, they bond over the loss of Sirius Black and become true brothers. That sort of thing.
