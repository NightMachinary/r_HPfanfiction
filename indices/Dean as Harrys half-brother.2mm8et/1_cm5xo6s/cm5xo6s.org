My first reaction to this is to wonder what the point of it all is. Okay, fine, you've got an AU where James had an affair and Dean is his son. It's a stretch, but I guess if it fit with the rest of the fic I could just about suspend my disbelief. Fine... but what's the fic actually about? Dean being Harry's brother isn't a plot. Where's the conflict going to come from? What's the beginning, middle and end?
