Well obviously, its the skeleton of the story. There'll be various objects surrounding their father that will come into play as the story develops, opening new avenues of storytelling with particular reference to /the sins or the father are reflect upon the son/. For example I'm going to give magic and the Marauders a slightly darker edge and have the animagus /ritual/ involve the staining of the soul and having some of that passing down to Harry and Dean. Eventually forcing Harry and Dean to deal with some heavy shit about responsibility and what it is to be a man. However, the main theme of the story is brotherhood and the struggles of family.
