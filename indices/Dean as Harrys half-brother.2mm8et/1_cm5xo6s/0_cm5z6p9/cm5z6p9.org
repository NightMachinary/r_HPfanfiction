I'm planning it to be insular dramedy fic that explores the emotional turmoil of Dean and Harry as they attempt to build a relationship. I've decided that it'll be set during the 3rd book so the main plot of the 3rd book will carry the story forward for the most part.

The first act will be primarily working up to Dean finding out about this secret and putting it together (this is where the timelines become important) and telling Harry.

Second act is Harry confirming the story/being confused and torn about the idea of family, particularly because of his budding bond with Remus and Remus building James and Lily up. Harry not knowing what to do ignores it/bottles it up. Naturally there is this awkward period where Dean and Harry being forced see each other every day because of classes/common room etc, until it comes to a head. I'm thinking around the time the fat lady's portrait gets slashed and Harry feeling obligated to tell Dean that Sirius might be after him too.

Third act is Dean and Harry coming together, learning about each other and finally facing Sirius as a team which cements their bond.
