I'd read it, even if there isn't much plot aside from the normal plot of the according book + the emotional new aspects. And I think you could make it work, Lily and James did not have to be perfect just because they married directly out of school. Or rather, because of that. The affair could have started with James getting drunk in a muggle bar after a fight with Lily over something, and him afterwards noticing that he was more relaxed due to it, meaning less fights. Being recruited for a war directly after school, marrying directly after school, having a child just a bit later, during a war, that has to be stressful. So yeah, I could imagine it if you explain it well.
