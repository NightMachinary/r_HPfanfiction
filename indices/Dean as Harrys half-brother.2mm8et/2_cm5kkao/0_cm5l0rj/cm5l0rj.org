Dean's mum is a Muggle, who didn't even know whether Dean's bio dad was a wizard or not. Part of the reason I think it would work is that the 2 worlds don't collide without Dean being a wizard. I don't think the Potters were that famous, and the war was on which gives an excuse to escape into a magic war free zone and meet Deans mum. I could also play it off that James pretended to go on top secret missions (with Sirius covering his back) were he would woo her.
