Looking it up, there is one thing JKR said in an interview that supports your claim. Apparently James didn't have a job after Hogwarts because he had enough money to support Lily and himself without it. He also supported Remus because he couldn't gain employment. But it must be said that "trust vault" and "family vault" are purely fan creations.
