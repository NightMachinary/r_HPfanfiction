Well it depends on if you take stock in the books or movies more. In the movies, Harry's vault wasn't exactly hurting for gold. And its just Harry's vault, never called the Potter vault. So its safe to assume that James had at least that much gold just laying around. Probably a lot more.

Anyways, I know it sounds like a load of fanon crap but with the combined literary and visual aids from books and movies, my points hopefully make sense. I am just trying to help the OP if he/she wants to make the fic complaint with canon.
