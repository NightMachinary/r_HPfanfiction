Don't usually go in for reccing my own stuff, but I've recently commenced a HP/DC crossover and it kinda applies: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13521865/1/Kicking-Gotham][Kicking Gotham]]

Only a couple of chapters in at the moment, I'm currently planning to update once every three days and I've posted up to chapter 5 on DarkLordPotter Work by Author. It's also already completed in draft so no need to worry about it going unfinished. ^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{ffnbot!directlinks}}}}}}}}}}}}
