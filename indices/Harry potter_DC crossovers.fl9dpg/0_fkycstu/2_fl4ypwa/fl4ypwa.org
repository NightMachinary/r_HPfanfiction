I have you on my followed authors list on FFN so I've been reading this since the first chapter. Really interesting so far. I'm pretty curious to find out if Poison Ivy's plants are actually magical in nature or not. Since you mention Superman existing I imagine superpowers can exist in this universe as a thing separate from magic. And to see how Harry reacts if he eventually finds out how wrong he was about Bruce when he brushed him off as just a billionaire playboy that definitely isn't actually running his company.
