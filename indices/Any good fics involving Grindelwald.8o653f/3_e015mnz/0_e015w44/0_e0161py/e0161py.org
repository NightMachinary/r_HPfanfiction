It is canon-compliant. However, it's also very different-it adds to the story in ways that were never mentioned in the books but also work really well within the books (filling in the gaps as it were).

Although it was written before Fantastic Beasts , in which I think it can be safely concluded that Ariana was an Obscurus, it does something very similar to that with her.
