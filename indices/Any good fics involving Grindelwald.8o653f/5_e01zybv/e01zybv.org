I know of several time travel fics that heavily feature Grindelwald. Sadly, my favorite ones both seem to be dead fics at this point. Both of these are well written with some excellent scenes of World War 2.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] - (67 chapters) Baby Harry gets sent back in time on the night that he was supposed to be left on the Dursleys' doorstep. He lands at the orphanage where Tom Riddle was born. The two boys grow up thinking that they are brothers. Meanwhile, Grindelwald's scheming in Europe leads to the troubling discovery of an unstable time loop, which might threaten the survival of the entire world. Grindelwald decides that he must entwine his fate with that of the two boys currently living in Wool's Orphanage.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] - (28 chapters) After the war is over, Harry travels back in time to adopt eight year old Tom Riddle. Unfortunately, Harry's life gets more complicated when Grindelwald notices that the Elder Wand is behaving oddly.
