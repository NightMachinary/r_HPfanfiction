Let's see, most of these fics have Grindelwald as important but not the main focus:

Hail Odysseus linkffn(Hail Odysseus): Grindelwald mentors Harry, mostly by flashback. Heavyweight champion of bashing fics.

The One He Feared linkffn(The One He Feared): Mostly by flashback in the first chapter, but still a very interesting Grindelwald depiction.

Realignment linkffn(Realignment): If you want powerful Grindelwald, this is THE fic. Highlights include: Grindelwald conjures a miniature sun in his hand, changes the world into a realm of grays and blacks, and summons a spectre of death to stop a killing curse. Thats in one chapter too.

Skitterleap linkffn(Skitterleap): Grindelwald beat Dumbledore. The results are practically alien, and I don't have enough characters to do the AU here justice.
