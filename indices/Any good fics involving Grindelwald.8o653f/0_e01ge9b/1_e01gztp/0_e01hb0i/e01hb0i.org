Skitterleap is actually complete, its just that the story just sort of ends, probably in anticipation of a future sequel that never happened.

If you like action and powerful magic, then Realignment is the way to go. It really doesn't have much of an overarching plot. Basically imagine if the T-700 got sent back to kill John Connor, but he is being protected by the T-1000. Now replace those characters with Harry, Tom, and Albus, and you get this fic. Grindelwald is like the T-X in that analogy, in that he outclasses everyone.
