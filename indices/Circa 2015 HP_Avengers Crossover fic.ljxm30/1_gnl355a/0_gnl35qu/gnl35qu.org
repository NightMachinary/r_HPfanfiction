Whispering Darkness Strangers in Bars [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8329787/1/]] Completed

Everyone else was avoiding the strange man but Harry felt himself drawn to him. His loud, archaic speech and enthusiastic drinking seemed to be off-putting to most people but to the Gryffindor it felt comfortingly familiar how different the man was.

Whispering Darkness Beyond Secrets [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9292567/1/]] Completed

He wasn't a threat here -- he wasn't an issue. Just a bystander - someone who didn't know what was really going on here. Except that Harry did know -- he knew enough, because he knew Bruce and he knew lies and he knew being hunted and in the end this was Bruce's choice. One-shot.

Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."

The Plot Bunny Whisperer Deus Ex Machina [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10983547/1/]] Completed

(Or - The Time MoD!Harry Got Fed Up and Dealt With Loki Himself, to the Consternation and Confusion of Everyone Else.) Some days, dealing with a bunch of bratty quasi-immortal beings and their temper tantrums just wasn't worth it. Especially when they kept causing him so much extra paperwork. [One-Shot]

Whispering Darkness Fly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8330170/1/]] Completed

Harry fled his past, flew away from the shadows that still haunted him. Steve had his own futuristic foes to battle. And even Fury wasn't sure how to go about debriefing a supposed mythical creature. Rated for Fury's coarse language.

"Harry Potter had never really managed a normal, peaceful Halloween, so he really shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly displaced from the grocery store and found himself in front of a maniacally cackling man in a very dramatic outfit."

Morta's Priest Wand and Shield [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/]] In-Progress July 22, 2015

The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.
