So, not sure if any of these is the one you want, but this is my collection of HP Avengers crossovers:

Hyliian Adrift 1: Recalibration [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7151309]] Completed

"The Asset had been without a handler for four days, six hours, twenty-seven minutes and fifteen seconds. A newspaper it had found in a bin seemed to suggest that it had not only relocated itself physically, but temporally as well, seeing as how the last time its handler had removed it from cryostasis had been 2011, not 1980."

Hyliian Adrift 2: Rewired [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7208333]] Completed

"Lord Slytherin had been acting erratic and increasingly illogical for the past few weeks. He had not given the Asset a single command in nine days, twenty-one hours, seventeen minutes and four seconds. According to protocol, Lord Slytherin was no longer its Primary Handler. The Asset wondered if Lord Slytherin was aware of this. *Sequel to Recalibration.*"

Hyliian Adrift 3: Recommissioned [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7365097]] Completed

One thing the Asset had known, without its handlers having to tell it so, was that there will always be someone willing to pay to have someone else killed. So far, even in this new world and new time, this had held true. The Asset had breathed reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering long before it had become the Fist of Hydra. Before the Winter Soldier had been Hydra's attack dog, it had been Призрак, the Ghost of Russia. When given an inkling of choice, the Asset would always choose subtlety. There was a reason the Asset was at its most lethal from miles away. Sequel to Rewired

tielan Avengers Wizarding World 2: How To Ask A Girl To The Yule Ball [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7350724]] Completed

It occurs to Steve that he might have started with some small talk. Only Maria doesn't do small talk. Their last conversation stayed innocuous for two sentences before she asked him what he wanted and he made up some question that she knew wasn't what he wanted and so she answered it and he had to go away again.

cywsaphyre Finding Home 1: Finding Home [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/413495]] Completed

When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.

cywsaphyre Finding Home 2: The Letter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8193983/1/]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/427446]] Completed

Oneshot in the Finding Home!verse. The problems grow as Harry receives a letter. It's been eight years after all.

cywsaphyre Finding Home 3: Difference of Opinion [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8198799/1/]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/429134]] Completed

cywsaphyre Finding Home 4: Choices [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8195160/1/]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/427957]] Completed

Oneshot in the Finding Home!verse. In a war, there are always sides, and choices must be made. Some choices are easy. Others, not so much.

"Dark lords and alien invasions are the least of Harry's worries. The world won't end if he has anything to say about it. Approved sequel to cywsaphyre's Finding Home. No Slash."

Aytheria Misunderstandings 'Verse 2: Misunderstandings and An Alien Invasion [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6304756]] Completed

"*""A giant of a man wearing what looked like the American flag as some sort of armour was storming towards him from the ground. From above, a red and gold flying metal robot dove towards them. And directly in front of him, an alien struggled through the wreckage of its hovercraft with a snarl and a deadly looking gun.* *Sometimes he had to pause a moment to wonder how he got himself into these situations.""*"

cywsaphyre Wanderer 2: Wanderer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/]] Declared Dead In-Progress August 13, 2017 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/431643]] Declared Dead In-Progress June 16, 2012

Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.
