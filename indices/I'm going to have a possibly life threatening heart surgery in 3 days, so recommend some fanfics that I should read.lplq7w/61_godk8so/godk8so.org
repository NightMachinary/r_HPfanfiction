The Seventh Horcrux is a funny Harry Potter fanfic with the idea of the Horcrux basically causing Harry to be Voldemort, but follow roughly the same path as canon.

I just checked and it's longer than I remember it being, though, so I can't say it's short like I thought it was.

I've saved this post.
