I hope your surgery goes well.\\
These are some of my favourites:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][the family evans by dirgewithoutmusic]] - What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?\\
Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).\\
Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.\\
(An amazing look at what Harry's life could have been had Petunia chosen to love him instead.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18505909][they'll turn out to be heroes by Nicnac]] - Placed with the Dursleys Harry will be safe, but Dumbledore would still like to have someone nearby to keep an eye on him. Someone mild and unassuming and unlikely to upset the Dursleys. Really, there's only one good choice. (Rather than Mrs Fig, Remus is assigned to watch Harry.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14787410][east, west, home's best by taizi]] - You can never have too many brothers, Ron decides, for the very first time in his life. And there's always room in the Burrow for another Weasley, even if only an honorary one.\\
(I also recommend Best Served Cold by enchanted sleeper, which was inspired by and is a follow up to the above fic, and is therefore linked at the bottom of the page.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4608288/chapters/10502271][Proud by WinterLeighEnd]] - Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.\\
(An interesting take on what Vernon and Harry's relationship could have been without all the History that Petunia brought into the picture.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8136625][Deepest Fear Revealed: one-shot version by Potterworm]] - After Harry's boggart appears as his Uncle Vernon, Professor Lupin takes him for a chat with Headmaster Dumbledore, and then everything changes. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22624558][The Girl Who Thrived by imaginary_golux]] - Voldemort didn't think a girl could be his downfall. Harriet Jane Potter begs to differ.\\
(A look at what might have happened, had Harry been born a girl.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7811107][you'll go the same way by LullabyKnell]] - Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the /other/ side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... /Family First/, after all.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other by dirgewithoutmusic]] - When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.\\
This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.\\
When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated.\\
And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18468001][And the Unethical Binding Contract by justafandomfollower]] - AU. What if the Triwizard Tournament took place in Harry's first year, not his fourth? (Author's note: Basically, it's an AU if the tournament happened Harry's first year, but the other champions were the same (and still 17). There were a lot of different ways to interpret that kind of AU - Quirrell vs. Moody!Crouch, Wormtail - so I hope you don't mind the way I did it. I wanted a happy(ish) ending.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24500287/chapters/59141077][who discovered your secret by LullabyKnell]] - *Pre-Canon AU*: On the street named Privet Drive, in Little Whinging, Surrey, a man lived alone at Number Eight, supposedly.\\
It was apparently difficult to tell. (A Regulus Black lives AU)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23636302][Parents' Evening by bikelock28]] - Petunia Dursley attends her son's parents' evening. Unfortunately, his teacher wants to discuss Petunia's nephew. (Set before the beginning of the first book, this is an interesting look at the justifications Petunia gives herself for her treatment of Harry.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23168287][disguised as something else by aloneintherain]] - “I used to sleep there,” Harry snaps.\\
He's breathing hard. He feels like he's run a marathon, even though he's just sitting there uselessly, staring at a perfectly ordinary cupboard.\\
“What?” Sirius says. ( Set in a fix-it AU where the war ends early (though definitely still happens), and Sirius and Remus make it out alive and manage to gain custody of Harry, this fic looks at the aftereffects of the trauma Harry sustained while living at the Dursley's.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4993657][Welcome Home (under orphan_account)]] - After escaping Azkaban, Sirius goes to find his godson. (A Sirius puts Harry first for once fic.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15068012/chapters/34933661][The Child of Azkaban by LonelyHarvest]] - Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them.\\
...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths. (A very AU, extremely well written and highly enjoyable novel length fic. It is part of an ongoing series, but the first fic is complete and very worth the read.)
