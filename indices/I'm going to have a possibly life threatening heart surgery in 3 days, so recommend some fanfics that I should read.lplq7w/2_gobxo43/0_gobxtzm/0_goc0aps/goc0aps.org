A few short ones to start with. Most of these are fairly in character and older fics:

- linkffn(The Thinking Cap by Andrea13)
- Angie Astravic was one of my favourite writers. She wrote mostly during 2000 so her stuff was fairly in character considering book 5 hadn't come out. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9000/Angie-Astravic]]
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer)
- linkffn(Just A Random Tuesday)

If you do get stuck in recovery I recommend some longer fics:

- linkffn(A Second Chance at Life) and it's sequels linkffn(Changes in a Time of War) and linkffn(A Magical World) even though the latter isn't finished.
- linkffn(Harry Crow)
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny)
- linkffn(Passageways)
