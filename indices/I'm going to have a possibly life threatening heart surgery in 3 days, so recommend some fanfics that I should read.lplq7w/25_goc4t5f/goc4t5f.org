Good luck with your surgery.

Imposter Complex by Notus Oren is a pretty good fic about an escaped Diary Tom Riddle. Linkffn(The Imposter Complex)

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is a classic fic that you've probably already read but I'll recommend anyway just in case you haven't. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)
