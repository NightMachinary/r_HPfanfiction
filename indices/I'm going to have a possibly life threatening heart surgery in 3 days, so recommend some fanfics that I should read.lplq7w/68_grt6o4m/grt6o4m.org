Hey, I hope your surgery went well! I hope you enjoy these in your recovery. I recommended a ton [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/js05k9/fic_recommends/][here]], but there are frankly a lot there, so I'll just post the ones here that I have reread at least once.

Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete.

2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.

3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.

   Here are the rest, unranked. Again, I have reread each of them and recommend them.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-Nine]] is by my absolute favorite author. It is the story that made me realize that Percy could be interesting. Summary: A story about murder, the power of writing lists, the interest of the press, the politics of the Department of Magical Transportation and the struggle of being Percy Weasley. It has a companion piece [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193/chapters/51221617][26]] that is also just lovely. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16435904][yer a wizard, dudley]] is a weirdly touching oneshot that asks, "What if Dudley was a wizard, too?" Dudley's still a little shit in this world. Fortunately, he gets spotted by 7th year Tonks. This is in a series of oneshots and I recommend all of them.

  Nymphadora Tonks kept an eye out at Hogwarts for Muggleborns, because her father Ted was one. Tonks also kept an eye out for anxious spoiled brats, because, according to Andromeda, her mother had been one, once.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123729][Around You Moves]] is the sweetest little ficlet. I super love dense gay characters. It was inspired by a Reddit post on AITA. OP was roommates with a gay friend and got super mad when his roommate brought home guys. Finally in the comments someone was like, "Sounds like you're jealous" and OP realized that a.) he was gay and b.) he had a massive crush on the roommate.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820][Blood Crest]] is a new fic that is being updated pretty regularly. The author has published 53 chapters in the past year. Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. I'd classify it as a dark comedy of sorts.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! It is complete. The first story in the series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] is complete. In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right. Harry has to be crafty. He can't rely on his power to win.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- Speaking of Harry chatting with his head horcrux, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is super fun. It is a dark comedy wherein Harry's Head Horcrux wakes up and gives him some truly interesting life advice. WIP
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]. #1 recommended fic on this sub. There is no Harry, only Lord Voldemort trying his damndest to make it through life in Harry's body. It is hilarious.
