I too love fanfics, here you go:

This series is complete, and is one of my favorites. Hope that it is your cup of tea. It's also on AO3. Warning, the first few chapters are quite depressing, but it gets better.

Alexander Dantes - linkffn(13497859) and its sequel The Riddle Coins - linkffn(13557024)

These are ongoing/incomplete, but I like them all the same:

Harry Potter and the Artificer Legacy - linkffn(13435630) - This one is feel good fic, Harry is focused on enchanting.

Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer- linkffn(7866134) - Harry Potter discovers the secret of magic after Ron does a prank.

Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament - linkffn(13140418) - Harry Potter learns the power of rituals.

Spells in Silence - linkffn(13510736) - Fem!Harry learns magic on her own before hogwarts, and breaks wizarding rules left and right. It is quite well-written.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][C'est La Vie]] - It is one of the top fics of mine that I want to see get completed, but one can only wish.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/689909/chapters/1267386][The Spellmaker]] - Sporadically updated, Harry Potter discovers the power of Latin. Hope to see it get completed.

Best of luck for your upcoming surgery!

Edit: linkffn(13710451) - The Slow and Silent Ways of Fish. Complete AU. But it is captivating.
