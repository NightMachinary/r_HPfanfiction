Ok, so, this likely isn't your type of story, but it is my favourite piece of writing ever. It's just the right amount of crack and seriousness, sexual tension, and (oblivious) pining. How that's possible I have no idea.

But anyway, it's tomarry. 17-year-old Harry (he's of age, by wizard standards, don't worry) time travels to about 1963, I think. Voldemort is 37. Voldemort thinks Harry is his son. (Black hair and a parselmouth, sooo) Harry goes along with it.

Now, Voldemort really seems to adore Harry. Like, blind adoration. Spoiler alert, but he just looks on fondly as Harry declares he will pull apart Voldemort's regime until they aren't blood purists anymore or something like that. It's adorable.

Also, this is all in Voldemort's point of view, which is strange in tomarry fics. So we see bi!disaster Harry getting flustered as fuck because Voldemort is a little too touchy-feely. And Voldemort is a demisexual!disaster that doesn't understand why his stomach flutters in Harry's presence all the time.

It's adorable. They clearly like each other and Harry is still obviously light. And Harry gets pulled in during the horcrux hunt, but he has no idea what he is.

The whole story is amazing. The writing, the plot, the characters. I can barely describe it. Please give it a read. Here's the link:
