Good luck on surgery.

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) It is the best HP & Firefly crossover, also best outer space & "Earth that was" story, and I've not really found anything better than it. I reread it so many times and it's tops.

Linkffn(The Girl Who Loved) It's like a straight crack fic, disturbing, hilarious, and a crossover between Ranma 1/2, Sailor Moon and Harry Potter. It had me gut laughing out loud and I've reread it tons of times too. The sequel, linkffn(Violence Inherent in the System) is an equally fantastic read that comes to a satisfying conclusion.

Linkffn(Harry the lazy Hufflepuff) It's short, with sequels, and I find it really entertaining. In summary, Harry hears 'lazy' growing up and it shapes his personality. He's not ambitious, not really brave, not very studious, but Helga said she'd 'take the rest' so to Hufflepuff he goes. He goes to lengths to learn to avoid hard work so it's more than a little hilarious.

Linkffn(Almost a Squib) They almost succeed at "beating it out of him", but he's still a prophecied hero and this fic shows a really cunning Harry meeting his destiny. It was really enjoyable, and a decent shorter length.

Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) Not all of Harry died that night, not all of James died that night. Lily did something to preserve her two most important people in her life. Features a really interesting TriWizard tournament and the Sorting Hat, with a potty mouth and who's been on probation for years for mentally scarring a child.
