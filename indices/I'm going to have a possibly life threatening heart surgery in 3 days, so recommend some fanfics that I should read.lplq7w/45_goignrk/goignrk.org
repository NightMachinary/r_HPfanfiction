Damn bro that really sucks. Best I can think of on the fly is 'Bound With Silver Threads', but it's kinda long. I can only read long fics. Main character is Lily Luna Potter, set in her 3rd to 7th year and a little bit beyond. Multiple pairings but Lily/OFC is the main one, OFC is Draco's daughter (Scorpius' sister).

Actually there's also 'Grow Young With' me, I don't remember all the details but I remember it being a really nice fic about adult Harry meeting a muggle woman and them getting together after some time, very fluffy plot.
