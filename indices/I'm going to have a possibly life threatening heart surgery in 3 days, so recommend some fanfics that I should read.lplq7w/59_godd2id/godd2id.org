If you haven't read it linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) it will consume you for days but it's honestly my top fic in the fandom even after all of these years.

There's also the “matters, secrets, and times” series by kraken's ghost if you're into naruto. The three one shots hit like a fucking truck.
