The Changeling is amazing and is almost as satisfying as reading the original series. I particularly appreciated its focus on Slytherin as something other than just an incubator for Death Eaters, plus the story continues after Voldy's downfall and explores the first few years afterwards as everyone grapples with PTSD.
