Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

This one is really good, short but good. Harry is somewhat op, but the focus of the story is on him being a nice big bro. The end is also quite satisfying, the way he deals with Voldy.

Ps: In advance, I wish you an easy recovery!
