Frankly, I would recommend binge (re-)reading the entire Natsume's Book of Friends manga. It is ridiculously soft hearted chicken soup for the soul feel good manga, that left me with extremely pleasant narcose dreams when I had a surgery 4 years ago.

I couldn't name a single Harry Potter fanfic that low on stress or heartbreaking moments.

Edit: also the very best well wishes for a good surgery and a better recovery of course <3

Edit:2 maybe make a wish from Rorschach's Blot, that one always makes me laugh. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]
