Wishing you the best of luck in your surgery. I'll be praying for you to come through smoothly and have a quick recovery. ðŸ’›

For me - anything by Shaylalonnie, Colubrina, MaryRoyale, and LJ Summers if they fit your fic preferences. Particular favorites for me are:

linkffn(Desperate Measures by MaryRoyale)

linkffn(Rebuilding)

linkffn(Roundabout Destiny)
