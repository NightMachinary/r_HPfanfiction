As someone who has had several surgeries in the last year I recommend you look up some fics that have been read out loud. Meds make reading hard the first few days. I believe they are called podfics.

Also recommend the 'stuff you should know' podcast. Years of content that is interesting but not presented in a way that will interrupt sleep with loud noises if you drop off.

Good luck and I hope you have a speedy recovery
