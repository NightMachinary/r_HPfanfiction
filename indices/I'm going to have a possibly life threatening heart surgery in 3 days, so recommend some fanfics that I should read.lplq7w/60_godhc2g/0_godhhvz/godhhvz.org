  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU

  She wasn't sure it was actually her that propelled her body across the room and steered itself in front of Harry. Nor did she recognise the harsh words that escaped her own lips.She wasn't even sure if she liked her actions."We call her Ivy."She let the silence choke them.

  Sansa deserved someone stronger and braver who could protect her and keep her safe and be her friend and even a lover and a husband. She was two years older than Tommen, she was almost a woman.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  If blindness wasn't enough for Ariadne Granger to deal with upon attending Hogwarts, being the transgender Girl Who Lived didn't help matters.Blind trans girl Harry Potter fic to spite JK Rowling's TERF ass. Starts before Ariadne has even figured out she's a girl and before she is rescued from the Dursleys.Since this fic is gonna be quite long, I'm adding a key here. Note, some things might lack context if you skip.Chapters 1-6: Pre-Philosopher's Stone.Chapters 7-33: Philosopher's Stone. Minimal plot divergence.Chapters 34-75: Chamber of Secrets. Moderate plot divergence.Chapters 76-109: Prisoner of Azkaban. Major plot divergence.Chapters 110-148: Goblet of Fire. Major plot divergence.Chapters 149-Current: Order of the Phoenix.
