My apologies for the situation you're in. I will be praying for you, as I imagine many of us will.

Now, I will not pretend to be a master fanfiction reader. I read stories with lots of bashing and they're not always the best of stories but below, I have linked stories that I personally liked.

linkffn(12438772) - This fic made me cry but it's good nonetheless
