Hi, I'm so sorry to hear about what you're going through, I can hardly imagine how you feel. I would recommend 'The Dark Roses' by Herald_of_Dreams on AO3, it's an amazing fic with a not-all-that-bad-Dark-side-of-the-War, and a Dark!Harry, James, Regulus, Sirius and Remus. It's amazing, and I've read it so many times!

I genuinely hope that you get better, and will live to read many, many more fanfictions.

Xxxxx
