Sorry to hear about your situation, I had to go through the same thing twice in my 20s. Got a wicked chest scar and a robot heart (well mechanical heart valve) to show for it now though. What your going through right now is bloody scary, but remember that the surgical team know what they're doing and will do their best for you. You have my best wishes and hopes for a successful operation and easy recovery.
