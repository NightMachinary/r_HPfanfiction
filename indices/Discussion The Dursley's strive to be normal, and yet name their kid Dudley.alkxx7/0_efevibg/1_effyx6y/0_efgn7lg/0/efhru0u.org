It definitely had at least one S in it and... it's a name I've never seen anywhere else - which is probably why I assumed it was canon, AKA one of those names fairly common in the UK that I've never seen here in the States. You know, like Dudley.

But it made his initials DUD which... has always cracked me up. Had to make sure the kid knew his name.

... it's probably Dangerverse, it's probably the only fic I've read enough times for something that small to stick with me.
