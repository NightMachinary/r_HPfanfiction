I think the Dursleys want to be both normal and exceptional at the same time. They want to stand out among their peers (other suburbanites) but they want to be envied, not ostracized. i.e. Petunia refers to "Harry" as a "nasty, common name." So they don't want to be seen as commoners, but they want to fit in to their social circles.
