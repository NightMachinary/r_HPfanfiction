Euphemia is not as bad a name as Fleamont is though, as it's a real name, meaning "well spoken" in Greek, and is the name of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemia][Saint]] in the three major branches of Christianity. So right now I'm deciding that my headcanon for Euphemia Potter is that she is of Greek origin.
