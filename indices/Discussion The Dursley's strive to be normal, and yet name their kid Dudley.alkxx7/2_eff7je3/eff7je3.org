One of the recurring jokes around Petunia, common in British literature, is that she is an upper-working-class/lower-middle-class snob desperate to be read as ‘posh' but blind to the signals and shibboleths of the middle classes above her, applying the opposite of the upper/upper-middle rules.

Hence, ‘Dudley' and ‘Vernon' as respectable names, but ‘Harry' as nasty and common.

It's the same sort of thing as the Dursleys' obsession with being normal despite them being very clearly abnormal (including in their obsession with normality).
