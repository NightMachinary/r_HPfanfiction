I wonder what it says about the Malfoys then, when they picked the name "Draco" for their son. I'm pretty sure his name was the most "out there" among his classmates, even among his pureblood classmates.

Come to think of it, I've read that the way that Lucius is portrayed as throwing money around is inconsistent with how truly wealthy people from truly venerable families behave. Money talks, wealth whispers, and all that jazz. Maybe saddling their kid with such a name is one more sign that the Malfoys are just putting on pretentions of being venerable purebloods?
