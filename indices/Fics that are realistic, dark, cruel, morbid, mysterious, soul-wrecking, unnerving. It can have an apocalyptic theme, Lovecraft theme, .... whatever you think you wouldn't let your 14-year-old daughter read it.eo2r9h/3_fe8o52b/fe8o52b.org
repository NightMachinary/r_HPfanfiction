Linkffn(Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma): a post-apocalyptic zombie fic that has a bit of everything. No one besides maybe Harry has plot armor. Can be a bit of a downer.

Linkffn(Circular Reasoning): an absurdly brutal and dark vision of a time-traveling HP. This fic pull none of the punches that most "rewrite the terrible future" storylines do, though it does suffer from a fair amount of meandering.

Linkffn(Lesser Evils): a much darker take on the OotP fic, with characters who use the Dark Arts also showing the corresponding traits associated with their use.

Linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths): a novella length oneshot about how the climax of OotP could have gone down. I would also recommend pretty much every other fic by VotN, which feature some of the most brutal and twisted visions of HP you will find (though you may notice some repetition).
