Fleamont Potter was the son of Henry Potter (also known as "Harry") who was a pro-Muggle Wizengamot member who caused controversy when he wanted to aid Muggles during the First World War. Henry Potter named his son Fleamont after his mother's maiden name.

There's no reason Fleamont /wouldn't/ give his son the name 'James' given his father's 'normal' name. It also makes sense that James and Lily named Harry after James' grandfather, i.e. Fleamont's father.
