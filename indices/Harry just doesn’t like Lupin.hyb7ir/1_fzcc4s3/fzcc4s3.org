I've read a couple that are interesting. Most are pretty generic "Indy!Harry yells at everything until it bends to his indomitable, all-knowing will".

The Lie I've Lived has some really interesting ideas on how Harry and Remus relate to each other, and there's some antagonistic dislike there.

Faery Heroes has a really interesting discussion with Tonks about Remus that I found quite novel. I don't remember much in the way of dealings with Remus, but it's an interesting discussion about how this Harry feels about Remus.
