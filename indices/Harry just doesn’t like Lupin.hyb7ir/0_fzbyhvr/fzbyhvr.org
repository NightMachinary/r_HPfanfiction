I'm very torn on Remus. I think in a lot of ways he's not a great person. Not evil or malicious or anything, just kind of weak willed and self-deprecating, which leads him to occasionally making harmful choices.

On the other hand, he never wanted to be a father. We know this about him. He was not Harry's guardian. He had no official or unofficial duty to Harry. Dumbledore probably told him Harry was somewhere safe, which he would have taken at face value since he trusted and respected Dumbledore and so did the Potters. He honestly would have had no reason to contact a child who wasn't related to him and who was too young to remember him, especially if he believed the child was somewhere secret and safe.

If my best friend died and her child was adopted out to distant family members at just over a year old, would I make the effort to stay in contact with them? Probably not, if I'm being honest. When the child was older I may send a letter or email offering to meet up and talk about their mom if they wanted, if I knew how to contact them/their guardians. But I wouldn't do that until the child was 15-16 and old enough to have that sort of open conversation about stuff. I certainly wouldn't feel the need to track down a young child who had no memories of me and insert myself into their life... and doubly so if I knew terrorists killed their family and others may be after the child, and the child was specifically being kept somewhere secret.

Blaming Remus for not contacting Harry earlier just feels very unfair. However, what he SHOULD have done is pull Harry aside after his first DADA lesson and say “Hey, I was friends with your parents in school. If you ever want to talk about them, my door is open.” That, IMO, is the beginning and the end of his duty to Harry.
