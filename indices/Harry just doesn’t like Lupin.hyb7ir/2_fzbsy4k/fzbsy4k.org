I always did think that in the end, Lupin wasn't a great guy really - maybe not malicious or anything, but such a weak-spined guy that couldn't step up when his best friend's son needed him. So, like, not outright condemnable but certainly not someone James and Lily would have felt warmly towards after. I always thought he should be very grateful that Harry was a much better guardian towards Teddy than he was towards Harry.
