Quick question: where does cannon talk about how Harry interacting with Teddy? Not a trick question, I do rather like stories in which Harry raises/helps to raise Teddy and would like to see how it went in cannon (some years since I read the books, so I could have forgotten, but for the life of me I can't remember any mention at all of Teddy in the epilogue).
