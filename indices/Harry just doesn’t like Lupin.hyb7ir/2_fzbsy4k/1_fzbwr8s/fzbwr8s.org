Exactly! A lot of fics (and even canon to some extent) give Lupin the excuse of “oh I'm a werewolf and the ministry wouldn't have allowed me to be the guardian of the boy who lived” but I always found that to be bullshit. You're willing to be a part of a illegal resistance group and also fight a terrifying dark lord and his group of terrorists but you're not willing to to check in on the child of somebody who you considered your closest friend and brother?
