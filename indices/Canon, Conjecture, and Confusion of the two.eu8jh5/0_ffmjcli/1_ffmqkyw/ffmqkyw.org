Yeah it gets real annoying when you have a fairly important question with a significant answer only to find that JK hasn't written the answer for it. I am slightly guilty of mixing fanon and canon myself, I will admit. There are many a time when I'm plotting a story that I have to stop and ask "Did that happen?" before googling it.
