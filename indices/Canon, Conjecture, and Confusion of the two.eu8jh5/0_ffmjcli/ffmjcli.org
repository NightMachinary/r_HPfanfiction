The Fidelius Charm is badly writing anyway, in book 3 Sirius talks like the choise was between Peter and himself.

But Rowling never explained why James felt the need to make his friends their secret keeper and not himself. Bill made himself the secret keeper of his house so it works anyway.

I want to add that a lot of people read too much fanfiction and don't know what canon is and fanon anymore. You get tons of message about where harry family fault is if you don't give him one. And that molly send hermione a howler in 4 year and stuff like that that only happens in fanon.
