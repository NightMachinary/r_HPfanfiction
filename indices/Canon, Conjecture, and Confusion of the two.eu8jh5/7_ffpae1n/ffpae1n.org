I enjoy the constructive approach because it's like a game to me--how can I explain this or work in this detail, etc.

But another thing I like is including some of the other characters' perspectives on other people within the HP universe. For instance, there are some things about Hermione that I really don't like (and of course there are other aspects that I love) so I can explore these through a different person's eyes. I thought it was stupid that the Slytherin common room password in Chamber of Secrets was "pureblood" because that's about as original as "password" or "1234" so I had a character address it. That is some real nerdy fun for me lol
