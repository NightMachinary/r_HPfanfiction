I recommend you re-read the descriptions provided in OP for both of those to see how easily the connotations can be found. For instance:

#+begin_quote
  Constructive

  The fundamental feature of this approach is that it seeks to preserve what has been established. It acknowledges that there are weaknesses in canon (e.g. population numbers) but rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, it seeks to find canon-compatible, reasonable solutions.

  The hallmark of the constructive approach is taking canon at face value, then making reasonable inferences to fill in gaps.
#+end_quote

and:

#+begin_quote
  Destructive

  The destructive approach *seeks out problems with canon, hoping to find problems*. Where a part of canon can be interpreted multiple ways, and some of those interpretations lead to contradictions/plot holes and others do not, the destructive reader will *prefer the interpretation that leads to plot holes*.

  The hallmark of the destructive approach is scepticism, which is perhaps why it is so often conflated with "rationality".
#+end_quote

This reads as clearly negative to me, and misrepresenting how people come to find issues with the fairly sizable gaps that canon has (and the way that later magic/capabilities would have fit in better earlier, but weren't invented at that point) - as well as why they might choose to expand on canon in different ways, or change it up. Besides which, you could say that building upon canon by replacing chunks is constructive, because you're expanding upon it.

A better classification would be something like a range of change, from 'minimalist' to 'radical' or 'extensive' - where people with a minimalist approach might try to change as little about canon as possible (fitting with the 'constructive' one described above) and 'radical' ones would be more willing to remove and change parts of canon to make it more cohesive.

For instance, let's say someone sees the issue in book 1 with Dumbledore flying to the ministry instead of using a faster method of transport. We know that the real reason, out of universe, is that JKR hadn't invented apparition or the floo network yet. Someone wanting to justify it with a minimal change to cannon could use an approach explaining why Dumbledore might choose to use a broom or a thestral or some slow method of transportation - whereas someone who's fine with change would easily take that section and replace it with apparition - and I would struggle to describe that as 'destructive'.
