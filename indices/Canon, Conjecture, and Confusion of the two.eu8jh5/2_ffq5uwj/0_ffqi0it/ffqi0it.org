Yeah - and describing it as 'destructive' puts a bad spin on it (and kind of reveals the perspective that the writer had on it). Like if we renamed those two perspective "Delusional" (where we interact with seeming plot holes by trying to patch them up) and "Realist" (where we accept plot holes and decide to change the setting to fix them up), that'd be another biased way of looking at it.

Now, I don't think the description of the two methods is entirely a bad way to look at it - but there's a lot of wiggle room in between the two approaches above, and neither is better than the other. I would prefer to use less biased names for them - something related to the changes, perhaps? Because the 'constructive' one is looking to make canon make sense with the fewest changes and justifications, whereas the 'destructive' one is much more willing to change structural issues with the world/plot/work.
