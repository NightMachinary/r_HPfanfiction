  Sure, he makes an excuse about wards, but we're never shown or told if and when these wards actually repelled an attack.

Wards are fanon. In canon, the protection Harry is granted by living with the Dursleys is the protection offered by his mother's blood, which saves his life at the end of the first book. It's also what leads Voldemort to specifically use Harry's blood rather than any random enemy's blood to return, which ultimately allows Harry to survive in book seven. Dumbledore's reasoning is pretty decent -- he knows Voldemort is cunning and powerful, and that Dumbledore cannot create any defence which Voldemort will not eventually circumvent. Harry is a child and obviously cannot out-duel Voldemort, so Dumbledore instead equips Harry with a magical superweapon that literally makes it impossible for Voldemort to win against Harry prior to book four.

With that said, Dumbledore could have easily memory-charmed a live-in Uncle Remus or Aunt Emmeline into the Dursley household. Considering what could have been lost if Harry had had his ability to love -- e.g. the /power he knows not/ -- beat out of him by the Dursleys, it is a bit strange that he didn't.
