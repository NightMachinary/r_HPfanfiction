  Even if he had moral objections to murder he could have still captured Death Eaters and imprisoned them. If not in Azkaban, then in Nurmengard.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is not the government. He doesn't decide these things.

#+begin_quote
  BS. Snape was on his side. All he had to do was ask Snape. Or capture a Death Eater and interrogate them via Legillimency or Veritaserum.
#+end_quote

Voldemort made sure the Death Eaters didn't know who everyone was.

#+begin_quote
  The Death Eaters didn't even know the address until they infiltrated the Ministry or Snape told them.
#+end_quote

Not that I think this point really matters, but source on that?

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was barely more than a ghost and a baby from Halloween of '81 to June '95 and was incapable of fighting.
#+end_quote

Mate, Dumbledore isn't a seer. He had no idea if there would be any attacks or when Voldemort would come back. He could've come back at any time, completely unknown to Dumbledore, and killed Harry had he any other protection.

#+begin_quote
  why did Hermione trust Lockhart, then Lupin (she didn't reveal he was a werewolf), then Snape to teach Harry Occlumency?
#+end_quote

Because she trusted Dumbledore lol.

There's no reason Hermione wouldn't have questioned Dumbledore in the seventh book, when he's dead, when he was apparently wrong about Snape.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort nearly got the stone because of Dumbledore's lack of foresight. Harry had the stone and if it wasn't for his mother's protection Voldemort would have both killed his enemy and regained a body.
#+end_quote

"If it wasn't for a crucial part of Harry, Dumbledore would've fucked up."

Well, yeah, but that crucial part existed so he didn't fuck up. Voldemort didn't nearly get the stone. And had Harry not shown up, he never would have had the chance.

#+begin_quote
  Finding the horcruxes- he found one- ONE horcrux.
#+end_quote

Lol. He found two. He would've found the Locket too had he lived. It would've been an easy find for him. And the point is that he found out about all that shit in the first place. C'mon, dude.

#+begin_quote
  Lead to the imprisonment of Sturgis Podmore, near-death of Arthur Weasley and death of Broderick Bode and Sirius Black
#+end_quote

Which was probably better than Voldemort putting his full focus into controlling the Ministry, WHICH IS THE POINT.

#+begin_quote
  placing snape as headmaster at hogwarts- lead to students being tortured by the Carrow twins.
#+end_quote

The fuck? No it didn't. Where'd you get this ludicrous idea from? They were already going to torture the students. Snape was put there to reign them in when he could.

It would've been so much worse if he hadn't been headmaster. Voldemort would've put someone far crueler in.

Did you miss the entire point of all that?

#+begin_quote
  his method of keeping harry away from gathering the hallows- Lead to Harry gathering the Hallows
#+end_quote

No it didn't?? He did exactly what he meant to. Keep Harry focused on Horcruxes while still knowing about the Hallows. Harry wants to go after the Hallows at one point, but he doesn't, which is the point.

#+begin_quote
  BTW Have you heard that names of people and places should be capitalized? You should try it sometime- it's great!
#+end_quote

Shut the fuck up.
