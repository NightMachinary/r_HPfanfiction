  You're thinking of The Prince of Slytherin and not canon.
#+end_quote

No, it's 100% canon. I've never even read Prince of Slytherin. Karkaroff literally says it in his trial.

  Plus he lived at Malfoy manor
#+end_quote

No evidence of this in the first war.

  But I think it was one of Snape's memories of him talking to Dumbledore's portrait and Dumbledore coming up with this "gem" of a plan
#+end_quote

No it wasn't. Just checked.

#+begin_quote
  It would've been the point if Dumbledore had spent that time building his own power, recruiting followers, preparing safe houses, gathering provisions, etc.
#+end_quote

...He did do that. We don't know the details, but he clearly did. He got new Order members, set up at least one safe house, and was doing whatever else we didn't hear about.

Good God, and /I'm/ the one without an argument. I'm done here. No need to respond, I'll have blocked you after submitting this comment.
