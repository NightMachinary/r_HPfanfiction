  Dumbledore is not the government. He doesn't decide these things.
#+end_quote

He doesn't have to be. I said "imprison", not "put on trial". Just get them out of the way until Voldemort is defeated.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort made sure the Death Eaters didn't know who everyone was.
#+end_quote

You're thinking of The Prince of Slytherin and not canon. Voldie drops names left, right and center in the graveyard after he got a body. Plus he lived at Malfoy manor and I somehow doubt that all the Malfoys + Bellatrix went about their lives with their masks on 24/7. That would make stuff like eating, drinking, brushing your teeth very difficult. I know they're evil, but come on.

  Not that I think this point really matters, but source on that?
#+end_quote

Well, it does /kind of/ matter. You can't, after all, attack an unknown location. (Unless you have a nuke, of course) But I think it was one of Snape's memories of him talking to Dumbledore's portrait and Dumbledore coming up with this "gem" of a plan.

#+begin_quote
  "If it wasn't for a crucial part of Harry, Dumbledore would've fucked up." Well, yeah, but that crucial part existed so he didn't fuck up.
#+end_quote

So he didn't fuck up by chance and not because he is so good.

#+begin_quote
  Which was probably better than Voldemort putting his full focus into controlling the Ministry, WHICH IS THE POINT.
#+end_quote

It would've been the point if Dumbledore had spent that time building his own power, recruiting followers, preparing safe houses, gathering provisions, etc. Instead he spends one year ignoring Harry and getting his ass handed to him by bureaucrats and then another by having a few movie nights every other Saturday. I suppose he did send Hagrid and Maxime to the giants, but we all know how well that went.

#+begin_quote
  Shut the fuck up.
#+end_quote

Right back at ya, buddy. Come back when you've calmed down and actually have an argument.
