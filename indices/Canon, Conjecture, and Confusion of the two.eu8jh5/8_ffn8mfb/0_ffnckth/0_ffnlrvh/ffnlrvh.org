  I'm curious about what you think he should've done, though. Go vigilante and kill the Death Eaters himself?
#+end_quote

He could have done something, /anything./ Even if he had moral objections to murder he could have still captured Death Eaters and imprisoned them. If not in Azkaban, then in Nurmengard.

#+begin_quote
  What if he himself wasn't sure who really was and wasn't a Death Eater?
#+end_quote

BS. Snape was on his side. All he had to do was ask Snape. Or capture a Death Eater and interrogate them via Legillimency or Veritaserum.

#+begin_quote
  Sure we are. You said it yourself. They weren't able to attack Harry in the 7th book until after he left the house and the protections fell.
#+end_quote

1. The Death Eaters didn't even know the address until they infiltrated the Ministry or Snape told them. (I don't remember which one it was)
2. There is zero evidence of any Death Eater activity between the attack on the Longbottoms in November of '81 and the fiasco at the World Cup in the summer of '94.
3. Voldemort was barely more than a ghost and a baby from Halloween of '81 to June '95 and was incapable of fighting.

All of these lead to Harry suffering needlessly for 10 years. It would make sense for Harry to be moved to the Dursleys /after/ the Death Eaters show at the World Cup or Voldemort regains a body. But in the '80s? The fanatics are in prison, the rest are covering their asses and Voldemort is little more than a ghost. And Dumbledore's vaunted protection did nothing to protect Harry from the "love" of his family.

  Here is the crux of my problem with your reasoning. It's not just Harry we're talking about. It's /everybody./
#+end_quote

/Everybody/ doesn't have a close relationship with Dumbledore. Most wizards and witches probably heard as kids from their parents about how awesome Dumbledore is and how he saved them from Grindelwald. Harry didn't grow up with wizards so he doesn't see Dumbledore as a hero until he goes to school. The people who are close to Dumbledore like McGonagall, Snape and Harry sometimes question his decisions and orders.

#+begin_quote
  Even Hermione. Why does Hermione still trust in Dumbledore through all seven books?
#+end_quote

Because while Hermione is smart, she is book smart. She isn't skeptical and cynical enough to doubt adults and men in powerful positions. Harry, being raised by the Dursleys, should have been much more cynical or even suspicious of other adults. In the same line of logic- why did Hermione trust Lockhart, then Lupin (she didn't reveal he was a werewolf), then Snape to teach Harry Occlumency?

  The mirror of erised, finding the horcruxes, keeping voldemort distracted in the fifth book with the pointless prophecy, placing snape as headmaster at hogwarts, his method of keeping harry away from gathering the hallows
#+end_quote

Ooh, boy. Where to start?

- The mirror- Voldemort nearly got the stone because of Dumbledore's lack of foresight. Harry had the stone and if it wasn't for his mother's protection Voldemort would have both killed his enemy and regained a body.
- Finding the horcruxes- he found one- */ONE/* horcrux. And it killed him. And after that he had the absolutely brilliant idea to leave the rest to three untrained teenagers. I mean it's not like he had a whole order of fully trained followers. Harry stabbed the diary, Harry found and Ron stabbed the locket, the Trio stole the cup, Harry found the necklace, Neville killed Nagini and Voldemort killed Harry. (Was that self-harm, BTW?) So while Dumbledore may have gathered some important memories and done research he is only responsible for destroying 1/7th of the Horcruxes.
- Keeping voldemort distracted in the fifth book with the pointless prophecy: Lead to the imprisonment of Sturgis Podmore, near-death of Arthur Weasley and death of Broderick Bode and Sirius Black. Especially fun since the prophecy is worthless as it doesn't indicate who would win or how to win. Just that they would kill each other.
- placing snape as headmaster at hogwarts- lead to students being tortured by the Carrow twins.
- his method of keeping harry away from gathering the hallows- Lead to Harry gathering the Hallows while going to war unprepared, untrained and uninformed.

BTW Have you heard that names of people and places should be capitalized? You should try it sometime- it's great!

I understand that war has its casualties and not even Dumbledore could have foreseen every possible outcome. But that doesn't change the fact that Dumbledore was too passive and his plans went wrong or even failed. He might have been a great teacher, headmaster and duelist. He was definitely not evil. But he was a shit wartime leader.
