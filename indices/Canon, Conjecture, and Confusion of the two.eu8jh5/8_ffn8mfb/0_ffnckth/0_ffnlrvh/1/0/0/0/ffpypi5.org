I've read them several times. And that is saying something, since I don't usually read the same book more than twice. Here's a nice little book quote for you. I suppose you could argue Dumbledore had the "bigger picture" in mind and was concerned for Britain as a whole. But he still left a defenseless child with abusive relatives for 10 years. And then didn't even bother to train him up or teach him. A paragon of goodness and mercy, indeed.

  Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well -- not quite whole. */You had suffered. I knew you would/* when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”
