  He never took any action against Death Eaters. He never used his positions in the Wizengamot and ICW to pursue Death Eaters or call for help.

We don't know that.

Really, most of your comment could be replied with "There's not enough info to believe that."

I'm curious about what you think he should've done, though. Go vigilante and kill the Death Eaters himself? What if he himself wasn't sure who really was and wasn't a Death Eater?

  we're never shown or told if and when these wards actually repelled an attack

Sure we are. You said it yourself. They weren't able to attack Harry in the 7th book until after he left the house and the protections fell.

  Why Harry continues to believe in him and follow him after this is beyond me.

Here is the crux of my problem with your reasoning. It's not just Harry we're talking about. It's /everybody./

If Dumbledore is as incompetent and close to evil as you're suggesting, then that means everyone else is too. Even Hermione. Why does Hermione still trust in Dumbledore through all seven books? I mean, these issues do seem obvious, don't they?

Don't you think that if all this was true, and so obvious as it is, that Hermione would've realized? Especially in the seventh book, when she's an adult and Dumbledore's past with Grindelwald is being criticized?

This is why I believe there /are/ reasons people trust him and believe in him. And it's not like Dumbledore didn't have his moments of cleverness.

The mirror of erised, finding the horcruxes, keeping voldemort distracted in the fifth book with the pointless prophecy, placing snape as headmaster at hogwarts, his method of keeping harry away from gathering the hallows, etc.
