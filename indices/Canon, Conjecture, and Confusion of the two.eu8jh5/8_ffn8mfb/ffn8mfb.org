  I've read a lot of comments from people who really believe Dumbledore is this evil mastermind orchestrating any and all events

I wouldn't go as far as "evil mastermind". Neglectful, perhaps. Passive- definitely. Tired and overworked- possibly.

One of the problems with him is that he left Harry with the Dursleys. And he knew what he was doing. Fics with manipulative Dumbledore often go overboard and into parody and crack. But, damn, canon Dumbledore still left a baby on a doorstep in November to abusive relatives for 10 years. Sure, he makes an excuse about wards, but we're never shown or told if and when these wards actually repelled an attack. Why Harry continues to believe in him and follow him after this is beyond me. While this may not be so bad on the grand scale of things, Harry is the protagonist of the whole series and Dumbledore seriously messed up with him.

  Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well -- not quite whole. */You had suffered. I knew you would/* when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”

He didn't increase or consolidate his power between Helloween of '81 and June '95. He probably knew the names of most Death Eaters, yet he did not pursue them and let the likes of Malfoy run free.

He was too passive once Voldemort returned. We are never shown or told of the Order attacking, taking down, arresting or killing Death Eaters. Dumbledore only defends against threats, but never attacks or retaliates. The Order acts more like spies while the Death Eaters actively attack, hurt and kill people.

By leaving Harry's departure from Privet Drive for the last possible moment and using magical means to escape he practically guaranteed that they would run into Death Eaters and have to fight. Think about it- the Death Eaters know that the protection will fall by July 31st. So if their target hasn't escaped until July 30th it leaves two options:

1. He will leave on 31st. In which case have a large force lay in ambush.

2. He will wait some more. In which case have a large force lay in ambush. And attack when the protection eventually falls on the 1st of August.

All the Order had to do was get Harry in a car under his Invisibility cloak before the 30th. But they waited for the last possible minute to extract Harry and used magic thus ensuring the Death Eaters would be waiting in ambush and detect them. I know JK probably wanted an action scene at the beginning of the book but this has to be one of the worst plans ever.

All of Dumbledore's wisdom and planning lead to Voldemort being victorious for nearly a year. By the time of Bill and Fleur's wedding Voldemort had defeated one of his two main threats (Dumbledore), had placed (what he thought was) his man as headmaster of Hogwarts and placed a puppet as minister of magic. And that went on until May next year and the Battle at Hogwarts. Voldemort had practically won for 90% of the last book.

So, no- I don't think that Dumbledore is evil. He is just an incompetent war leader whose inaction lead to the enemy winning. He didn't train Harry. He shared too little information too late. He never took any action against Death Eaters. He never used his positions in the Wizengamot and ICW to pursue Death Eaters or call for help.

It's not a stretch to make Dumbledore evil. A fanfiction trope that bothers me much more is making Ron dumb and evil and making Draco pretty and good. What's with all the hate that Ron and Ginny get? Meanwhile, the little Death Eater shit Malfoy gets away with throwing around racial slurs, trying to get Buckbeak executed, casting the Imperius on Rosmerta, nearly killing Ron and Katie and smuggling Death Eaters in a school full of children. He's not "misunderstood". He's a racist criminal and a terrorist wannabe and I don't care how blond his hair is.
