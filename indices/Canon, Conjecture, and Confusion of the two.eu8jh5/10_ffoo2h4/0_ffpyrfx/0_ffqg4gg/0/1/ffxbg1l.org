I think you're forgetting that Dumbledore didn't exactly have a choice either.

Voldemort was the linchpin that held his side together, through a mixture of fear and awe. In order for his side to be defeated, he had to die. If he was disembodied again, it would only be a matter of time before he came back (likely much faster, as his followers would actually make an effort to find him), and start the nightmare all over.

Then, Albus figures out Harry has a piece of Voldemort's soul in his scar, presumably in book 2. So, he realizes that he either A: has to let Harry die/have him killed or B: let Voldemort be immortal. Obviously he chooses A. There is no way of knowing what he learns researching horcruxes between book 2 and 6, other than tracking down memories of young Tom for clues. We can make some reasonable assumptions though, like how there's no safe way of removing the horcrux from Harry.

Then there's the triumphant twinkle in book 4, a desperate hope for a desperate man. Maybe, JUST MAYBE, Harry can come back from Voldemort killing him. So he starts tracking down the horcruxes in earnest, let's the prophecy orb be a nice distraction for Voldemort while he does so. Except, like all of Albus' plans, this one blows up in his face and Harry ends up in mortal danger again. He comes upon Harry facing down Voldemort, if he just waits for him to kill Harry that'll be another Horcrux down and Harry will maybe (probably) survive.

BUT instead, he deflects the Killing Curse, duels Voldemort til he fails to possess Harry and flees. As much as it would have benefited the war effort, he did not stand aside to let Harry maybe die. Why? Because he's a good person who genuinely cares about Harry but has been forced to make pragmatic choices. Then book 6 and 7 happen, yadda yadda, manipulates Snape to tell Harry about the Scarcrux. And after everything, Voldemort is dead for good, and Harry lives. He may be more than a little messed up, but he's alive, which is more than Albus thought possible to begin with.

This kinda rambled more than I meant it to. Anyway, boils down to Dumbledore was put into the train track dilemma with Harry on one side and EVERYONE ELSE on the other, and due to luck and a quirk of magic, found a third track.
