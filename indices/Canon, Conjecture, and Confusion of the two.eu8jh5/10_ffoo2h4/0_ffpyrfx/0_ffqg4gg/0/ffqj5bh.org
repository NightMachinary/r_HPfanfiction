Yes, a lot of people don't seem to realize that telling a teenager at the last possible moment that he needs to walk up to a terrorist and allow himself to be killed, is /unethical all on its own/.

Harry had no *practical* choice in that matter. Dumbledore unilaterally decided to sacrifice a teenager, on a /guess/. People seem to think that making a decision like walking to your death will have no affect on a person's psyche; that you can simply walk away from a betrayal like that.

Have you read the last chapter of linkffn(Stages of Hope) ? Because that's how Harry would end up.
