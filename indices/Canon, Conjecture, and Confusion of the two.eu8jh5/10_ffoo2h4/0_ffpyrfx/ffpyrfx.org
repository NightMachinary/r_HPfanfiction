A commonly misunderstood scene. Dumbledore was not telling Snape the truth. We know he always planned for Harry to survive, since the moment in GoF when he had the "gleam of victory" in his eye upon finding out that Voldemort had unknowingly tethered Harry to life.

But specific things needed to happen for Harry to survive, one of which was that Harry had to /believe/ that he was walking to his death. So Dumbledore told Snape what Snape needed to be told, in order to pass misinformation to Harry.
