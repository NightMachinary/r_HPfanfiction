One could also argue that Dumbledore had that gleam because as far as Voldemort was concerned, the war was won. Voldemort couldn't kill Harry without becoming mortal, which with time even if Harry died for real, would result in his death. The game was set, all he needed was to move his pieces in the right order.

We over play that gleam of victory. Dumbledore gambled on the sacrificial magic, and the horcrux taking the hit. He was right, but that doesnt change that as soon as Harry was hit with that AK, which was planned from the beginning, the war was won.
