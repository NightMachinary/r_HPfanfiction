  as soon as Harry was hit with that AK, which was planned from the beginning, the war was won.

No, it was even worse than that. It doesn't mean that the war is won, it means that Voldemort /might/ die. And that's was big *if*.

/If/ all the other horcruxes are destroyed, /if/ someone is capable of killing Voldemort, /if/ the Death Eaters are also defeated militarily, /if/ the victory doesn't end up to be entirely pyrrhic. The war requires /far/ more than Voldemort's death.
