Dumbledore does admit that he acted like a dark lord when he meets Harry at the train station. From Snape's memories he tells Snape that have tested Harry's abilities and allowed him to develop. From that we could reasonably infer many things about him. None of them positive.

Even Snape, who hated Harry, was horrified with Dumbledore's plans.
