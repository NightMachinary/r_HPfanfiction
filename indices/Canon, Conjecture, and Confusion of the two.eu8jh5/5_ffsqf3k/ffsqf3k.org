The books are meant for kids Those of us who grew up reading them and go back and can't help but think that the adults are either incompetent or evil because if they are competent then it should never come down to a child to save the day and if they are evil they aren't very smart about again if a child beats them My suggestion would be to simply forget canon other than as a simple guide to the world of Harry Potter and enjoy good fanfics where characters and their motivations make sense
