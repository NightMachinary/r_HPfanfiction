  Is Divination actually a thing that you can actually teach, or isn't it?

(Watsonian Hat firmly ON)

It might be, but the wizarding world isn't up to the kind of information theory and analysis that would make it actually useful, so it's limited to fairly basic fortune telling and the fact that the current (and, it is implied, former) Divination teacher is a complete waste of oxygen doesn't help any.

As for prophecy, Dumbledore realises (possibly too late) and Voldemort never catches on that prophecies /aren't predictions/. They're messages from Somewhere Else that spur mortals to their fate, often but not always by warning them of it vaguely enough that they flee into danger. Heed a prophecy and you end up accidentally killing your father and fucking your mother, to pick one of the more famous examples.

Trelawney's first prophecy leads Voldemort into the trap that kills him the first time. Her second prophecy unsettles everyone sufficiently that what /should/ have been the apprehension of Peter Pettigrew (who wasn't in any sense of the word 'chained for twelve years' but everyone assumed it was about him) turns in to his escape, and Voldemort is able to come to his final doom.

The /sensible/ course of action on hearing a prophecy is to shoot the prophet and obliviate everyone within earshot. Much trouble is avoided thereby.
