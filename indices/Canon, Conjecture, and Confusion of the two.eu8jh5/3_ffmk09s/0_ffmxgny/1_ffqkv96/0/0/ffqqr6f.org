It's worse than that: he's running a boarding institution, which requires a minimum standard of pastoral care. Which is provided by four people who have full-time jobs of their own, one of whom is the abusive teacher, and another has still a third full-time job on top of that. Hogwarts is /radically/ understaffed, and needs five and probably more like ten more members of staff for the number of pupils they're seen to be managing. Assuming eight hours of classroom time per week and weekends off, the teachers in the core subjects taken through all seven years are able to deliver less than two hours per week instruction to each pupil they have. And that's /before/ they tackle their workload of planning, marking, admin and pastoral care.

Other than the keenest of academic self-starters, the pupils of Hogwarts are being systematically failed by their school.

There are, or must be, other teachers but Harry only mentions the ones who take /his/ classes, an explanation that works from Watsonian (in all honesty I can't really remember the teachers at my old secondary school that I didn't have, and with a couple of exceptions they followed my class from start to finish of my time there) to Doylist (the books would have had to be a lot longer if the non-speaking parts had got any more screen time, it being a truism that every named character adds to the length of the book without necessarily advancing the story, so if they can be decently cut they should be.)
