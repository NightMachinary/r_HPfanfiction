There are always things about canon that aren't gonna make a whole lot of sense in retrospect, but we have fanfics that do an admirable job of plothole-plastering.

For example, in HP and the Prince of Slytherin, the author does a FANTASTIC job giving explanations for certain canon plotholes. For example, Snape and his post OWL requirements. Doesn't make sense in canon because you would have to be ridiculously good at potions to get into his NEWT class. In this fic, however, it's because the NEWT class covers topics meant for someone who wants a potions mastery, and would be a waste of time for someone who just wants to, say, become an Auror. For those people, reviewing the skills and potions taught up to OWL level is sufficient to get a NEWT in potions. But this relies on the fics assumption that you can sit your OWLS and NEWTs outside of the canon year 5 and 7, much like you would be able to do in any reasonable society that bases its hiring requirements on those results.

I guess the takeaway is, just because canon didn't explain why something exists, doesn't mean there isn't a reasonable (IN CHARACTER, looking at you evil Dumbledore conspiracy theorists) explanation for those things. My head canon for the continued tenure of Binns is that the Board of Governors is very happy to not have to pay anyone to teach a class, and blocks Dumbledore's attempts at replacing him.
