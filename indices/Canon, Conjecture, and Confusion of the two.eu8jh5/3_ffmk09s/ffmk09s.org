Agreed completely. I had a guy tell me Dumbledore was literally the "epitome of evil." And he was somehow upvoted.

I'll tell them they suck at reading. Half this fucking sub seems to think only Harry can kill Voldemort and Dumbledore is just using Harry as a weapon.

...Even though Dumbledore literally tells Harry that the prophecy doesn't need to be fulfilled and that Harry can ignore it if he wants.

Edit: Oh, look, here's a very recent example: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/eu49w8/why_harry_was_placed_with_the_dursleys/ffnbevo]]

Lmfao.
