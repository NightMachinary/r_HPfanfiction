I mostly agree, but I think the problem is fundamentally more complicated. You mostly say, but I would reformulate that the basic problem is with applying HP universe *as whole* with all years together. When we do that, there are insurmountable problems which cannot be explained away. E.g., we got to the questions like “Why in PS Dumbledore /flew/ to London on his broom?” (hint: even humble Floo was invented only in CoS, apparition is from HBP; yes, something like apparition is shown already in the first chapter of PS, but it is never explained and it really doesn't work as a part of “known universe” until later), “Why there was not at least the age line around the third floor corridor?” (that was “discovered” only in GoF), etc. The mess around the Fidelius Charm is just another example of the same. The results of such logic of applying all information together has to lead to some weird conclusion, manipulative and sinister Dumbledore just one of them.

Logically, when trying to work out your problems while writing your fanfiction, you try to apply all information collected throughout whole canon at once (and that is how for example The Harry Potter Wiki works). However, this approach cannot be applied to deconstruction of existing text, where one needs to apply something like “layered volume-by-volume logic”, i.e., for each problem only solutions from the same volume can be applied.
