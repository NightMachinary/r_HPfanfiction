I'd just like to point out here that In PS, even limited to the plot of that book, the entire point of the third floor corridor was to trap Quirrell/Voldemort with the mirror indefinitely, so Albus probably intentionally let slip that he was going to fly to the Ministry.

AND if the trio had trusted McGonagall that the stone was safe, it would have WORKED.
