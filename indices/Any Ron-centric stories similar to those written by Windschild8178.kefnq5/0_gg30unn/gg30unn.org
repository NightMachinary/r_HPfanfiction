I don't know about the fic you are mentioning but this is my fave ron centric fic ever.

Groundhog Day Â» Ron keeps reliving the same day over and over. His world is inhabited by the same people every day, but they don't know that the day repeating itself. He is the only one who can remember what happened yesterday and that gives him an advantage!R/H & Humor
