Well werewolves would tear up their suit and suffocate pretty quickly. (Even with wolfsbane they are still prone to violent tendencies, the human can just influence them to not do things, but they aren't suddenly humans with a fur coat on, they still have the impulses to be aggressive and damage their confines)

And in order to stay fully transformed they would need to circle around the moon every day to stay in full moonlight. (which is just the side facing the sun). Being in a dark part of the moon would be just like being under a regular moon here on earth.
