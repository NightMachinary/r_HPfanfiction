So this is kind of gross but I was just reading another post about pregnant women during the holocaust whose legs were tied together and they died because the baby was just kind of stuck in there.

What if it's the same idea for wrewolves? They're on some kind of internal clock that they need to transform and the full moon allows them to do so. If theres no full moon allowing them to do so, their body starts attacking itself and trying to push out the wolf inside but failing because maybe a werewolf took a port key to the other side of the world where it's not the full moon.

And so the body just breaks down and dies.
