Perhaps more practical, what happens when a werewolf crosses time zones? Would the transformation happen according to the internal clock when the moon rises back home, or does it react to the moon being above the horizon in the location of the were?

We know that being inside to block direct moonlight probably doesn't stop it since otherwise everyone would do that and werewolves wouldn't be a problem.

But if the trigger is based on the geometry of when the moon is both above the horizon at the location of the werewolf and, with some tolerance, opposite of the sun as seen from the earth, then it could be cheated by portkeying to New Zealand over the full moon night.

If portkeys are too expensive, flying around the world westwards in half a day (would require supersonic travel, enchanted invisible Concorde probably) would work too.
