This is nice thank you, but just like with Hail Odysseus, it starts after all the raising has been done. Harry appears at the start of the story essentially an OC, a large chunk of canon divergence already happened as exposition. If someone took the concept and actually covered the years where the raising is done I'd be so happy.
