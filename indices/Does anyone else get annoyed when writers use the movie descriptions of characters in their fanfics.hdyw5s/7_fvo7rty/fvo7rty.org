I think the point being made in time travel/rebirth fics when they say he's "small again" is that he's back in his eleven year old or pre eleven year old body - when he was living with the Dursleys and not getting proper nutrition. It's only after a few years at Hogwarts where he gets to eat properly and do sport that he starts to grow and fill out. He's meant to be small for his age in PS and CoS, then he gets his growth spurt.
