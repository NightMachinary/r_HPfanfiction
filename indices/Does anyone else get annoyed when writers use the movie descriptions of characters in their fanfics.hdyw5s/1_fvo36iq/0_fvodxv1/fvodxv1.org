I read different depictions of characters as looking different anyway. Movie Hermione vs Cannon Hermione, or Slytherin Hermione, or Ravenclaw Hermione, or Genius Hermione, or Politician Hermione all look physically different in my minds eye. It doesn't bother me if a writer decides to describe a character differently, it helps me keep them visually distinct so I don't mix up characterizations in my head (I read way too many fanfics, I'd get very confused if they all looked the same)
