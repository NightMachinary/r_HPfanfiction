Honestly, I never bother too much with descriptions in general. When I read, I just go with how I imagine the characters in my head. I don't pay too much attention to descriptions unless they are gender-bent versions or sth like that.

When I write, I work the same way. I don't really describe already known characters like Harry, Ron, etc. Characters just mentioned once or twice like Sally-Anne, Megan Jones, etc., those I describe, but then I have kind of free reign with those.
