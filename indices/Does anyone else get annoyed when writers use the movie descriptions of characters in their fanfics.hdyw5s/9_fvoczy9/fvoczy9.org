Personally, I'm just a huge fan of short Harry. I'm not particular about favoring either the book or the movies... None of it's gospel when you're spending time writing a free fanfiction for an audience that has similar tastes to yours.

I just pick and choose which parts I like and which parts I don't. I'd say most fic writers do the same.
