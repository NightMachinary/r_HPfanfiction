I know canonically Harry has a growth spurt, but I am kinda surprised how short Harry is that unpopular. His height isn't a defining feature of his, compared to a casting of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher where Reacher's size plays a big part of who his character is .

MCU fans don't seem to focus on RDJ as Tony Stark even though Stark is supposed to be 6'1". Daniel Craig is the only Bond actor shorter than 6 feet tall and after Casino Royale that criticism has gone away even though Bond is supposed to be tall, criticisms of Craig's Bond tend to be that he's not suave enough and that his Bond is more assassin than spy.
