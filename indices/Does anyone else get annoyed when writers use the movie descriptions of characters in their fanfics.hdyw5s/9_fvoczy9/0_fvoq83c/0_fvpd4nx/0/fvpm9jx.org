I never really gave much thought to Tony Stark's height until I read a few fics in a row where the author put in notes that 'everything is movie canon except Tony Stark is tall', but it never actually played any role in the fics themselves, was waiting for him to do something with his height, idk, like reach stuff on the top shelf?
