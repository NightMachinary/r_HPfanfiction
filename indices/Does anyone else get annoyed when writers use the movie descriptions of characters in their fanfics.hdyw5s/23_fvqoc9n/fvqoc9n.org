No, it doesn't bother me at all. I don't mind people envisioning the characters after the actors that played them in the movies.

There's only a few physical character traits that I consider 'essential'. Those include Harry's hair color, Harry's eye color, the fact that Harry looks like James, Hermione's bushy hair, the Weasleys' red hair, and Dumbledore's silver hair/beard.

Everything else can be changed, and even those essential traits can be changed if the author gives a specific reason for it.
