As a person who doesn't really have an "inner eye" so to speak, I can't really imagine what the characters look like too much. I do kind of mash together the movie and book versions of the characters, though. No matter what I tell myself, I keep seeing Neville with brown instead of blonde hair. Other than that, as I can barely conjure up a clear image in my mind, I kind of blank on what they look like. I do prefer the book version, though, for most.
