Ginny had an interesting development in books 1-5, going from "butterdish" to one of the "Ministry 6".

Books 6 and 7, well to be honest they did no one a favour. Tonks went from cool background character to moping doormat, Hermione.exe stopped working completely, all Weasleys were horrible around Fleur if they interacted, Ron was a dick to Lavender and even Malfoy went from "annoying shittalker" to "war criminal".
