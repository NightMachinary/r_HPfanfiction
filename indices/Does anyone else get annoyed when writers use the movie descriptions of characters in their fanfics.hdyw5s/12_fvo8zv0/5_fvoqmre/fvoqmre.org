Everyone's saying that the movies bashed Ginny but how? It actually removed her worst moments and kept everything else.

Ginny sticking her elbow in a butterdish? Not in the movies.

Ginny using the Bat-Bogey for anything and everything? Not in the movies.

Ginny constantly dunking on Fleur and calling her Pleghm? Not in the movies.

Ginny telling Harry that he wouldn't be happy unless he's fighting Voldemort? Not in the movies.

Ginny telling Harry that he shouldn't hook up with a Veela like he's going on some jolly adventure where he's gonna fun and have the time to pick up girls? Not in the movies

Ginny becoming jealous of Cho wanting to take Harry to Ravenclaw Tower to search for the last Horcrux like they're going to immediately get back together and snog when there are Death Eaters knocking at their doors and they're hard pressed for time? Not in the movies.

Ginny fans love saying that in the books, she's a strong, confident, interesting character and it's about time they stopped being delusionnal dumbasses cause she's definitely not. In the movies, she was a non-entity before Y6 and didn't have much screen time even in Y6 and Y7 but she was a nice girl at least.

In the books, not only was she a non-entity before Y6, she's a jealous and unlikable bitch after. The movies didn't "bash her", they glorified her. Ginny stans are stupid
