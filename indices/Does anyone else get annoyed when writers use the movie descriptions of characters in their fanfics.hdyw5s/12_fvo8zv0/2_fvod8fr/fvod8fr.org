Honestly, even beyond the movies, I think it's perfectly fine to be very sparse with how much any content past book 7 should be considered 'canon' or necessary for a good fic. Aside from the questionable handling of America in Fantastic Beasts and Pottermore, I feel like Rowling's run into the George Lucas problem where people just won't tell her it's not a good idea to describe what wizards did before toilets.

Do you think FB and the HP films can be said to exist within a 'film canon' or general extended universe? In the sense where pre-Disney Star Wars was pretty cool because it had different levels of canon you could pretty much ignore at will.
