Isn't the only appearance they have in the series before then in the Mirror of Erised (excluding their young memories in OOTP)? I'm pretty sure most fans wouldn't even notice a recasting after a decade, and there were quite a few actors who left after the first movie iirc. You could even argue that the mirror showed his parents aged up because they stayed alive and aged throughout his life in his dream.
