The casting of James and Lily ruined how incredibly sad their deads were. It's one thing if a 50 year old dies fighting an Dark Lord, it's another thing when 21 year old do. They were so young and had so much potential, and just died.

It's the same for Sirius, him being thrown in Azkaban for a crime he did not commit for 12 years is sad if he's in his 40s. But him being thrown in Azkaban at the age of 21 for 12 years, just after he got his freedom from his abusive relatives, only to die shortly after getting free is in a whole other ballpark. The man never got the opportunity to live his life.
