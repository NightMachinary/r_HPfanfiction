Well, glorified Sirius and Remus too.

In the movie we never see coward!Remus who couldn't stand up his friends, retaining important info about Sirius when he believed him a murderer out for Harry's blood because he was afraid to look bad, trying to abandon his pregnant wife and getting violent when Harry calls him on his bullshit.

Or the dark face of Sirius, in OoP he should be a wreck, in the movie he is all cool. In the movie they cut his murderous "joke" when he betrayed Remus' confidence sending Snape from him during the moonlight, we don't really see him being a bully in the memories (in the only one we saw about the school James is the only standing out - and the bullism is far worse in the book anyway), being a dick with Kreacher or with Harry (the disappointed tone when he said he is not like his father after all, when Harry asked him to not be reckless please).
