I generally drop a fic if it uses Movie depiction of appearances and characters.

For me, Movies are just another poorly written fanfic that:

- Bashed Ron and Ginny, and Grindelwald
- Missed important plot elements and was therefore incoherent (Voldemort's childhood, Half-Blood prince? Marauders?)
- Turned most other female characters into shallow caricatures (Fleur)
- Added cringeworthy scenes (shoelace, Confetti Voldemort, Harry breaking Elderwand without fixing his own)
- Glorified Hermione, Draco, and Snape (by cutting latter two's worst moments)
- Used 40+ years old to play 21 years old James and Lily because some Hollywood types thought 21 years old didn't look "parental" enough
