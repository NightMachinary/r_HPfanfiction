I think most of the problem with Harry's height comes from the fact that while Harry is not short, the Weasleys are overly tall compared to him. So even in the books he's described as shorter than Ron and later when he gets to his father's height(something like 6 feet and something), Ron, Fred, and George are still taller(and lankier) than him.

I don't even notice it, most fics get the basics, Green Eyes(and how some fics go on, and on and /on/ about his eyes), messy black hair and somewhat pale skin and soft features, that's it. It fits the books and Rowling's own description.
