My family tends to have small babies, short children, and then everyone grows a foot around age 14/15. My seventh-grade teacher (who was shorter than most of her students) used to say that she had been the tallest kid in her fifth grade but hadn't grown a centimeter since.

Basically, I'm trying to say that how you're described pre-puberty doesn't dictate how you will be described post-puberty.
