The only instance I found where this was unforgivable in a fanfic was when the author insisted on describing Harry's eyes as blue instead of green, and made quite a bit of effort to point out that detail whenever possible. It drove me absolutely bonkers because it's also been a thing throughout the books that Harry has his mother's green eyes! The author knew this and went out of her way to make a long AN about how she preferred the film look of Harry so she wanted to preserve his eye color too. I dropped the fic just for that reason alone - I was surprised by how furious it made me.

In other fics where Harry is described as short also tend to be fics that play up and overdramatize the abuse Harry is subjected to by the Dursley's. I always saw at as a way to play up the abuse and not a way to emulate the movies.

Also - THE HAIR. Harry's long girly hair in the 4th movie - some authors include this in their fics and it bothers me a lot but not enough to make me drop a fic just for that reason. I hated Harry's hair in that movie and in the later ones - I always felt his hair in the third movie most closely fit what I had imagined from the description in the books. Usually I just imagine him that way, but when fanfic writers go out of their way to tell me how his hair looks otherwise it removes me the story quickly.
