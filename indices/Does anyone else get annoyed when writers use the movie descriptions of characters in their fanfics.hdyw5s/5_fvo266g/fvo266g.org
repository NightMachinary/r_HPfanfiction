Generally speaking, reference to anything that's only true in the movies but not the books drives me up a wall (I'm a gatekeeping book-purist, sue me), but I think the issue with Harry's height is also related to him having been described as "small and skinny" in the first few books. It was only in the fourth/fifth book that we started getting indication that Harry was growing taller. So it's possible that some people just never readjusted their mental image of him.
