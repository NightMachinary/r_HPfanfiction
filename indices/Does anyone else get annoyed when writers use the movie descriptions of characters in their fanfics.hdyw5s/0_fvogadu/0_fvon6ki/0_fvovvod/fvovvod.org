I think in the books she has a slash on her neck where the knife cut her when it was held to her throat and during the conversation with Griphook she makes a point of saying "Mudblood and proud", which was a pretty big moment that they cut out, which is a shame. I agree carving mudblood had a pretty big impact though too, particularly the placement - lower forearm where the dark mark is. I kind of imagine in Bellatrix's mind it's to show she'll never have the "honour" of the dark mark because of her dirty blood.
