It /can/ be done in an interesting way, but I agree it makes little to no sense that every 11-year-old coming into the store causes massive property damage.

The fics I've seen that do it /really/ well, have the effects downplayed to not be destructive - the fic I already mentioned in the parent post has nothing more harmful than the wand just refusing to stay in her hand (and that's stated to be a /really/ bad match).

What I tend to imagine for the more destructive examples is that Ollivander specifically has a load of cheap knick-knacks and donated/conjured decorations to destroy, in order to keep anything /actually/ harmful from happening.

IRL, you have a company designing guitars that are /specifically/ made to be smashed onstage without the risk of splinters going anywhere harmful - kinda similar principle could apply here. Everything that happens /looks/ impressive because that's part of the wand-picking experience, but nothing actually happens that a wizard/witch can't fix in a jiffy.
