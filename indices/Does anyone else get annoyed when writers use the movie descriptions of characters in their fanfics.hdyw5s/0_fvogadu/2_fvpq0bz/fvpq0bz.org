I really hate the wand matching destruction in the movies. Good way to spice up what would otherwise be a boring scene, but so very, very overplayed. I can't imagine that happening in "real life" if we can use such an expression.

I skim through those scenes in fanfiction. The destruction is nonsense, and the "wandlore" is uninteresting. Doubly so if the ingredients are super-rare.
