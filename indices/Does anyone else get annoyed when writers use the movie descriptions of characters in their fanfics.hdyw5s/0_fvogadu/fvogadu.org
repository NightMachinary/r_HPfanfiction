I tune out the physical descriptions of characters for the most part - the only thing that would genuinely /bug/ me is if Harry has any other color eyes than green (unless it's a consciously chosen thing, for example if a fem!Harry has her mother's red-haired looks but her father's eyes).

Honestly, the only reason I dislike over-reliance on film canon is the absolute character-assassination committed by the films. Hermione in the books isn't nearly as much of a Mary-Sue, Ron isn't as much of a prat, Ginny actually /exists/ in the books, Snape has some depth even before we get to see his memories...

Not all of it is bad though - /some/ of the changes for the film-verse, I actually /wish/ were book-canon.\\
The film's idea of poorly-matched wands having some kind of effect is actually pretty good if you downplay the destruction (see: Victoria Potter, which does a really good job incorporating it into how magic in general works).\\
The scene where Bellatrix carves "MUDBLOOD" into Hermione's arm makes sense for book-Bellatrix to have done as well.
