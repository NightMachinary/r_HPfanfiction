The whole "Harry is as tall as his dad" thing is really stupid. Harry was malnourished and abused for his whole life, not to mention he lived in a cupboard. Malnourishment should have taken its toll, and even though he was fed well at Hogwarts and by the Weasleys, it doesn't take away 10 years of abuse.

Really, it's not like JK Rowling even searched up the after effects of the abuse Harry went through, so we don't really listen to Harry supposedly being "tall".

He should have been short, thin, and malnourished with more than likely wrongly healed bones and some scars from Dudley's "Harry Hunting", and maybe even some from Petunia and Vernon.

So, really, it doesn't make much sense that he's described as healthy-looking. Especially whenever he just left the Dursleys. When he just left them, he shouldn't have been able to eat much without getting sick, especially after their "diets". And he shouldn't have been able to get so many growth spurts. Children that are malnourished for long periods of time don't grow up too much without the proper care.

Also, how the fuck did Harry learn to swim in GoF? The Dursleys did not teach him that.

But I'm rambling, so I'll stop.

In conclusion, JK Rowling did not do her research when it comes to abuse, so fanfiction is doing it for her.
