JK Rowling didn't really pay attention to detail, then. And the Dursleys were out of character.

But I'd say that Vernon was out of it at the time---clearly---and that he probably only had a piece or two of bacon and not a full English breakfast that the Dursleys most likely had. But I do still stick to the fact that Harry wasn't fed enough.
