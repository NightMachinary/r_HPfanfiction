It doesn't say that he lived on scraps, and yes, there are indications that he had the same meals as the rest of the family. However, there are several relevant and concerning statements.

- "Harry had always been small and skinny for his age", Philosopher's Stone chapter 2. This could, of course, be a simple matter of genetics, but it's rather suspicious. It's at least a strong indication that he was not eating as much as his cousin, even though Harry shows a good appetite when he reaches Hogwarts.

- "He had been given a week in his cupboard for this" after his hair regrew in a night. It's unclear how well he was fed during this time, but it would certainly encourage muscle atrophy, poor posture, etc. The context implies that extended cupboard time was a standard punishment (and indeed, a few paragraphs later, the 'appearing on the roof' incident saw him locked in the cupboard again).

- Harry was given Dudley's leftover icecream to finish on Dudley's birthday. This /might/ just be a matter of Dudley getting a special treat for his special day, but a) it really wouldn't be that hard to buy icecreams for both boys, especially since they did in fact order Dudley a second one after he complained about the size of the first, and b) Harry considered getting Dudley's leftovers to be an extraordinary privilege, such a stroke of good luck that he ought to have expected the day to go downhill. That doesn't bode well for his portion sizes at other times.

- "Go - cupboard - stay - no meals" after the boa constrictor incident. Harry then waits for the Dursleys to be asleep so that he can sneak food from the kitchen - and the casual way this is written implies that it's very much not the first time that regular meals have been withheld.
