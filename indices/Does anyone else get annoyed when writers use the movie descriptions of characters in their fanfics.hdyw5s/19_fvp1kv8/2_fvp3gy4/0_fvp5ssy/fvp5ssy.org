Go back through the chapters where Harry was with the Dursleys. You'll see that it was rare if he was even fed the scraps of what he cooked. He had to cook for them, you see. But there was never anything left for him to eat. And I highly doubt he was given what the Dursleys had at the shack. They mentioned that they had it, but they never would have given him a crumb.

And, during the summers, he was given food through a flap. It was most certainly not enough to be considered food.

I also remember a summer when he was only given a quarter of grapefruit per day.

So, really, the Dursleys barely fed Harry at all, JK Rowling never gave them enough mind, and Harry had no after effects.

But a trained medical professional like Pomfrey should have seen that Harry was abused.

So I can't help but feel that it was covered up.ðŸ¤” I'm not particularly surprised with the Dursleys treatment and the manipulative Dumbledore tropes in fanfiction because of this.
