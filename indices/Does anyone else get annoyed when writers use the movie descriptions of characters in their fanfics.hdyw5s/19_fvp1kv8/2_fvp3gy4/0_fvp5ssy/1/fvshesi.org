Harry in the first book at the Hogwarts' banquet thinks Durstley didn't make him to be hungry but that abudance was new.

Harry cooking for them is a movie thing: in the book Petunia is putting the food on the table, even for Harry. In the third book, when Dudley is on diet, she wanted all in the family eating the same thing of Dudley but she made the plate of Harry "slightly less" to make Dudley feel better about it.

The only time we see Harry eating scraps is in the book 2 after the Dobby fiasco.
