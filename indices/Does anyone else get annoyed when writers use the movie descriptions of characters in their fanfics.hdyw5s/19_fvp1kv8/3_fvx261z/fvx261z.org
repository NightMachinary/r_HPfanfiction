  Also, how the fuck did Harry learn to swim in GoF? The Dursleys did not teach him that.

To be fair, when I was at primary school in the UK in the late nineties we had swimming lessons through the school, so everyone in my class learned how to swim even if it wasn't from their parents or other caregivers. I don't know how universal that experience is or was, since I have met several people in my age cohort who can't swim, but it doesn't seem odd to me that Harry would be able to swim even if the Dursleys had never taught him.
