I remember DISTINCTLY a scene in HBP when Hermione tells Harry about how the girls are into him now and “it doesn't hurt you've grown six inches over the summer” or however much he's grown. Like obviously he has a growth spurt, and I've always imagined him to be near six feet, even though I saw the movies before reading any of the books.
