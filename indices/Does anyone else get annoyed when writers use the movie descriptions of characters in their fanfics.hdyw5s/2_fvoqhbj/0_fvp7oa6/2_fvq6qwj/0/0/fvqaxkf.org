Yuck. I wasn't thinking like THAT. If there was magical puberty, I expect the stuff that would happen wouldn't be too extreme, and would not be disgusting e.g Growing faster than muggles Magic becoming suddenly stronger Accidental magic become more frequent for a while due to mood swings. Maybe, even stuff like slightly more advanced natural occlumency screens.
