It does seem a bit overexagerated, but in America our summer is roughly 3 months and from the summer of 6th to 7th grade (age 11 to 12 for me) I grew 4 inches once. Its on my cousins house on a brick wall marker in sharpie because I used to spend every complete summer with them. It could be possible but most likely isn't.
