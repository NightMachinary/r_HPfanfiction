I rarely picture characters exactly as they are physically describe, for some reason.

Their behavior, their voice, they character traits change a bit in my mind-eye the way they look according to the books or even the show or movies sometimes.

I mean, in my mind-eye, Hermione's hair look like a bad 80s perm. Harry his average height and slender with short hair that look like he just got out of bed all the time. [[https://loripalooza.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/image_1.jpg][(a lot like that kiddo]])

So, whatever I read in fanfiction, it goes over my head, and I still picture the characters as I use to. Most of the time, I couldn't even tell you how they were describe.
