I read the books before I watched the movies and I admit, that I haven't done both in many years - But I'm really sure that in the first books Harry is described as small for his age and skinny.

As you wrote Harry is tall I was like "what?!" :)

I think it was around the third book when it was mentioned that he had grown. But I can check that when I'm home.

Edit: I remember as I saw the first trailers that I thought that Daniel is neither short ( for his age) or very skinny.
