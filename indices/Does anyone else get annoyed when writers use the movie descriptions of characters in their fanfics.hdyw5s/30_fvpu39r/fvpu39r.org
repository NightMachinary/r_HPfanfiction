Personally I don't mind, but movie is my primary canon, having been exposed to them a lot more than the books (which I haven't read for over a decade). As long as the descriptions aren't too out there (such as claiming Ron has blond hair or that Harry has blue eyes, etc), unless the fic is fiddling with parentage for whatever reason.
