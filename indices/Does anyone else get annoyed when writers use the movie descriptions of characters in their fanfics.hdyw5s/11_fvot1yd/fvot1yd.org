It's annoying when it's just a mix-up like Harry or Ron's height (or the twins' for that matter), but it's downright eye roll worthy when it's about, for me personally, Snape and Hermione.

Hermione is meant to plain leaning pretty, but without ever putting the effort into her looks because it's not something she values. Emma Watson is unfortunately incredibly beautiful and her perfect curls (along with in general overly perfect character in the movies) ruins an important element of Hermione.

Alan Rickman as Snape not only ruins several other characters because they had to age them up to match him (ruining the tragic nature of how young Harry's parents were when they died), but also made him much too likeable in the films. Snape is a greasy, thoroughly unpleasant man in the books- movie Snape is often comic relief (?!).

So I guess for those two it's about looks (beauty and age) as well as how they're represented as characters as a whole in the films that really gets my goat.
