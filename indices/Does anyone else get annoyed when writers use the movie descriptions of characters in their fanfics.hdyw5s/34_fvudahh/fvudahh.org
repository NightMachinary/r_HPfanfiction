This has gotten me curious, OP - do you get irritated at book localisation induced references? eg. if a writer calls it "the sorcerer's stone" instead of "the philosopher's stone"?

To answer your question though - it doesn't bother me in regard to character descriptions. I generally mentally-edit out character description if it goes too weird. Generally stuff in the vein of "Harry took a potion and he suddenly became this gorgeous, muscled hunk with long flowing hair, perfect cheekbones, and sergio-esque chest hair that winked at all the ladies as they swooned past him" rather than Neville looking like the movie actor rather than the book character though.
