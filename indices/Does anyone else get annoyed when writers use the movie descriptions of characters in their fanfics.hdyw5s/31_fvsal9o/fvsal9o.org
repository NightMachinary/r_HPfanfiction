I'm rather contradictory because I default to the movie appearances but do consider the book to be "more canon" when it comes deviations outside of appearances between the two. This is so I can enjoy Felton Draco pwps. Unless the characters I'm interested in reading about need to be hotter than they are in the movie. Like Oldman!Sirius. Then I completely leap off into wildly inaccurate fantasy.

Also at the same time though, the character appearances in the books mostly made very little impression on me except for Harry's eyes, Hermione's hair, and Snapes nose.

Hence my confusion that Neville is blonde. I can't even picture Neville not being movie Neville. Narcissa and Lucius on the other hand get the same treatment as Sirius. Thewpin stays because Thewpin is visually attractive to me. I'm probably going to keep reading whatever HP fanfiction reinforces all of this.
