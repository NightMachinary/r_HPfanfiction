  A baby is left on a doorstep, only this time Petunia Dursley isn't the one who takes it in. Charles 'Hawk-Eye' Potter, retired Sniper of her Majesty's Army is surprised when his adopted grandson turns out to be his own flesh and blood. Now Jamie has to deal with learning magic on top of his regular studies. It's going to be a bumpy ride if he wants to be a pilot in the RAF!

  If there's one thing Lal hates, it's Vongola craziness. On the other hand, perhaps being randomly thrown back in it time is a good thing. After all, she had so many regrets before she joined the military, and now she has a chance to do things right. There's only thing she didn't anticipate the fact that the guy who had a crush on her forever has a few secrets of his own.
