It's not particularly ground-breaking and there's more than a few typos, but I still enjoy it immensely.

To use an analogy with sports movies, "Redheaded Stepchild" reminds me of the Sandlot [if you haven't seen this, go to Netflix. Now.]. It's not ground-breaking or brilliant or thought-provoking, but it's a heck of a lot of fun.
