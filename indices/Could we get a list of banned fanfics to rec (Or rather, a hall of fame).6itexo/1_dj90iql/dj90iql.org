Its not a bad thing really(especially for newer people) often times they are usually the best and most popular fics, but everyone should definitely try and include lesser known and newer fics when they recommend as well, I don't post to often but when I do I try and do this, hell iv posted fics I didn't really like before just to provide some variety, Im sure im not the only one who exhausts the search tab and google in search of recommendations before I post a request myself, its like if you've been around FF for longer than a few months you know the popular ones, you've probably made a request to get lesser known ones to begin with.

Everyone should just assume that the requester knows about Seventh Horcrux, or A Black Comedy etc and maybe include them but list of a few others if you know any aswell. Its when people don't link anything else that it becomes really annoying.
