Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, though, the stories get recommended precisely for a lack of anything else; I mean, if you see a request that's without any replies for half a day or longer and one of those “oh so woefully overrecommended” fics fulfils those requirements then I think recommending those at least says to OP that people can see their request.

Personally I do try to link whatever less commonly reccomended I happen to have that fits, but sometimes it's hard for this-or-that reason.

Edit: Also, it reminds me of those times when different people create requests for the same kind of fics day after another, one user, then one day later another, then half a day later yet another ... at some point during that streak they start deserving copy-pasta for being lazy bastards.
