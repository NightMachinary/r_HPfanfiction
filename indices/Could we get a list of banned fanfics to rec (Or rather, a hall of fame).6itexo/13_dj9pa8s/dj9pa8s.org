The problem is - people ask for the same kind of series over and over again. It's obvious that the same recommendations will be repeated. I've created a list of series to recommend in Evernote so I can just paste the relevant stuff.

You want something new? I suggest creating a list of things you already know (or at least those likely to get recommended) and ask for recommendations while posting it.
