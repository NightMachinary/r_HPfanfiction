Well I do know how you feel. The vast majority of those recs don't really appeal to me so I don't want to see them again and again. Especially anything that just might be a blatant self-insert with no detectable plot. I simply don't believe that out of the million? fics posted online, only thirty or so are worth reading. And as the unfortunate author of some obscure and little-read fics myelf, obviously I'd like to see more of those recommended. But I don't want to see censorship and I don't have to look at the recommendations. If I'm feeling particularly salty I'll just hide the thread so I can pretend it doesnt exist. Simples.
