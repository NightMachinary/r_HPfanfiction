  If people don't want to read about disabled people then there is no problem, the only issue is when you treat disabled people different because of their disability.

I think you're right, in theory. But in my experience, people who don't want to read about disabled people do, in fact, treat disabled people differently. However, Correlation is not causation.

As am I; I don't read slash, either. But at the same time, if I was asking for reccs, I would be massively uncomfortable putting "no slash" on my request. If I don't want slash, I can just skip the recs that contain it, without advertising my preferences to the world. It could, of course, be that I'm too sensitive. As I said in my original comment, I don't actually advocate banning anything. This is just a personal thought that I struggle with sometimes.
