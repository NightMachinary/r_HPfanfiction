  no different than asking for a fic with certain characters, or a specific literary genre.

I'm not entirely sure that comparison holds up. Asking to exclude particular fictional characters, or a literary genre, seems somewhat different, to me, than asking to exclude people of a certain sexual orientation, race, or disability. However, that disagreement is exactly why I said, in my original comment, that trying to ban certain qualifiers would only lead to a slippery slope, before concluding it might not be a worthwhile idea.
