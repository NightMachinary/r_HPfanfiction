I read for my own enjoyment, and if I don't find reading such things enjoyable, then it's perfectly within my rights to ask if there are fics without it.

I'm not asking for other people, I'm asking for myself. If I don't want to read something, I'm not going to ask for recs for it. If I go on FFN and look for fics, I have to scroll past hundreds of slash fics that I'm not going to read anyway. It is, quite frankly, wasting my time. So in the interest of saving time, I have to separate the metaphorical wheat from the chafe. Adding qualifiers is doing exactly that. It's literally what they're there for. Asking for a fic with no slash is no different than asking for a fic with certain characters, or a specific literary genre. If I want to read SciFi, I don't want people giving me High Fantasy just because other people might enjoy them.
