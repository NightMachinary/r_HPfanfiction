  Would it be equally wrong for a gay reader to request 'no M/F'?
#+end_quote

Yes, it would.

  got a slash scene not because I think gay people are inferior but because that's not what I'm interested in
#+end_quote

I feel the same way. I think the difference might be that I believe that to be a flaw; I wish I was equally interested in everything, and I think that treating people equally almost requires being equally interested in them. Also, again speaking personally, I tend to get way more annoyed by surprise M/M than surprise F/F. So that reveals quite a bit of hypocrisy in my personal preferences. I also have a sneaking suspicion that in 75 years, our grandchildren really will find it strange to be interested in M/F, but not M/M.

  not enjoying literary gay porn is a sign that I'm homophobic
#+end_quote

Homophobic is a strong word. And like racism, terrorism, ableism, revolution, and many other words, so many people have shouted it so many times about so many things, it's almost impossible to use it in a conversation, because nobody understands what it means. Especially an internet conversation! While I don't want to accuse anyone of homophobia, and am not, I do think that the number of requests that go out of there way to say "no slash" is troubling. Especially when it's part of requests that wouldn't otherwise involve sex anyway.

  I don't read fics to broaden my horizons.
#+end_quote

Oh, neither do I! I regularly take my downvotes here for defending robst. :-) It's trash, but I find it really, really enjoyable trash.

  I read a lot of Hermione-centric stories
#+end_quote

But as you said, you still do read stories about Draco, if they're good/interesting for some other reason. Putting "Hermione only" would be locking you out of a lot of good stories.

#+begin_quote
  I hope that sorta makes sense.
#+end_quote

It's the most well-expressed version of the opposing point of view that anyone has yet posted. I'm not sure you've changed my opinion, though. I still don't think banning anything is the right way to go. But I still kind of feel that "no slash" and other qualifiers that exclude races/genders/orientations are not a good thing.
