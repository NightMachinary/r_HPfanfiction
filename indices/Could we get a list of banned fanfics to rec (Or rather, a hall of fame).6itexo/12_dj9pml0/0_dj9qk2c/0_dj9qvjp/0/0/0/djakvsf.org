  I don't want slash, I can just skip the recs that contain it, without advertising my preferences to the world. It could, of course, be that I'm too sensitive

I think it's just you to be honest. Would it be equally wrong for a gay reader to request 'no M/F'? Regardless, not everyone discloses that a fic is slash when recommending, for example, and I'd be annoyed if I got 30k words into a fic and got a slash scene not because I think gay people are inferior but because that's not what I'm interested in (in much the same way I would want to know ahead of time if the fic is Evil!Dumbledore).

We read for enjoyment. I don't think not enjoying literary gay porn is a sign that I'm homophobic. I just don't enjoy it because that's not my orientation.

Similarly, when it comes to excluding characters with a disability, or race, or gender, part of my enjoyment of fics is based on the similarity of the main character to me. I don't read fics to broaden my horizons. For example, I read a lot of Hermione-centric stories because, as a nerdy girl that got picked on for her hair, her experience resonates with me and makes me enjoy the story more than reading a story from Draco's perspective (though I still read those.) So if I ask for stories featuring specifically a straight female main character, it's not that I think the others are inferior. I just want a character like me. I expect a lot of people are like that too.

I hope that sorta makes sense.
