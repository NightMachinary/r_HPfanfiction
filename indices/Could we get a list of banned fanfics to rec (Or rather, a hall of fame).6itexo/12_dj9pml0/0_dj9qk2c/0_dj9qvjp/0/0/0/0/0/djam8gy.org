I respect your wish to be equally interested in all things, but I think we'll have to agree to disagree here, and more importantly on the idea that treating people equally requires equal attraction (which is the kind of 'interested in' I meant.)

Now I do agree that a no slash request on non-sex-containing stories is a bit odd, but in terms of still reading Draco stories, for example, sometimes I'm just not in the mood for one. When that happens, I'll request Hermione only. Or the next day I'm really in the mood for Draco-centric stories, so I'll request Draco only. I don't think I'm excluding good stories because (setting aside the fact that 'good' is very subjective) some other day I might want something else.

Anyway, I respect your opinion and I'm glad to have had the discussion, even if we don't quite agree. (Side note: I love robst stories sometimes. They're great for when I don't want particularly thought provoking stories, just well written from a grammatical/spelling perspective. If that gets me downvoted, well, more reading for me I suppose :P)
