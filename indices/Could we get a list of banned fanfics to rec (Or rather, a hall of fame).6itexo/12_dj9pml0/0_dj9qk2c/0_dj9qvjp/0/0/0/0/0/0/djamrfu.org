  treating people equally requires equal attraction
#+end_quote

Ah, I think this is where our assumptions differ. I wasn't using "interested in" to mean "attracted to". It's possible for me (and I suspect most people) to be "interested in" an m/f romance between two people, even if I am not attracted to either one, and wouldn't want to date anybody involved. And yet, the same thing doesn't seem to be true for m/m romance, for me and a lot of people. And that's where my problem lies.

  I'll request Hermione only.
#+end_quote

I think, though, that requesting one particular character is quite different than requesting the mass exclusion of an entire group. As an example, I wouldn't have a problem with "Immortal Harry, from Hermione's point of view." But "Immortal harry. No female characters!" would bother me. And it's this exact slippery slope problem that caused me to conclude that banning things would be a bad idea. It's too subjective.

  I respect your opinion and I'm glad to have had the discussion,
#+end_quote

Ditto! A discussion between two people who agree completely is the least interesting discussion. :-)

  great for when I don't want particularly thought provoking stories,
#+end_quote

Yeah, exactly. I'm a straight white male, so the wish fulfillment for me in some of these is just off the charts. As you're someone who identifies with Hermione, though, I'm surprised they don't drive you crazy. If I had to point to one major problem with robst, it would be how he turns Hermione into an Accessory for Harry, rather than a powerful character in her own right. As with most of robst, though, it's just fine if you don't overthink it. :-)
