Perhaps. But when someone doesn't want to read about gay porn, it's because they're unattracted or uncomfortable with it. If someone doesn't want to read about disabled people because they're unattracted or uncomfortable, many people would feel that's not OK. I'm not sure why the involvement of sex changes things. Especially when someone is already asking for something that contains sexual content. I recognize that it does change things, though. But I'm not entirely sure that's a good thing.
