Got an idea of how to do it. It's not scientific so its won't REALLY be the most recommended but it still might be fun. A week before New Years we have a stickied post that asks everyone to recommend one story. The thread gets locked New Years day and the top 10 upvoted fics get put into a thread on the sidebar.

Nothing gets restricted afterwards or anything, we just get a neat list we made together.
