As an author, I really have to oppose this. This reddit is one of the best ways for fics to get exposure. More exposure to my and other authors works is great. If we can't recommend things by Starfox5 or Seventh Horcrux those stories will die off and not get read any more. If people really are recommending my stories every other thread that can only be a good thing for me.
