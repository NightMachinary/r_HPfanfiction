most characters' race arent mentioned in the books though. i mean we know seamus Finnegan is irish and the patil twins are indian and the malfoys are french from their names, and i suppose a few others have skin described as pale her and there, but for the most part it isnt really mentioned. in one of the earlier movies, lavender brown was played by a black actress, but that was changed in 6 when lavender was suddenly relevant...
