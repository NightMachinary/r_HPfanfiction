It's fanfiction, you can change anything you want, no matter the reason. I've read a story with Indian Harry once, where his skin colour was mentioned, but that was all. Technically it didn't add anything significant to the story, but that was author vision, so I didn't care much. It certainly didn't stop me from enjoying that story.
