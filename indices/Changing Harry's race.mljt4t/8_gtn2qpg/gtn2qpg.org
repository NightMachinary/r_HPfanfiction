If it is absolutely necessary, then sure, but otherwise, no. While there is nothing wrong with adding cultural diversity, I dislike changing canon character's race. I'm not sure if it ever says specifically that Harry's white? Prpbably, I don't know, but it is very heavily implied. Making Hermione black is okay because it never implies anything about her race, but Harry is definitely white so unless if it is very absolutely necessary, no.
