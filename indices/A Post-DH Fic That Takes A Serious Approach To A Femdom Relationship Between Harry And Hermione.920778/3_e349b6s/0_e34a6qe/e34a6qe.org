I'm glad you're enjoying all my current stories! I can't link TBW here because of Rule 5, but I'm glad you found it and thought it was interesting.

Baby Fever is really supposed to be something closer to unrepentant smut but with enough strong characterization among all the characters and comedy to make it an entertaining read in between. The sequel to Baby Fever though, which I'm tentatively calling *Go Ask Your Mothers*, will basically be a story of all their kids growing up in a crazy, unrealistic harem family, and how that unrealistic situation might realistically turn out, especially with all of them pregnant at the same time (approximately).

That's to make sure I continue having at least one story that I don't have to be quite as careful with the plot about, or spend so much time crafting each chapter.

After an update slot opens up (that is, a story is finished), the next one up is *Just Magic*

** Just Magic
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: just-magic
   :END:
*Harry/Fleur Romance*

#+begin_quote
  When Fleur asked for Harry's help with a bit of magic that is fairly rare, Harry thought she was playing a joke on him at first. He'd never heard about sex-powered spells in school... granted, that didn't seem like something they would teach there. But Fleur had insisted that it was just magic, nothing more. Well, just sex and magic, nothing more. Nothing more...

Then we have two more stories that I'll start releasing as I have more update slots open:

** Patchwork Soul
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: patchwork-soul
   :END:
*Harry/fem!Riddle or Harry/Ginny/Riddle depending on perspective, Angst & Romance*

#+begin_quote
  Tom's teenage self was reeling. Having your soul shattered and then forced to absorb parts of an 11 year old girl would do that. But this wasn't the world or the time he --- or she now --- remembered, and unfortunately the only person that could understand felt nothing but hatred. Oh yes, Harry was most unhappy about Ginny being killed.

** Kismet Entwined
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: kismet-entwined
   :END:
*Harry/fem!Neville Adventure & Romance*

#+begin_quote
  When Harry first arrived at Hogwarts he was pleased to find himself making friends. Ron was someone he got along with easily, but he quickly started to get close to one of the first year Gryffindors who seemed to have a lot in common with him: Cecilia Longbottom. No matter what happened, it seemed their fates were connected by threads that neither could understand.

Finally, I'm still developing concepts for the following stories:

- A story that basically focuses on the futa kink that's much more in the style of Baby Fever, though probably not a mass harem fic.
- An Avatar: The Last Airbender story that is Zuko-centric (though probably not Zutara) that is set at the beginning of Season 2 or end of Season 1 (possibility I might do a crossover with this, but unlikely)
- A time-travel fic where Harry involuntarily keeps reliving his entire life every time he dies (sometimes young, sometimes old) and when we join him has lived a total of something close to 250,000 years worth of lives

EDIT:

Also, next chapter of TBW should be released within 24 hours.
