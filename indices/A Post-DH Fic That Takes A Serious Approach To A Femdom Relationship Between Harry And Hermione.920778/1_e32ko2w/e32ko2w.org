The story has its moments, but sometimes Harry's issues feel almost comically exaggerated. Like the time when Hermione leaves for some research and he is at a complete loss what to do. Not just "no idea what to do, let's turn on the telly or rub one out", but more like "Harry.exe has stopped working."

Harry enjoying Hermione's directions and even his inner struggle feel believable (I have no personal experience in that regard, but it is not outstandingly odd), but someone who had managed to survive alone for a year wouldn't forget everything within a couple of days.
