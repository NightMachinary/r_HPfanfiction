Hmmm... perhaps this is more difficult for me to see without outside input because I have much more of the story in my head than I've published. Thank you very much for the insight, there are certain things I was going to get into in later chapters that I should have perhaps touched on in these two.

I wasn't going to deeply explore Harry's mental state until Hermione started to see it as something that would stop them from getting into a proper relationship, I was just planning on covering the surface of it until then.

But, in doing so, I can see how it would leave Harry's character feeling a bit incomplete until I do that.

I'll have to think about whether or not I'd prefer to just continue forward until I reach the point I was planning on or update the chapters already posted.

Again, thank you for reading and also for being so willing to give such constructive feedback.
