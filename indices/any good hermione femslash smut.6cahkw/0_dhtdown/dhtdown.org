[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028): No Voldemort AU. Hermione got together with Bellatrix. Lots of smut and very decent plot.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/][Here and There]], linkffn(7525570): This is what time turner travel should be. The plot is compelling, Hermione and Ginny's relationship developed quite nicely, and the fallout of their relationship was well written. Only the ending felt a little off.
