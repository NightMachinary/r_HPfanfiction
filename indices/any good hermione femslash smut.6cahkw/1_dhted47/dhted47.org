+There's a fem!Harry/Hermione series by Philosophize or something like that. It's pretty decent. The pro-women stuff gets a bit too much for me later on, and I say that as a woman.+

+The Blackest of Souls is another one. It's Hermione/OC. The OC was a fourth member of the group named Carina. She gets sent to Azkaban even though she's innocent, and when she comes back, she slowly rebuilds her relationship with Hermione+

Edit: Whoops you said smut. My fault.
