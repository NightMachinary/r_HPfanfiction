While not necessarily popular among wizard born students, arranging to have daily deliveries of various Muggle newspapers and selling magicallyâ€‹ produced copies would make a steady business, perhaps more for the sports//gossip sections among the younger years. Heck, a local bookie operation could work for both magical and muggle sports.

There money to be made going the other way too. I mean, you could make quite a tidy sum just going to the Room of Requirement, asking for all clothing/furniture not used in the last say 100 years, and selling it through venues along the lines of Antique Roadshow.
