This would be a good use of the expandable trunks. Harry buys one and uses it as a storage for his contraband.

I'd have in stock:

- Porn magazines. Easily distributed, especially if you hide them in books.

- Alcohol. Anything and everything I can get my hands on. Lets face it. The customers I'd have are teenagers and teenagers swallow anything that gives them a buzz and isn't entirely legal for them to have.

- Quills, Parchment and other supplies. I'm not sure where students in Hogwarts get their spare parchment - its never said - but maybe you could make that a market? Also you could add muggle stuff like ring-folders, staplers, pens, notebook to your selection due to their practicability.

- Potions. From contraceptive to psychedelic anything that could go for a quick galleon. Hangover potion, Dreamless Sleep, even Polyjuice for the right price.

- Broom Rental. Buy a few good brooms (doesn't have to be Nimbus or Firebolts) and rent them out for a few bucks. They're way better than the school brooms and if you'Re only looking for the occasional casual ride, its way cheaper than to buy your own.

- Tobacco and Herbs. I'm sure the casual cigar, pipe or joint aren't even the funniest stuff you could get out of a well stocked greenhouse. I'd buy a trunk big enough to have a greenhouse in it with all the fun plants in it. When I harvest I can supply the student population with a wide variety of herbal drugs.

- Repair and Clean Service. Buy some houseelves and let them work a little shop. Repair clothes, bags or let evidence vanish. All at the flick of a houseelf's finger. May also write homework for you for the right price - just don't expect to get good grades for it.

Depending on how good Harry's moral compass is, he could even go into highly criminal territory.

- Dark and Dangerous. Need a bit of Knockturn Alley? Sure thing, step right up. We got it all, from uber-potent love potion to candy that makes your enemies bones turn to glass. Your desire is our business. Your revenge is our trade.

- Prostitution. If your Harry has truly lost all sense of morals, maybe he buys some... idk... Succubi, Lamia, Nymphs and whatnot on the black market and lets desperate boys and men have fun with them (or let "his girls" have fun with those poor sods), for galleons a plenty (loss of soul, free will, or other bodily, spiritual, or mental harm may apply).
