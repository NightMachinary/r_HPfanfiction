Generally speaking the stuff that sells is going to be stuff that is either against the rules, or is quickly used up and needs to be replaced.

Quills, ink and school supplies could be a small, legal business.

Food items that aren't available at dinner, like candy, we're a solid sale at day school, it would only be worse at a boarding school I imagine.

Porn would likely be an option, but more likely to just be passed around rather than sold. Thinking back to that age, one magazine would last you months, if not the whole year, simply because that is what you had access to. Make with any kind of sex supplies, there is probably a market, but not a huge one.

Drugs and alchohol would be the highest value, but highest risk items. Someone has a hookup outside the school and can smuggle stuff in.
