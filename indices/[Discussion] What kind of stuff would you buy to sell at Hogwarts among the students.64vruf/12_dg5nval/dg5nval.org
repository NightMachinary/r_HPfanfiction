I simply feel galleons aren't melted due to treaties. Like if wizards started melting gold it would trigger a war. Just like the Philosophers Stone isn't used to create gold in large sums due to treaties. Not magic. I really doubt the goblins would go to the trouble to sabotage the coins just in case, that would have been like Jobs sabotaging a Macintosh to explode if you tried to get to the base code to see how it runs and create your own OS. But maybe they do idk. My whole argument is based on the theory they're unprotected and there's so many if a few go missing here and there, well tough shit.
