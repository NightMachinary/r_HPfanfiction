How so? In book 4 people are trying to give muggles "hubcap sized gold coins." No one gets arrested.

Again, what is magic going to do against 1600/C fire when gold has a melting point of ~1000/C? And theoretically magicals would only deal in pure substances, like in alchemy, they only use pure substances. And if that's the case why didn't the goblins do anything about the Philosophers Stone? It could theoretically create gold, thus destroying the banking system.
