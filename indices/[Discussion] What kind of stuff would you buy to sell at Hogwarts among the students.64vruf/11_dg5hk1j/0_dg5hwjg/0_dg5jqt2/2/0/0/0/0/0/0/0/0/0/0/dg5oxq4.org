A bullet is in no way the equivalent of a Killing Curse. Its not even close.

A bullet is a /physical object/ accelerated to high velocity and kills by piercing the body, ripping wounds into them. Bullets have a chance of hitting in a non-lethal way.

The Killing Curse is a /spell/ that kills a living thing. It leaves no physical mark, no wound. It just ends life in an instant. It doesn't matter if it hits you straight in the heart, or on your pinkie toe - you're dead either way.

The Avada Kedavra is a spell in a group of spells that are known as "unblockable", which in this context means that they are unblockable /by other magic/. These spells are magic specifically designed to ignore shields.

Bullets are non-magic physical objects. They do not have the magical properties of the Killing Curse that allows the curse to ignore the Shield Charm.
