If Muggles would do something against wizards they have one chance. They have to completely eliminate the wizards during First Strike. Not just that. It would have to be a global, synchronized, all-encompassing first strike. Given how many wizards live amongst muggles, that would be not only genocide on the wizards, but also genocide on your own people. To make a One-Catch-All strategy, muggles would have to sacrifice a lot of lifes of their own. Bullets may travel fast and bombs may kill a lot of people, but the moment wizards catch on, those two option will be neutered by protective charms and by simply vanishing to where muggles can't look - can't even remember to look because those places are simply gone from the collective memory.

I also think you're making this way too complicated. You assume that wizards would attack soldiers. Why? As a wizard I would avoid all serious fights. I would apparate around the cities, cast fiendfyre into the most densely populated part of a city and disapparate. My populace would be situated in tents in caves under Fidelius, while agents would travel around the world in their own tents, casting fiendfyre and the darkest bit of magic I can find until the muggles are either extinct or grovel at my feet, begging for mercy.

The muggles would have one chance. If they miss that window of opportunity, they're done for.
