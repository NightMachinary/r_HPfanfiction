Really? Cus as far as I'm aware the only reason they're unblockable that is given to us is is simply that they're unblockable by magic. Only a physical object can stop them. So if you have proof, please point it my way.

By usually I mean in fan fiction that is how it's explained. As far as canon goes it never explains what would happen so we don't know if a Protego can stop a bullet. But if that's the case why wouldn't the Death Eaters attack muggles and then shield from bullets? They could simply stand there and trade fire with muggles, and then apparate away, obviously there has to be some sort of catch with how bullets interact with shields. Maybe after a salvo of bullets a shield breaks like a salvo of magic can break a shield? Things I think about instead of sleeping after a 10 hour shift.
