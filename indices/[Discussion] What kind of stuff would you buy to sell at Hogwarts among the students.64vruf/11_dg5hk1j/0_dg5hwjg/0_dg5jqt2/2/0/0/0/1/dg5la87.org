There's no canon statement. Who knows if it could actually create gold?

We only know it actually extends life due to their extreme age. Perhaps he made a deal to not do so if it can make gold. Or they didn't do anything because goblins attacking a wizard as famous as Flamel would spark another war they aren't ready for.

As for goblins using alloys, see their creating the sword of gryffindor.

All it takes is a squad of well trained mages to sneak into command officers' homes, extract intel, then begin assassinating world leaders. You can't equate magicals to spear carrying zulus.

Anyway, it's time to sleep.
