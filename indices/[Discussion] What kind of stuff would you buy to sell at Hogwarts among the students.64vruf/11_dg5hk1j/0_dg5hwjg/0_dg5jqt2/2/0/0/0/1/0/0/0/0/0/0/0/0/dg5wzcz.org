Ok, I am back to interject again. First of all, the muggles have a slight tactical advantage. They aren't stupid, and have a bit of technological advantage over the wizards. Bullets travel fast, and really too fast to defend against. In book seven, we see that apparation is not fast enough to evade a skillfully thrown knife. Also, disillusionment is useless until wizards catch on that they need to adapt for thermal cameras and also silence themselves. I can't personally imagine that disillusionment works for all of the EM spectrum, but know never know, magic is wierd.

However to give some love to the wizard side, consider that the guerilla warfare is orders of magnitude more dangerous. Wizards can be invisible. They can teleport. They can communicate faster than light, and that communication cannot be jammed. They can also travel faster than light, and that can't be jammed either. And Dark Wizards are even more deadly. The Imperious curse would wreck havok in the mugglle government. With a competant caster, there appears to be nothing wrong. They would also retain all their memories, so any kind of polyjuice check would fail. With one efficient dark wizard, you could easily imperious a large portion of government. Here comes nuclear warfare.

Because infiltrator tactics like those give wizards victory in most situations, what can they do if they aren't allowed. Well, first off, legilimency is a very powerful tool, all things considered. But also, consider this. Wizards won't fight muggles the same way they fight wizards. Wizard combat is mostly dueling style, with beam weapons, because more area of effect damage could be canceled or negated. But on muggles? If you transfigure polar bears, and use the impervious charm to make them bullet proof, then portkey them behind enemy lines, it would be carnage. Polar bears would kill and eat just about anything, and are one of the few apex predators which actively hunts, and kills humans. And if you can't shoot it, or outrun it, your Kevlar vest will not help whatsoever. Or, if you are a dark wizard, you can make an inferi horde. Imagine creating Inferi, putting them under an illusion to look normal as well as a Notice-Me-Not, and then leaving them to walk around a populated city.

And finally, while the Muggle world has weapons of mass destruction, so does the Wizarding world. Basilisks. Nundus. Mandrakes. Fiendfyre. Dementers for that matter. All of those options, if used correctly, would kill thousands, millions of muggles. Creatures are the real dangerous part of the wizarding world. Magic outright laughs at the concept of DNA and inheritance, so you can breed a venomous lion porcupine creature, with a firey crustacean, to create 12 foot long, heavily armored lobsters with explode from both ends as a means of propulsion. That, coupled with dragons, and other deadly creatures is a rather terrifying concept.
