There is Protego. Protego's name says it "protects from harm". A bullet does harm, therefore Protego protects you from it. The HP magic doesn't work with physical forces or maths. Its semantics and symbolism - abstract concepts.

Stuff like that is why stories in which muggles beat the magicals always need such a elaborate explanation. Its super unlikely that they could.
