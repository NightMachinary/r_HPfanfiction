  And I'm pretty sure a single squadron of A-10's carry enough fire power to level a city.

24 bombers - a squadron - do not carry enough firepower to level a city. They may eradicate Hogsmeade and seriously damage Hogwarts, if they can find it, that is, but if the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs are in their Common Rooms, they have a good chance of survival.

But lets assume they eradicated Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. 50% of magical Britain dead in one go. Hell, lets assume that the muggles react really fast and get Diagon Alley and the Ministry too. Wizarding Britain is done for.

But then you face a problem. How do you bomb something you can't even find? How do you find Durmstrang? Its unplottable. How would you find fideliused places? You literally cannot even comprehend their existence.

  Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, the Durmstrang Institute, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have all been rendered *unplottable* with powerful magic to protect their students and secrets from Muggles and Dark wizards.

I get how you'd find Hogwarts. Hogsmeade isn't unplottable, so you just bomb the vicinity. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons, though. We're not even talking about the other schools.

So you decimate hundreds of thousands of magicals all over the planet, who weren't in unplottable locations at the time of your assault and couldn't apparate there to safety. Win for you, I guess.

However, have fun with that mustard gas and those nukes... wherever you let them drop. Wizardkind is gone from your radars and those pesky wandwavers started apparating into your cities, flinging their own mass-destruction spells around. Where do you drop the nukes? Where do you drop the mustard gas? At the last known location? Just into the middle of the plaza where there is a house-number missing? What about your own people you kill? How many thousands of your own are you willing to sacrifice to kill one wizard?

If I were a wizard I'd fidelius house after house in all the biggest cities. Your own people are my meatshield. Wann bomb a safe-house? You'd have to take thousand, maybe even millions of your own with me.
