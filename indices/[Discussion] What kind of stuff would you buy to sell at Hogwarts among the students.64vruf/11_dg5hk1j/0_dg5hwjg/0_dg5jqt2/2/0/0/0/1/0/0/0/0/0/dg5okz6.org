I see bombers as a wizard and I apparate the fuck outta there. I cough a bit weird, I apparate out of there.

The way I see it, once wizard caught on that the muggles have it out for them - meaning, once the first strike is over, they're almost impossible to catch off guard again.

If anything you'd need to take wizards out silent, instantly, simultaneously at several places and in great masses. Yet, miss even /one/ wizard with half a library and you could face the end of global muggle civilization.

HP wizards are insanely overpowered. There is no limit to magic, as far as we know. If Muggles can't finish it really quick, they'll be in the defensive afterwards - even if its only a small team of wizards surviving.
