You think they'll hear the bombers? Laser guided. They don't hear it until it's too late. And I'm pretty sure a single squadron of A-10's carry enough fire power to level a city. Let alone a castle and a little village.

If muggles can't finish it quick, I doubt they'll fight fair. They'll turn to things like mustard gas, white phosphorus. And worst comes to worst, nuclear weapons.
