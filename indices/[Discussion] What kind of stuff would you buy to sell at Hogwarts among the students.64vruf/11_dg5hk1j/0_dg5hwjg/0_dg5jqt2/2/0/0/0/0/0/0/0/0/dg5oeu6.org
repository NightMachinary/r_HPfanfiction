Yes, we were talking about Protego, which is magic. The Killing Curse and the Cruciatus are unblockable by magic. Why do I have to point this out? Have you read the books?

Which makes it absolutely useless in any kind of argument. If we're talking about fanon, its all about preferences.

I personally believe that the only reason the Death Eaters didn't go all out on the muggles was that Voldemort could do without the ICW getting a panic attack and intervening. The attacks he did were on the edge of what can be explained away - the Statute wasn't broken. I would suspect that we see more of how the ICW reacts to dangerous breaches of the Statute in the movies that are coming up.
