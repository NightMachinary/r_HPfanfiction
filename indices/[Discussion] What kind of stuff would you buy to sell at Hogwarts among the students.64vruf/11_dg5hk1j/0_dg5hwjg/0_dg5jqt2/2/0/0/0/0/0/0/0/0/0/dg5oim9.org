Well you made the statement that somehow a Protego can stop a bullet but can't stop the wizarding equivalent. And I asked you to prove your point about why the spells are unblockable, yet you can't because we're never given an actual reason, so obviously you haven't read the books.

But without an actual reason as to why, it's open to speculation, and speculation is not fanon. So it actually is a valid argument.
