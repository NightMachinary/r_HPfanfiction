There's no canon statement that the galleons aren't pure gold, or that they're protected.

Pottermore states it is able to.

Again Pottermore states the Sword is pure silver. So not an alloy.

A squad of mages appears in military base, sentries upon notification begin firing on the mages, sniper fire begins not long after, and as soon as they get in position, machine guns and squad automatic weapons are laying down suppressing fire, now wizards have a few choices. They can try apparating around picking off a few soldiers at a time, while being picked off one at a time. Start shielding and firing from a fixed position which would essentially end in them being killed off one by one. Or they flee. Yeah and muggles have cruise missiles, claymores, high caliber bullets, muggles discover Hogwarts guess what? Wards probably aren't going to be able to withstand a continued assault from artillery, missiles, AC-130 fire, A-10 Warthogs.
