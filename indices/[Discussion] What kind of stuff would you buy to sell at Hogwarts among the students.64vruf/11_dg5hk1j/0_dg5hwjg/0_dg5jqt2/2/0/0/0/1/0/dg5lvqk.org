Just to interject, you both have good points and bad points. First of all, the gold. We never actually see any specific details about the Galleons in the HP Verse. However, if the scenario that you describe were true, then the Wizarding economy would have collapsed ages ago. Thus, we must assume that the money is protected somehow. It might be enchanted so that it is impossible to melt down. While it is less likely that Galleons could prevent furnaces from operating, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the heat energy simply doesn't reach the metal.

Now, if I had to create a magical monetary system, compliant with canon, yet still making sense, I would use sympathetic magic, like the Protean Charm. First of all, let's assume that the Goblins have a monopoly enforced by treaty over the gold, silver and copper markets. All of their currency is backed by the gold standerd, and it is patently illegal to sell or buy hold from someone else. What the goblins do is create a massive bunker, an underground magical Fort Knox. There, they have every coin in existence. All of those coins have serial numbers, and are magically tracked with a ledger. What everyone thinks are Galleons and Knuts, are actually magical constructs, bound to their counterparts via sympathetic magic. Any changes which happens to the master coin in Gringotts happens to the slave coin in common use, but not vice versa. Thus, they cannot be melted down, damaged or destroyed by normal means, and even if they were, the monetary value was not lost, it merely was transported to Gringotts where they make a new slave coin. If the master coin is enchanted, the slave coin picks up it's enchantments, which is primarily how they track it. It you try to duplicate it, it will only last for an hour or so before the magic runs out. This is what is commonly known as leprechaun gold. This also deals with Flamel nicely. While Flamel can make gold, he is required to sell to the goblins. The goblins then are free to control that supply of gold, and sell the raw material at a marked up price, or else use it to make currency which they can then circulate at their discretion.

As for the benefits/downsides of muggle vs wizards, consider it this way. These are both what equate to first world countries. Wizards are debatably even more advanced in that aspect, as they are closer to a post scarcity society. Both countries have what could be considered weapons of mass destruction. Muggles are exponentially better at a traditional war, where as Wizards are just about the best at asymmetric warfare, with some of the best possible abilities for guerilla warfare possible. The point being that they are on roughly equal ground society, culturally, and in regards to military strength, I am of the opinion that both sides would damage the opponents irreparably.
