/"Fiendfyre" he bellowed and watched as London burned to ashes, the muggles unable to fight the demonic flames. All over the world, the witches and wizards of the magical army did the same. Tomorrow no big city would remain, all burned, billions dead./

Or what I'm trying to say: Once the muggles fight with the gloves off, the wizards may do so themselves. Fiendfyre is the first that comes to mind, simply because its such an easy spell (Crabbe could do it) with such immense destructive power. No firefighter could do anything against somewhat sentient flames. You'd only have to fly your broom across New York, Tokio, Berlin, London, Moscow,... and let loose. A team of wizards could burn the civilizations of muggles to a crisp in no time.

So muggles may "win", but only at the cost of everything they have ever built and only after the deaths of billions.
