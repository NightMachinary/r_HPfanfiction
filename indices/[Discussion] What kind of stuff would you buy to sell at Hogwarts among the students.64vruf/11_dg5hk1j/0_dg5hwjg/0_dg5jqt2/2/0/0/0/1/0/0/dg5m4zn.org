It's possible, but unless we have a clear statement, we simply have to assume no one does it simply due to treaties.

My problem with this is why is Flamel bound to sell it? How does he benefit? I don't see him simply agreeing to that. I feel Flamel simply doesn't use that aspect since he's been alive so long he's accumulated enough gold that he has no need to create it.

As for the warfare, yeah they might be better at hit run, but as soon as the military discovers their settlements, they simply turn on the firepower and blow it to shit. Boom. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are gone. Diagon alley is a problem as it's supposedly in the middle of London, but then the government declares there is reports of a bomb threat, and they blow the shit out of it. Now wizards have no stongholds, and are scattered. Aurors and hit wizards attempt hit and run tactics, but just like the Viet Cong, they'll lose witches and wizards along the way. And with the Magical population being supposedly low after the first wizarding war, and probably still low, they couldn't stand to get in to a long term war. On top of that, where do wizards get food? Gotta assume there is some trade with the muggle world, as food can't be transfigured according to Gamp's Laws.
