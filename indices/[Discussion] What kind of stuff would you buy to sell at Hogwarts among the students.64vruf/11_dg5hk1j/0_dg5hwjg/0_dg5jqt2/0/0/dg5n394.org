And charms aren't permanent so therefore you keep it in there until the charm fails and gold melts. And also if that's the case, why wouldn't Voldemort have made his Horcruxes impervious to Fiendfyre? Gotta assume Fiendfyre burns pretty damn hot since it can destroy a horcrux but a regular fire can't. If Voldemort is as nuts about immortality that he discovers a dark obscure piece of magic to split his soul that has few things that can destroy it why wouldn't he go all out and protect against the few things that could destroy them. Cast an op fireproofing charm and boom now you have to get a basilisks venom to destroy it or fire the killing curse. And with basilisks being banned or illegal (can't recall how they word it) you have to fire a killing curse, which most wizards wouldn't.
