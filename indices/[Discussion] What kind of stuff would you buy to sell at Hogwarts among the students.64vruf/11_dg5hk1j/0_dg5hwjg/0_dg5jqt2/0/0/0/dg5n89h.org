Who says they aren't? We see enough permanent charms throughout the series.

Heres an excerpt from the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  A charm is a spell that adds certain properties to an object or creature. Charms are distinguished from transfigurations in that a charm adds or changes properties of an object; it focuses on altering what the object does as opposed to what the object is.[1] For example, the Colour Change Charm causes something to flash different colours; the Levitation Charm causes an object to levitate; the Cheering Charm improves upon a creature's mood.

  An object that has a lasting charm placed on it is called bewitched, though charms in general appear to last longer than other spells.

No time limits, just some extra complications in /bewitching/ items.
