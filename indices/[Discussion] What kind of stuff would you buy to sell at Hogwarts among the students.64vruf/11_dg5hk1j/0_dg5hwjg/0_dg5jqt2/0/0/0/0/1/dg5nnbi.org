I'd think that if a witch or wizard would undo them, they got a Goblin bolt in their forehead before they can drop it in the furnace. If that didn't work they'll pressure the Aurors to throw the offender into Azkaban - or better yet, give them to the Goblins for justice. If that also didn't bear fruit, its a call to arms and a whole lot of wizards and witches gon' die in the next Goblin Rebellion. Or Goblins also charm them so that if they are disenchanted, they explode in a TNT worthy blast, ripping the offender to shreds.

But hey, before we loose outselves in an epic battle of the headcanons: If you really want galleons to be meltable, you go ahead. You do you. We know waaay too little about those coins to base arguments on facts given by canon.

I just wanted to point out that magic /can/ protect a galleon from melting and that Charms aren't necessarily time-restricted.
