  Also I highly doubt a killing curse could destroy a non-living horcrux. Horcruxes are destroyed by damage to the physical container, and the Killing Curse is not a particularly physically devastating spell.

Just had an epiphany: killing Harry wouldn't have removed the horcrux. Unless his body was cremated (and even then, depends how), the soul piece would still be stuck to the scar. In a properly twisted world, killing Harry would only make him a corpse that the horcrux would then attempt to possess, making him inferius!Harry.
