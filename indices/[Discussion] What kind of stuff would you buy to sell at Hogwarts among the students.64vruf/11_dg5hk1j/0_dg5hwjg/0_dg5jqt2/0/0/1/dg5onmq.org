  Gotta assume Fiendfyre burns pretty damn hot since it can destroy a horcrux but a regular fire can't.

Fiendfyre can destroy a horcrux because it's cursed fire, not because it's hot. It's the magical qualities of the fire not the physical qualities that are especially destructive.

One suspects that if you tried to melt a coin with fiendfyre there would be no coin left at the end of it, and no pool of melted metal either. Just ashes.

Also I highly doubt a killing curse could destroy a non-living horcrux. Horcruxes are destroyed by damage to the physical container, and the Killing Curse is not a particularly physically devastating spell.
