The idea that moderately high heat poses a serious problem for a set of abilities that includes time travel, creation of matter, teleportation, and manipulation of space is kinda absurd. From the perspective of Muggle science, if one were to treat magic as energy, then there is more energy used in a single Aguamenti charm than in a nuclear bomb. From a more magical perspective, if one treats magic as entirely separate from physical law, then the amount of energy in a fire doesn't really matter, because "energy" is not part of the system of magical law.
