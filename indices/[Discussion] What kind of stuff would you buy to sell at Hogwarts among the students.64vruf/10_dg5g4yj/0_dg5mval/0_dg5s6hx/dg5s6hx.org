He's not wrong: A kitchen most people never find in all their years at the school (especiall the rule abiding Ravenclaws and Huffelpuffs!)...I agree on the tampons and pads (there's probably a spell and/or potion for that!), but muggle pain killers? Yeah, I'd go for that - why?

They probably don't interfere with potions (I mean you can't take a pain-reliefer if you use skele-gro, right? So a muggle drug would work because it has no magical propperties what so ever!)

Thanks, great suggestions :)
