Study aids are canon, as are protective amulets in times of trouble (Chamber of Secrets, etc)

Potions ingredients that can be used to brew all kinds of dangerous stuff, or just completed potions (drug-equivalents, potions like polyjuice potion, love potions, etc) brew your own ecstasy after finals with your friends! Etc.

Contraband pets (some Slytherin would love to have a cool looking snake! Plus the hufflepuffs could get their own badger and keep it hidden in the dorms. Especially crazy gryffindors might smuggle in a small griffin to pet 'for luck' before a Quidditch game) and the means to feed them.

Moving pictures in racy mags would be a hit (I bet the harpies & other Quidditch teams do a charity stripped-down photo shoot).

Booze would be the number one desired item, though.
