I was considering starting the next chapter off with Revan introducing Bastila to Remus and then having to explain to her girlfriend why they called her 'Blood Blossom' during the war.

"Err...yeah that was one of the titles they gave me before I was mind fucked to be a pacifist. Blood Blossom, Crimson Lily, Death's Bouquet, honestly I was very busy, and eventually a girl gains a reputation when she gets around."
