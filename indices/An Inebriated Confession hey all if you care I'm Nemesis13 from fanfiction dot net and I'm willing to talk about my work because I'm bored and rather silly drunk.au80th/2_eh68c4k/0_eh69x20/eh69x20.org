You know 'Being Bellatrix Black and Loving It,' started off as just a method to make my muse shut the hell up and let me get some sleep, then it ended up doing the direct opposite because I kept thinking of scenarios that made me break out laughing?

Maddening, absolutely maddening.

Also I'm glad I got you to play KOTOR, it and its sequel didn't age all that well but they are still certainly fun if not for the gameplay then the storyline.
