Truthfully I had never really considered it, I suppose writing Harry and whoever else being in stasis after the attacks wouldn't be out of the question, but getting them to America would be something I'm not quite sure they would be capable of. And they would /have/ to be in America since half the fun of Fallout is the 1950's flavor of the entire franchise, hmm...something to consider.
