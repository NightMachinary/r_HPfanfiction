I generally enjoy your works but most seem to be abandoned a few chapters in. And I really get that writing updates can be a bitch, and sometimes you want to skip the boring bits and get to the good part, but your pacing is all over the place. Looking at "Through the looking glass", it isn't impossible to build a relationship in that amount of words/chapters, but it is unbelievable how quickly it happens in the story. I think you go from "enemy" to "let's bone" in a week. A bit more time passing in the background would already do the trick (eg " a month passed and Harry...")
