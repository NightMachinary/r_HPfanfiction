I'm going to be honest on this one, with /that/ story I kinda froze up and thought, "Holy shit, how is she /not/ going to burn the school down in the first week out of shear boredom?" When every day is an adventure and every hurtle is a boss battle what is a young Red Mage supposed to do when she has to go to a history class taught by ghost? Which, in said young mage's mind should have been fucking /awesome/ but ended up being suicide inducing boring.

I love Iris but her thought processes are honestly terrifying, and I /created/ her.
