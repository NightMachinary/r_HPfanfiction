Working for a narcissist who spends more effort to displace blame for his own mistakes then he actually puts into fixing said mistakes is tiring. I've been awake since 1 AM and have been sipping wine while watching gen:LOCK over again, then I got bored and felt compelled to write and then didn't know what to write.

It's a thing.

Regardless, I'll be ok soon since I'm looking for a new job. Thanks for asking ^_^
