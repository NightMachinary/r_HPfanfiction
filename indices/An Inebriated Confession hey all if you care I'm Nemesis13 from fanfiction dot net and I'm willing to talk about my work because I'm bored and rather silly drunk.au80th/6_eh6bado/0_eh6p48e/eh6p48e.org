Through the Looking Glass was a surprise for me, I just kinda wrote what came to mind and it ended up being one of my most followed stories over night which, don't get me wrong, is awesome, but I had never written an outline for it so I kinda stymied myself on how to progress it.

Ted and Lucius in A Life Twice lived kinda serve as the 'straight men' to all the chaos around them rather well don't they? As for when it'll be updated, whenever the muse strikes, which is hopefully soon because I adore that story.
