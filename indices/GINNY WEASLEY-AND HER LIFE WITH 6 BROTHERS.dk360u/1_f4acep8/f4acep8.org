Hi, I like your story (and having a fourteen-year old daughter, I can appreciate how much work it must be to write it), but I am kind of lost in terms of plot. Let me present you my theory of A and B (originally [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/ceiyfj/the_character_development_of_ginny_weasley/][here]], then expanded and rewritten on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][my blog]]).

Tell me, please, what is the point A and point B of your story? Where does Ginny moves from and where is headed to? That is, in my opinion, the only thing we as readers care for. What do we have? I am afraid I just see couple of not completely related images (how does first two or how many chapters even fit in the rest?).

Also, even if you want to make a romantic story (take some classic one, e.g., “When Harry Met Sally”) we have to have some doubts and questions whether they kiss in the end or not, they have to at least make such mess of their relationship that readers/viewers could have reasons not to be certain main characters would be able to get it together (see Harry and Sally). Here? I don't think there is one reader who has a second of confusion whether Fred and Hermione will get together.
