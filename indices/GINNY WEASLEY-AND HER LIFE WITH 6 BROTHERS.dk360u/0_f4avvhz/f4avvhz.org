Hey, as somebody who's been thirteen and writing fanfic, the last thing you should do is advertise you are such and that people have given unkind criticism. It's sort of a beacon to all those with unkind intentions that you are an easy target to troll that will get them the rise they want from somebody.

On a second note, It's not fair, but you are going to have to learn that not everyone is going to critique kindly and some will be just downright insulting when they don't like/agree with something. How to handle that is to ignore the worst of it and if you do feel very compelled to reply, but are upset, give yourself a few hours, maybe even 24 to cool down and think it through before you reply.

Lastly, if you're looking for people to comment on your story, I would suggest posting on more than just Wattpad. Most older audiences (which HP is slowly becoming) do not like it and prefer to read on either AO3 or FF. FF is older and does not support images in their stories, so you would have to take them out and beef up your story with some actual description a bit, but AO3 would allow for you to keep your images. AO3 makes you wait for an invite typically before you can have an account, but if you'd like, I have several invites I could share to help you bypass the wait.
