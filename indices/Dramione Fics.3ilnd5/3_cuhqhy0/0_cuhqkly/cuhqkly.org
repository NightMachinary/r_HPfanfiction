  Hermione is a Veela. Draco is her mate. Welp, it's time to drown in booze and carry on with her life. That pale haired elitist surely won't mate with a mudblood like her. Warning: Depicts your favorite characters as Adults in their early 20s.

  "Granger, you need to be more careful," His voice was quiet, but not in a menacing way...it almost sounded...gentle.' In their final year at Hogwarts, Hermione Granger is delighted to be awarded the position of Head Girl, but when she finds out Draco Malfoy is Head Boy she has much more to worry about than the ever nearing war.

  After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater responsible for her capture in the first place. COMPLETE.

  Rescue can come in many different forms and appear in the most unlikely of places. Hermione's saviour is the only thing keeping her from losing herself after she was left behind at the Manor. Can she do the same, when a familiar stranger needs her help? And will she take his help in return? Rated M for distressing scenes, violence and possible later language. Eventual DraMione.

  “How does it feel? When she thanks you for saving her life?” Blaise said. Draco's face twisted, mimicking the tightening of his chest. "Like hell.” Draco said. “Maybe you've got a heart after all” Blaise whispered. “That makes one of us.” Draco returned.
