  For that was the one mystery left after the war: what had happened to Hermione Granger. She had been there by Potter's side all throughout the battle. Then after it was over she disappeared. No one could find her. No one knew where she was. Draco Malfoy hadn't even thought about Hermione Granger in years, until one day when he was given no other choice.

  Draco Malfoy thought that he had escaped his past by moving to muggle America. After a run-in at the local bar, he isn't so sure anymore. 'His Death Eater days were long over. And then here came Granger, marching into his supposed to be 'relaxing' lunch, a dark mark on her arm and a mysterious little boy to match.' AU T for swearing and violence

  First he lets my head rest on his shoulder. Next he starts borrowing my books. Then he decides to go to Hogsmead with me. Then he blames me for what Ron did, but he also makes sure that I don't lose my prefect badge for attacking Ron. And next thing I know, he's hanging out with me; A Mudblood. I swear there's something wrong with Malfoy this year. (re-written a bit. Plot the same)
