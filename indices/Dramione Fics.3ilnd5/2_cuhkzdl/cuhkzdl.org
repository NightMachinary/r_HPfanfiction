It's been a few years since I read these, but I had them in a list of recs/a favorites folder I used to use, so I must have liked them. I don't read much Dramione anymore.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] was definitely my favorite at that time. I should get around to rereading it at some point...
