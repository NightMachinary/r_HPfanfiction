  The Dark Lord's rules were harsh, but she found safety in Draco's care. She knew her place. However, Hermione always knew that the rules of the game could change. What she didn't understand was how much it would affect her when she found herself playing a new game, on a new board. Now she's lost, and afraid the game will be lost as well.
