  Birds should be watched and not kept, but Draco never was one to obey rules. It's their sixth year. Draco still hates Hermione, but finds he's becoming obsessed with her."Have you ever read any of those fairytale books as a child?" He didn't wait for her to answer. "The dragons always hoard beautiful things like gems and gold and princesses. Well, pet," he said, leaning in closer still, brushing his lips against hers as he spoke, "you're my princess."

  Sequel to His Little Bird. He's waited for months while she's slipped out of his sight, but now she's back at Hogwarts, and Draco Malfoy will stop at nothing to claim his ultimate possession.

  #+begin_example
      It is the sequel to His Little Bird\. If you haven't read that yet and want a little backstory I suggest you go read that first\. This story is really dark\. Take a quick peep at the tags before you continue\-I won't put up any more warnings\. All pertaining to the world of Harry Potter belongs to JK Rowling\. The plot is my idea\.

  Draco awakens to find himself in an unfamiliar place, having apparently committed an unspeakable crime, with no wand, and no memory of how he got there. Will he save his victim from certain death, or will he be the heartless killer everyone has believed him to be? Nominated for "Best Multi-Chapter Story" in the Deathly Hallows Awards - December 2010. Please note that this work is NOT for the faint of heart. Very dark.
