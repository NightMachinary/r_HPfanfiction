#+begin_quote
  Widowed Hermione takes a post at a newly opened wizarding school, expecting eighteen-year-old Scorpius Malfoy will be her most troublesome student. What she doesn't expect is to feel a spark when she meets Draco for the first time since Hogwart's, or that both Malfoys would complicate her life-and her heart-quite so much. A dark, erotic tale of romantic drama.

  #+begin_example
      1\. Hermione goes by her maiden name, there is an in\-story reason for this\.2\. The Dumbledore Institute is a very specific facility, offering scholastic redemption to those who completed their term at Hogwarts with less\-than\-stellar grades\.3\. As stated in the summary, this is a dark romantic \(yes, and erotic\) drama, as such it may explore aspects of human emotion which may make some readers uncomfortable\.\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-DISCLAIMER: I don't own Harry Potter, or any affiliated characters, and make no money off this story\.

  When Hermione is forced to seek shelter in the last place anyone would look, she finds herself drawn to Draco & becomes the unwitting muse behind a habit Lucius won't admit to having. Complicating the matter, she's forced to question her friendship with Harry. Just when hiding from a serial killer targeting muggle-borns was her biggest concern. MATURE CONTENT.

  #+begin_example
      1\)In my own, happy little world, Hermione & Ron never really worked out\. After the dust settled, they tried a relationship and decided they were better as friends\.2\) Updates to Nights may be sporadic\.3\) This fic is because as much as I love putting plot first in The Scavengers, I'm really dying for said plot to allow me to just get Draco & Hermione into bed\.Make of that statement what you will ;D\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-I purposefully chose to give Hermione the 'mudblood' scar from the movie over the line on her throat from the book, as I feel the imagery of the letters marring her flesh is more potent\.

  How it all ends. Final part of the His Little Bird Trilogy.

  #+begin_example
      Usual Disclaimer: All Harry Potter belongs to JK Rowling\. This plot is just my idea\.Final installment of the His Little Bird series in at least four parts\. These events take place a couple of months after His Persephone\. Need I remind you that this is going to be dark and angsty?
