My own headcanon is that, like the Killing Curse, it's in an old dead language (aramaic for the Killing Curse) which is why it's obscure.

So, we're looking for an ancient culture that was /really/ in to fire? Well, how about the ancient Arachosians, whose religion went on to maintain fire as a holy symbol? (We know it today as Zoroastrianism).

Fiendfyre is cast with a chanted stanza of Old Avestan. Up to you whether it's the blasphemous unleashing of Ahriman's destruction (which is suppressed as Dark Magic for very good reason) or it's a call for the holy cleansing flame of Ahura Mazda (which is called Dark Magic out of racism and/or religious bigotry, but is still wildly illegal to cast in a built-up area).
