The Fiendfyre seems to embody the destructive aspect of fire, that seems to have a mind of its own as it eats everything. That doesn't mesh that well with the benficial, purifying interpretation of fire in late Zoroastrianism. Of course we can always go with it representing fire corrupted by Angra Mainyu. I think would be more fitting to show his corruptive aspect rather than straight-up destructive.
