I've also seen Malus Ignis a few times in fics. Personally I don't care for it because a literal translation of "bad fire" doesn't seem very poetic or impressive. I could see that being the incantation of a lesser flame spell, but Fiendfire is supposed to be the highest tier; I'd want something more exotic to fit.
