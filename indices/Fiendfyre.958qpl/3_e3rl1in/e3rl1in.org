Inferni ignis = hellfire

Ignis Edax = voracious/devouring fire

I liked the movie displays of fire being breathed out by Voldemort in the Atrium battle and in a very controlled way by the Durmstrang student at the end of their arrival march. From my perspective, why have ten different fire spells when five will do -- let's say that those were examples of Fiendfyre. If so, the incantation for the spell would have to made silently, which may be part of why it's so difficult to control.
