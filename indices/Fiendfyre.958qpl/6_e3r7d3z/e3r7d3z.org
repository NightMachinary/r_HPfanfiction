Following all the other answers, I also read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729845/19/Adversity-Breeds-Excellence][here]] someone doing some kind of ritual invocation with a long spell to use Fiendfyre. Not the only place I read something like this but that's the one I remember right now.

Of course there is also the not really original "Fiendfyre" incantation.
