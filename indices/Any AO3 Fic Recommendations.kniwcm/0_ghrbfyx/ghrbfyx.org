If you haven't read them yet, check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][Turn]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599][Reparations]] & [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879624][Foundations]] by Saras_Girl. They're post-Hogwarts Drarry. I don't want to say too much about Turn and spoil the plot.. Reparations & Foundations has Harry training as a Healer doing the magical equivalent of residencies when he has to work with Draco.
