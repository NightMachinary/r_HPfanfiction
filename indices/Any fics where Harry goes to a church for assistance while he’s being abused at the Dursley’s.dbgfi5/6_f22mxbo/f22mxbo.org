There is one, but for the life of me I can't find it. If I remember, Remus starts spending time with Harry and the local priest also takes an interest in him, wanting to help him.

If I'm remembering, the Priest does a lot of outreach to the local teen community and there are Saturday night dances? Harry matures quite a bit, but all the kids are still kids, and it's a very age appropriate story. Might be the same one where he has a crush on an older girl who's trying to make her ex boyfriend jealous, or something along those lines.

I feel like this is post 4th or 5th year, and is old enough to have come out while waiting for the next book.

This ringing a bell for anyone else?
