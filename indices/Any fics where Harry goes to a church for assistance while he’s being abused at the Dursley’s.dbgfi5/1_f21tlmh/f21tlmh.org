I don't think I've heard of anything like that, no.

That's an interesting thought. I wonder how the priest would respond? The Dursleys are 'normal' which means they almost certainly go to church, but probably only for holidays like Christmas or Easter. So they likely wouldn't have had the chance to fill the priest's head with lies and he might be more sympathetic to Harry. The problem would be: if the priest does ask around he'll almost certainly start hearing those nasty stories.

This does strike me as an interesting spin though, Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles, but not flippant? Harry starts thinking maybe what he can do is miracles, not sure if he should say anything, wondering if he might be the antichrist or the second coming, friendly priest being equally confused and not sure what to do; maybe talks to his superiors that bump it up the chain until they hit someone high enough up to know about magic? Harry being a little bummed that Hogwarts doesn't even have a chapel? Hmm.... there is some christ-wank HP stuff already, so keeping it from becoming tedious would take some finesse, but as a starting point if nothing else, this has potential.
