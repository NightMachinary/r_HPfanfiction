I can't think of a punishment that is cruel enough for him. I suppose death since he was so terrified of it, but people in general aren't fond of it so there should be something more satisfying. I guess I'm as evil as he is, but it's a pity no one spotted thos tendencies of his before it was too late. I mean,'I can hurt people if they annoy me' terrifies me every time I read it, and I remember thinking there had to be some reason he became so evil. But that was before I read that chapter where he talks about how he can use his powers to punish everyone. I suppose not all psychopaths take over the government, but I can't bring myself to feel sorry for him even when he was 11. Those fanfics where he gets with someone from the good guys are a bit unsettling and I'm curious how people manage to write a convincing paring in this case, but I just can't force myself to read them. Even though I remember reading one where Luna finds that diary and writes in it. I haven't finished it, but I'm guessing they ended up together. But the first few chapters were so funny. Maybe humour is the only way to write a paring with him because it seems so scary that the only thing you can do is laugh.
