Many people /today/ come out of orphanages just fine. I doubt you've met any people who were orphans in the UK from the 1930's, when people believed things like losing both your parents was a divine punishment, people could be "born evil" some kids were "born to be hanged", etc. In that time a lot of orphans just did run the streets and become thieves, kids at orphanages actually died of starvation, priests at the ones run by the church basically had their own little sex slaves, etc. They were absolute hellholes.

Also some people might lose their parents later in life. If you wound up in an orphanage at age 9 after being raised by loving parents before that, your brain pathways are already developed very differently than Tom Riddle's, who has been there since birth.

His upbringing absolutely does not justify what he eventually became. But I think he could have been redeemed at any point before he actually killed a person.
