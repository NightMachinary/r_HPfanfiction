  And if you do time travel, remember! It has to be before he fucks with the orphans minds and kills their pets just for shits, so yeah.

I don't think it does. Kids don't get charged as adults when they commit crimes because their developing brains don't realize all the implications of what they're doing in most cases. Yeah, young Tom is a disturbed kid, but there's nothing saying he killed that rabbit and fucked with those kids "just for shits".

So, as I understand it, antisocial personality disorder happens due to brain damage. Damage can happen in the womb during brain development, it can result from head trauma, or it can occur from lack of proper development of brain pathways due to abuse and neglect during childhood. But it isn't a done thing to diagnose a child with it until at least 15 years of age, and that's because, with proper intervention, personality can be changed.

Orphanages were pretty fucked up during the 1930's, y'know? So let's say Tom Riddle is fucked up due to that and not a birth defect or head trauma. He was probably neglected, underfed, bullied and maybe abused as a young child, and he acted out and hurt people and animals just like he'd been hurt. If he'd been shown another way and put in a situation where someone loved him and was able to devote time to only him and he wasn't in competition with other children for the basics of survival, he very likely would have been able to develop some empathy.
