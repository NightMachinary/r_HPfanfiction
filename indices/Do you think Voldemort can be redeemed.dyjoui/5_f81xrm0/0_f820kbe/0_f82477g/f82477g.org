Also there was the war in the muggle world to consider. I mean he was born in what 1930? So he was a child when that whole thing started. Just imagine growing up there. The innate fear in everyone would have been very high, food supplies low and more children being orphaned every day. People lash out in those sorts of environment, especially if they had been picked on from a young age for being "strange". Sure Harry turned out different, but everyone acts different even in similar circumstances. Also I can totally imagine an orphanage being into the religious stuff in that time and trying to exorcise him for any accidental magic he might have shown.

And then he discovers the magical world and is then told he cannot stay there (where it is save) during summer, but has to go back to the orphange, during a time where bombs fell on London (which started in 1940). That would have to be horrible! I imagine that is also where his fear of death comes from.
