One thing to recognise is that redeeming Voldemort requires he be punished. Perhaps even killed for his crimes. But that's fine, because we already have plot mechanisms in place for this.

Horcruxes can only be reabsorbed into the body, and the souls restored, if the person feels genuine guilt for the murder that split it. There is a story to be written about a Voldemort who, for whatever reason, feels guilt and regret. Perhaps a greater evil could exist which he has to destroy, which ends up giving him perspective. Eventually, when his souls is restored and this greater threat destroyed, he could face his greatest fear, death, execution for his crimes willingly. Because what is guilt without acceptance of the consequences?

That in my mind is the way Voldemort can be redeemed partially. It would be so interesting to see this Voldemort interact with those he has wronged, and face justice willingly. How would Harry react if Voldemort was actually sorry? How would Hermione and Ron?
