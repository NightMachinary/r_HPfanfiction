At the point the books start? No. At the time he goes to Hogwarts? Yeah, sure. Kids are right bastards, him offing a pet of another kid or inflicting pain upon others (implicitly for some reason or without much of an understanding, few kids are really thoughtful about what it is they're doing) isn't a marking of a saint, but it isn't a point at which you should condemn someone for eternity.

While there is no cure for being a psychopath, i'm pretty sure people like that can become semi-well adjusted and not go into a murderhobo lifestyle, and if they get off of torturing rabbits in their basement... well, it's awful, but better than going on a genocidal rampage and not yet worthy of some capital punishment.
