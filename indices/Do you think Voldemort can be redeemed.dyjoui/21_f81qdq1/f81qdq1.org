/Ahem/

First of all, you seem to have a tiny fact wrong.

It is widely accepted that Tom was bullied in the orphanage, so he struck back the only way he knew - hard.

The environment of orphanages at that time also helps children develop cruelty.

I would redeem him quite easily - he's insane.

Insane people tend to not go to prison for their crimes for a reason.

So all I have to do is restore his sanity (and soul) and he becomes that much more decent.

I don't downvote pairings that the others like, because those pairings are fine, long as it isn't zoophilia or something, and even then, only if the person is serious about liking animals that way.

Back to the topic - he may change while in Limbo, of course, and then go and redo it or be ressurected.
