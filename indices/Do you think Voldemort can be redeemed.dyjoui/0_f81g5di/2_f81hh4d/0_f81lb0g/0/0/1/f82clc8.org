I'm writing a fem!Riddle fic centred on the diary, and yeah, it's hard. Ultimately, I recognise that a total redemption would be impossible, so I'm trying to give her more depth to her actions while not attempting to say that she isn't a bad person. Sure, she has done terrible things, and no matter how much she was pushed in that direction, she's still the one who ultimately chose to do those things, no matter her justifications.

Then again, this will be a darker fic that won't leave Harry with clean hands by the time it finishes, so Riddle having one death on her hands is relatively tame by comparison.
