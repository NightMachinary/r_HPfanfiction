  The thing which makes Riddle rather irredeemable is that he (or she in your case) is de-facto victim-blaming his father for getting raped by his mother and then not only goes on to murder him, but his grandparents as well.

I've read a few fics which handle that confrontation well by interpreting it differently.

In those cases Riddle Jr. /doesn't/ blame his father for abandoning him/his mother before birth. Instead, at that moment he's focused on the crushing disappointment of both branches of his family not living up to his dreams, and perhaps even worse, both of them writing him off as worthless as soon as they meet him. He's an orphan who's fixated on the idea of proving himself better than the situation he was trapped in by birth, so it's easy to imagine that a moment of callous dismissal by his rich family could have pushed him over the edge. In many cases the fic authors depict the murder of the Riddles as a crime of passion after Tom's father insults him and/or attempts to shoot him in fear after realizing he is like Merope.

Point being, there are believable reasons for Tom to have killed the Riddles that don't require victim-blaming or premeditated murder.
