The thing which makes Riddle rather irredeemable is that he (or she in your case) is de-facto victim-blaming his father for getting raped by his mother and then not only goes on to murder him, but his grandparents as well.

I feel like the one way you could MAYBE resolve that issue is that diary Riddle regrets the murders when she finds out the truth about her mother's "seduction" methods.
