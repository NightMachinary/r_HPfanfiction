I'm drawing inspiration from Limpieza de Sangre and having her kill her father in an act of self-defence after he tried to shoot her. The man had a pathological fear of magic from his bad experience with Merope and didn't react well to her showing up on his doorstep. Riddle doesn't hate her father because he left her mother; she hates him because he refused to accept his daughter for being magical.

That doesn't change the fact that she used the killing curse on his whole family, even if it was done in a fit of rage, and even if there were compounding factors that I've yet to mention in my story
