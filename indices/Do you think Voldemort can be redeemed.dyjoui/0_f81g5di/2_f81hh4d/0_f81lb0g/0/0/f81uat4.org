The closest you can come would be Diary!Riddle, but even then you need to somehow resolve the fact that, at this point, he has 1 cold-blooded murder (the Horcrux itself), and needs to kill again to get a body in first place.

There's also deaging (complete deaging, including losing all mental history), but that's merely just a fancier time travel.
