Now, I don't read Tom/* ships. But I think most most of them deal with the teenage version of him, before he turned out the way he did. Before he started murdering people in cold blood, I think he's -- at least in theory -- still redeemable. Of course, it'd require a lot more work than fics probably put in, but still, it can be done at least in theory.

Either that, or the fic is some noncon dark fic, but I stay far away from these, no matter which people are involved.
