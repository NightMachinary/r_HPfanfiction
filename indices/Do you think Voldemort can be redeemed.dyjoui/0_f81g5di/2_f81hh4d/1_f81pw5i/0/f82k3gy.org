This is really the only reason. Neither this sub nor fanfic authors in general know what "abomination before god" means (and I don't mean because of slash, that's mostly fine unless it's pedophilic or tom/anyone), so they ship the guy who put his soul into a book with a boy whose parents he murdered and then tried to murder (while said boy was one year old. Think about it. he's a lil babby and ol' tom just straight up fires the spell).

Like, He's literal snake satan.

Even if you use diary version, that's a cold, psychopathic murderer who has at this point already unleashed a basilisk on a school full of children.

Like fuck
