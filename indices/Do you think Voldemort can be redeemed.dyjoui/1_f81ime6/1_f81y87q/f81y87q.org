this is mostly hc. he isn't described as a runty kid, /or/ picked on. /he/ terrorised the other children. nor is said to be picked on in slytherin. not every slytherin is a blood supremacist

  “However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.”
