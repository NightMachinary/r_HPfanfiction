  he was an orphan boy, from a time where orphanages where hell holes

  I imagine being bullied by older kids is a regular thing.

ok. but you don't establish specific characterisation by generalities. most people don't become murderers. from canon, him being bullied isn't detailed, but him bullying others /is/

  Come on, with a clearly non magical lastname like riddle there would be some hostility.
#+end_quote

maybe? but who knows what form that hostility would take. &like i said- he was already&easily more powerful than all first years even before hogwarts, &popular with the staff. he could have frightened or impressed his fellow slytherins into submission within...the first few days

&i don't see why he couldn't have passed himself off as a half-blood? how much would anyone know about his history
