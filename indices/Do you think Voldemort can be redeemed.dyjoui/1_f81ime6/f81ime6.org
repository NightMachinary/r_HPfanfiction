I would say he could be redeemed any point before his first murder.

I imagine he grew up in the orphanage and was a runty kid so was picked on until he could control his magic enough to unsure he would never be weak again

then he was sorted into slytherin where as a muggleborn orphan - it would look like that at least- he was again picked on until he learnt enough spells to stop it once again showing in toms mind that might makes right.

while I do not think he would ever be a kind hearted person I imagine if he was sorted into a house like Gryfindor or ravenclaw

he would not fall so heavily into the right makes might aspect
