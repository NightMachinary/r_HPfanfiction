I do believe it would be possible to be redeemed at any point in time. Sure, the later it is, the harder it would be, but I don't think it would ever get to the point of /impossible/.

EXCEPT -- he doesn't want to. Voldemort, Tom Riddle, he doesn't care about any of that at all. He knows he's cruel and manipulative and sadistic and a murderer and a bastard, he just doesn't consider anything about that to be a Bad Thing that needs to change.

So no, he can't be redeemed. Not because of what he's done, but because of who he is. +and I wouldn't have it any other way+

Also, I want to say something about this, but at the same time I don't want to mention it at all, so here, have a compromise: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
