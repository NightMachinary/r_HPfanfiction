I do think that redemption is possible for Tom for several reasons :

1. I don't think that Tom was a psychopath in the beginning, it is the abuse at the orphanage and slytherin house purebloods that started his psychopathology and the horcruxes destroyed definitely the rest of his psychological stability.
2. Emotions are relative not to magic, nor mind but to the soul in first instance. The trauma of splinting seven times his soul have made him unable to feel any emotion that need to be expressed all the deepness of a whole soul (Any form of Love : Philia, Storge, Eros and Agape, any positive emotion like Remorse)
3. To repair his soul , he must a at soul level feel remorse , impossible on his own. Harry and him are bound at a soul level so he could help.

- In Time travel, Prefect Tom and Harry could balance each other, Tom could be saved by being balanced against a soul with more Love to give but that could only happen with a time loop because the past has to happen.
