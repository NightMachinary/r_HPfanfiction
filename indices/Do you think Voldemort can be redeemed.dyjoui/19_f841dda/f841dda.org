The problem about Voldemort he has crossed the line long ago that he's far from able to redeemed himself, that it would take a lifetime to compensate his sins.

And even then, there will always be people who see what he was in the past than what he gave become or wish to become, a man who wish to atone his wrong doing, a man who have regrets.

Worse, he's not that great of character writting, he's pure black character, evil for the sake of evil but not that bad compare to other series character, not gray or between. Compare to better writting character like Lucius and Draco Malfroy, Petter Pettigrew, Severus Snape before he become double agent. Or great evil character from outside HP, such as Lord Shu and Tai Lung from Kung Fu Panda movie series, one man who have been spoiled to the core and end up walking on the wrong path out of rage, hatred and disappointment, other, Lord Shu who more of great example of a great character writting of pure evil, deadly, powerful character, despite being written as a Peacock and not a more badass and deadly animal like a Tiger. And yet he's more terrifying and dangerous than Tai Lung can ever become because of his intelligent of making deadly weapon from gunpowder, which is more powerful than Kung Fu until The Dragon Warrior walk in Inner Peace mode.

If I was an ff author who write about Voldemort being redeemed, I would just make him hide and run away from the wizarding world where anyone know about his wrong doing or just experience the horror first hand, and quitely without attracting unwanted attention, atone his sins somehow in someway. And somehow the MC or someone meet Tom Riddle before and after realizing he is Lord Voldemort or used to be. You get where this heading.
