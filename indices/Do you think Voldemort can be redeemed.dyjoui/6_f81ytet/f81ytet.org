So, I am going to ask you the obvious question here: What is redemption?

I am asking because honestly I don't think you get that redemption is entirely subjective. This means redemption is something everyone has a different opinion on 'what it means to be redeemed' and 'what is enough to be redeemed.' And thats not even getting into the fact that their is a big difference between if you yourself think you have been redeemed and what everyone else thinks. Redemption is a choice at the individual level, unlike by society which sets rules and requirements that serve as judicial or legal redemption. So you also ask the question of whether you are referring to whether X person thinks he is redeemed and whether he has/can be redeemed through societal definitions.

So that needs to be asked before you try and parse out morality I suppose. Perhaps a better question would be what would it take for Harry to think Voldemort was redeemed, as that seems to be what you are really on about here.
