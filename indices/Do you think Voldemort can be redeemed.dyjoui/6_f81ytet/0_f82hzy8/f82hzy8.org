Honestly I personally believe everyone can be redeemed but I've noticed as a newcomer to this SUB that the people here disagree vehemently.

Which is stupid, if Voldemort wants to redeem himself and be a better person than he should, but on a level others will not.

I dont think Harry hates Voldemort, he only fights Vildemort for his safety not over the fact that his parents were murdered. To me this implies that Harry doesn't hold any attachment to Hames and Liky as he was young when it happened so he doesn't go looking for revenge but after he kills Cedric Harry has to fight.
