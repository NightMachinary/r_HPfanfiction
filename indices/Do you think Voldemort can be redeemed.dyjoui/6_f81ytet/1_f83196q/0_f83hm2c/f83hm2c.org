Wow.

*I didn't even make an argument for or against this*, merely say that your question isn't appropriately formulated/phrased. And then you went off on a rant about morality and what you think is right or wrong. Is that all you wanted with this thread? To pontificate?

Bit of advice: if you want to make people support one side or the other, don't rant and talk down to them *when you don't even know what their opinion is.*
