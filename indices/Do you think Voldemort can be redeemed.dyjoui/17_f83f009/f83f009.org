I do not care for slash, but am happy to weigh in on the exercise.

Part of Voldemort's canonical villainy was that he was incapable of love due to being conceived under the influence of a love potion ( he can't be the only one so I don't know if I buy that but the poor treatment from birth at an orphanage didn't help.

Harry's blood protection was based on the magic of love, however. Voldemort recreated himself with it making it a fundamental part of his existence.

If you want to go the 'love redeems all' route have his conscience kick in after the rebirth and make him seek atonement for his now realized crimes.
