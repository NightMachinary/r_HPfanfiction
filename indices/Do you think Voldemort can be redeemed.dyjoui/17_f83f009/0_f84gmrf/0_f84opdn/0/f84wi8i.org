It's derived from a misinterpretation of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ceo0r7/i_remember_reading_somewhere_that_jk_said_that/][something she said]], so in fact word of god doesn't support the idea either.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's an interesting idea to explore in fanfiction and can make for a great story, but it is definitely fanon.
