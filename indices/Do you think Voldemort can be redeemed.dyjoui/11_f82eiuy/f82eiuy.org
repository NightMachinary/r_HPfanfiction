I enjoy Tom/Harry fics, but I actually dislike it when the fics try and redeem him. Any redemption of Tom feels sloppy, lazy, or half-hearted, because Voldemort is a fucked up monster. Frankly, the sheer fucked-up-ness of the situation is the real appeal of Tom/Harry fics. Attempting to half-heartedly redeem Voldemort ruins that.
