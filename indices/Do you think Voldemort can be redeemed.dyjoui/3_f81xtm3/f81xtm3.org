No, I don't think Voldemort can be redeemed. But then time travel is a thing. AU is a thing. Magic is a thing. What I do think is that this sub needs to lay off on the shaming. Y'all are taking all the magic out of the fandom.

I think this sub has gotten into a very, very bad habit of assigning moral values to fannish preferences. While I'm not a tomarry fan unless it's time travel or very, very au, in which case he's just a handsome, charismatic, amoral OC with a recognisable backstory; the very fact that Dexter and Hannibal exist should show you the way evil is so easily found sexy so very, very often even in the mainstream media.

The actor who played young!Tom is very good looking, and in the kind of fics you're talking about, they tend to make Harry evil anyway. Evil characters are fun. Portraying evi as protagonists or as less evil, or as their evil mattering less because they're pretty, is neither new, nor unique to this fandom. In case you haven't noticed, Bellatrix gets the exact same treatment, and she's exactly as bad as Voldy is. Yet nobody protests pairing Harry with her, post-azkaban murderous psychopathy and all, half as vehemently as they do Harrymort. She's not any less vile than him just because he's the official villain and has been around the block a while longer.
