I hate that trope. This is the magical equivalent of "go back to kill baby Hitler", and for some reason killing Hitler as a child is commonly accepted as "has to be done to save millions" because "the danger is too great", but "kill magical Hitler as a baby" is out of the question for some reason. And before anyone points out the resulting lack of conflict, there is still that dark wizard called Grindelwald who comes very close to conquering Europe (and has implied ties to the Nazis). He is more than enough challenge after you dispose of baby Voldemort.
