Benefits of Old Laws was a half decent redemption fic that I think has finished since I last read it. The basic premise is that destroying the diary returned a big chunk of Tom's soul, which he started to feel after Harry escaped the graveyard. I liked it, but I didn't feel like he could ever reach complete redemption within the span of a year or two that the story sold. Still a decent story.
