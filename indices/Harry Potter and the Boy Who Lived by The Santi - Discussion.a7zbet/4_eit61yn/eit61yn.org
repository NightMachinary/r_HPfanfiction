I too just finished my first fanfic read, which was the boy who lived and also feel some sort of dissatisfaction where the story left off. What I feel made me love this story was something the original story didn't dive into details about. With the addition of "end of year projects" and the focus on power at drumstrang, we finally get a wizard school story that is focused more or less on learning magic. Exploring wand movements, advanced charms and spells, dueling stances and habits, and even the use of occulomency vastly opens this world up to be so damn enjoyable in a way the original story lacked.

​

Either way just my 2 cents, I really wish someone that was in cahoots with the author that knew the direction of the story would take over or give an outline so osmeone else can take over. The abandoning of this story right when it should have picked up (revival of voldy at the end of the TWT) is such a disservice. But the person that picks it up needs to do the research into advanced magic to be able to write and keep Harry's progression believable and interesting.

​

As for your two main questions: Nathan becoming the BWL, I highly doubt it will be due to chance. I may be wrong, but didn't they mention voldy killed the grandparents that were taking care of the boys? Maybe they can instill the sacrificial love.

​

Secondly, I believe something happens to Calypso to turn Harry dark. The whole point of Voldy sending harry to drumstrang was so he can be educated to become a strong Death Eater later on in life. What I believe happens is Calypso will be used in someway to turn Harry against the people he loves. Wether he does it by choice in regret, or by losing it through her death at the hands of a weasley (whom his brother will defend as Ron has been used over and over as someone who comes between nathan and harry) and the turning will start at that point. My only issue with it is Harry is looked down on as being a half-blood by all the pure blood Death Eaters.
