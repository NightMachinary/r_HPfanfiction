I don't know about Romulus, actually. What would the point even be? The vibe I always got from him was just using Harry to get at Nathan, and failing that just hitch his daughter to an overly powerful and well connected wizard for political convenience and general light side espionage.

Regardless, as far as I've read the story (I actually didn't know there were other chapters outside ffnet until this thread) Calypso seems far closer to turning against her father than Harry is. Even Fawkes gave his (tentative) approval to her character.
