My understanding that harry would be dark but not evil. One thing that is unfailing thoughout the fic is the love the Potter family has for each other and I can't really see a situation that isn't completely contrived breaking that apart. I always saw harry using his power to protect his family and brother even at the expense of his reputation among wizarding Britain.
