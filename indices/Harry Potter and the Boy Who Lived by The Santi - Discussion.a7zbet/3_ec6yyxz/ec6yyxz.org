This story is a mess. I feel like the author wrote themselves into a corner with all the knowledge escalation, not to mention literally wasting everyone's time with all the age line nonsense. Lets add in the poorly written character interactions with everyone who isn't Victor and Calypso, and lets not forget that the fan-favorite Calypso Rosier herself is essentially stolen from the fic "The Black Heir," since, yep, you've guess it, it's a Durmstrang!Harry fic as well.
