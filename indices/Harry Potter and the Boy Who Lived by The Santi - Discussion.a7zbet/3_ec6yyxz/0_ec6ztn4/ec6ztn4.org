I haven't had a chance to read The Black Heir, I'll make sure to go check it out.

I actually think one of the author's main problems is that they didn't flesh anything out that much. Some fics spend 100k words just on the first year, and this one is at 190k or so, and already at the Yule Ball. With some more scenes and character interactions, like you said, with people who aren't Calypso and Viktor, it would be a lot more cohesive.

The age line was stupid because if the cup actually does judge champions how Dumbledore said it does, then Harry should be the top pick (between being underage, his thirst to prove himself, and the ordeal he went through to actually get to Hogwarts). And either way, Harry should have had Viktor put his name in, and then figure out another way to put in his name himself.
