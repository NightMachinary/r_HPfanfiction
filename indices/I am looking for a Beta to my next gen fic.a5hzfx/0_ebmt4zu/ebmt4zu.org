How can a global treaty be a villain? Some sort of reverse Kyoto-protocol?

Also, if you want to go "global", you have a lot of reading up to do on 18th-century geopolitics. Assuming that the statute of secrecy went into effect in 1705, you have the 1705 borders, which means countries like Prussia, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth or the Holy Roman Empire have a magical equivalent still alive and kicking. At the same time, you have Bulgaria, which did not exist at that point, so there have to be some changes, but keep in mind that "Transilvania" is a canon nation as well, so modern borders are entirely unrealistic. Most of the border changes in Europe are the result of the Treaty of Westphalia, the Congress of Vienna, the German Unification wars in the 1860s and the world wars, none of which concern the magical population.

So basically you have to make up an alternate magical history of Europe just to cover the "direct" neighbourhood so to speak. And we haven't even talked about the "recent" Balkan conflicts, the British Empire and Asia.

Of course, there are plenty of issues just with that. If you look at Silesia, it was passed along between the "Czechs", the "Austrians", Germany and Poland (after the second world war). So the local magical population (at least the established purebloods) are either Austrian or Prussian, with a few Bohemians thrown in between. And you have Polish Muggleborns growing up and being told that their arch enemies (minus Russia) are now ruling over them and the entire education and bureaucracy is in German/Czech. And Silesia is pretty resolved right now, unlike the Balkans. You could have Bosnian kids who lost their parents at Srebrenica being told that they now have to pay their taxes to the magical Serbian government, which will not go over well at all.

See why trying to make sense of Rowling's worldbuilding is an issue if you move even 500 miles from London?
