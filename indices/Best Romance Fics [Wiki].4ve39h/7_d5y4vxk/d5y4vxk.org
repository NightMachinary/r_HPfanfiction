*Magic Within, Magic Without*

*Pairing:* Ginny/Harry

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts:* This story has liberal amounts of both fluff and adventure; at heart it is a Coming of Age story for Ginny. The premise is that Harry and Ginny are targeted by Death Eaters (for reasons revealed later). The Order then sends them to live with Ginny's great-great-great-(great) Aunt. Ginny isn't too happy to be stuck in the middle of nowhere with Great Aunt and Harry.

What makes this story is its setting, along with its writing and humor. There's Ginny teaching a Jarvey swear words, an anxiety clock that chimes in with a new worry every hour and beautiful meteor showers at night. The setting is /magical/, reminiscent of the early chapters of Philosopher's Stone when Harry first enters the magical world.

All in all, highly recommended.
