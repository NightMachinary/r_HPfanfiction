Title: The Fallout

Link: It's not posted on ff.net, only Dramione.org [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1]]

Author: Everythursday or Sage

Pairing: Hermione/Draco

Status: Complete

Description: Hermione learns about growing up through the redemption of Draco Malfoy.

This fic takes place right after book 6 over years as a war rages on. The writing is fantastic and every single character is spot on. The love and romance part isn't a major part at first, but is a slow glorious buildup as these characters grow and change and one of the most realistic romances ive ever read as Draco and Hermione deal with loss, fear, love and redemption together. My favorite aspect of this story is it treats all of the characters like they are human beings and not 2D beings and stereotypes.

Check into it even if you're not a H/Dr fan for thr author's hyper realistic take of war and it's effect on children.

Edit: grammar and added link
