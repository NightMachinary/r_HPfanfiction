UNFINISHED BUSINESS

Linkffn(unfinished business by Ramos)

Hermione Granger / Severus Snape

Complete

Another gem written pre-HBP. The relationship is quite unique here, due to the fact that Hermione dies in the opening paragraphs of the story. Hermione's ghost returns and haunts the potions classroom, and together Severus and Hermione try to come up with a war-winning plan for the Order. Five out of five broken hearts.
