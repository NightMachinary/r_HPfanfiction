Behind Blue Eyes

Link: linkffn(2095661)

Pairing: Harry/OC

Status: Completed

Thoughts: This by far my favorite Harry/OC. The author does the genre right by not having them fall in love in the first chapter. It's a slow burn where you get to know the OC intimately and by the end it feels like she was a canon character. It also portrays the characters in a more realistic way than almost any fic. Each characters flaws are thoroughly fleshed out by the end.
