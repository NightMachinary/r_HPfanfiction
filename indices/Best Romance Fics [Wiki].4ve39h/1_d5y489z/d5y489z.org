*The Landscape of the Heart*

*Link:* linkffn(7383815)

*Pairing:* Hermione/Neville

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts:* Beautifully written story that encompasses grief and recovery, angst and humor, loss and love; all in less than 20k words. I would have loved to see more of Rose and Hugo, but what is there is damn near perfect nevertheless.
