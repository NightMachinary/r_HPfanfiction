PET PROJECT

linkffn(pet project by caeria)

Hermione Granger / Severus Snape

Complete

A beautiful slow burner (in terms of plot and also of how long it took to complete). Written pre-HBP. Based on the simple premise that Hermione notices Snape catches a lot of flak in life and wondering what she could do to make his life a little easier (not like that, you pervs).
