Seeking Ginny by Casca

Link: linkffn(Seeking Ginny)

Pairing: Harry / Ginny

Status: Complete

Thoughts About It: In my opinion, the best HPFF romance fic. The climax is outstanding and never fails to bring out strong emotion. Ginny's characterization is pre-HBP, so might seem OOC, but at the time this was written it was pretty standard. Personally, I like this characterization far better than canon post-HBP, and I think she has more depth.

Plenty of OCs which can grow tiresome, but the Harry/Ginny interaction is solid. Very little (maybe zero) action, so if that's your thing you will find this sorely lacking though I suppose that's not necessary for this thread.
