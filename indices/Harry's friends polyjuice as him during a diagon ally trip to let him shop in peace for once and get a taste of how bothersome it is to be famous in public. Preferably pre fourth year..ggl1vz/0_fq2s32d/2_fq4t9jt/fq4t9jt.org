Thank you for that, seriously. Just say Harry threw away Dudley's old hand me downs and bought some new clothes, spent the rest of the time hanging out with his friends, and maybe got ice cream. We don't huge paragraphs describing each and every piece of clothing, or each and every magical item that won't be relevant to the actual story.
