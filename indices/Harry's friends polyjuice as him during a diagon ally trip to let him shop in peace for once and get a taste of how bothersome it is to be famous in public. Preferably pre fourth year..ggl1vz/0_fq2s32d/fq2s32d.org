In the story I'm writing that's literally every shopping trip cause the main character is a bit overly paranoid. But most of the shopping trips are skipped over and summarized in a single paragraph because very little of importance happens and I don't want to spend five chapters talking about every detail of the super awesomeâ„¢ luggage with built-in five-star apartment.
