Dam, that website has huge access ability issues as I'm blind and I can't download it, I love on the corner I read it on FF.net, so I bet that one is amazing. Do you know if you have to download it on laptop or should it work on a phone? It's just not working for me. Give me a few and I'll get a whole list written out for you, would you prefer every link to the thick that I recommend? Or would the author and title be okay? They will all be on FF.net
