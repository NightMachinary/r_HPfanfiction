Wow, thank you very much. I'm going to trust your tastes then and feast on all these fanfictions. Snily's I had already recommended it to my brother, but Lily is my least favorite character in the whole saga, however I think I should give it a try.

P.S. You really have to look for a way that you can read "self preservation", it really is quite good and one of those few fanfiction that really manages to reach your heart. And if the problem is the format, you could also change it to pdf.
