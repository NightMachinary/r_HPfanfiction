Obscura Nox Animae, by Heatherlly. It is finished, incredibly long and well written, although it might not be everybody's cup of tea. It's a Snily but not cliche, it's hard to explain so I think you best look this one up if you are interested. Always in your shadow, by Arinus. A very good and well written Snape's daughter fanfic, it works, I usually don't like things like this but it was great. It's completed too.

Harry Potter and the battle of wills, by Jocelyn. Harry Potter and the enemy within, by Theowyn of HPG. What's Owed, by ruth7019. Moment of impact, by Suite Sambo. Visions of sugarplums danced in their heads, by fawkesfeathers. O Mine Enemy, by Kirby Lane. A very long ongoing, steady updates every two weeks. Incredibly well written, quite slow, Snape mentors Harry and there's a lot on mind magic which is great. I love it. Unfortunately Harry is about 15 here, but it's still really great.

crime and punishment, by mlocatis. Another Snape mentors Harry, very very well written and well structured, not finished, updates are sporadical, but recent so it's not officially abandoned or anything like that. It's definitely worth a read if it's your type of thing. This author writes a lot of Snape mentors Harry, I am reading one at the moment that will probably be up your street by the same author called Snape's promise.

Have you heard of an author called Snapegirlkmf, there are a lot of her fics that have young Harry raised by Snape, although I do feel that he is a little bit more out of character, Snape that is. There is also a great one called bond by Crystal Cove too. Hope this helps.
