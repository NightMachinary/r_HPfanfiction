Well you can download it both on your computer and on your cell phone, since you can use an Epub application, such as cool reader, which I think is one of the most complete.

For the fanfics I would like some where Harry was less than 11 years old, that is, before he entered Hogwarts. Since I think he can get on better with Snape that way, at least that's how it was in Self Preservation. Severus had to adopt little Harry, and it turned into a beautiful Father / Son relationship. And so far I have not found another fanfiction that fills my heart like that. And be fine just with the title and the author.

Thank you!
