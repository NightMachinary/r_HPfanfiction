Linkffn(A New Place to Stay by Debstheslytherinsnapefan)

This story is by far my favorite. I re-read it a lot because it is amazing. Also completed, so no need to worry about new chapters, etc.

Edit: Not sure if it has the tenderness you are looking for but it does stay in character with their canon selves for the most part
