Next year I'm going to go to Pigfarts Potter. It's the school on Mars, Hogwarts is nothing compared to Pigfarts. Our Headmaster Rumbleroar is a lion- that talks. If you're good enough,, he might even let you ride him. We only accept the finest students who own rocketships. So do you have a rocketship, hmm Rocketship Potter?
