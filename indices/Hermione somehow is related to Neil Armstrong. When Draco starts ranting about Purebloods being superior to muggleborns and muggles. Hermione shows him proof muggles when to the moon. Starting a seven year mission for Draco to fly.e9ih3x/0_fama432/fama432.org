Returning from Christmas vacation second year had Hermione staring at her trunk nervously, constantly checking to make sure it was still there.

It had not been an easy task but she had managed to get her proof. She had found all the right spells used for providence. Still she was going to have Professor Sinistra do a presentation over it.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Draco sat there stunned as the astronomy teacher continued her speech with the mud mudblood Granger.

A Moon Rock, from the Moon. Gathered by Muggles over 22 years ago! Draco refused to believe muggles had done something so great that wizards had yet to do.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Draco was trying to calm himself down as he read the book the mudblood had given him. There was no air above the Earth. The sun was bright enough to blind you in seconds. It was hot enough to boil your insides in minutes. Oh that was if you didn't explode first from some bloody scary thing called explosive decompression! Or freeze!

Muggles where bleeding insane they were. They found out all this stuff the hard way and said, sure let's keep doing this until we get it right!

As if that wasn't bad enough there was talk in this book about building a big house up there!

No! Wizards would not fall behind muggles in learning the secrets of the heavens! Wizards would rule space!

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

"Granger! We need to talk!"

Draco had been studying mathematics heavily after learning how much was needed to know the dangers of space.

For the last two years he had been getting more books from Granger about the science of space.

"Honestly Draco you don't have to hide you're learning Muggle Sciences. Before you ask yes here, I have the books for you."

Hermione was glad Draco had moved well past being a pureblood muggle hater. He still kept it secret though, he did not want to be labeled a blood traitor in the snake den.

"Yes, yes, we've had this talk Granger. Still I also have some advice for Potter. Let him know they are bringing in four nesting mother dragons for the first task. He has to get a special egg from the nest."

Hermione's eyes widen and she rambled off a thanks to Draco before rushing off.

Hermione was fairly tolerable and she cared for Potter. It was no harm for him to help her some.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

"Lucius where is your son?"

Voldemort had been wanting to brand the boy this summer and get him to working for him.

"My Lord, he is at some island he bought a few years ago. He's been building some strange artifact that he claims will launch wizards far and above the muggles."

"I honestly know little of it but he seems sure it will be a project that will be spoken of for millenia."

Voldemort had no clue anyone of Malfoys line could be so ambitious. Well he would find out more later about this project and see if it was as amazing as it seemed.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

December 30, 1999

Draco grinned like a total loon. Looking across from him his two best friends grinned with him.

Hermione had become a close confidant over the years. When Harry had won the Tri-Wizard tournament Hermione and Draco had talked about using the Galleons to fund their project even further.

Harry had done them one better. He had thrown most of his families remaining fortune into the project after learning of it.

Between Draco's scientific knowledge, Hermiones spell-crafting and Harry's casting power it had came together much sooner than Draco had dreamed of.

The Vessel outside dimensions were only 10 meters long and 3 meters wide. A cylinder absolutely brimming with spellwork.

The inside was nearly large enough to hold Malfoy Manor and attached grounds.

Magical sensors, bedrooms, lounges and a library were just a few of the accommodations available. After all they were Wizards, not silly muggles all cramped together in a box.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

It had taken two months of extensive work under powerful hiding charms but it was finished! The first building was done.

Muggles went to the moon and never returned. Draco would build a city on Mars! The Vanishing Control room was linked to the other one one Earth. Instant travel!

Wizards would own the stars before Muggles made it past the moon again!

OOOOOOOOOOOO

Across the stars the live feed from the ceremony played as millions wept as a hero was interred.

"Today we mark the passing of the last of the Great Three. Draco Malfoy now lays to rest in the soil of his first true home. Here 800 light years from Earth where they found themselves this unspoiled magical planet."

"Declared a magical preserve here he will rest his bones as the grand work he started into the stars continues. I have only this quote to give from him."

"We are magic, we are children of the stars. Go forth children of the stars, feel the heartbeat of the cosmos. Sing in the starlight and dance in the darkness of space. Go forth children of the stars, for we are magic."
