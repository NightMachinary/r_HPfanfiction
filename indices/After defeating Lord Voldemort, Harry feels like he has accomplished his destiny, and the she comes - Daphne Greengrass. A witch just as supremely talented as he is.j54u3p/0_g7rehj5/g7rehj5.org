Great, everything people hate in a fanfiction but more over the top. Super powerfull, ultra talented haphne, trained by albus "I have three full time job but yeah let me train you enough so you become akin to a God" Dumbledore, jerkass "if you're not good enough we can't be friend" Grey Lordiest Lordeth of Lords Potter.

Ok, maybe not the lord part but this one is obviously underlined.

Short is, you want a powerwank fic with unlikable OP protagonists. With sparks of Mary Sueness.
