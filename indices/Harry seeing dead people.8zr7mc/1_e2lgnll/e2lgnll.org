You might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12869153/1/Resurrect-The-Living][Resurrect the Living]]. It's a relatively new fic (first published 4 months ago, 15 chapters so far and ongoing).

After the war, Harry begins to see dead people everywhere (a la /The Sixth Sense/.) He tries to ignore the problem, but over time the violently dead seem to be more and more drawn to his presence. Turns out being "Master" of the Hallows is more of a curse than anything. With the help of his friends Harry searches for a solution, but he can't help feeling that time is running out.
