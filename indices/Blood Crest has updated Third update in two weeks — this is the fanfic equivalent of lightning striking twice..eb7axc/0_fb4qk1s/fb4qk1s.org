Blood Crest is a wonderful fic, I'm greatly enjoying it! And it does an excellent job with little tidbits that fit right into canon, like the snippet you posted. My personal favorite like that for it is earlier, when Harry is reading through his potions reference book in the train.

  Unfortunately, the book was less of a textbook than a reference. It reminded him of the /Complete Compendium of Charms/, only for Herbology. He wasn't sure if reading about magical plants in alphabetical order was the most efficient way of learning about them. All the same, he was too lazy to go through his trunk again, so he resigned himself to reading about aconite.

  He had hardly gotten through the first sentence and discovered that it was also called monkshood and wolfsbane when the door to the compartment burst open...

The reason I really like this one is that it puts Snape's little quiz on the opening day of Potions into a completely new perspective. He asks questions involving Asphodel, Bezoars, and Aconite - all three of which would basically be right at the start of the book if organized like this. So instead of being a random assortment of trick questions, it's basically like checking if the student even read the first page or two of the compendium.

In general though, the fic does a great job of fleshing out magic in a way that still feels like Harry Potter. There were some aspects that I enjoyed a little less, or that feel like they're dragging on a bit - but it's a very good one overall.
