Eh, Rowling also decided to make Ravenclaw's Diadem literally have modern English etched into it, I generally ignore anything she says about language. Or history, frankly. I do tend to believe that ghosts can absorb information just as portraits can, but I don't consider brief conversations with ghosts who are portrayed as mostly silent evidence for that fact (do we even hear the Baron speak? genuinely can't remember). I think Helena remembering her interactions with Riddle is far more compelling evidence for their ability to change over time, and I'm not convinced that's due to any unique property of Hogwarts beyond lots of forced interaction.
