You get the sense that the ghosts who stay at Hogwarts keep more of their interactive abilities over time; it's unlikely that Helena Ravenclaw or the Bloody Baron spoke anything resembling modern English since they died before 1000 AD. Somehow, they continue to adapt to the times, and I think that's because of Hogwarts.
