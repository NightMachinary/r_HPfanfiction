Ghosts (at Hogwarts and elsewhere) stay behind because they're too afraid of the unknown to properly cross into the Afterlife. For some it was a choice (though most come to regret it), for others it was involuntary --- "flinching" at the last moment. Canon doesn't explore any ways for ghosts to change their mind and move on, though I have the theory that that's the Veil's original purpose: allowing repentant ghosts to cross over "manually" if they choose to do so.

As far as we know, ghosts can choose their place of haunting, but they spontaneously manifest within the area of their death, and it's possible to magically prevent them from leaving it (which is what was eventually done to Myrtle because she was harassing one of her living bullies). She seems to be a special case, though --- the House Ghosts clearly stay at Hogwarts because they like the Castle and/or because they want to be helpful to the living as much as they still can.

They can definitely have all kinds of emotions --- Moaning Myrtle alone displays playfulness, depression (obviously), and, in the infamous Prefects' Bath scene, what does indeed seem to be lust, though it could just be inappropriate curiosity.
