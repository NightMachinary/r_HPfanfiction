Next idea: Dumbledore captures both Harry and one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, puts them in a magical artefact and lets it accelerate to 99.999...9%c. Time dilation gives everyone on Earth hundreds of thousands of years. Dumbledore and most others live a good life and die of old age, after that Voldemort spends a few millenia ruling and collects pretty much all the information there is to collect. A minor strange particle accident is caused by muggles in 5270, and Voldemort spends the next hundred thousand years as the only human in this solar system, developing his own branch of magic far surpassing anything that ever existed before. Then Harry's ship hits a speck of interstellar dust at enough speed to have energy equivalent to a supernova, and the cycle restarts.

This time Voldemort has magic he spent more time developing on than mankind has experienced since the invention of fire. Meanwhile everyone else only has one additional lifetime of experience. Voldemort enslaves everyone on Earth in a fraction of a second, then makes a hundred copies of Earth a second later. Harry is immediately put under time stasis again. Everyone else gets a small subset of Voldemort's discoveries, including immortality, and is put to work on figuring out how to break the loop. 132 million years later, Dumbledore copy #328 makes a breakthrough discovery. Voldemort double checks the theory and kills Harry, restarting the cycle.

Voldemort snaps his fingers. Instantly his Horcruxes are hidden in intergalactic space billions of lightyears away. He snaps his fingers again. Spacetime refolds itself. He snaps his fingers a third time. Harry Potter bursts into flames. The cycle does not restart. A fourth snap, and everyone else's memories of the time loop are erased.

Voldemort has billions of man-years worth of magical research in his brain. He's a god amongst mortals. And this time around he can do whatever he wants.

He strolls down Diagon Alley and buys a cone of ice cream.
