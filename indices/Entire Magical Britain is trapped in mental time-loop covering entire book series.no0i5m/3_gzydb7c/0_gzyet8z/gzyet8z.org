While at some point people would just grow apathetic to the whole situation, there is important asymmetry that would most likely prevent or severely disrupt Dumbledore and Voldemort having a chat: if Voldemort dies - entire cycle restarts, he is guaranteed to live; Dumbledore on the other hand is most valid candidate to break the loop and he gets new cycle if and only if either Harry or Voldemort die, so for him new start is not guaranteed if Voldemort kills him. So both are motivated to attack one another at the first sight.
