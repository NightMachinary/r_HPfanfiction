While existential crisis that classifies as angst is inevitable for many characters, explicit descriptions of rape are completely avoidable, in fact even the explicit mentioning of rape is avoidable. I am sure in canon DEs raped a lot of people, aside from just murdering them, but we never hear even hints about it in the books because this gruesome detail wouldn't add anything of value to the story.
