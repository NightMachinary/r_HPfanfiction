Yeah, entire world is reset, but only magical sapient beings that were in Britain at some point during the original Cycle 0 retain memories. Non-magical animals and muggles (such as Dursleys) don't retain any memories, wizards in other countries that didn't visit Britain during the series don't experience this cycle.

While centuries of memories sound maddening, in my particular treatment of time loop, characters don't suddenly get all their memories from previous time loop, more like if they read book or watched movie about their previous timeloops with all emotionally unimportant moments left out. And those characters that are too small at the beginning of the timeloop (Harry's generation) barely can recollect their revelation because this is how much toddler can comprehend and memorize, getting déjà vu when encountering certain terms, people, creature, places, objects, situations, etc.

Those individuals that are born during the cycle don't get recollection at all, because of butterfly effect they are different people each time even if produced from the same parents at the same time chances that the same gametes collide again are astronomically small.
