A while back I came up with an idea for a writing prompt, or a game concept; the idea was that a supervillain goes back in time to conquer the world, far before any superheroes have ever been born.\\
However, rather than successfully changing the timeline as he believed, this villain actually inadvertently created a parallel Earth in a pocket dimension; he ruled over this world as an immortal god-king, hoarding technology for himself and treating his subjects like slaves, but the 'real' Earth was untouched save for the supervillain disappearing from it.\\
 \\
Except not quite, because once the parallel Earth's 'timeline' reaches the point in the real Earth's timeline where the supervillain disappeared, an inadvertent merger occurs; people are shuffled between the two Earths, buildings and infrastructure are swapped over, et-cetera. For the people on parallel Earth, millions of them suddenly remember lives where they had far more advanced technology and freedom, with their god-king's monuments spontaneously being graffiti'd with mechanical instructions and unfamiliar pop culture; on the real Earth, millions are shaken by memories of servitude to a tyrannical overlord, and the Empire State Building is replaced by a way-too-big statue of a certain time-travelling supervillain.\\
 \\
I wonder if such an idea could be reused here? Voldemort tries to rewrite the timeline to his whims, only to create a parallel Britain, one that automatically rewinds in time whenever he or one of his Horcruxes is destroyed (which unfortunately includes his archnemesis Harry).\\
However, this parallel Britain has a flaw; at the point of temporal intersection, the time on real-Earth when Voldemort initiated his time-manipulating ritual (and made a parallel dimension instead), souls and matter bleed over, leading to a sudden insurrection when dozens if not hundreds of Voldemort's servants spontaneously remember what it's like to /not/ live under Voldemort.\\
...I want to come up with something-something about what happens to the temporal intersection when a horcrux is destroyed but it's getting too late at night...
