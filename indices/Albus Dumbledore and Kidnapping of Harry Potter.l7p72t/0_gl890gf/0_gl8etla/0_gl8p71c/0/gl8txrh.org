Harry doesn't start paranoid but is simply cautious: the setting seems like Middle Ages and Witch Burning might be in the vogue so might as well hide being a Wizard. Due to Dursley upbringing he understands how people might have facades as well.

Harry's true fatal flaw is loyalty. The novel shows his loyalty to Dumbledore - enough that he was willing to commit suicide via Voldemort for his plans to succeed. But Dumbledore was merely his Headmaster who was very kind to him.

Imagine a woman who is actively trying her best to seduce Harry when puberty has struck him. Imagine they having sex and the woman saying that she loves Harry. Harry would definitely be willing to sacrifice everything to help her.

You'll need a overblown, epic betrayal for Harry to get it in his head that the woman is evil.

That said, I don't think GOT has a stupid woman who would be willing to betray Harry after finding out his true ability. That's why I didn't even think about who this woman would be.
