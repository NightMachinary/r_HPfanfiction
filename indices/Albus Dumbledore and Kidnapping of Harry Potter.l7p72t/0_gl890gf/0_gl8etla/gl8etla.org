This prompt was inspired by [[/u/inquisitorcoc]] 's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dp71eu/a_harry_potter_character_is_displaced_into_a/f5t3tf2/][comment reply]] to [[/u/muleGwent][u/muleGwent]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dp71eu/a_harry_potter_character_is_displaced_into_a/][original prompt]].

If I were to write this, I wouldn't put much focus on the GoT part, since it is more or less a tragedy and focused on making Harry hate everything in the world.

Harry isn't dark/ independent, he is actually a 3rd year and has 3rd year level ability - so he is appropriately cautious and takes care not to reveal his powers as a Wizard. He hides his identity as a wizard the best he can, learns swordsmanship, always keeps fresh Bezoars at hand and transfigures a dozen knives to look like wands because his power is based on a easily breakable wooden stick.

Unfortunately his ability to lay low is not enough - his secrets are arousing to quite a few people, plus he is just 13 year old and very vulnerable to sexual wiles. That's the first tragedy.

There are other points I'd insert in to make Harry's experience in the GoT world more horrible -

1) He gets a Dragon egg and learns mental magic from it. He hatches it successfully but it dies later,

2) He learns swordsmanship but his mentor dies,

3) Another mentor taught him politics, diplomacy and such things but was secretly trying to poison him and Harry has to kill him,

4) He falls in love with a girl and she truly loves him and dies protecting him...

...You get the point right?
