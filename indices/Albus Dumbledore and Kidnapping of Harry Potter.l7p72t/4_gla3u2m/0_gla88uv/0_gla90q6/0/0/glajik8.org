That's absolutely true, but then the problem of breaking Harry in a credible way remains; the Tyrrells wouldn't think twice about having Margaery court him just for the future power it would grant their heirs, same with the Lannisters, Martells, Greyjoy, Frey etc.

To put it crudely: why risk losing a prized stallion when you can breed him with one of your mares and end up with a higher number of superior steeds? If anything there'd be a queue for the "honor" of marrying him and everyone would either want to get on his good side or kill him off as soon as possible because his magic would drastically upset the power balance between the Seven Reigns.

Then, there's the fact that his eventual children would be equally sought-after/ in danger for the same reasons.
