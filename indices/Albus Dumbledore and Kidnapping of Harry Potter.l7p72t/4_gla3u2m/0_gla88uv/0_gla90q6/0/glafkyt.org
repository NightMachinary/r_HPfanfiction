Harry finding True Love™ upon appearing in Westeros and leading her to tragedy seems a mite cliche, though.

Harry being seduced by a babe, thinking he has found True Love™ and the true start of tragedy being her betrayal seems more Game of Thrones flavor. Harry at least learns something from that.

I was originally thinking of a Dany betrayal since I can have Harry get a Dragon, learn Dragon Magic and have it die protecting Harry as well. But why would Dany take initiative seducing Harry and why the betrayal after his loyalty is confirmed? I could have Drogon convincing her that Harry's death is necessary for her rise, but it just seems wonky.
