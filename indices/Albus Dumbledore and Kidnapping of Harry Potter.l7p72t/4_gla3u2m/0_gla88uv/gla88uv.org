If I carried this further, it would have Harry join either the Starks, Baratheons or Dany. While he is hiding his magic, he can't hide how exceptional he is - and one of the beauties decides to seduce Harry. Harry's fatal flaw is loyalty and he is willing to wholeheartedly serve the seductress - until she ruthlessly betrays Harry.

The problem is that betrayal doesn't tally with any of the girl's characters.

*Stark Family:*

Catelyn would never cheat on Ned.

Arya and Sansa betraying doesn't make sense.

*Baratheons:*

Cersei shares too much with Petunia, Harry would always be wary of her.

Myrcella... I don't know much about her character but no real reason to betray Harry.

*Dany:*

Dany isn't a betrayer either, honestly. She might just go insane and try to burn Harry with Dragon Magic but Harry would forgive her coz accidental magic.
