As a writer, Rowling is great, with each of her books surpassing most authors in quality. However, her world-building is marred by her awkward transition from the kids to the young adult genre.

You go from an active protagonist to one that passively reacts to events, becomes average, when he shaping up to be rather skilled. The story doesn't need a child genius protagonist, but the laudable themes did not fit the dystopian later books.
