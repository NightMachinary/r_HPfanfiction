IMO it's that Rowling turns out to be amazing storyteller, but her skill lies mostly in the 'teller' part and not the 'story' one. When you read the books for the first times it makes you want to continue reading, you are engaged in the story and feel all the right emotions, yet if you take a closer look at it holes start to appear, and the themes of it might be something you don't agree with or even blatantly dislike (like the whole magic-jesus-harry thing).

And also i think that's the reason why HP is the one thing with the most fanfics written about it - everyone knows it and everyone liked it at some point, but the holeiness and lackluster worldbuilding let people dive into it headfirst with their own ideas and create parallel works of fiction, because the basis is rather loose and easy to mold.

Look at A song of Ice and Fire for example - it was published at similiar time, also gained immense popularity (albeit a bit later than HP), yet the amount of fanfics compared to HP is miniscule - IMO because the world is well-fleshed out with somewhat consistent story and trying to play with it the right way requires quite the effort - with HP it's basically '(almost) everything goes because magic'.
