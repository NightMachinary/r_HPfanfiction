Absolutely. People definitely forget what the best aspects of Harry Potter are, it's not because it's dark and gritty or because it has morally ambigious circumstances. What makes Harry Potter good is exactly what you have stated: it's the fun and whimsical characters, plot and magic.

There is some truly fantastic and well written Harry Potter fanfiction, but rarely are those fanfictions actually keeping to the /essence/ of Harry Potter. They aren't comparable to each other, and I enjoy them specifically sometimes because of their different take but that doesn't mean I don't adore the original canon take.

Very few books (and fanfiction) have given me greater joy to read than Harry Potter. There's a reason they are so, so popular.
