Yeah - no!

The characters in canon often behave way more stupidly than they should! Hell, Harry himself is a braindead moron in canon! He knows he has a super-powerful psychotic dark lord after him and what does he do? He slacks off, he puts chess and quidditch above his education, he choses bad electives that will not help him one bit, he avoids the library like the plague etc...seriously, I would enjoy the books more if the teachers and most main characters weren't so stupid! That includes supposedly super-smart Hermione who never figured out that Harry was abused at home (even I figured that out with people I was close to - I had two friends who came from neglectful and borderline abusive homes!) and it also includes (Mo-)Ron who never grows up...hell, neither does Hermione! For all her smarts she's often abusive (she attacks Ron with those birds for example)

Rowling crafted a beautiful world, but I prefer fanfiction over canon!
