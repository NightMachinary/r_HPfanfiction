Yes, but ... She is really a superb narrator, and especially she is great on the microlevel. Whimsical nice dialogues, various magical devices, small deficiencies of the magical world. Professor who is too tiny to be seen, so he falls constantly from the heap of books he stands on?, dark and smart professor who cannot make for himself a good shampoo?, lemon drops? some of them are I am afraid inside baseball of the British educational system we cannot comprehend from the outside. Her dialogues are always perfect (and who tried to write a longer story knows how difficult it is to write a good dialogue). But ...

1. She is not Tolkien, she was not a maniacal super-builder of the parallel universe as him. Also, it is another hint how poor idea is a serialized writing of novel. And her task was a way more complicated. It is a way more simple to write a separate parallel universe somewhere (whether Arda is our Earth of not, is immaterial here) than to build a parallel universe working inside our normal world. Magic is for her just a tool how to make her plot working, so I am persuaded that all those crazy problems (why didn't Dumbledore put an age-line in front of Fluffy?, why did he fly to London on a broom and not Apparate or Floo? etc. etc.) are just because those particular pieces of magic were not known to JKR at the time of writing PS. Also, whole category of muggle-world-collides-with-the-magical-one fanfiction (linkffn(11500936) and many others) is centred around this problem.
2. Her particular strength are those small nukes inside one line in a dialogue. I don't know about an author who would wrote stronger lines than ‘“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.', ‘“Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!”', and ‘“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!”' (any other of the similar calibre?). Whenever I read these lines, I get still a bit misty, even after the fiftieth time. However, each of these lines needs a /huge/ build-up to work, and they force some characters into a very flat and one-dimensional creatures. Ginny [[http://www.quibblo.com/quiz/huK3uTO/][practically evaporates]] from the third, the fourth, and the first half of the fifth book, just to return with this bang. Which unfortunately terribly hurts development of Hinny pairing; knight in not so shiny armour save a princess from a dragon, and then ignores her? What kind of fairy tale is it? Molly Weasley must be a meek Kinder-Küche-Kirche type of woman, which hurts depth of her story (never bashing! but I like more complicated and problematic Weasley family like in linkao3(11676102), in the similar vein, I would love to read more realistic and three-dimensional Dursley family than what we get from very unreliable abused teenager narrator; linkffn(12551744) makes at least small steps in this direction). And Kreacher must be ever negative hateful jerk, which forces JKR to make Sirius to much into jerk himself. Only in a fanfiction (was it linkao3(13143726), where Kreacher has a small garden on the terrace of 12 Grimmauld Place? no, it was linkffn(10937871)), we can get slightly more complicated and interesting character from him.
3. Some characters are ... well just not well executed. Ginny is the most famous example (whole Harmony movement is to large extent fuelled by how poorly Ginny is written); see the link above. I personally resent how terribly Dursleys' were written, and another huge discussion in the fandom is driven only how terribly Snape was written (especially, because there are two Snapes: one super negative 2D in the first few books, another snarly tragic hero in the latter ones). Poor Lavender Brown! Of course, we all have list of characters we would love to hear more about (for me it is Susan Bones, I love linkao3(2467277), Professors McGonagall and Flitwick), but that's probably not a fault of JKR, but publisher's limit on the length of the book.
