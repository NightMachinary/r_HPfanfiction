Nobody hates _______ more than _______ fans is a statement that holds true for practically every fandom. No one can pick apart Star Wars like a Star Wars nerd, and no one can rant about the plot holes of Harry Potter like a Harry Potter fan. When it comes to fanfiction though it's not just about a fan of Harry Potter, it's a fan of Harry Potter and of writing. Fanfiction creates a perfect storm of people who love Harry Potter enough to criticize it and who love Harry Potter's writing enough to criticize it too, and JK Rowling doesnt exactly hold back in giving ammunition for that.

I view the canon books the way I view Dumbledore. The books did things a shitty way a bunch and have some major issues, but they also have a massive dosage of nostalgia and emotion. Many people can love Dumbledore for who he "was" without getting caught up with the details of the actions and decisions he was written to have made. Same with Harry Potter as a whole. You can love canon and the beauty of his without getting caught up on the writing problems. But that doesn't mean that those problems aren't there and it doesn't mean those that don't look past those problems are wrong to do so either.
