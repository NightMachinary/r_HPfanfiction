I think they're pretty damn good /especially/ considering it wasn't until GOF that Rowling properly had the wherewithal and resources to stop writing them as fast as she could and with the minimum of effort and attention to detail to get everything to make sense and set up the next bit.

Of course, by then she was also hampered by what she had set up in the first few books and had red lines to work within that she couldn't retcon too heavily.

I feel like we forget - or don't take into account often enough - that unlike a lot of creators, and especially a lot of children's/YA authors, JKR wasn't coming from a place of privilege and resources, with all the time and energy she could have to make her books airtight and rock solid before pitching to publishers as her life's work. She was a young single mother who'd been left by her partner, unemployed, and living off the British equivalent of food stamps in a pretty expensive city, and Harry Potter was, she hoped, her ticket out of that. The first book was a labour of love but it was also a meal ticket, and then when it did well, she would have been pressured by the publisher and her agent to rush-release sequels while the iron was hot and before her locked down readers aged out of the cohort to still be into the story.

With that in mind she did pretty damn well I think. Sure, they might not have been perfect - but at that point /she probably didn't intend or need them to be/, as long as they got finished in time to be brushed up by an editor and put out to market. I'm sure they didn't anticipate adults going over them with a fine tooth comb two decades later.
