Honestly, my problem is that we only ever get to see this wonderful world JKR created through the eyes of someone, however strong and moral and worthy he maybe, who is myopic and unmotivated and rather oblivious. If there's any such thing as wizarding culture, we don't know much about it because Harry does not give a fuck. Not only are we, as readers, crippled by the fact that Harry just isn't curious about the things we're curious about, but also the fact that this is a protagonist that characters in the know go out of their way to keep ignorant. Harry is so busy struggling for pieces of information that are essential to his personal history and survival that he doesn't really get the chance to be excited to learn things in this new world he's found himself in. So in terms of worldbuilding there are plenty of fics that have far surpassed JKR, some of them with absolutely brilliant prose and drama and mythical heft to them.

Check out linkao3(common sense by grohiik) or anything by flamethrower on ao3. They're both slash but not slashy.
