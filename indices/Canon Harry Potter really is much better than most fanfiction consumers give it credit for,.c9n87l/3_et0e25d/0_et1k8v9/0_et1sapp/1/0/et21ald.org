Polyjuice was touched on once by a man that seemed to mimic the person so perfectly that it was impossible for even his closest friends to spot the impostor. Besides that, it was used only sparingly in Deathly Hallows: once during the Battle of the Seven Potters and once more when breaking into the Ministry and the Lestrange vault. A total of 4 times and the one time it was used as a plot point, it was revealed that it was an impostor rather than Moody Imperius (which would have been much cooler and more of a twist in my opinion). Harry seems to rarely use his Invisibility Cloak like an intelligent person and uses it to hide out rather than follow Malfoy from the Slytherin common room (where Harry knows the entrance is from being there at age 12 years old) and take down Malfoy. And Parseltongue is never touched on except for a one-off time where Ron mutters a word that sound like 'open' in Deathly Hallows. Between Chamber of Secrets and that one scene in Deathly Hallows (off-screen in the book by the way), it's never brought up again...oh wait, I'm wrong; it was brought up once by Harry commanding the locket to open before Ron stabs it.

Don't act like those things were used significantly apart from just pushing the plot along or even making people seem dumber than they are.
