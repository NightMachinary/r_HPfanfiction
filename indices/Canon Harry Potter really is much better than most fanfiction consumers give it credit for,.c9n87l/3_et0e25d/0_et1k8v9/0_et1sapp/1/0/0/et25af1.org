Look, I think you haven't read the books in a while-which fair enough I imagine most people haven't-but you are just straight up wrong on all of this. I am actually a bit lost at just how to address this because you got a lot wrong. Perhaps look at the wiki if you need a catch up rather than having to re-read? But yeah, anyway.

Harry uses the Invisibility Cloak a crazy amount, so much so it's utterly pointless to list. There just wasn't a time where he wasn't using it to get up to mischief. What do you mean 'take down Malfoy'? Harry isn't an assassin, nor is he the instigator in his conflict with Malfoy.

Polyjuice potions was introduced in the Chamber of Secrets. Which is important because in that book we learn the ingredients and it's level of difficulty (a month to make), and so when Snape reports missing Polyjuice ingredients it's meant to clue the reader into the mystery of the Goblet of Fire (I.e. Mad-eye Moody the imposter).

When Hermione steals it in Deathly Hallows they only /have/ so much and they make sure to use it quite reasonably. They use it the Battle of the Seven Potter, they use it in the Ministry, Harry and Hermione use it to hide themselves as Muggles in the graveyard and finally their last bit is used to disguise Hermione as Bellatrix Lestrange.

And as for Parseltongue, well no again. Every time they communicate with snakes is Parseltongue in the books, which is basically all Nagini scenes. It's used in the Half-Blood Prince when introducing the Gaunt family (who speak in parseltongue specifically) and Voldemort's upbringing, it's used in Deathly Hallows as an important plot point in regards to the Locket /and/ the weird creepy Nagini-Bathilda (Hermione doesn't speak parseltongue but Harry does and most importantly he doesn't /know/ he is speaking parseltongue so he didn't realise anything was up). Like I don't think you can use 'speaking to snakes' any more than it is actually used which despite your claim is quite frequent, it's most important aspect is connecting Harry to Voldemort and the dark wizard association.

Besides this, there's frequent casual mention of all these aspects even when they aren't using them.

Oh I even forgot, Malfoy uses Polyjuice himself in Half Blood Prince, Crabbe and Goyle disguise themselves as girls and warn him when someone is approaching the room of requirement.
