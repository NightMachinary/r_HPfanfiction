Yeah I think one can arguably point to elements that are underutilized plot solvers, or at least elements that are added in to solve one problem that later raise questions about previous plot points (apparition vs. Dumbledore flying all the way to the ministry).

But definitely not invisibility cloaks, polyjuice potions and parseltongue which are sort of /the/ elements of the book series. Time turners are also kind of intentionally one use, JK Rowling destroyed them in Order of the Phoenix because they are a bit /too/ convenient. Veriterserum comes up a few more times as well, but isn't too major.

And all of that isn't covered in the movies that much (and the movies probably do stick in most people's minds the most), so I can definitely see the confusion.
