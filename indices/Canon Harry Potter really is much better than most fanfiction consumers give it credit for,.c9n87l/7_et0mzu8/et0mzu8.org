I'm going to start of saying that it is perfectly fine if someone enjoys the original over everything else. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm one of those people who think that the books are fine if you just sit down and read it and not really think about it.

The characters I kind of do and don't agree. The characters she does develop through the books where pretty developed. Whether they ended up good characters in the end or not is up for debate, but she has a ton more one note characters. Outside the trio, Dumbledore, Snape, and Voldemort; almost all the other characters were pretty much given one trait and written around said trait. Towards the end, only Neville and Draco got more development, but I don't know of Draco gaining redemption through fear and stupidity is better than Neville growing to his own. Strangely enough, I think Neville grew much more as a character than Harry.

I have to disagree with you about point number 4. I find the whole Deathly Hallows and Horcruxes terribly contrived plot devices. I'm kinda thinking you are stretching it with magic rewarding people for following human values. I don't think Magic, on its own, has that kind of sentience. Its like saying god likes you for keeping to your guns therefor he's going to reward you for following the plot.

I do agree that Harry has never been shown to seek power for the sake of power so it makes sense he would give up the Elder Wand.

The Epilogue, I thought, was just a disappointment. It doesn't acknowledge anything that happens in the previous books because it was written a long time before she finished the series, which I think was a mistake. If the Epilogue occurred maybe a few years down the line instead of almost a decade and actually acknowledge the events they had gone through, I probably would have been happier.
