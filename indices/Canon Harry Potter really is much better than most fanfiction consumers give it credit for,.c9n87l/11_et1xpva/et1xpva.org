My main complaints about the canon plot is that it is doesn't stand up to scrutiny. The books are very well written, and I'd say less than 1% of fanfiction surpasses JKR's writing. The writing is top notch.

That said, there are /so many/ plot holes that needs to be addressed or explained away. Dumbledore is either a manipulative villain or massively incompetent. Everyone holds the idiot ball one or more times for plot reasons. The numbers rarely adds up, like total number of wizards, number of students, faculty, and so on.

Another problem often addressed in fanfiction is Harry's personality. He doesn't have one. He's a weak-willed follower without initiative. He never acts, only reacts, and doesn't plan or think through when he finally is forced to do something. He's definitely a Gryffindor, brave but not bright. Harry with a spine or functioning brain would go AU immediately.

The moral of the story is to be nice. Good trumps evil, but mostly by sheer dumb luck and not without heavy and unnecessary losses. The parallels between Harry and Jesus are obvious. Personal sacrifice to save others, death, and resurrection. No wonder the Christians were up in arms over the books! Except they didn't read them because witchcraft.

Pet peeve: Whoever writes fanfiction without reading the books cover-to-cover first is doing something very wrong. Too many authors base their stories on the films or other fanfiction. Spelling "stupify" or "alohamora" is a dead giveaway, so is spinning portkeys which is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/5/The-Power-of-the-Press][bobmin]] invention done for important plot reasons.
