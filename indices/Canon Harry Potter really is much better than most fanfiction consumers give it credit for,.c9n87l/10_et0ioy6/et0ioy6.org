My main complaint was that Harry was made pretty unobservant or undiscerning for plot purposes, especially in Order of the Phoenix. As an example, basic knowledge of double-agentry should have told Harry there was no way Snape could openly acknowledge the hint that he had dropped about where Sirius was, and yet he just bulled on ahead heedless of the possibility that Snape /had/ checked in on Sirius, or at least gotten Dumbledore to do it.

I did like the overall theme of an unfolding world that takes us, and Harry, deeper into it and exposes not just its bright shiny side, but its more multifaceted, complex and sometimes quite dark side as well.
