JK suffers from convenience writing.

Things happen because they need to for plot reasons, even if in the process characterisation, world consistency or logic have to suffer.

Most fanfic I read deals with smoothing over those issues and ensuring that consistency is maintained and the story follows logically, while retaining a lot of the core of canon. Naturally, that means it will often surpass canon, as it's doing half the job and the other half was already done.
