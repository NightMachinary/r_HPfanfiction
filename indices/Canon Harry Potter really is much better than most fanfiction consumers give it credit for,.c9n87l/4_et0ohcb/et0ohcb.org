The biggest problem for me has been the tell don't show By JK. We're /told/ that Voldemort was a manipulative genius, never shown it (yes, even in Slughorn's memory). We're /told/ that Hermione is smart, but other than being ahead in books, she isn't all that smart, not thinking of the many ways to use the /half thought plot devices/ introduced by Rowling.

This is what I find the most infuriating in canon. That, and the frankly stupid way of making Hinny a couple. I'm not saying that the couple can't work, I'm saying that Harry feeling a monster inside his chest is not how things work.
