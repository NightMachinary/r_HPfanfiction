My main complaints are having all Slytherins be evil and characters only thinking to move the plot along sometimes. The whole “none of Harry's friends believe that Malloy could be working for Voldemort” considering that he's known as a bigot, he threatens people with a well feared and known death eater werewolf, he's obviously a bigot, his family are supporters, etc. just seems out of character especially since Hermione goes yeah it is suspicious but he's probably just bluffing. Other than that some fanfics do have better parts than the original Harry Potter world such as for me I like it when there's more magic and there are a lot of strong talented magicals and when the magical and muggle worlds are different because of magic. However, Harry Potter being so light on world building, the magic system not being fleshed out, and we only see through a muggle raised kids eyes makes it so that all these fanfics can exist and not be too drastically different from the source material.
