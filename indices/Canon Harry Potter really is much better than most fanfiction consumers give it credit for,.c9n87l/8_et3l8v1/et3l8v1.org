Most of your post can be summarized with "I specifically enjoy those aspects of the series that most critics hate". Kinda hard to debate points that are mostly personal taste.

You might like the themes and plot of the last two books, but they're the most hated in the franchise for a reason. For every fan of reward of principled heroes there's another who'd rather see perfect consistency instead. For every reader that calls HP's magic "whimsical" there's another who calls it "plot convenient" (which for many people is a straight synonymous with bad writing).

You might have liked the love vs evil theme, but to me it felt like a pretty abominable message: good always wins against evil, so preparation and competence are unnecessary as long as there are principles (which are obviously objective and indiscutibly right and white and light compared to the opponent's which are wrong black and dark, 128% of the universe agrees).
