I would actually prefer it at the end of the original fic, just put an author's note “chapter” between the fic end and the one shots to explain what's about to follow, then 1 one shot per chapter. I mostly read by app or downloading to PDF so it's loaded on my phone already that way, rather than having to click back to the author and then go into each individual one shot.
