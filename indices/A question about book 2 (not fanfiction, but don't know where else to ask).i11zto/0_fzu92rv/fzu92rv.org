You've got the canon timeline mixed up. Between PS and COS, Arthur Weasley writes and implements the Muggle Protection Act and starts raiding properties. At the start of CoS, Lucius tells Borgin his house hasn't been raided yet. Arthur doesn't raid Malfoy Manor until Christmas of second year.

Lucius didn't pass the diary onto Ginny in revenge for a raid. His goal is for Ginny to be caught opening the Chamber of Secrets as a way to discredit Arthur Weasley and by extension the Muggle Protection Act. He knows exactly whose diary it is and what it will do - see the exchange between Dumbledore and Lucius at the end, where the diary is openly referred to as Lord Voldemort's; see also the warning Lucius gave to Draco to keep his head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with the job.

Dobby presumably overheard Lucius discussing his plan with Narcissa.

Of course, the funny thing is that Harry and Ron flying to Hogwarts in a flying car enchanted by Arthur probably did more damage to Arthur's professional reputation than anything Lucius Malfoy achieved.
