Lucius knew perfectly well, that it is some kind of very dark magical object, which will probably seriously hurt (or kill) Ginny. He probably mentioned it to somebody (Narcissa?) while Dobby was listening.

If he knew it was something to activate the Chamber of Secrets, then it would have tendency to kill muggleborns, not Harry.

Right, so the proper question is, why he didn't show up in The Burrow and why he didn't warn Ginny instead, when it had nothing to do with Harry?

That's a very good question.
