The Death Eaters are the equivalent of fascists, white supremacists or if you like, what we currently call the 'Alt-Right.' They were a once niche movement that hijacked the mainstream of 'Slytherin thought' - if you like - when concerns began to arise about muggle-born influence in magical society. You get plenty of rich, influential people backing these sort of movements - why? Because they either genuinely believe in what the movement espouses or because they think they can get even richer from it and use the movement to their advantage - or both. That's Lucius Malfoy in a nutshell. The Nazis never had a problem getting support from Big Business and Rich Capitalists. Now imagine if Hitler was a walking super-wizard that can kill you as soon as look at you with a flick of his hand. Malfoy and others of his ilk - the already rich and influential - get in over their heads and soon it's too late to do anything else but gamble on a Voldemort victory because otherwise they and their families are dead and all their assets are almost certainly going to one Tom Marvolo Riddle.

There's also the fact that Voldemort didn't always present himself as a homicidal maniac. Just look at him in the GOF scene where he returns. He's charming and charismatic - and that's after 13 years stewing in some Albanian forest. At first he would have seemed a radical but still acceptable option for people. And given that Slytherins are impressed by power and talent, the fact that he's also so magically gifted helps. He's essentially a God among Mortals, with everything that implies. And whether he believes in Pureblood supremacy or not, he's using everything in his power to advance that cause. That creates sudden momentum and opportunities for those people who delude themselves into thinking they can exploit it. Again, it's not that unlikely. Look at the current administration in DC.

Even then, look at Voldemort's Death-Eaters. We sometimes get the impression that pretty much all the major Slytherins supported him. But the elder Blacks didn't become Death-Eaters, though they certainly seemed to have cautiously supported his aims. I'm willing to wager that, in actual fact, very few of the older establishment took the mark at all. Look at who Voldemort chooses as his followers - the young and impressionable. He gets them by twisting their minds with a far more radical ideology that nevertheless affirms the beliefs they've latently accepted their entire lives. It's not like we don't have equivalents of /that/ in the real world. He stole the children of the 'Slytherin establishment' and took them as his own. He hijacked Slytherin House, in a nutshell. Slytherin is like a church of religionists that suffers a hostile takeover from fundamentalists.

Which is why one of the thing's that missing from the series that absolutely should have been included was the redemption of Slytherin House. There should have been Slytherins who chose to noticeably resist Voldemort exactly for the reasons highlighted in the op - because in the end it wasn't clever, or cunning, or useful for anyone's ambitions to bow down to a genocidal dictator. Who would look at Voldemort in his dying days and see anything but a ticking time bomb? If I could change one thing about the books, it'd be that.
