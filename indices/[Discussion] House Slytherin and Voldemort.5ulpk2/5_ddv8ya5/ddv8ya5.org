Slytherin isn't the house of evil, but those we would generally be aware of as large scale evil would likely end up in slytherin. It makes sense that the house that values ambition attracts people with plans to take over thebgivernment, amass wealth and want control.

It also makes sense, to some extent, that people that don't share the beliefs of the vocal members of the house remain quiet. They have their own, different, ambitions that won't be served by 'rocking the boat' and by keeping their heads down it is likely that post hogwarts no one will remember which house they were in.
