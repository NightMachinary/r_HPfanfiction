  It makes sense that the house that values ambition attracts people with plans to take over thebgivernment, amass wealth and want control.

Absolutely. You didn't read my post though did you? I explicitly addressed that point. Again: Serving Voldemort achieves neither of those goals. Unless you're particularly stupid you'd have to realize it pretty soon by looking at how he treats those underneath him. He does not elevate you. It's much more likely that you'll end up dead, in prison, or be one of his lackeys in a dystopian society that he rules like North Korea (no wealth to speak of and he certainly won't give you any meaningful control).
