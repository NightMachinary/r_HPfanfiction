I mean you asked for things that Malfoy might want, and that Voldemort in charge could provide.

These are things that the books have evidence to suggest Malfoy would want to have. He /hates/ the Weasleys, t doesn't matter if rationally he shouldn't, he does. Dumbledore is the biggest thorn in his side, controllingbhogwarts, competing for the minister's ear, holding important government positions....all of which have been true basically as long as Malfoy has been an adult. Muggle hunting is a stretch because it's not directly supported, but I feel a strong case could be made.

All of these are things that, to date, Malfoy hasn't been able to accomplish with all of his power. And as a power behind the throne, Malfoy won't see it that different working to manipulate fudge and working to manipulate voldemort, save that he doesn't have to manipulate the later as much since they already share core beliefs. To malfoy, his power will ot decrease if Voldemort takes over, but increase as now he will be able to come out of the shadows and take the spot near the top of the power structure. Yes he works for another, but his overall power will increase as a side effect, and he be lives in all the things the guy he works for does.

Baring the inexplicable evil of Voldemort Crucios being handed put like candy, it is a sensible, and ambitious, plan to support the Dark Lord.
