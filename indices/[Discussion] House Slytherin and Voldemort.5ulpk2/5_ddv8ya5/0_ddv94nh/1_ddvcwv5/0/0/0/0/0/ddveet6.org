Yeah okay I get what you are saying. I think this is just a slight miscommunication how we approach things.

A lot of these things for me just fall into the "Mustache twirling pointlessly evil"-category like a cartoon villain. I think in the broadest of terms we are in agreement that Slytherin is more House Evil/Insane/Maniacal/Idiotic than truly Ambitious (and yes, of course you can be both, but it seems in most cases their 'wickedness' trumps their ambition).
