I always assumed that the voldemort prior to the books was a more even headed individual that the one we see I the books that throws out torture curses like candy.

Also, it is incredibly likely that people will jump on the coat tails of the powerful with the ambition of a strong place in the new order. Remember, to these people, voldemort winning isn't a dystopia future, it's a return to the glorious days of our ancestors where we rule over the peasantry as lords.
