  And if your ambition was a muggleborn-free Wizarding Britain, Voldemort was the wizard to follow.

Sure, which totally works with my assumption that Slytherin is House Evil and not House of the Ambitious and Cunning.

Again... what does it mean to "take over"? They give up all their political control under Voldemort, he will not suffer any dissent. Whether you will get rich in such a totalitarian society is highly dubious as well, especially if all you want to rule over gets destroyed in your grab for 'power'. I think North Korea is a particularly great example.

Sure, if you want to eradicate all the Muggleborns Voldemort is your best bet, but he offers nothing else. Sorry for starting another historical meandering, but even Hitler - a maniacal genocidal mass murderer - had more to offer for his followers. Just look at the incredible architecture that people like Speer were able to indulge in because of his regime. I do not believe that you can win any kind of traction coming out of the gate with offerings of mass-murder and genocide, no matter how bigoted the society.
