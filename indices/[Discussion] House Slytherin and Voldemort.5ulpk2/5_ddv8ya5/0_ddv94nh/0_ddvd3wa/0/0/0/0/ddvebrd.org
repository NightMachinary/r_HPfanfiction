Except that he doesn't make sense in how he acts to accomplish these goals. Riddle is shown to be charming and intelligent. He is basically a mini Hitler rising to power. Fast forward a decade or two and voldemort rules his followers through torture curses, seems to have no grand plan and hunts children because of prophecy...and still people follow him.

It doesn't make sense unless there is either some sort of mind control in the dark mark, or in the scenes where we don't see him, the dark Lord builds up plans for a new education system that takes muggleborns and turns them into brainwashed slaves, or rewrites the ministry's laws so that individual pure bloods rule their own lands as lords and answer to no one but their head of hoyse, or something similiar.
