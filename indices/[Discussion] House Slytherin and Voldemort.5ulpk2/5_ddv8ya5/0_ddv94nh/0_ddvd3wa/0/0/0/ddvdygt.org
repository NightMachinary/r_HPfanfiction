Wait wait wait, but Voldemort is the only one who makes sense. He's a half-blood and can't seem to make a career through conventional means... he actually has something to gain and he will be the sole Tyrant in his regime. I can totally understand what he's doing (of course he's deranged and big Evil too). It's everyone else that's stupid.
