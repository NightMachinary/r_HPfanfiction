  Except that he doesn't make sense in how he acts to accomplish these goals. Riddle is shown to be charming and intelligent. He is basically a mini Hitler rising to power. Fast forward a decade or two and voldemort rules his followers through torture curses, seems to have no grand plan and hunts children because of prophecy...and still people follow him.

Yeah that's a pretty glaring inconsistency in the writing. It's hard to imagine that the Voldemort we see could attract those followers and I've heard the argument before that maybe the Horcruxes or the Resurrection ritual messed him up (more than just his appearance).

  It doesn't make sense unless there is either some sort of mind control in the dark mark, or in the scenes where we don't see him, the dark Lord builds up plans for a new education system that takes muggleborns and turns them into brainwashed slaves, or rewrites the ministry's laws so that individual pure bloods rule their own lands as lords and answer to no one but their head of hoyse, or something similiar.

That's some good speculation and I would like to see some more fanfics that actually give better reasons for the Purebloods to follow him. It's just not in canon and no indication for it. They just seem to go along with it, because they are sheep.
