And why do you think they would have a reason to assume that they wouldn't be treated like Speer?

If you're an average pureblood, one of those who won't really get political control or have lots of gold, you're better off with Voldemort than with the current system since all the muggleborn and most half-bloods would be beneath you and no competition no matter how talented they are.

And even if you're rich you might expect life under Voldemort to be better than under Fudge because you think you'll be oppressing your lessers and those nasty mudbloods won't show you up at school and in business.
