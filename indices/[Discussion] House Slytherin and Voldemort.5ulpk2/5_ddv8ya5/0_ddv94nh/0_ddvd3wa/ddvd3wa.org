I beg to differ. The Death Eaters were winning in the 1970s, and would have taken over Wizarding Britain if not for Harry. And in the 1990s, they did take over Wizarding Britain, and would have kept it if not for the trio.

And if your ambition was a muggleborn-free Wizarding Britain, Voldemort was the wizard to follow.

All of the desertions we saw in the books were not cases where the individual realised just how stupid their decision was after thinking it through - Snape, Regulus and the Malfoys only defected when someone dear to them was endangered (Lily, Kreacher, the Malfoys).
