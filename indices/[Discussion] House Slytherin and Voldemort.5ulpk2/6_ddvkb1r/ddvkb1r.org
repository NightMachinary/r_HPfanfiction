I've always thought that 1984 is a great template for Hufflepuff House going evil. Huge emphasis on loyalty to the regime, majority rights, working hard to support your fellow workers, being fair by spying on everyone the same way, etc.

I think Slytherin house was created to reflect Voldemort's values during JKR's brainstorming, because there's plenty of different ways to abuse people in a dystopian society and different reasons to justify it.
