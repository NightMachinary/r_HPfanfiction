Oh yeah you totally hit on a larger much more important point. The idea of sorting people into houses based on their 'most dominant personality trait' (at age 11 no-less) seems patently absurd. Sorting people randomly into a house that's just represented by a color or maybe a House Animal would be much more sensible and avoid this weird pseudo-caste system.

  So to me, saying that someone is "ambitious" or "cunning" doesn't really mean anything when those traits automatically will begat more diversified traits

Well it's not totally without merit. Surely Voldemort is more ambitious and cunning than he is loyal... and his bravery is probably also relatively low (considering he'd rather throw his minions at dangerous situations).

  With few exceptions we see the entire story through his eyes and his worldview. To him, the only Slytherin's he pays attention to feed into "ambition/cunning = evil."

It's just such a stupid thought to me. In my opinion Hermione is extremely ambitious (freeing the elves, her academic aspirations, her thrive to keep Harry alive), yet there is absolutely no reason to relate that particular trait to being evil. It's just so aggravating to me, especially because traits like guile and cunning are just useful and completely neutral in terms of morality (like tools).
