Well it's just like you said, that one trait informed OTHER traits of Voldemort as well. Not everyone will take /that/ path with those traits. For Tom Riddle, his ambition led to him to seek out knowledge in a way that it wouldn't for someone like, say, Hermione. Those base traits are just that, base traits. Something that a person's personality is built on and by themselves are somewhat meaningless.

In real life, someone like Edward Teller was an incredibly smart person, yet his intelligence was buttressed by other traits that led to him considering the use of nuclear weapons as the go to answer for /literally anything./ Yet his base personality trait of intelligence would make him an ideal Ravenclaw. Someone like Curtis Lemay was an incredibly loyal and brave person - but that loyalty and bravery also led to him being a heavy proponent for advocating bombing enemies (to include civilian populations), "back to the stone age."

What I'm getting at, and what I thought your original post was getting at, is that Slytherin=EVIL is a flawed concept.
