  And I maintain that for the ambitious, being a bigot is smart when the society - or the part of it calling the shots - is bigoted.

Nah, the smart thing is to pretend to be a bigot and take the cheap labour that no-one else wants because of their idiotic bigotry (since the difference between Muggleborns and Purebloods is completely made up). Oh and of course you'd treat them as well as possible while maintaining your facade, so they'd be in your debt. You certainly wouldn't believe in the bigotry. Pretty ruthless, but not stupidly evil.

But that only makes sense if the whole regime is already in place. I have no idea why you'd want to make it worse, these kinds of societies don't work very well and are doomed to collapse. Why would you support a genocidal maniac who wants to take away your underappreciated and probably underpaid workforce?
