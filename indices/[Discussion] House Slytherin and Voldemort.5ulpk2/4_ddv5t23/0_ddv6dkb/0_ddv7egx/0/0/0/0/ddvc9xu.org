I disagree there. I could see most of the characters fit into at least two houses. Harry is Slytherin or Gryffindor. Hermione would fit into all four houses - she's cunning, ambitious, brave and hard-working as well as loyal and the smartest witch of her generation. Ron is very brave, but he's also very loyal. Neville would fit into Hufflepuff as well as Gryffindor. Luna, who wanted and needed friends so badly, would have also been a good Hufflepuff - she certainly wouldn't have complained about work.

And I maintain that for the ambitious, being a bigot is smart when the society - or the part of it calling the shots - is bigoted.

It's actually more realistic, in my opinion, given how isolated those houses are, that a house is "evil", than that all bigots were split evenly among all houses.
