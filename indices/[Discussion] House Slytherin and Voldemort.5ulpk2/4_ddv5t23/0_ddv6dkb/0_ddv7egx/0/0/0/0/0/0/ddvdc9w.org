It's rather hard to keep pretending when everyone around you laps it up. After a childhood in a bigoted family, and seven years surrounded by bigots at school, it doesn't matter if some of them had been faking it - odds are, most will believe it by then, or have grown so used to it that they repeat it anyway.

Which is why having Snape pose as a Death Eater to be a spy pretty much dooms the house.
