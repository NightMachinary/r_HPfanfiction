That doesn't make much sense to me. For all 3 other houses the Hat seems to sort mostly according to those characteristics ... It's no surprise that our main characters are mostly Gryffindors for example (they are 'doers'). It just falls apart for Slytherin in my opinion, because JKR wanted it to be House Evil. She just realized that there couldn't be a House for Dark Wizards in a school like Hogwarts so she had to come up with some characteristic that could be associated with a tendency towards being evil - ambition and cunning just seem like a particular bad choice considering the kind of evil (mad rampaging terrorists and a wannabe tyrant) that they are supposed to be attracted towards.
