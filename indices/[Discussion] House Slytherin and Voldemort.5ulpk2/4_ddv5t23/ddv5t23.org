I actually wrote about this in one of the chapters of the story I'm currently writing on how the intrinsic 'values' of each house don't really mean anything in the grand scheme of things. As expressed in the books, where you are sorted really depends on the choices that you wish to make as there is tons of crossover between what can be considered the 'traits' of each house. It takes ambition to gain knowledge for example, and sometimes it takes tremendous bravery to loyal being two key examples /pointed out in the text/ (those being Voldemort and Neville). In addition to that, wisdom is the byproduct of hard work for many, and the especially brave also need to have a certain merit of cunning about them. Wisdom could make you act brave in your actions, and ambition could lead you to great loyalty towards those that support your ambitions.

So to me, saying that someone is "ambitious" or "cunning" doesn't really mean anything when those traits automatically will begat more diversified traits. What this is saying is that any fanfic writer who automatically lumps /all/ of one house into only having /X/ trait is being incredibly superficial. So why does JKR get a pass on this in the books? Because they're from the POV of Harry Potter. With few exceptions we see the entire story through his eyes and his worldview. To him, the only Slytherin's he pays attention to feed into "ambition/cunning = evil."

But Harry is not reliable, of course.
