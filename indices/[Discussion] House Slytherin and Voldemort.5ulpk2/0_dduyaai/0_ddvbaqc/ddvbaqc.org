Do you believe in a way its a self fulfilling thing? From the first book we see that free will and choice has a large part in the sorting. Now I'm not saying that an eleven year old has the same characteristics and personality they will always have but the hat doesn't sort on traits but on wishes. Do have to have a trait to believe you have it? I frequently see comments about how Malfoy doesn't deserve to be Slytherin but he would say he is the definitive Slytherin regardless of where he should go were the Hat to sort him on personality alone.

What I'm asking is do you think that where parent's went etc, the wishes of the children have corrupted the Slytherin house so its full of people who think they belong there and really don't? With the way Slytherin is presented by many its easy to see an us vs them siege mentality forming and being passed down to their children.

The only thing I have to contribute with regards to Slytherin house ideals and Voldemort is cunning ambitious people are often pragmatic. They'd wait and then join the winning side regardless of their views. By all accounts Voldemort was winning before Halloween 81. Its why Harry was so famous, he was a miracle who snatched victory from the jaw's of defeat.
