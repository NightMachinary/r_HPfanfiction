But there wouldn't be a 'side' without his Slytherin supporters. Without them Voldemort is just a (admittedly very strong) lone Dark Wizard. What could he offer them that they don't already have or have a better shot at gaining without subjugating themselves to him (and being branded like a farm-animal)? This is not a rhetorical question... after the defeat of the Dark Lord Lucius Malfoy becomes one of the most respected and influential Wizards. He's an evil bastard, but he could easily become Minister for Magic one day if he plays his cards right (and then he can even persecute all the Muggleborns as much as he wants). Why the fuck would he serve Voldemort? He has nowhere to go but down.

No, the only way it works is if Slytherin is House Evil and the Hat just sorts all the bigots and Dark Wizards into that house, regardless of ambition and cunning. I like your musings on that the Hat sorts them there just because they believe they belong there (clearly Draco Malfoy has neither ambition nor cunning).
