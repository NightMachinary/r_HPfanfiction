  Who knows what Malfoy would have become if Voldemort never gave them a banner to rally around.

Hm yes, maybe. Lots of speculation. But there always seemed to be a very strong Pureblood foundation. Wasn't there a recent Black who was Hogwarts Headmaster? It just seems to me that a politically savvy person like Malfoy could achieve much more from his privileged position - especially if he is morally bankrupt - than by becoming a common brute/solider for some vague idea of a new order in society that may or may not be better for him in the long run.
