  We also don't know if the elections in the Wizarding world are open or decided in the Wizengamot which I have seen in several stories. I think Scrimegeour's election was too quick for a true general election but I can't be sure.

Well if it's in any way like the Prime Minister in the UK (or most similar positions in governments across Europe) he is not elected directly.

I'm not so sure about canon... is the Wizengamot elected? Do we know anything about it? Either way, even if there currently is some form of democratic elections, the current state of affairs already appears quite totalitarian. Fudge already seems like he can do whatever the fuck he wants and he's not even being particularly smart about it. I don't want to say "Sure thing", but I see very little - except Dumbledore who is old - that could stand in Malfoys why in a grab for power and then slowly erode any kind of oposition.

Yeah I get it, he hates Muggles, but maybe he'd read a history book for once and see that that's usually how it's done (i.e. it works).
