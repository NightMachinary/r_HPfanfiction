Assuming you were talking about Professor Phineas Nigellus Black he died in 1925 (according to the wiki) and Sirius describes him as the least popular headmaster ever.

We know the Blacks and several others always had pro-pureblood beliefs. We also don't know if the elections in the Wizarding world are open or decided in the Wizengamot which I have seen in several stories. I think Scrimegeour's election was too quick for a true general election but I can't be sure. Either way we have seen that those in power pre Voldemort were willing to work with a muggleborn. Who knows what Malfoy would have become but I think having what might have appeared as a share of certain power (Voldemort crushed all before him other than Dumbledore so it might seem like he was guaranteed victory) would be more attractive than a gamble in a changing world.
