Its said power is the ultimate aphrodisiac. Tom Riddle was always talented and powerful. We know little for the history of the house before his rise outside of Hagrid's statement of 'There wasn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin." Personally I don't take that as evidence. Some seek power for gaining more power. Tom Riddle had power and was likely to gain more. A small share of a lot is a lot more than everything of nothing. We don't really know enough about the world before Riddle, what allowed him to rise. Nobby Leach or was a muggleborn Minister (1962-8 according to a quick search), its not hard to imagine he might have made moves to remove power from the older families. We don't know what would have happened without Voldemort. Now if you say the Hufflepuffs are all about fairness then they might not protest even if some of them lose power. Gryffindors don't really care, of their sense of Nobility should oppose the unfairness. Ravenclaw I have always considered a bit detached from the comings and goings and wouldn't really care either way. If you took power away Slytherin would oppose you. People dedicate their lives to the pursuit of power all while struggling to define it. It Voldemort gave a clear opposition, a path to more power then some of the more extreme would join him quickly. The more power he gets the more would join.

  Lucius Malfoy becomes one of the most respected and influential Wizards. He's an evil bastard, but he could easily become Minister for Magic one day if he plays his cards right

If there was a muggleborn minister in the sixties and Voldermort emerged late 60s early 70s and the war lasted a decade then without the war we don't know what would have happened. There is evidence that before Voldemort muggleborns had some power. Who knows what Malfoy would have become if Voldemort never gave them a banner to rally around.
