That mirrors my thoughts. It isn't that Slytherin house gets a bad reputation, it earns it. That being said if everyone was sorted at say 5th year and the sorting was absolute on traits rather than perceived or favoured traits do you think Slytherin would be though of very differently or do the house traits lend themselves to bigotry?
