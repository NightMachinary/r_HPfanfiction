It's self-fulfilling in that once you have a general attitude/tradition within a house, it's very hard to change without drastic outside intervention. Just look at "hazing" rituals. Once you have a bigot brigade, odds are it'll stay a bigot brigade, and whether they are supposed to be brave, cunning, hard-working or smart won't matter a thing.
