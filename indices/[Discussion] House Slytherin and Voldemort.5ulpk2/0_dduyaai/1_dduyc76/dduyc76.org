  I've got no problem with having a "House Evil" - it's quite common for such "fraternities" or "clubs" to develop such an attitude among their members.

I agree in regards to clubs or fraternities. But they are smaller and can filter their own members. Slytherin is a quarter of the population and it's way too radical for people to go along with it - especially if mindlessly being compliant seems contrary to most ambitions. I can see a House like Gryffindor going along with a radical ideology much easier (in terms of character, of course there's still the problem with quarter of the population)...
