Meh, Slytherin doesn't seem particularly under-represented in canon. They share classes with Gryffindor for example and there's no indication that there's less of Slytherin overall.

Anyway, if the Hat only sorts Purebloods into Slytherin it raises the question of why the Founders allowed such prejudice (I doubt it could happen). On the other hand if he doesn't sort some people into Slytherin in order to protect them from the poisonous House it might be a better idea to "reboot" the House and refuse to sort anyone into it for 7 years.
