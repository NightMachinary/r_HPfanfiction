The hat sorts half-bloods as well - see Snape. But important is, in my opinion, what he said to Harry: He could be great in Slytherin.

I think the hat sorts according to where a student might thrive - and cunning etc. plays only a part in that decision. If you have a house with a strong bigotry streak, muggleborns would not thrive there, so they'll not get sorted there. On the other hand, people like Draco might not do better in another hosue, so they'll be sorted into Slytherin.
