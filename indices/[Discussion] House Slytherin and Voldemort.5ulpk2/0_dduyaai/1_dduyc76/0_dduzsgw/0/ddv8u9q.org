In other words, anti-muggleborn sentiment is high among purebloods, and Slytherin advertises that it approves of anti-muggleborn sentiment. It has a large population to draw from in perpetuating its status, and the Sorting Hat somehow takes that into account (perhaps, for instance, it sorts people into the house they most desire that won't murder them).

This rather cements its status as a haven for people amenable to Voldemort's politics.
