I wouldn't say evil is confined to a house - I'd say that's the house where bigotry is most prevalent.

With regards to lynchings not finding large society approval, lynchings generally found solid approval - as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States][the wiki article]] shows. (Warning: Drastic Pictures!). in some cases, thousands of people watched a man get tortured to death, and took pictures, even postcards, from the event. And yes, it was often about "teaching the blacks their place".

I have absolutely no problem believing that many purebloods approve of lynchings in a society where slavery is still legal.
