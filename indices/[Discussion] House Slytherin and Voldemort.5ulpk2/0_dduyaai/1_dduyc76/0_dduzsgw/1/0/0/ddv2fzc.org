It's still neither cunning nor ambitious. I assume that most people involved in such lynchings were mostly uneducated... they happened more in rural areas right? Also it carried the veneer of of "justice"... In regards to Harry Potter I found the whole Umbridge Muggleborn registration stuff very plausible, which may come close to something like it.

American history isn't my forte and I want to be careful because it also isn't my cultural heritage, but I think treatment of slaves was pretty complicated and I'm pretty sure that the mainstream still found lynchings... distasteful - at the least? Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'd be interested in contemporary newspaper articles, etc here.

Worst (physical) treatment of slaves usually happened AFAIK away from the public eye (remote cotton farms, etc.). In more populated urban areas it was for the most part constrained to segregation and "blacks knowing their place" in deference to whites.

IMHO it's a very large step from seeing someone as lower caste (like the portrayal of the Malfoys towards Muggleborns) and actually murdering/torturing them. Even if you see them as animals (which I'm not sure is entirely the case), most people wouldn't needlessly murder or torture dogs.
