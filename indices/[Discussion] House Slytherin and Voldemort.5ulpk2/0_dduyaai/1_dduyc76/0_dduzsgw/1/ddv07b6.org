Racial prejudice yes...lynchings finding large societal approval? No. Even in Nazi Germany people preferred to remain blissfully ignorant about the realities and even Hitler was less overt about his genocidal tendencies (at least until the later years of his dictatorship). I do not believe he would have been elected if he openly tortured and murdered Jews (this is the kind of person that Slytherin supports, it is on it's face ludicrous).

Edit: this is really off track though... I didn't want to discuss the accuracy of JKRs allegory. It doesn't make sense that the evil is confined to a house that doesn't really fit the bill when you think about it objectively.
