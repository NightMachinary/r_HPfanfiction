Slughorn came back to the battle with reinforcements. The Slytherin students leaving didn't necessarily mean they approved of the Death Eaters, rather they were either underage and scared for their lives, or they knew children of Death Eaters and didn't want to get involved in their fight on either side. I know I sure as hell would not stay and fight, even if I hated everything Voldemort stood for. I think it's astounding that as many students stayed as they did.
