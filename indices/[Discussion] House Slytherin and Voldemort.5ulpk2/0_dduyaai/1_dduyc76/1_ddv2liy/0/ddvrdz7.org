Technically, only Crabbe really fought that we know of. Parkinson voiced her "opinion", Malfoy and Goyle stayed but didn't do much... and that's all. As far as we know, the others went with Slughorn.\\
What we mostly forget is that most of the characters are children (or barely adults) who just follow their parents path (and barely at that). Unfortunately, many in the fanfiction community seems to forget how strong an impact the opinion of the prents and peers have on a teenager, or the drive to go with the group.
