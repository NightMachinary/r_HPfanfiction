The whole idea that purebloods are superiour makes no sense either (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Harry, Hermione, Snape, Lily - most of the exceptionally talented wizards and witches in the series were half-bloods or muggleborns) and yet many Slytherins believed it.

I've got no problem with having a "House Evil" - it's quite common for such "fraternities" or "clubs" to develop such an attitude among their members. Not everone might be on board, but the majority either spreading it, or going along with it? That I can easily see.
