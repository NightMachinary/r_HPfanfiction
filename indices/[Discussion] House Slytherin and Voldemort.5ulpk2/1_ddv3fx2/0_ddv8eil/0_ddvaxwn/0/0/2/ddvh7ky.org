  Hufflepuff doesn't even get a useful metal, they're just Yellow and Black.

This isn't intentional, but it's what I'm working off of.

There's a process to harden steel called case hardening. You add carbon to the steel surface, creating an outer layer of harder metal. In the old days, you'd do this by covering it in charcoal (see where I'm going with this), heating it up, then quenching it like normal. This would transfer some of the carbon to the steel and make it much more durable for some applications. Naturally, we didn't understand why for quite a long time, but we still managed to get it to work.

Also, proper charcoal makes a sort of tinny, metallic sound when struck. If you don't have much in the way of a science education, and 10th century wizards are as far away from a science education as you can get, you might attribute some metallic properties to charcoal.

Depending on how you produce it, crushed charcoal can also be used to fertilize soil. There's soil in the Amazon that's still very fertile, was created intentionally, and one of the primary ingredients was charcoal. If there was anyone in Europe who would have figured that out, it would have been wizards experimenting with odd rituals and such. This would probably look even more like actual magic. Of course, Hufflepuff is connected to growing things in the earth.

Canonically, the colors supposedly represented aspects of the elements of each house (in fact, the black represents soil), and those other three just "happened" to get metals as colors. I don't think that's quite good enough though. As weird as it is, I've basically decided that the black in the house colors was inspired by charcoal.
