  So... would you think that portraying the Hitler Jugend as a bigoted evil organisation is being biased? Even though not all members were racists, you can bet that m,ost of them were racists, especially after a few years of getting taught that shit.

Sorry to butt in, but the HJ is actually a good example in regards to something that we talked about earlier. Before the actual takeover the HJ was actually pretty small. Wikipedia mentions about 80k members before 1932. Only after membership became more or less compulsory later it became such a large organization. This just relates to our earlier argument about percentage of radical people.

Of course your point about racism still stands, but anti-semetic attitudes were pretty common place all over Europe in that era. The HJ was AFAIK more focused on encouraging nationalism, national-pride, discipline, etc. Of course ideological purity in regards to racial dogma played a certain role, but for the most part (I think) they wanted to create soldiers, not people who eradicate Jews (which requires a very special psychopath and is still quite ugly for most normal people). If the HJ occasionally went out and murdered or tortured Jews parents would have probably quite outraged. Voldemort though seems to be overt on such a level, which I don't think most would accept.

I'm not quite sure what my overall point about this was, just wanted to mention a few things.
