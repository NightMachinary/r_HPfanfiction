So... would you think that portraying the Hitler Jugend as a bigoted evil organisation is being biased? Even though not all members were racists, you can bet that m,ost of them were racists, especially after a few years of getting taught that shit.

Why should it be different with House Slytherin? It is led by a man posing as a Death Eater, who is also a bully and a despicable human being, and no one in the house thought it was a good idea to rein in Draco and Co., not even when they were stupid little firsties.

And no, "They were afraid of his father" doesn't really mean that Slytherin was good - it just means that the odds of the house following blood purity are even higer if they can't even stand up to one family.
