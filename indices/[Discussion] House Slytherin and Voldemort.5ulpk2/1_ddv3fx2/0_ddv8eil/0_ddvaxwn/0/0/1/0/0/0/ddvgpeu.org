I agree, which is why I have such trouble with believing in a Slytherin as it is presented in the books. Idiots like Malfoy should be the minority, especially if they are so overt about their genocidal ways. No-one (except psychopaths) openly approves of genocide, but I think you have a more cynical view on humanity than me.
