  By that logic, none of the characters in the book are responsible for their actions because they didn't do anything.

Rather, I'm saying that, because Rowling consistently chose to portray Slytherins as evil, the obvious message from the story is that Slytherins are evil. We should expect most people who read the stories to associate Slytherin with evil. When we write fanfiction, if we want Slytherin not to be evil, we must explain that it isn't and also explain how a non-evil Slytherin relates to canon Slytherin.

And for a discussion like this, we are trying to retroactively insert justification into a story that doesn't necessarily have it.
