  To be honest, I don't think Slytherin is dealt that bad a hand until the Seventh book.

The closest things to good or kind or friendly Slytherins we ever see are Regulus Black and Severus Snape. Snape being good is an informed attribute. Black is not directly portrayed. We're directly told in the first book that Slytherin is where all the bad people come from. If this isn't a bad hand, what is?
