There are too many goblins, burrowed too deep. After a few thousand years of war it got old, and wizards got lazy. They just pay them off this mudbloods now.

Sure, it's nearsighted. They're just growing in number uncontested. But the wizards have diluted themselves into thinking this is the status quo, and that there's no reason to rock the boat. They didn't want those mudbloods anyways. All the Real witches are safe in the knowledge that their gold is secure behind goblin wards and walls. Pay no attention to the fact the goblins control the entire economy.
