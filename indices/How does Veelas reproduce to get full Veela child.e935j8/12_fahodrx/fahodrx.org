I like to think that there's no such thing as a Whole veela, and it can't be diluted out. Any kid of a veela will be a female, the breed of the father, and a half veela, no matter what. It's a bloodline curse. The only Full veela In history was the first, all others are called Half Veela.

Same way I like to think that all goblins are descendent of one original cursed child, and that they rape young witches to make more of themselves, like is the case in the Firebird Trilogy. The magical world is not all sunshine and rainbows. Quite the opposite in fact.
