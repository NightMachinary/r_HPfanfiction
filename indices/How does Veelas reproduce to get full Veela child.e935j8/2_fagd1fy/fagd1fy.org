They aren't born, they're made through a magical process. A maiden who drowns herself before her wedding day is one of the more well known myths, but in HP verse there'd probably have to be specific scenarios. Given the harpie form, and the fire balls, plus the original water-spirit nature, it wouldn't be hard to cobble something together. Harpy-eagle eggs, hatched in a firestorm. Any abandoned nest taken care of and hatched by a phoenix. Abandoned nest hatched by fairies.

That's my theory.
