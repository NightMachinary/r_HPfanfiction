A lot of creative ideas here. Here's mine. What if most wizards think they reproduce asexually, but actually they're extremely sexually dimorphic. The males are tiny, permanently attaching themselves to the females like parasites, with most of their bodies except for their gonads atrophying, as in some species of deep sea fish. So usually they produce full veela offspring, but a female who declines the advances of the usual veela males can reproduce with human males.
