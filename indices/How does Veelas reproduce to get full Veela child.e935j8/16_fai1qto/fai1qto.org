We have Half-Giants and half-goblins in cannon. Troll-blooded as well maybe? No reason why we can't have half-veela as well. I don't see why Veela need to have any special way to reproduce. The ordinary way will do.

Also, if I can be a bit cheeky, why do they need to be Other? Frankly, that so many fics treat Veela and magical beings as something Else, something Strange, makes me quite uncomfortable.
