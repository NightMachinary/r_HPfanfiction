I don't believe it's ever stated outright in the books - we don't see too much of Veela there.

Outside of the books, I did a quick search - and the only indication from JKR seems to have come from one of the WOMBAT tests and reverse calculating the answers. So according to that there are no full-blooded male Veelas.

For FF purposes it's certainly vague enough that it's entirely up to you.
