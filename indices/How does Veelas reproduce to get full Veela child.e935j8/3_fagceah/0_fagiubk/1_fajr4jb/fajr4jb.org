I am a Czech, so we are just on the edge of the area where Vilas are part of the national folklore, but for us they are something close to the Greek nymphs. There are vilas living in the woods (and seducing random males into death by dancing etc.), in water (e.g., Rusalka in the Antonín Dvořák's opera was the one; she was a way less meancing than rusalkas are in the Russian folklore, more like A Little Mermaid or something). I don't think they have absolutely anything common with Veelas from the HP universe.
