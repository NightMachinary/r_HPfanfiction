I think samodiva is also pretty close to the veela in Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  *Samodivas*, *Samovilas* or *Vilas* are believed to be very beautiful women with an affinity for fire. ... It is said that, when angered, a Samodiva can change her appearance and turn into a monstrous bird, capable of throwing fire at her enemies. ... Men who gaze upon a Samodiva fall instantly in love (or at least in lust), and women take their own lives at the sight of such beauty. ... Another important aspect of the myths surrounding Samodivas is their dance.
