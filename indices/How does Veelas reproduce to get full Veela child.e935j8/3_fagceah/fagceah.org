[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vila_(fairy)]]

#+begin_quote
  The vila is known among South Slavs and Slovaks only, quotations about her occurrence among Poles are wrong. Among Czechs, vila denotes a wood spirit (15th century)

  In Slovakia, vile are the restless souls of deceased girls who lure young men into a deadly circle dance.

Like Dementors and Boggarts, I picture them as a kind of non-biological spiritual being (in JKR's terminology, a non-being) which can reproduce with humans to produce half-Veela offpsring, but which do not reproduce biologically themselves.
