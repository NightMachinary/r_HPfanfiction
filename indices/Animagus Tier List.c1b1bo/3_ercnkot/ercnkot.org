I always felt that, should it not be snake, Harry's form should hav the form of a bird of prey (eagle, hawks, owl . . .) because of the freedom it brings and his habits as a seeker.

- Medium to very high /Stealth/ depending of the form (who would even notive a owl if he carries a letter), medium /Attack Damage/ (would not fight a wizard if the first /Surprise Attack/ fail), high /Mobility/ and ability to /Flight/. At least B-Tier no matter what the final form is.
