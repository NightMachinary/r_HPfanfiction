No, it's not. Let me rephrase: it'll be a wakeup call to wizards in the way that they are not superior to muggles regarding things like these. Their abilities do NOT protect them from this. I'm not saying that someone with the ideaology that wizards are better because of their blood will feel differently- they're more likely to blame it on the muggle- but people who view muggles more as pets, will definetely see a flaw. Also, IF many wizards think that they are immune to this just because they are magical, they'll be wrong. They just refuse to see it. Saying it's a wake up call doesn't mean they acknowledge it. IF someone is a racist and believes that white people have better immune systems than black people, then it IS a huge wakeup call to the, they might just choose to ignore it. I'm not saying they'll stop- I'm saying it'll once again prove to them that they aren't superior. Whether they choose to accept that or not is their decision.
