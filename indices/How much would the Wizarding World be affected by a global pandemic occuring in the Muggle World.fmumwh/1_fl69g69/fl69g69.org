from what i've seen, it's a not-uncommon trope that wizards/witches are immune to most "Muggle diseases." depending on the fic, that can include viral/bacterial diseases, autoimmune and chronic illnesses, and things like cancer.

of course, when you look into it this trope makes very little sense bc the logical extrapolation of that is that wizards don't ever get infected wounds, or the common cold, or headaches, all of which happen or are strongly implied to happen in canon; Moody has lost multiple limbs, Pepper-Up Potion exists, and Harry's headaches aren't seen as unique to him.
