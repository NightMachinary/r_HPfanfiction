This fic isn't relevant to what you want to find and it isn't finished, not even halfway finished yet so I don't know whether Harry would "reveal" himself or not, but in this fic, Harry did travel to the past, did chose to present to be Harry Potter the muggle-born and his divination teacher, who is a seer, quickly saw through his mask then cornered Harry about who he really is. Harry, being a dork like he is, told his teacher he's a time traveler, then his teacher like: "Nope, stop talking, I'm too young, too love my life for this shit" then proceeded to teach Harry how (pretend) to be a seer. Spoiler: His great-great grandpa from his mother's side, also figures who Harry is without Harry tells him. Oh, he's also a pretend seer, magician.
