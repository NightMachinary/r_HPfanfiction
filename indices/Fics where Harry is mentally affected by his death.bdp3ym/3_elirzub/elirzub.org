[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late][fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]] is a brilliant story, that was sadly never finished. Harry's life is mentally affected by the deathly hallows. The first 28 chapters though are in themselves a closed-up story. Reading further only lets you get to an open end - unsatisfied - so just don't read them.
