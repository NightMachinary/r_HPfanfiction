Oh, and another one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6563043][fanfiction.net/s/6563043]] "The Real Memory" is ever better. Harry comes back to life and everything has changed. It is another story that deals with the effects the deathly hallows have for Harry. In the end everything makes sense in a strangly satisfying way - as much sense as coming back after dying can.
