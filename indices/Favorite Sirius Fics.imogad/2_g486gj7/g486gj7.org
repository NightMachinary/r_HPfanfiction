Ugh, the scenes in which he hangs out with Remus in his werewolf form ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Not finished but I think it's nearing the end. Either way there is enough text to entertain you for a long time.

Really loving the OC and her interactions with Sirius so far, and he seems realistically mature and depressed but still reckless and impatient. The story is just picking up but is updated pretty regularly.
