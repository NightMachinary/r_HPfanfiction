My fav Sirius fic is the "Interwoven" series by Katinka31.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/714431/1/Interwoven-The-Seamstress-and-the-Lovable-Stray]]

It was written before OOTP came out and paired him with a female OC living in Hogsmeade.

Another longer Sirius fic that I read and remember on the spot would be Cartographer's Craft. by Copperbadge.
