*Ron is a Death Eater* because all the Weasleys are.

Arthur and Molly were actually dormant agent during the last war. Arthur and Lucius hate each other because they are rival for their Lord favor. Ron approached Harry on the Hogwart Express because his parent asked him to become closer to "the future Dark Lord". His mission to become close to him was a success, but with Voldemort return in GoF, the family has a chance to infiltrate the Order of the Phoenix and prove they are the best servant of Lord Voldemort.
