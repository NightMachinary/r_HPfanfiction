Probably all of these have been done already, but...

*Wrong Boy Who Lived-* A ruse by Dumbledore to protect the identity of the real Boy (or Girl) Who Lived. Neither Boy Who Lived is an asshole- they're just pawns in a much bigger game.

*Neville is the Boy Who Lived-* Neville dies as a baby, because Snape doesn't give a damn if Voldemort kills Alice Longbottom. The rest of the story is about the post-appocalyptic world after Voldemort wins. The lesson is "prophecies are bullshit".

*Ron is a Death Eater-* Someone posted this here recently, but maybe he's not actually a Death Eater, but playing double agent like Snape.

*Snape is Harry's father or raises Harry-* A few options. James was sterile and Lily asked Snape to be the sperm donor because she knew he was a) familiar with Muggle procedures for treating infertility, and b) desperate enough he'd say yes no questions asked. Alternatively, Dumbledore used Snape's DNA (preferably with his and James and Lily's knowledge) as part of a magical ritual to create a Chosen One who would combine James, Lily, and Snape's abilities.

*Marriage Contract-* portrayed as the state-sanctioned slavery and rape that such a system would actually be, the protagonists lead an armed revolt against it, and the people who are contracted together do not end up falling in love and happy with it.

*Magical Creature Inheritance-* Rather than just being a way to give the hero more special powers, said inheritance comes with major negative side effects, not least the prejudice of a Wizarding World that looks down on anything associated with magical creatures. Or- Harry becomes a vampire and its a Buffy the Vampire Slayer crossover, because I love Buffy. He's not a fluffy vampire though- the Chosen One is a soulless murder monster Buffyverse vampire.

*Going to an AU-* Canon characters go to a fanfic AU and are thoroughly horrified by how their characters have been butchered. Ron is so horrified by all the Ron the Death Eaters that he ends up turning evil to seek revenge on fanfic writers everywhere.
