Snape adopts Harry/is Harry's father - Snape does not trust either Voldemort or Dumbledore to keep their promises of keeping Lily safe so he decides to follow Voldemort's every step in case he might go after the Potters. He even gets the secret from Wormtail. As Voldemort is about to kill Lily while she's begging for Harry's life, Snape shows up begging Voldemort to kill him instead of Lily. Voldemort obliges but then Snape puts the protection on Lily so it's her that destroys Voldemort's body. We later find out that James ran away in fear. Lily raises Harry telling him that Snape is his father.

Marriage contract - after Harry saves Gabrielle from the lake, Harry is told that she will be her wife and sex slave for life once she comes of age. Because of their beauty, Veela think that they bestow an honor upon a mortal by doing that, but Harry is obsessed with Cho so he refuses. This refusal makes the Veela Council deem Gabrielle as unworthy so they punish her by taking away her beauty and youth and enthusiasm. She returns next year as an old bureaucrat under the guise of Dolores Umbridge to get her revenge on Harry.

Magical Creature Inheritance - The Basilisk develops a crush on Ginny, but Fawkes is in love with the Basilisk. The Basilisk uses its sight to posses Harry and from then on Fawkes keeps getting very sexual with Harry. When Harry and Ginny finally get married, James, Albus and Lily (Harry's kids) are all quarter Basilisk, quarter Phoenix, quarter Potter and quarter Weasley.

Going to an AU - Harry follows Sirius beyond the Veil at the end of OotP and ends up in a world where Lord Hadrian Potter Black Whatever is the actual enemy and Voldemort is part of the resistance. While Lord Hadrian has a harem, the driving force behind his lust for power is Daphne Greengrass who uses her influence to drive him to do all the horrible things such as killing and torturing people. Harry teams up with Voldemort and Manipulative (but good)!Dumbledore to defeat Lord Hadrian and Daphne (who turns out to be the reincarnation of Morgana, while Harry is the reincarnation of Merlin).
