The Wrong Boy/Girl Who Lived - It's actually Molly's Squib cousin's son also born at the end of July. He/She is treated as a Mudblood when the Death Eaters come to power in 1997-1998 and gets sent to Azkaban. There he/she uses the accounting knowledge gained from his/her father to win over the Death Eaters in charge of Azkaban by helping them launder their money (Shawshank Redemption style). Relying on the leniency and preferential treatment he/she receives, he/she forms a cult of Muggle-borns around him/her with the ideology that the time of the old pureblood families' time is over and they need to be exterminated. They form a rebelion, break out of Azkaban, defeat Voldemort and his Death Eaters and enslave them. Voldemort marks him/her as his equal because he has to admit the WB(G)WL is just as capable of gathering followers and the power he knew not were accounting skills.

Neville is the BWL - Bellatrix had a secret crush on Frank Longbottom so when Voldemort goes for the Longbottoms, he wants to spare Frank and it's his sacrifice that protects Neville. The story is essentially the same, minus the Dursleys and with Bellatrix as Potions Mistress.

Ron is a Death Eater - Ron doesn't believe in blood purity or all that stuff but instead joins Voldemort because he wants to learn the Dark Arts and become the next Dark Lord. He proves himself so loyal and efficient that Voldemort makes him his protege. Ron eventually learns about the Horcruxes, destroys them, poisons Voldemort and because he was so close to their leader, the Death Eaters accept him as his natural successor. He takes over the magical world and uses his power to put an end to the bias against Muggle-borns and the mistreatment of House Elves. Turns out he did all of this out of love for Hermione.
