To be fair, a lot of the things you probably dislike about Pureblood Pretense are either things drawn from the Lioness series (the crossover series that inspired it), are phased out by the second book, or have plot reasons that appear later to make it make sense. For instance, she's a vegetarian for a reason that you learn later, not just to be a hipster cool!girl. The writing also gets massively technically better by the time third book comes around. But I recognize it's a lot of time to put into something that doesn't hook you from the beginning. It's your time and your reading preference, I just gotta put in for one of my favorite series either way ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜‰.
