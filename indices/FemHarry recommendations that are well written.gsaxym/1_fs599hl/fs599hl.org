Linkffn(Yule Ball Panic by Philosophize) Linkffn(The odds were never in my favour by Antony444)

Personally Yule Ball Panic and its sequels are some of the best Fanfiction which edits very little from the Canon world.

The odds were never in my favor uses the canon world and adds to it in very interesting ways.
