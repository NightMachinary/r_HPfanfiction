Not sure on everything you said you disliked but effects and side effects is one of the best fem harry I've ever read. It does avoid the usual thing where they write harry as a girl just so they dont have to describe his junk but it's not horribly smutty. I'd give it a strong R rating but its gradual as they also deal with some of Harry's issues from growing up with the dursleys.
