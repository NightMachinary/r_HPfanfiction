And She Wears A Crown of Merigold: liknffn(12306575) MOD Female Harry lives in the Village hidden in the leaves and gets pissed when she's summoned to seal the nine tails inside Naruto by Minato (Who is basically her only real friend in this story.) A nice little one shot that is easy to get through.

The Unrelenting Frozen Sea: linkffn(10793290) a Percy Jackson Crossover that I remember enjoying a while back though it might not have aged so well. Female Harry is a daughter of Poseidon.

What Happens in Vegas linkffn(10561760) Female Harry is dragged to magical Los Vegas to loosen up by Tonks and a Reluctant Remus after the events of book 5. She ends up getting married to Raven of the teen titans.

Not Who She Seems linkffn(8425161) Female Harry is the Daughter of Lily Potter who is the younger sister of Thor and Loki in this story. I remember enjoying this alot and it had some fun character interactions especially with Cedric.
