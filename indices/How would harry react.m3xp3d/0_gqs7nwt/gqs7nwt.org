I think there'd be a fair amount of stunned silence on both sides.

HP magic is in many ways much more powerful that Dresden magic. Transfiguration can create and destroy matter, something which breaks the Dresden rules of magic, and even changing the form of something in the Dresden universe is incredibly complex magic. A lot of the more conceptual charms like the Fidelius are just not possible in the physics-based, mechanistic magic of the Dresden universe. And of course, Harry Potter can cast magic continuously for hours on end without breaking a sweat, whereas Dresden casts 3 spells and he's already talking about how tired he is.

On the flip side, the range of Dresden magic is far greater than HP magic, and the ability to cast magic on people half-way around the world through a sympathetic link is not something we see in HP magic. And on top of that, you have the beings like Mab, whose power can affect the whole Earth e.g. through affecting the seasons.

In many ways, it's a matter of breadth vs depth.

The power of Dresdenverse magic is very broad - that is, it has a large scale, able to affect things over large areas and long distances. But it must fight against the natural forces of the universe to do so, and is a constant strain on the caster.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter wizards are only really able to affect their immediate surroundings (with some notable exceptions). But within their immediate surroundings, an HP wizard has greater depth of power than a Dresdenverse being. A competent HP wizard is basically a very localised omnipotent god. HP magic does not struggle against the natural laws of the universe, but completely breaks those rules. It's basically a set of cheat codes. The constraints on magic are those dictated by magical law, not natural law.

When it comes to wizard vs. wizard action, HP magic operates on the "the problem is, the other side has magic too" principle, i.e. that the real problem for wizards is not overcoming natural forces, but overcoming opposing magic. Wizard on wizard conflict within the HP system is the question of what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. But I'm not sure that Dresden magic counts as "opposing magic" for this purpose, because Dresden magic is ultimately just energy, working within the same system of natural law as physics. It's neither an unstoppable force nor an immovable object, because Dresden magic cannot break the laws of the universe like HP magic can. So my view is that HP magic would be able to "cheat code" Dresden magic in the same way it cheat codes physics.

I briefly entertained the idea of an [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10781800/4/False-Starts][HP/Dresden crossover]] that was Voldemort-centric. I had Mab encounter Voldemort and be immediately fascinated with him, because to her perception his HP magic seemed like the power of the White God, only on a smaller scale - the power of creation itself, able to make something from nothing.
