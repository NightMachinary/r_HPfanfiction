Well, the thing with Harry's character, canonically speaking, is that he's not too impressed with grand titles, long histories, etc. He's a rather practical person whose focus is on moral action.

So I suspect he would take a rather "Sam Vimes" approach of "I don't care how old you are, ma'am, property damage is against the law so I'm going to have to arrest you. What's that? You're a god? Well, I don't know about that, ma'am, but to my knowledge there's no exception in the law for gods, so I'm afraid you're going to have to come with me."

It's also fun to imagine how a more prejudiced HP wizard might approach the situation. Someone like Umbridge only more magically powerful.

"Ethniu, is it? Well, as a being of near-human intelligence, you will be subject to the Regulation on..."

I think probably the best character for /fascination/ with the situation would be Hermione. She's probably the character who would be most intellectually engaged with the idea of ancient gods, angels and demons, wanting to find out more about their history, nature, etc.
