I also think if one where to write a hp/dresden crossover, harry would have to go to dresden verse, because I don't think dresden would do well in hp verse. I say this because you would have to make whoever crossed over be beholden to that universes laws of magic. If you didn't, both chars would be OP in the others respective universe. Dresden would me a fucking god in hp verse with his insane range of magic, and harry would be flat out rediculous in dresden verse being able to just cast endlessly as well as just flat out being able to avada anyone he wanted if he wanted

I actually think hermione would be the best to cross over in that regard. She's very intelligent and would be able to adapt to the new laws that are beholden to magic, and she would eat up all the new ways to apply magic much faster than harry due to her rabid thirst for knowledge. Plus I can't lie, it would be cute as hell to see her all giddy when she gets to learn something new every 10 seconds. And seeing her come face to face with fallen angles, fairies and gods such as odin would be a treat to see if written well

Edit: also, hermiones personality would mesh in some ways a lot more with dresden than harry, as dresden is quite academically inclined compared to harry
