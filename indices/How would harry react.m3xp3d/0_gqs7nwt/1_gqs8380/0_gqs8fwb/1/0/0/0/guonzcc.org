What do you mean? Are you referring to your own post, or something?

No, your post made sense. The only thing that doesn't make sense is that people read things like Awaken Sleeper, and Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain, and actually enjoy them without a doubt tickling at the back of their minds. I suspect that they have not actually read the Dresden Files.
