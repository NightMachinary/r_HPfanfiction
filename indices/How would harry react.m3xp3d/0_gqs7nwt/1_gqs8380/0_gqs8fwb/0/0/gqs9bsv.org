  I think any of the HP verse characters would shit a brick seeing the eye of balor go off from a 15ft tall literally skin-with-bronze "giant" as it destroys entire city blocks in one go.

I don't think this is really that different from a giant trashing an entire town in HBP, with an effect equivalent to a powerful hurricane. To which Fudge's response was:

  “The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, we've had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we've got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can't find the giant --- it's been a disaster.”

Nor is it really all that different to Pettigrew blowing up a street, which again elicited a somewhat routine Ministry response of "show up and cover up".

The HP world is pretty innately wacky, with its Theme Hospital-esque magical injuries and casual, officious approach to mass destruction.
