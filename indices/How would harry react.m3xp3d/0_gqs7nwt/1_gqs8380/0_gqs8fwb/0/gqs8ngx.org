See I think in some ways you are right, but I also feel in some ways your making the characters seem too nonchalant about it. Like in my mind, I think any of the HP verse characters would shit a brick seeing the eye of balor go off from a 15ft tall literally skin-with-bronze "giant" as it destroys entire city blocks in one go.

I guess while I can see the characters responding how you said they would, I feel like those would be more crack fic responses than realistic responses
