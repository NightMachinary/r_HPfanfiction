Actually, no. HP magic is not more "powerful" than DF magic. The magic of HPverse is improbable and impossible, and contains limitations which make no sense. DF magic is powerful, but bound and constrained by rules. And middle-to-upper crust of HP wizards could not do the more complex things at all.

Apparition during a fight? Pshaw. Apparition was only used to run away, and by experienced Aurors no less. And that's why Death Eaters used Anti-Apparition wards.

Fiendfyre? It does not depend upon the power of the caster and is controlled by something that we do not know. Basically, it is a plot-device. It consumes all magical objects and is sentient, but we do not know about its limitations. Any high-power Wizard in Dresdenverse could replicate it with effort.

We have seen Transfiguration work on only magically summoned /energies./ It will not work on the fire which is normally used by Wardens, as it is only slightly different than normal fire. Transfiguration does not work upon, say the forces of gravity, and will never work upon a blob of liquid fire summoned directly at the position where your head should be (I'm looking at you, Hannah Ascher).

We do not know about how the Hidden Halls of Edinburgh are hidden. It might have a mechanism similar to that of the Fidelius charm. And, creating a Ward to ward off hundreds of Red Court Vampires and Outsiders (which are literally Lovecraftian horrors) at just a moment's notice, is a feat which Dumbledore, Voldemort, or Grindelwald, even with the help of the Deathstick can scarcely hope to replicate.

Any person who caused the Krakatoa explosion, or the Tunguska event, I'm going to consider to be more powerful than a person who couldn't even take over a school of teenagers, even with all of Magical Britain's resources at hand.
