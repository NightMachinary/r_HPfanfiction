Honestly, I'm not sure whether the Battle Grounds would be the best place to have Potter drop into the Dresden-verse.

There's a lot of interesting ideas, though--the Knights of the Cross for example. Michael would be disgusted with Fudge.

And I'd pay through the nose to see Mad-Eye Moody interact with the Blackstaff.
