  since there are so few actual DF stories with... you know, a story

While I agree with your main body, this quote I just can't agree with. I have read all 16 or 17 dresden books, multiple times, each one absolutely has a story. The mistake your making is that dresden files as a while is one giant story. While potter books have more individual story identity, dresden files are all smaller story arcs that all tie into one giant story arc. Every single book in dresden files so far is leading to the BAT (big armageddon trilogy), where as potter stories are more individualistic. Another thing to point out is the dresden books feed off the previous book in the series a lot more than the potter books do. The potter books, as a whole have minimal impact on the next book on the series, where as the dresden files books are extremely dependant on the events of previous books. When you look at it this way, you see that dresden files is really a singular story split thus far into 17 volumes with 6 more on the way if we include the BAT.
