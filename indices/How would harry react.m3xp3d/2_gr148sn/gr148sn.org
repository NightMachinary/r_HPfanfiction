What'd happen if Harry "I won't stun a person cos then he might die" Potter got dropped in the middle of that shitshow? He'd likely get absolutely wrecked very, very quickly. It's just a bad spot to throw him into, honestly. Maybe if he was around in that world a bit more and time to adapt to it, etc, he'd manage to do something.

The two versees don't really interact well, either. You can't have them existing side-by-side, which means you'll need to grab HP and throw him into DF, or vice versa. Then the difference in magic systems might be fun, but since there are so few actual DF stories with... you know, a story, it might be better to just write that. xD
