It drives me pretty crazy when the characters are obviously mouthpieces for the author's feelings to the detriment of characterization and established character relationships.

Yeah, Dumbledore did some questionable things, but the characters all still respected him even if they had complicated feelings about his actions and they'd never refer to him as 'Dumb as a Door' or 'the old coot'. Yeah, the Order of the Phoenix was loyal to Dumbledore possibly to a fault and made mistakes, but none of our 'heroic' characters would call them 'the Order of the Fried Chicken'. Harry would never rhapsodize about how Ron is just as bad as Draco, the Weasley children would never shittalk their mother, etc. etc. etc. etc. It's okay for the story to confront bad things characters did in canon, but keep the characters reactions consistent with who they are.
