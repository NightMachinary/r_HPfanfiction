I really don't understand why people write time travel stories if they are going to let everything happen again with minor changes.

I don't get the hate for Ron tbh, he's a normal guy with tons of insecurities. There are more reasons to hate Hermione than Ron imo.

I don't mind a character being OP, but I wish people would put more effort into the progression. Like rituals that the main character researches instead of going to the Goblins and getting it done or finding a book with rituals so easy that a 11 year old kid could do it. The goblin rituals , huge powerboost from magical maturity and all those things feels like lazy writing.
