I have a few, which is odd, considering I've read just a few fics:

use of movie canon or characters from Hogwarts mystery game in fics;

tactlessness shown as some sort of charming character trait, particularly in Tonks case. This is why I ended up hating her;

pre full moon symptoms that are related to sexual drive or anger;

noticible americanisms, like vacation or fall. It's lazy not to correct these, even if fanfic is just a hobby.

â€‹

mixing up canon details that were repeated many times,like Dumbledore wearing horn-rimmed glasses. Has he stollen them from Percy?;

Long discussions of 'do you like him' or 'you should date him'. They aren't annoying usually, but they can be if they sound like something from a particularly stupid romantic comedy;

emphasising how cool it is that a woman doesn't cry.Crying is not a sin.
