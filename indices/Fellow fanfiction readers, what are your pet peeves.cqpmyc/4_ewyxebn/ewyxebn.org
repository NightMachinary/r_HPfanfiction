This is a bit more general than just Harry Potter but applies here too.

Whenever someone is pregnant, there's bound to be problems with the pregnancy. There'll be an accident (falling off the stairs seems like a used example) and then there's fear of miscarriage. If the pregnancy continues, it's very unlikely to carry on the full term. The birth is difficult and there's rarely only one child.
