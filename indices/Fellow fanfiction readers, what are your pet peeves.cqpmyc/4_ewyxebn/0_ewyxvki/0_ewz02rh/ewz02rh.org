I suppose that's where it comes from and then writers think that's the way a character pregnancy has to be dealt with like it wouldn't be interesting enough without the drama.

I don't encounter fics with pregnancy all the time but when I do, I tend to get a bit annoyed or sometimes, I soundlessly congratulate the writer for exceeding my expectations.
