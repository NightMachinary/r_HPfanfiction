  Harry went shopping in muggle London and bought 5 pairs of pants, 3 pairs of new sneakers, and some t-shirts that fit him. He then wrote Hermione and told her that the Weasels were evil and fumbledork was manipulating him. He decided to start exercising so he went for a run every morning, about 5 blocks one way and another 5 back. When he got back he went to the restroom before having a donut for breakfast.
