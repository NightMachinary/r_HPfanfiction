Outside of all the Harry gets a million titles and a billion gallleons with it, probably my most hated problem with fics are giving a 12 year old shut-in British child from the 1980s who's just now experiencing the world for the first time the brains, vocabulary, and mannerisms of a 40 year old genius master level war strategist Victorian prince.

It takes me clear out of the story when I'm rolling my eyes every time Harry is kissing someone's knuckles or bowing when he's never been taught to. Or he's monologuing how he's put one past ole tommy boy moldywarts or dumb as a door.
