Bashing doesn't ruin a fic for me, but I never like it when it's present. Bashing is never a good thing, with the possible exception of crack fics.

Then there's tropes that will probably make me stop reading a fic completely: mpreg, romantic soulbonds, fics with an imminent bad ending in the form of heartbreak (which has caused me to spoil endings to fics if I suspect this is going to happen). I never liked mpreg, ever. I've read fics with romantic soulbonds (hell, I even thought Debt of Time was a decent fic at the time I read it), but they've never improved a story IMO (not even in that fic -- I just found it offputting), so I no longer read fics which has them. I've never been able to deal with fics where the protagonist experiences heartbreak well unless I know things get better. If I suspect this with how things are going, or am reading a fic with a trope/pairing especially prone to this, I have a habit of spoiling the ending and, if it has this, run away from it.

These aren't the /only/ things that make me stop read fics, but they're the most usual ones present in my personal little corner of fanfic preferences. For example, I stay away from the Indy!Harry trope or the Tomarry ship, but I also happen to not really read Harry-centric fics much in general, so it wasn't worth a mention.
