Personally I really enjoyed it, but I was hesitant like you to start it. I ended up just reading some of the later chapters, and then going back to the beginning after. It's not really one you need to have read everything before to make sense, so I'd try reading a couple chapters to see if you like it. It's generally pretty well written, but at some points the grammer isn't perfect. If you like a badass Harry that makes a difference, its a good one. The author mixes in Runes, and healing magic in a way I've never seen before, so I really enjoyed that aspect. It's also very well paced, mixing in the past with the present. The present chapters are really interesting.
