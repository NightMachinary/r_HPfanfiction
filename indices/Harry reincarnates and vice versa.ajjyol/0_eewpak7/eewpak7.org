linkffn(10709411) Harry get's sent back to Merlins time, and has to live out the time until the present. He becomes known throughout history, changing his name every 150 years or so. He is the son of Merlin, adopted son of Arthur, and Salazar Slytherin himself. It's a great fic, and it mixes in the past with the present really well. One of the best I've read in a while.
