Harry is autistic in The Little Bat by Elvirakitties, but it's a Severus/Tom Riddle and a bit cracky, not to mention Dumbledore-bashing and still in progress. But hey, it's a neurodivergent Harry. linkao3(11811135)

There was a mentor!Snape fic I read once but can't remember---wish I could!---where one of the Dursley rules was for Harry to "not think," so he trained himself to keep his mind jumping from topic to topic. In a detention, Snape tells him something like, "don't even think about X," and he reflects that he has a lot of practice at that. Later Snape berates him for not concentrating, and finds out about his self-taught deficiency.
