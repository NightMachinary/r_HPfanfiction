Lots of original plot. There's so much original stuff you tend to drown in it. Beating Voldemort and another original dark wizard are objectives, but very differently than usual. The author SI is a minor side character, a muggle living in America who occasionally listens to the radio and provides a perspective of how an everyday person experiences all of the crazyness that's going on. There's a Hermione ship with a real person, but it's a minor side thing. There's actually quite a few real people, including Bill Clinton, the entire British royal family, Rasputin, Osama Bin Laden and Kim Jong-Il.
