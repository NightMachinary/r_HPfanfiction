My favorite genre!

I highly recommend lupinslittlesis's series about Sirius. The first one is called Deny Thy Father. Link: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lupinslittlesister/DTF.html]]

Also amazing (but dark) is NyxFix's A Feast in Azkaban, one of my all time favorite fics. linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/2454211/1/A-Feast-in-Azkaban]])

I'll try to think of more!

And sorry my linking is strange. I'm new to this subreddit, and on mobile. :/
