Shame there is only one example of Hermione dying in the troll attack although it's not surprising. Hermione is such a popular character and at the same time very important to the plot that removing her would give the writer a huge and difficult challenge.

Anyway the closest example I could think of is in Harry Potter without Harry Potter linkffn(7781192). In which Hermione is forced to leave Hogwarts by her parents after the troll attack.
