Could people stop downvoting stories just because they dislike them personally? The original post is asking for stories where Hermione dies in the troll attack. Right now, this is the only story in the comments that fulfils the criteria. If you don't like it, that's fine, but it's stupid to just downvote it. Let the OP know why you think it /doesn't/ fit what he's asking for instead.
