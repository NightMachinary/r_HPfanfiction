  is 2 actually bad? it seems more like a strict reading of cannon vs forgiving view of cannon (like there is no reason presented but we will assume their is a good reason for it, seems to be what you are looking for?)

Hmm, not by itself, no. It is bad if the author is trying to write a story that aligns with the world built by the original author, in which case it would count as not doing their research.

However, because “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality” is a massively AU story, one in which the basic premise and the very baseis of the original story are taken and then everything else is built from scratch on top of it, instead of making it bad it makes for an interesting “what if” scenario due to all the world-building done for the story.

That being said, some of the things he did give an explanation to for his version of the story actually could be explained in a much better way. The bit about the gold and making money, for example, uses the old and trite “galleons are worth more gold but sold for that much only because both wizards and goblins are utter cretins and nobody ever had noticed for reasons that make no sense” thing, which does fit the setting and all but is kind of a poor man's exit from the problem. Though, of course, it is possible that in the world of his creation that simply is the case, but this means it is not because Rowling made it so but because he did.
