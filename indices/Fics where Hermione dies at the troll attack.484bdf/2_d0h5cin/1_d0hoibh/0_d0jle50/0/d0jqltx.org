The real issue with 2 is that it is a quite honestly infantile reading of canon, ignoring the reality of the not-fully reliable narrator.

And that is true with Indy!Harry, but I was only really discussing it in the context of MoR. Though yes, the strawman wizarding society is my least favorite part of Indy!Harry stories.

And honestly? When I started viewing it as a less serious work, I came to really enjoy MoR, because then it fulfilled my one guiding rule of reading HPFF: Does it entertain me enough to keep reading?

EDIT: Changed fanon to canon. Stupid typos.
