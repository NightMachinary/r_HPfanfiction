  Yudkowzky is a funny and relatively talented writer, regardless if you support his offshoot-rationality mindset or his preaching. The fic stands on it's own as a entertaining read, and with writing better than the vast majority of other fanfiction. Give it a read, if you haven't.

This entire statement is true. Frankly, the only issues with Yudkowzky's writing (from a technical point, not a plot/holy-shit-this-shit-he's-preaching-is-insane point) is the fact that he doesn't understand pacing and that long, didactic internal monologues happen way, way, way too often.

Sure, the wizarding society he has set up is ridiculous, because he

1. didn't actually read the Harry Potter books

2. assumed that what we saw of wizarding society in the books was the totality of it (when it came to things like logic, etc.)

3. set up the wizarding world as a strawman

And sure, the philosophy he is espousing is cult-like, and of the irritating 'I am so very super special smart' unique snowflakeism variety that just seems to piss people off.

But it is highly entertaining, and better than the vast majority of other fanfiction. Honestly, if you read it as crack (because of the ridiculous wizarding society, dementors as death representations, the humanism super Patronus and the utterly immature plans-within-plans-within-plans^{plans} variety of he-knows-that-I-know-that-he-knows-that-you-get-the-idea spy v spy stuff) it becomes a hell of a lot better.
