This is the eighth SS/HG thread you've made in the past fifteen days. You might want to space them out a bit, or perhaps do some hunting for what exactly you would like yourself. Ao3 has a nifty tagging system and you can sort the tag/relationship you want to read by how many have bookmarked it, left a kudos or a comment, etc. I hope this helps.

In any case, I tentatively recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7401394/chapters/16812232][Breathe]] despite its short length and incomplete nature. It's been a while since I've read it, admittedly, but the few words it had really resonated with me. I don't want to spoil it, so I'll let you decide if it'll be of interest. Happy reading!
