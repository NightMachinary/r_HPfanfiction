This happens in The After Life by Th3Alchemist. linkffn(13120415) Its a Harry/Hermione fic but at the beginning she is dating Ron and a meeting between both families make Hermione realise how biggoted the Weasleys really are and she is utterly ashamed. Her parents are so shocked by the meeting that they decide not to have anything to do with the wizarding world to the point they decide to kick Hermione out once she goes back go Hogwarts. (The worse os that they have good logical reasons to do so).

Eventually they meet Harry (unbeknowsnt to Hermione) and their fate toward the magical world and their daughter is restored.

Its a really good fic, I recommand.
