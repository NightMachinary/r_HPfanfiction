They like twist endings? ...So do I?

More seriously, I think the "problem" here insofar as there is one is that somethign like [[/r/WritingPrompts]] can usually only get its contributors to do short stories or novellas, and there's a long-standing tradition for a great many short stories to have twist endings.
