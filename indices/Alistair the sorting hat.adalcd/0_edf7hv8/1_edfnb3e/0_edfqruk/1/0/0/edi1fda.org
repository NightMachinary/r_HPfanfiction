Huh. I could have sworn she was mentioned as Slytherin in the books, but I suppose you're right. Her predecessor, Queenie Greengrass, is listed as Slytherin in the handwritten Original 40 list featured in 'Harry Potter and Me', though I know some people don't consider literally anything but the books themselves as valid canon.

By 'character' , I mean 'a name given by JKR in the books' - someone once tried to tell me that, name and all, she was never in the books.
