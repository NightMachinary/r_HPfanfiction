No, it's not canonical. I think one fic came up with it and enough other people thought it was a good enough idea to pump into their own fic that after a while, some people kind of absorbed it through fanfiction osmosis, unaware that it wasn't at all canon. Kinda like Daphne Greengrass, Wards, etc.
