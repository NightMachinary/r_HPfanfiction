Hey guys! I've been in the server for a few months now and one addition that I'd really like to make to the above most is that the model is really, really open to new ideas and worldbuilding suggestions. Wandlore, how magic is approached in other countries, the history of the wizarding world outside of the past century, how different natural abilities are passed down, pretty much everything is up for discussion and people are really encouraged to share their preferred fanons and ideas. Even if not everything can be accepted as 'model canon', most things do end up being at least taken into account!
