Remove 95% of the plot and world building to turn it into a pure smutfic centered around Harry's conquests. Also, he'd be a lot closer to his canon characterisation, so no of that completely unbelievable "13 year old boy dominates everyone" crap. Screw around? He's a celebrity and the star player, of course he'd have game. But definitely not in the way the author wrote it.
