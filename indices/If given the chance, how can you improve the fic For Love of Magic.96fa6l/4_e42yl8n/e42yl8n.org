Get the author to stop binge-watching bad porn, learn what a human being is, and, one hopes, pretend to be one.

Seriously.

I read the story and found it to be a cry for help from a sociopath wanting to be something less than the creepy uncle other relatives warn their children not to be around at family reunions, not fiction proper. There's so much distilled fridge horror and rape fantasy, it should be tossed into the midden heap of Kinsfire-esque shitfictions and left there to rot or burn.
