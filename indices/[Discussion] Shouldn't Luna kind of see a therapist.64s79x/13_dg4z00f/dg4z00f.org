I think it might be possible, that mental illness' could be a result of some kind of magic accident, or just exposure, even in muggles. Maybe, especially in muggles, since they are not magical and therefore less resistant to its effect(hence no magical psychology).

Perhaps, some magics can be radioactive, of sorts, and alternate a person's psyche. And if we assume that magic is everywhere, some moments especially emotional or traumatic ones can be charged with this "radiation" and lead to PTSD, for example.

Schizophrenia can be an openness to the world, ability to see things that are normally concealed, inner workings of the world and a subsequent struggle to comprehend them. Probably, what Luna has.

Just a little theory of mine.
