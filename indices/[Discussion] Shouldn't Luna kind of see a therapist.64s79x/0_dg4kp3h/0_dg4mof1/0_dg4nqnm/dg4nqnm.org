Nope, not in canon. Some of the better stories i've read have them going to muggles who know about the masquerade or have to carefully edit their stories to tell them though a few stories have some good mindhealer stuff edit: though a lot of stories have absolutely horrible mindhealers who can do anything. I have a mindhealer in darkness ascendant, your choice if she's good or not. At the moment she's a throwaway chara kinda but in a few years she'll be harry's mindhealer potentially.
