I would! If I have an invisible friend (well, I don't - hypothetically speaking), people recommend therapy/a shrink - but if thousands or millions have such a friend we should accept it and think it's cool? Sorry but: Fuck this! I mean I don't care if somebody worships who- or whatever in private, but treating religion as the default position is a wrong asumption IMHO and it's even more wrong if those religious people influence laws etc. (why do people who don't believe that claptrap have to live by those laws? Sorry, I don't believe in a sky-daddy (otherwise called a "god") and I don't want to follow the rules of people who do! Best example: Abortion - Many Christians are against it and want it forbidden, but why should society care what Christians want? It's not like they can forbid abortion for themselves (note: This should still mean that their kids can get one if they want to! Having a kid or not should never be the choice of somebody else but the mother IMHO!) and follow that rule to the letter - funnily enough: They don't, many campaigners are very hypocritical in that they have abortions when having a kid doesn't fit their schedule, but they still continue to fight against it afterwards (!)...recently read an article about that, I was stumped how people can live like that! They fight against something, but use it themselves!)
