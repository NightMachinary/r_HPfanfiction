  Great - but: Would you guys really want to be lumped in with all the crazy?

I'm not an atheist but I am familiar with the phenomenon. These "atheist churches" sprouted up because the members missed the aspect of community. Or the music. Or the organization. And some atheists attend Unitarian-Universalist services, which emphasize social justice.

  I mean all religious people are IMHO delusional (loved the book "The God Delusion" - Thanks Mr. Dawkins!)
#+end_quote

I. Am. Not. Delusional. Have you ever actually discussed religion or spirituality outside of the Internet?

You bring up Dawkins? Have you ever read the works of atheists who found faith? C.S. Lewis? Lee Strobel?

  hell, by starting an "Atheist Church" you kind of go down to the fucking level of SCIENTOLOGY (that fucking sect started by a fifth rated (if not worse!) science fiction author should IMHO be forbidden!), I just don't know if that's worth it!
#+end_quote

I am insulted on behalf of all atheists for that statement. And Ron L. Hubbard is one of the best science fiction writers of the twentieth century. If you think he's "fifth rate," than I am genuinely curious to see what masters of wordsmithing you consider to be good.

  ps: Germany is great this way, we have a lot of atheists here (former East-Germany (the disbanded German Democratic Republic!) had a lot of non-believers because they tried to get people away from church during the cold war (when that part of Germany was under socialist/communist "management"))

You do realize that the Soviets had a habit of slaughtering priests and other religious figures? They had a god, and it was the State. That's not exactly something to get excited about.

  so we kind of have a voice in parliament (sure the believers often manage to drown us out (in certain instances they really pile on the pressure and muslims stand with jews and christians against us non-believers...strange right?)
#+end_quote

If by "voice in Parliament" you mean advocating for complete secularization of society. I haven't forgotten that Germany outlawed home-schooling, and threatened Christian parents with arrest.

Also, the inter-religious conflicts of the Abrahamic religions is far more complicated than what your statements imply. And I don't know where you get your sources, but in the West, Christians and observant Jews have been getting along recently--to use your juvenile terms, we like each other.
