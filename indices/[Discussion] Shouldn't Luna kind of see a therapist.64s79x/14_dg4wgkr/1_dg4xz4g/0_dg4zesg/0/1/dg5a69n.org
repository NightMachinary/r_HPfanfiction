Great - but: Would you guys really want to be lumped in with all the crazy? (If this offends people: I am sorry!) I mean all religious people are IMHO delusional (loved the book "The God Delusion" - Thanks Mr. Dawkins!)...hell, by starting an "Atheist Church" you kind of go down to the fucking level of SCIENTOLOGY (that fucking sect started by a fifth rated (if not worse!) science fiction author should IMHO be forbidden!), I just don't know if that's worth it!

ps: Germany is great this way, we have a lot of atheists here (former East-Germany (the disbanded German Democratic Republic!) had a lot of non-believers because they tried to get people away from church during the cold war (when that part of Germany was under socialist/communist "management")), so we kind of have a voice in parliament (sure the believers often manage to drown us out (in certain instances they really pile on the pressure and muslims stand with jews and christians against us non-believers...strange right? Normally those groups don't like each other!) - especially when they allow stuff like Male-Genital-Mutilation (otherwise known as circumcision!) for religious reasons (note: I know that people say it has health-benefits, but I've looked into those studies etc. and all of those that I've found are totally bonkers and IMHO this practice only started in the US because the church wanted to prohibit masturbation!)....right, it's ok to mutilate your kid because you believe...right...what's next? Religious canibalism? (yeah I am exaggerating!))
