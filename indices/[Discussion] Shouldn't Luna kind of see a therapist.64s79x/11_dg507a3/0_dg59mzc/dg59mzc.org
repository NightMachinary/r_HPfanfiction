Maybe - I don't agree but it's better than seer Luna :( (I like Harry and Hermione think divination is a load of bunk, I mean look at that prophecy about Harry and Voldemort: It only became true because all sides believed in it and thus made it a self-fullfilling prophecy! If Voldemort didn't give a damnd about it nothing would have happened, same if the Potters hadn't prepared for Voldemort finding them (IMHO that blood-protection isn't just love, sorry but I would say more mothers died to protect their children but none lived because nobody was invoking ancient magical protections!), same for Dumbledore stashing Harry at the Durleys! If Harry had been brought up differently and had something worth living for then he wouldn't have accepted that he had to die in the end (so no self-sacrifice!) etc. etc.)
