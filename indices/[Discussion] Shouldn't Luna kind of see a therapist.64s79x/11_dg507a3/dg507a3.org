I personally think that she was ment to be special in the same way that other witches and wizards are. Harry can talk to snakes, Prof Trelaeny(sp is wrong i know) has "the sight" and can on rare occasions see the future. Who is to say that Luna and her father both have a weird personality, but also something.... Something more. And that something lets them see MAGICAL creaturrs that use their magic, like the threshals, to be invisable. Only with these creatures the way to see them is not by watching someone die, but having some MAGICAL ABILITY. Or even being exposed to some sort of event in the same way threshals require. But that event wasnt mentioned or anything because Luna was just a side character.

Just some thoughts.

Sorry for bad spelling. Dyslexic.
