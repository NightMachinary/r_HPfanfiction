Honestly it wouldn't have been to hard to recruit Luna. You've read my story so you know that when she did get in contact with a Dark Wizard, she as all to willing to do whatever it took to earn his love and affection and it nearly ended with her getting killed. If a death eater had shown Luna even a little love and affect before Harry and co did, she would have fallen over herself to get more.
