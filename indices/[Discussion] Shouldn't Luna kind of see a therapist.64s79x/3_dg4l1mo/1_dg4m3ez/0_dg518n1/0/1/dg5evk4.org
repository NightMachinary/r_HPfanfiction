I seriously doubt Voldemort would have been able to recruit Harry whether he killed his parents or not.

Unlike Snape Harry is a kind person, with a very solid moral code. He doesn't tolerate assholes, even if (like in the case of James) he really really wants to like them, he acknowledges the fact that they are behaving badly.
