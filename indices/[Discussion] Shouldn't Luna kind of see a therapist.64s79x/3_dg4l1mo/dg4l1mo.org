I couldn't agree more. Luna is a very broken little girl. She watched her mother die, helpless and unable to do anything and probably blames herself for that. Her father seems to love her, but also completely incapable of helping her properly either because of his own grief or the fact that he is, you know, nuts.

I think the imaginary creatures and obsession with unreality are coping mechanisms for Luna. I think she's probably naturally spacey and a bit odd, but the lack of nuturing and trauma made it far worse. Then of course, there is the complete lack of friends. She was in her FOURTH year before she made even ONE friend, and for crying out loud Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not exactly close with her! The girl needs help, and is not a crazy awesome seer or genki girl. She's a broken bird who needs some love and affection and a better grounding in reality.
