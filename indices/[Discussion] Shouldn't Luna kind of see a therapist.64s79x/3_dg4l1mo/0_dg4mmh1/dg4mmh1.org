Yeah, Luna might naturally be loner oddball prone to space out and day-dream (without the grief and the delusions she gets through her dad), but she would not be, well, totally nuts and delusional - and she certainly wouldn't believe in all sorts of creatures that don't exist and in stuff like the "rottfang conspiracy" :D

Yeah, Ravenclaw wasn't good for her - IMHO Hufflepuff might have helped her more (hell, even Gryffindor might have because the insensitive lions would have probably - rather rudly - told her to "snap out of it"!) - the bullying there made things worse (but what would you expect from a group of people who think they are better than everybody else because they are bookish and intelligent (note: Not all of them, but most Ravenclaws seem kind of arrogant...kind of like most Slytherins, but without the blood-purity crap and the snobbishness that many rich folks have!)

Yeah, I'd love a fanfiction where Harry runs into her early on and swears to help her (doing so might also help him with his own demons!)
