You know, I hear there is this really cool story called linkffn(Like a Red Headed Stepchild by mugglesftw) (also known as me) that features Luna. She might even end up in the Weasley, I mean Gryffindor, house.

She did have kind of a traumatic first year, and to be fair her second year is going to be a bit rough, but she's 100% going to get the love and support she needs. And by that, I mean therapy and family.
