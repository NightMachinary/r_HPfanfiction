  I'm serious. Nearly every character we know in the books/movies is in some way mentally ill, deficient, or unstable.

How?

I mean, I'm aware that lots of people argue that the characters /should/ have more emotional problems, given the experiences they have been through. But aside from Luna, I don't think we see any character displaying any actual symptoms of mental illness. So the claim that they all need "mind healing" seems somewhat baseless.
