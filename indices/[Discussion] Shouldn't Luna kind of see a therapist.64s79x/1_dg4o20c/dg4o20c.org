We know (or can take an educated guess) that Luna uses her creatures to cope. That in itself is not necessarily a bad thing. Everybody copes with stress differently and Luna does it by giving things names and backstories to explain the world around her. Thats one thing.

Then I would assume that mental health isn't really a /thing/ in the wizarding world. Ginny didn't get treatment. Children were just sent back to their dorms after life threatening situations. There seems to be no such thing as psychological healthcare in the magical world.

And for my last statement, I'd guess that being odd is normal enough in the wizarding world to not warrant special attention. Its still perceived as a weakness, and therefore an easy target for bullies, but i'd go out on a limb here and say that in terms of mental health, no one seriously thinks Luna needs help.

As to the stuff like the Rotfang Conspiracy... I mean... Its really not that far off the mark of your everyday normal conspiracy theory.
