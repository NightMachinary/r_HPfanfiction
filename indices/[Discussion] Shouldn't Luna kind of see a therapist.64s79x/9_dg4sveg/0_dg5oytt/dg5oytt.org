  Like a couple others have already said...virtually everybody in the universe needs some sort of therapy. It's especially impressive that Harry somehow turned out decent despite being subjected to the Dursley's style of "parenting."

Impressive, but not unknown. Everyone reacts to negative experiences differently, and there's been a lot of research into the psychological quality of "resilience" - the ability to come out of hard circumstances relatively unscathed. It's still not really understood, but recent research suggests that the more one has an internal locus of self - that is to say, the more you believe yourself to be responsible for determining the conditions of your own life - the more resilient you are. And in contrast, the more you attribute external factors as the cause of your life circumstances, the less resilient you are.
