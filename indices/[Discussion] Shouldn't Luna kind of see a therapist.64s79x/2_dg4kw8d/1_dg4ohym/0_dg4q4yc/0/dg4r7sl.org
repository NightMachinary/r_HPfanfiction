Yes, Evanna Lynch is wonderful and definitely did a lot for the character, as well as helpfully being beautiful. I do remember that she was a popular character even before the release of film 5 though!

Fun fact; my cousin auditioned for Luna and got quite far in the process, but ultimately her northern accent didn't have the Luna charm they wanted.
