Luna definitely could use therapy. I think her fandom interpretation stems from the conversation she has with Harry at the end of OOTP and from occasional remarks that show she's perceptive despite seeming spaced out most of the time. Also, Luna in the movies is mostly just eccentric, not mentally ill.
