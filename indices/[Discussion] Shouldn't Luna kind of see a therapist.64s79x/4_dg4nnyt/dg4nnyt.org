Like Hermione you assume that the creatures doesn't exist. If a wizard say to a muggle that magic exist, he would think that he is crazy. If a really smal part of the population (Luna) see things that only they can see, another more idiotic part (Hermione) would think that they are crazy. Rowling never said (I think) if Luna's creature don't exist.
