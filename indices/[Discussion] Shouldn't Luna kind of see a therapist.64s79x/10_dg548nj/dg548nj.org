You have to remember that Wizarding England is stuck closer to Victorian Age (200 years ago) than to today. Even 100 years ago, you had two choices for people with mental disorders. Either they were locked up and had their hair sold to the local wig maker, or they were treated as eccentric and kept at home.

I always imagined that everyone knew Luna had issues, but decided to roll with them instead of causing her trouble. Especially Harry who has his own issues and doesn't want people to pitty him or dig into them.

It isn't right, but it explains the "maybe she's just a little different". Doing what they can for her as friends when they do not have the power to do anything else for her. Especially since by the time they meet Luna they have all pretty much given up on Adults helping them with anything (except Ron who grew up with her and treats her as badly as anyone else).
