You truly think that Mrs. Hermione Rules-and-Adults-are-to-be-obeyed Granger has given up on adults at that point? No way!

She still obeyed Dumbledore when he placed Harry in an information embargo (hell, he didn't even allow them to send him a "Hey pal, how are you?" - even thought Hermione could do so through Muggle-Post, which no Deatheater would ever intercept because they think muggles are beneath them and unworthy of attention!)...and didn't she urge Harry to trust people in the order with the Horcruxes? (Don't remember much about that, I never finished the last book - it read too much as "Hermione Granger and the Deathly Hollows"! Harry was dismantled from the start, he was just the blundering idiot who was there but didn't have a plan and got through all this through luck, chance, Dumbledore's engineering of the situation and the sacrifice of a lot of good people!)
