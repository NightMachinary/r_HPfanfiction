Must have been an unusual child then - never looked up to rules (in fact I always tried to find ways to get away with breaking the rules and pushing boundries!) and most adults weren't people I looked up to either (had some people I idolized, but those weren't your run of the mill adults, more like certain researchers, adventurers, movie-characters etc.)

I am contesting point 3: Having the three of them have a go at it was hard enough (the Weasleys had to find an excuse to keep Ron out of school, so Luna, Neville and Ginny would have needed an excuse, too and it's suspicious if such a large group of people is missing (Hermione was expected to hide, she was a muggleborn and Harry was of course undesireable number 1, so yeah him being in hiding/on the move was expected, too!))

As for 4: Indeed! As for Hermione lying? She was trying to take the blame (something she considers honorable IMHO), sure she didn't actually need to (Ron would have looked bad if she told the teachers why she was there, but over all I don't think anything would have happened, after all Ron was there to kind of trying to fix his mistake!)

Yeah, Potty (note: Yes, I am mocking Harry here!) got lucky a lot, but this book really blew it out of proportion! That a madman like Voldemort would fall for that setup was convenient, but highly unlikely in reality (hell, Draco lying to protect Harry is unlikely, too - you don't just forgive a guy you have hated for 6 years to save him from being killed, especially if you aren't a good person...someone like James Potter (who was an asshole, but still a good person inside!) might lie to save somebody - Draco? Unlikely!)
