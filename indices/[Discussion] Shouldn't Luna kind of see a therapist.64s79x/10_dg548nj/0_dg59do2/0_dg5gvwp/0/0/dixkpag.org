Most kids I knew when I was young to like 12 years of age respected most adults. There was the few troublemakers but they wouldn't do much. Tended to have those who often acted out in later years.

True. Though honestly the Weasley's should have gone into hiding anyway. (Voldemort taking over the ministry, and you are in the order, so send your children to the school that is under his complete control). Neville should've gone into hiding, since he was a prophecy child and his parents were in the order. Admittedly he didn't know he was a prophecy child. (At least I don't think he did?). Luna could have come up with the excuse of searching for <creature here> in the newspaper. Her father could have come with or headed away. Such a large group isn't too suspicious, and also what does it matter if it's suspicious? Several students who are known friends of Undesirable Number #1 and friends.

Lying because you think it's honorable is still lying.

I can easily assume you are mocking Harry when you call Him Potty. I can see Draco not wanting Harry to be killed (Draco just doesn't have the hatred needed). Even if you hate someone for 6 years that doesn't mean you're fine with them being killed, or tortured. It's harder to see him going directly against the death eaters though.
