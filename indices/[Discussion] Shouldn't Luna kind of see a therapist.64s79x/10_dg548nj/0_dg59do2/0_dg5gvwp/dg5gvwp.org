1. Hermione does look up to adults and rules, which is actually normal for a child, while they might still break them it's actually normal.\\
2. There is at least one half-blood who was raised in the muggle world in the death eaters (Snape) who's to say there isn't more? Admittedly if Snape was truly on the side of the death eaters instead of being a spy then he might not have thought of it, except he might've heard of it from other order members or from Dumbledore. I agree with you on that she could've just sent it the muggle way, or given it to an order guard when she was at Grimmauld and they would give it to Harry next time they were on watch duty.\\
3. It probably would have been better if they had trusted more people, most likely their friends. It would have been interesting to have Luna, Neville, and Ginny along for Deathly Hallows.\\
4. Admittedly you are correct about the last book, it was almost entirely on luck and chance that they were able to do it. An amount of luck is good and acceptable in a story (and bad luck), but it was pushing it to an extreme. Admittedly Harry did get lucky before but it was more believable.\\
   Also Hermione was perfectly able to lie to teachers even in first year, she lied to the teachers about the troll. (Though admittedly she didn't need to, she could've just said she was there crying, or lie and say she was going to the bathroom.)\\
