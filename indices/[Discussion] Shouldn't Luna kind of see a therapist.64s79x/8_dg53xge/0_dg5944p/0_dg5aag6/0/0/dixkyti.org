It's been two months since you started this post and you just now reply to it? That does it--now, I'm mad.

  Not really, you don't have proof that any deity exists, so it's not bigoted to assume that none exists and treat people with disdain who believe in deities (I mean if you hear voices people commit you to the loony-bin, so why accept religion as anything different?
#+end_quote

I disagree--I think there is quite a bit of evidence for a deity. Entire branches of some denominations (the Jesuits from the Roman Catholic Church) have made huge efforts for scientific discovery. Some extremely prominent scientists agree that a Creator quite possibly

And in any case, absence of evidence is */NOT/* evidence of absence.

While it is not bigoted to assume that there isn't a God, treating people with disdain for having faith most certainly is--especially since you equate it with schizophrenia, and have suggested similar treatment as such.

  I mean it's not like I want to tell people what they can and can't believe!

You literally just compared religious faith to schizophrenia.

  As long as people do it in their own homes/private life and don't try to make laws that restrict my freedom because of their religious believe

First, religious doctrine in Christianity demands evangelism. The Great Commission that Jesus told his Apostles was to "go forth and make disciples of all nations." Thus, many believe it is a sin to keep their faith completely behind closed doors. Secondly, in regards to the law: Religious faith of government officials have shaped the laws of the Western World for the last three thousand years. Laws against murder and theft have their foundation in religious law.

  example: Abortion! Many religious people consider it murder/a sin, but then again: They have to choice to just not have one themselves

If one believes something is wrong, do they not have the responsibility to put a stop to it? And before you say "It's not their body, so it's not their choice" most pro-lifers say that the unborn child, the third party in the situation, is not getting a choice.

  As for being delusional: Well, believing in stuff that's not there is pretty delusional IMHO (book recommendation: Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion!) ;)

You think that little winking smiley face actually adds to that argument? And Dawkins is a hack. You want something to actually challenge your mind? Read the works of C.S. Lewis or Lee Strobel--atheists who examined the historical and philosophical arguments of Christianity and came to believe themselves.
