Not really, you don't have proof that any deity exists, so it's not bigoted to assume that none exists and treat people with disdain who believe in deities (I mean if you hear voices people commit you to the loony-bin, so why accept religion as anything different? I mean it's not like I want to tell people what they can and can't believe! As long as people do it in their own homes/private life and don't try to make laws that restrict my freedom because of their religious believes (example: Abortion! Many religious people consider it murder/a sin, but then again: They have to choice to just not have one themselves (which funnily enough many anti-abortion campaigners don't do, they'll have one when they get pregnant when a child would totally ruin their lives - case in point, I recently read a story about an abortion doctor who aborted the child of a college student who was the head of the anti-abortion-organization on campus...talk about a fucking hypocrite!), but if they want to restrict other peoples rights to have one then it starts being a problem...same for people who are against sex-ed in schools or who want creationism taught in class (often instead of evolution!))

Maybe Luna did receive help, but I seriously doubt it!

As for being delusional: Well, believing in stuff that's not there is pretty delusional IMHO (book recommendation: Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion!) ;)
