  Why bigoted?

Not so much in your original post, but scrolling down you mention your complete disdain for religion, snidely referring to it as akin to having "imaginary friends."

That's bigotry, that is.

  I want her to seek treatment for what I see as some grief left over from seeing her mother die and some delusions from her dad who raised her as best he could but actually needs treatment himself?

We have no notion that Luna didn't get some sort of treatment. She's clearly far more at peace with the idea of death, and the possibility of an afterlife, than anyone else in the canon, except perhaps Dumbledore or Nicholas Flamel.

There is nothing to indicate that Luna suffers from delusions, which are neurological in order. Conspiracy theorist and amateur cryptozoologist she may be, but the fact of the matter is she is *not* delusional.

At only a very few points in the canon do we actually see that Luna is factually wrong about the various conspiracies. [Sirius is not a musician. The Rotfang Conspiracy is most likely bogus. Fudge is not baking goblins into pies {though I wouldn't be surprised if he's killed a couple; we know he was trying to steal away control of the banks).

And similarly, Xenophilius does not appear to suffer from delusions either.
