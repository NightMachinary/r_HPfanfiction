Why bigoted? I want her to seek treatment for what I see as some grief left over from seeing her mother die and some delusions from her dad who raised her as best he could but actually needs treatment himself?

I don't hate her and frankly I wouldn't bully her or anything if I was in her class (I'd never bully anybody, I've been on the receiving end of that for 5 years, so no - bullying is a CRIME IMHO and any school should have a zero tolerance policy for it! So if you bully somebody? Well, have fun finding a new school asshole because you should be expelled ASAP!)
