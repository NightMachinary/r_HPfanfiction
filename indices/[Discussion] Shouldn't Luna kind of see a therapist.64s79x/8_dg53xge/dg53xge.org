Luna doesn't hear voices. Luna doesn't see things that aren't there (Thestrals are real, and the only other critters that Luna thinks might actually be in the room with her, so to speak, are Nargles and Wrackspurts--two species that are apparently bugs of some sort and cause confusion and disorentiation. In a world with Billywigs [tiny electric blue wasps that cause people to float when they're stung], those two are remarkably plausible). Luna is not delusional.

There's no indication that Xenophilius is delusional or deranged either.

While I have little tolerance for Sage!Luna, and acknowledge that the Wizarding World has much to be desired in regards to mental healthcare, I cannot bring myself to support your frankly rather bigoted position.
