What's so OC about Harry not loosing at Quidditch? In canon he only lost ONE game (the one with the dementors (or was it students pretending to be dementors...I don't remember it well enough))! So it's not OC at all :( (also: I'd love to know what you hate about the sport (I myself only think that the seeker is too powerful (to many points for the snitch) so it doesn't matter much what the other players do in most cases - other than that? I love it, I think the idea is GREAT (a sport which involves flying? Come on, that's cool!))
