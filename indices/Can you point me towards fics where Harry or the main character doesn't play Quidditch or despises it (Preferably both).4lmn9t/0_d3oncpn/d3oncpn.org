Lots of fics ditch quidditch. Lots of fics focus on other areas of the world so it doesn't make an appearance one way other the other. If I were you, I'd look at Hermione centric fics. Since she's not a quidditch player, anything she starring her isn't going to have huge amounts of quidditch. Things like linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine), linkffn(the arithmancer) and linkffn(applied anthropology) (which are all goods fics) would fit the bill. There are tons of harry centric fics where he decides he's too busy to play quidditch, but none of them spring to mind right now except hpmor (already rec'd) and linkffn(the art of self fashioning).
