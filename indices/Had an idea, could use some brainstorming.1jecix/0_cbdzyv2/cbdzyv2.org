You might find some inspiration in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity's]] Alexandra Quick series, which did much the same thing with a U.S. magical school, though he created an entire magical society in the U.S. with its own history, culture, and set of essential conflicts.

For me, the most interesting idea of a second magical school set in the States is the ability to change whatever you wish, emphasizing cultural and historical different elements that are uniquely American. For example, aspects of the Native American culture and spiritualism could be adapted for a Harry Potter world (for an example, see jbern's Bungle in the Jungle and the way it approaches the Animagus transformation). An idea might be to note the profound influence of the Jesuit missionaries on the mundane world beginning in the 17th century. What about the magical world? For a conservative populace that lives into their hundreds (some into their six-hundreds) and have rather long memories, this is recent history and the imprint of events like these is likely to remain to this day.
