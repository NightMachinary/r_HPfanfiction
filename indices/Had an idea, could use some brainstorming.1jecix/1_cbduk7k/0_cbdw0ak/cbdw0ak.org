Yeah, I'm trying to stay away from the hat but having a hard time coming up with a viable option.

As for the wizarding schools and different founders, I want it to have /some kind of tie/ with the harry potter world. I like the ideas of the founders, I did change the first names, so it seems more like descendants of the four original but a little different at the same time.
