Oh what about this hogwarts was founded on ~990 AD (Acording to HPwiki) this is before the discovery of the 'new world' which was in 1492, what if a decendent of Slytherin (or he himself, wizards live longer) went to the new world and founded this school

As for the selection, if you really need to, what about a talking familiar, some kind of ancient animal (think of the summon toads of naruto ([[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Toads)]])

What if insitead of sorting by personalities they sort by abilities (oh you will be good at this or that) or something

or simply drop the sorting.
