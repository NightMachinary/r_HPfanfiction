Just an idea, but change the founders names. All of the wizarding schools have different founders - so having the same founders names doesn't make sense. Also note that you can have more or less than 4 founders, 4 houses, etc. Each school would do it's sorting differently, I think, so you could really come up with some cool ideas for that! I think you should really stay away from a hat though if you are wanting to have it be unique. Maybe something with a task the students have to complete or something like that.

Just suggestions
