Before reading it... That was 4 years ago you're probably way better now :O Also I'm not really a SW fan so idk how much I'll like this. 90% of my knowledge of SW is from Darths & Droids and I never got past the start of the second one. Edit: If you don't know, Darths and Droids is SW but a D&D game, and it is probably nothing like SW but I'll never know... Theres something called the Lost Orb of Phanastacoria though which idk if that exists in canon...
