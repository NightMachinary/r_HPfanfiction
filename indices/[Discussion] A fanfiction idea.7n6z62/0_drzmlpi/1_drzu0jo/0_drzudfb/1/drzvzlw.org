TBH I find Hermoine's inclusion forced. I believe happy accidents and plot armor are bad. People surviving on chance and becoming one of the main character is stupid. Specially when adults are forced to be incompatible.

Hermoine should have died in troll incident. It works have forced Harry to rethink his 'friendship' with the first (and only) kid to talk to him politely.

It could have given Harry a more mature outlook on world too.
