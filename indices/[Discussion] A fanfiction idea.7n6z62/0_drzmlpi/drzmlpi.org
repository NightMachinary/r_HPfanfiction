Personally, I'd like to read a story where much of Ginny's baseline personality gets over written, and she decides to become the next Dark Lady. Realizing she'll need to off Voldemort first (as she still views herself as a separate person) she cleverly seduces Harry and manipulates him into become her champion. They kill Voldemort, then Ginny manages to convince Harry and co that they need to take over to prevent any more Dark Lords from rising. one by one, Ginny and Harry take out all who oppose them, until Harry reins supreme. Ginny happily rules as the power behind the throne, and keeps the Master of Death as her personal executioner.
