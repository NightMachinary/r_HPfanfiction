Hi OP,

I like this idea. I wrote a 8,000 character response detailing things you'd need to keep an eye on. Then realized it was getting a bit much and that I enjoyed thinking through this story. It doesn't derail canon and I think enhances it in a few places.

I'm going to draft a short story (no more than 30,000 words I think) and will promote it here, linking you when I do :)

I'd like to see your take on this story sometime. I think it's interesting when people with the same premise have their own creative twist on it.

I'll keep my original notes so that when I do upload the story, you'll all see how a premise spawned a reply that turned into a brainstorming session and became a finished story.
