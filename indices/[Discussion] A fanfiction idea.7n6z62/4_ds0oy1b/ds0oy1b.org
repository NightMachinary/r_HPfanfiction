Then so would Dumbledore (the ring), Ron (the locket), Hermione (the cup), Crabbe (diadem, but accidental I suppose so maybe not), Neville (Nagini) and of course don't forget Voledmort destroying his own pseudo horcrux ... by your logic all of these peaces would need to jump to a new host. So do take this into account. And if it is only Ginny then why others wouldn't? How would you destroy a Horcrux then? Is it indestructible?
