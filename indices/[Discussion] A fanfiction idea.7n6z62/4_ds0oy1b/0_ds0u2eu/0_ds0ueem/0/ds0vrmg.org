Maybe that could be a plot point of Horcrux nature? That they are indestructible themselves in a sense, because they will always latch onto something else if driven from a host? And yes the only way to really destroy them would be to do it in a way that there is nothing else nearby for them to jump to? And that would make it more creative and challenging in destroying them? Also yes hunting them would be harder because if a horcrux did get away you would have to spend time searching for and identifying the new host. :)
