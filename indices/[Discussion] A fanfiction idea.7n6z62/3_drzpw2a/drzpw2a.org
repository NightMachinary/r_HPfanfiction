/Could/ be interesting (although re: my advice not to spread yourself too thin between stories, or else you'll never finish any of them!), but I think if the soul-piece broke off Diarymot, it would be a piece /of Diarymort/'s soul, making Ginny a Horcrux not for the main Voldemort, but for Diarymort. The result would be that Ginny's existence would be tethering Diarymort to life even after the destruction of the Diary, and he could pull a Quirrell or something like that and then you could explore the results of having /two/ spectre versions of Voldemort floating around, each trying to get its own body...
