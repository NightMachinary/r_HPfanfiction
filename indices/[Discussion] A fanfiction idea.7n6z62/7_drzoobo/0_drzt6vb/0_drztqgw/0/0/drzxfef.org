  What would you propose as an alternative?

Alternative to what? Alternative plot? Have her die. Tom Riddle escapes, finds about his life, hunts down his real self, and becomes Voldemort. Ginny was a silly damsel in distress plot device.

It's better than:

OMG Harry you are back to Hogwarts, let me kiss you before you go again to fight. I'm sure my kiss will finally make us couple since my schemes of making you fall in over with me by making you jealous didn't work while you were busy fighting for your life.
