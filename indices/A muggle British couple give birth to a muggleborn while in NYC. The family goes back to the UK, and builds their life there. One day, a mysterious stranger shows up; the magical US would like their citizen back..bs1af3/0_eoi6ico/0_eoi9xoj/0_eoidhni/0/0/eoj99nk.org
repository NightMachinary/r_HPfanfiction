At the hospital your parents have the option of declaring whether to claim citizenship or not. They don't just force it on you.

There are two factors that determine what nationality you are born into : /jus sanguinis/ is the right of a person to be a citizen based on their heritage (in this case British), and /jus soli/ is the right to claim depending on where you're born. The US is fairly strange in that we honor both - if two Americans had a child in England for example, they wouldn't be able to obtain a passport from the UK because it doesn't honor strict /jus soli./ To an extent, many European countries will take birthplace into account, but only with other factors at play (such as how long you've lived there, language proficiency, education, etc), but being born there doesn't guarantee you any rights (this gets more complicated with refugee/asylum statuses).
