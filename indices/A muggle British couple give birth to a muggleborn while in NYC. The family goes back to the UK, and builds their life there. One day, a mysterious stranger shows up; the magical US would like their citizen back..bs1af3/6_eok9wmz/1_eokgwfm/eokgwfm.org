As I understand it, Hogwarts is in possession of a Quill of Acceptance and a Book of Admittance, said items being enchanted in such a way that, on the moment of a magical birth, the name of the magical child is recorded. The quill detects a witch giving birth, and tries to write in the book. The book refuses to open for the quill, until the book detects that the childs' magic levels aren't dropping, which would indicate that the witch had given birth to a squib. I'm not sure if places like Northern Ireland are covered, or any former colonies, like the first thirteen States. I read a thread on this subreddit a while back, discussing the range of the book and quill. Iirc, there isn't any word of Rowling on the range of the book and quill, but it's not impossible that the names of children born in former colonies could be recorded in this book. So as far as the wizarding world goes, it seems that you become a citizen at birth.

I'm on mobile and I can't link, but there's articles on Pottermore and the Harry Potter Wiki about this book and quill.
