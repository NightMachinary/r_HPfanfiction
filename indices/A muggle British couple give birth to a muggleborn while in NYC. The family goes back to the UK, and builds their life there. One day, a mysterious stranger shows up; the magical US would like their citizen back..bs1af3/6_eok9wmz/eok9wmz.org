I'm not sure the MACUSA would even bother. Even if the MACUSA is better integrated in its country that Magical Brittain is, in both case they are, in the end, different country.

Even if the baby is "born" in the US, I'm pretty sure Magical Brittain determine its citizen (or at least the Muggle born ones) thanks to accidental magic. So unless the couple left the US pretty late (with their child being like 7), he would probably have his first accidental magic in the UK, making him a British citizen.
