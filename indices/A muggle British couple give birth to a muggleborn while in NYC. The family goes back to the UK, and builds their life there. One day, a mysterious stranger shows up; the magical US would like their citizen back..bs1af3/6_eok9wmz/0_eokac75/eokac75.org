Though I would totally see one of the minister trying to bring a Muggle Birth Certificate to "prove" the a VIP is from their country and so should attend their school.

Ex : Voldemort kills the Potters, Lily sacrifice destroy him. Sirius refuse to let Harry to Hagrid, and seing the madness about the "Boy Who Lived", decide to leave the country with him. Monthes later, Harry has his first bout of accidental magic in the US. When he turns 11, the Ilvermorny sends him a letter (or whatever they use there), but Fudge come to their house with some ministry officials and Dumbledore (perfect situation for a good old manipulative one), and claim Harry is British and so has to attend Hogwarts.
