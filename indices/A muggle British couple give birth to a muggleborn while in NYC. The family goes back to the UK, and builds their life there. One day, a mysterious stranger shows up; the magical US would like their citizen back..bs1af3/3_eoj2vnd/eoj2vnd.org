Under muggle law, the child would be a dual US and UK citizen, barring exceptional circumstances. For this to happen, either MACUSA and/or the British Ministry of Magic would have to not recognize the British citizenship, which seems unlikely.

It's certainly possible for a representative from Ilvermorny to show up before McGonagall and tell them the kid has the right to go to school in America. If there's some kind of miscommunication, they might even tell the family that the kid is /required/ to go to Ilvermorny, since magical education is compulsory. But again, that seems unlikely.
