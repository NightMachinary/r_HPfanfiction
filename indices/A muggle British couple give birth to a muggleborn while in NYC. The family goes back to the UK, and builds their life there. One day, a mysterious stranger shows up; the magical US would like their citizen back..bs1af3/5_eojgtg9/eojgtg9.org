This wouldn't realistically make sense to me because there'd probably be a treaty between the 2 nations that would deal with this issue, especially because of when the American school was founded. I think the conversation would go like this:

Rep: Hello, I'm here from a prestigious school in the United States, here to offer your child a place in our school because he's a US citizen. Why were you in the United States?\\
Parents: We were there just to spend time in New York.\\
Rep: OK, have a nice day!

No need to explain magic to them at that point, Hogwarts can take care of that when they get there. 7 years later, a letter arrives in the mail confirming renouncement of US citizenship for the child and a clear payment account. Now, if the parents were there on student or work visas, the child would have to be told about magic because they have a choice of attending one or the other. If Hogwarts is chosen, the same applies. The reason is that in my head, magical countries have to accept the citizenship laws of their non-magical counterparts, and assuming compulsory attendance at school is required by US law, US citizenship would necessarily have to be renounced at the earliest opportunity (which is 18), and MACUSA or Ilvermorny pays the fees for that to USCIS. If Ilvermorny in this case is chosen, nothing changes wrt the child's citizenship.
