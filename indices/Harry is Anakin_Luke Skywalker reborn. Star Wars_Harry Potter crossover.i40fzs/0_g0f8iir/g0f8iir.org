"So," said the Goddess, smiling a terrible and knowing smile, "I ask you this - who is the one who is prophesied? His mother died because of a Dark Lord while his father screamed about betrayal from a best friend. He was sent to his aunt and uncle who did their best, their very best, to keep the boy grounded, /normal/ - but the boy dreamt of flying and thought of school as an escape from the grinding labor of his days. The old man with the white beard told the boy about his power, but he did not tell the boy the whole truth. He gave the boy an item of incredible power, an heirloom from his father, which the boy treasured. Secretly, he had plans for the boy. Beside the boy was the clever girl and the best friend who did seem to abandon him in a moment of greatest need - but he came back. The Dark Lord tormented the boy, but drew his notice to how very alike the two of them were - what similarities they shared. So which of you two am I speaking of?"

Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter stared at her.

"Trick question! The answer is both!" she cheered.

"Also in the books you end up married to a redhead," she added.
