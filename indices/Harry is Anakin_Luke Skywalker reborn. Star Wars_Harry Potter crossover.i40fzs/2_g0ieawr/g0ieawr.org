The closest one I recall is the excellent and ongoing /Balancing The Scales/ by Nemesis13. /Harry/ isn't the reincarnate though, rather:

Blurb: At the start of KOTOR I, Darth Revan and Bastilla end up Negative Space Wedgied to Earth when Harry is around six, almost literally stumble across him (because force), and immediately adopt him.

Spoiler as to who the reincarnate is (it's a few chapters in): Lily's Protection was some ancient, dark ritual Lily Potter invoked that more or less sacrificed her soul to Magic/the Force to do with as it pleased in return for saving Harry. She was reborn in the distant past as the woman who would become Darth Revan. Darth Revan wants to hug her son and murder idiots, and her son is currently napping.

In fact, I'm going to go reread it right now.

A second ongoing fic (that is updated far more frequently) is /Of Clones and Wizards/, by Zirakinbar. This one also is not a reincarnation fic, rather a nasty interaction with the Mirror of Erised drags Harry into the middle of the Clone Wars. It is of particular note because Harry only has a first-year education, so he has to get /really/ creative with what he knows, unlike many other crossovers where he's older, more savvy, and tossing complex wards and powerful spells around left and right.
