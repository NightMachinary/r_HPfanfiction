1k is a good day for me. 3k is a great day. Most days I usually average 500 though, if I write at all. Hence, my writing takes a freaking age to get through. I have a fanfic I've been updating since January 2017 and I've only managed to write 25k for it.

In general though, I just push myself to try and write every day and don't really bother with hitting a specific word count. I write what I'm comfortable with, and however much works for me in the moment. I may end up deleting a whole lot of what I write, but at least I've explored avenues in the story and decided that I didn't want to go down that path.
