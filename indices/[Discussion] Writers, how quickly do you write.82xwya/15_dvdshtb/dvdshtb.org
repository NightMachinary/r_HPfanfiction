For me there's a bit of preparing before I begin to write. Usually I take a few days to come up with the entire chapter on my head; what I think should be there. Then I go on to plan the scenes; how I imagine it would play out with the people involved. Once I have those things then I begin. If I'm just regurgitating words in my head I could get to 3k words in about 5 hours. If I'm thinking about things like style, appropriate words, voice, showing instead of telling, etc. I can get about 1k words in those same 5 hours. The former, while faster to finish, takes a lot of editing to become decent and has a higher chance of needing a complete rewrite. The later takes longer and can be more frustrating, but usually comes out better at the end and with fewer rewrites.
