I usually write between 15 and 20 pages, which QUOTEV tells me is like 5000 words to 7000 words. It takes me like a week to make a chapter, but I'm taking a lot longer with my latest one because my brain stopped working and I had to do some major reorganizing of certain plot points to make some things make sense or pay off later. :) Also to add more details and flesh out stuff, because my best friend Achille gave me that tip since he says my story seems to move too fast.
