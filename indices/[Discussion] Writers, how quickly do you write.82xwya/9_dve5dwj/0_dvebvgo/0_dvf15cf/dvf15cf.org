Pomodoro Timer, is basically a system where you work for X amount of time, and take a break for Y amount of time until you've done it four or five times. Which is when you take a longer break for Z amount of time. All of this is so that you can keep yourself somewhat focused on the task at hand. But not burning yourself out.
