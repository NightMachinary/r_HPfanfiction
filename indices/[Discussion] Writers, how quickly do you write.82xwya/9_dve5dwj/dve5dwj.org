Ok, so it's been a while but I do recall that I pomodoro'd myself to check an average. And with 15 minute blocks I'd write 500-750 if I didn't have the scene planned. But if I did I'd nearly double it and always go over 1K. Which would have been a good day if I did it for eight hours straight. But I think a full pomodoro of writing a day is a good start. If one feels like it one could continue with a second and a third set.

I'll most likely get back to it next year.
