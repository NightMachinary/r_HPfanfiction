For me, I can write 5k words quickly and none of it will ever be in any relation to the project at hand. Or, I can open my laptop, stare at a blank word document and then leave it sitting there for weeks at a time. Sometimes I can write a quick conversation between characters, or describe a part of a scene and then piece things together... I type fast, so when my idea is flushed out on the screen (or paper) I can go weeks before another hits me. Depends on what I'm typing, where I'm typing, why I'm typing, and if there's an enforced deadline
