It really depends but I tend to write a lot of stuff that never gets anywhere. For example I am writing on the next chapter for one of my stories and then get an idea for something different so I start writing a one-shot where Teddy and Delphi were raised as siblings by Andromeda, Harry and Tonks and only realise 1000 words in that it is far too angsty so I try go back to writing the chapter but at that point, my motivation for that day is gone so it's time for World of Warships.
