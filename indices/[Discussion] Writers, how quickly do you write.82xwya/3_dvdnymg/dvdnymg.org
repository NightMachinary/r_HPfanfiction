I usually don't set a specific number for myself but instead write based on scenes in my chapters. Normally, I have anywhere from 4 - 6 scenes per chapter and try to write 1 - 2 a day. Of course, in a typical week, I average writing 4 or so days. Also, I sometimes put an estimated word count on my planned scenes, just to get an idea of what neighborhood I'll be delivering into but I never, ever hit that estimated mark. I come in either too low or too high. For example, one scene I wrote just yesterday I budgeted it around 1,200 words. It came in at 4,160 words instead.
