When I write, I usually settle down to write a scene, which is usually between 700 and 3k words. Sometimes I'll really get into the fic, and write up to 5k in a sitting, but that doesn't happen super often. For the first fan fic I wrote, I struggled with getting over 2k words per chapter, and wrote a bit under 40k words in a year. With my latest series, I've cleared over 100k words since July. Like [[/u/TheGeneralStarfox][u/TheGeneralStarfox]] said, writing is definitely a skill, and one that gets better over time.
