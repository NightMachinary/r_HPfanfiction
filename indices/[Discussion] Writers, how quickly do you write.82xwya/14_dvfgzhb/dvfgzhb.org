On a day when I only have time in the evening: 500-1000 words

On a day with extra downtime: 1000-3000

On a busy day (typical, 4 days out of the week for me at the moment): 0-100

In short, depends on life events. My last long fic (114K words) was done in 3 months. But I had so much more time then. My current one that will be around the same length has taken 7 months so far.
