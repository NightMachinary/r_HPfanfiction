I definitely agree, though for me I find joy in the grind I suppose. I like it when it's challenging and I have to work to find the next part of the plot. Some of my happiest moments writing are when I'm stuck and trying to figure out which word I should write next.

I also feel like writing is a skill, and if you don't use it, it goes away. I want to be as good as I possibly can be, and I'm at my best when I'm writing almost every day.
