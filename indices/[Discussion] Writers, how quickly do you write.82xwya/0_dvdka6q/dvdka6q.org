It ebbs and flows. Some days I can't write my name, other days I write 5k words. I never really set specific times or dates, I just work on whatever "project" has my interest at the moment. The secret of writing is what I've found to be: only write when and what you enjoy.

Make time, be consistent, and most importantly /have fun/.
