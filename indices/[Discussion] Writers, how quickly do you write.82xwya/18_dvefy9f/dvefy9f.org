When I actually have time to write fic instead of just read it, my average is similar to my pro fiction: 2000 to 4000 depending on what I'm writing +and how quickly my deadline is coming up+.

But that's an average. Some days I literally write a dozen words; on most I hit my daily minimum of 2000; and on some rare, beautiful days, I'll magically reach a count â‰¥5000.

(Also, with fic, it's easier for me to zoom past 2000 words since world-building and characterization tend to be built in.)
