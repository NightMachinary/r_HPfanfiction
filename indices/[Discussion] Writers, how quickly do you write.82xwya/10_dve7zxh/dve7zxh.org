I struggle to put out 1k a day even when I set aside the time. My problem is that I'm something of a perfectionist. Doesn't mean my writing's good, not at all, but that I obsess over wording, constantly rewrite sentences, etc. I know logically that the best way is to just /write/ and come back to edit later, but it's a hard habit to shake.
