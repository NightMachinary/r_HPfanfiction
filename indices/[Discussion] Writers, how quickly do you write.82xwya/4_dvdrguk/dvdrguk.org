It depends on how easily the idea comes. I don't always write every day, but I usually get about 1200 words or so on average. I've done as much as 6 or 7k when the juices are really flowing. I did 200 words this morning before I left for the gym and I'll add more to that in dribs and drabs throughout the day.
