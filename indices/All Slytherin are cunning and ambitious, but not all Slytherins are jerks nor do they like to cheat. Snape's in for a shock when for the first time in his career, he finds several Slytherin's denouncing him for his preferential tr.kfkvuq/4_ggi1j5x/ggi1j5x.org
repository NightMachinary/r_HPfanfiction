After that comment, a distance was cast between herself and Daphne. That was fine with her. She danced to the beat of her own drum anyway.

"Come sit with us," she said catching Harry's sleeve as he walked into the room.

He hesitated, seemingly being torn between confused and skeptical. After a moment of trying to land on an emotion, he asked, "Why?"

She could have said it was because she wasn't like the other Slytherins. She could have said it was a way to apologise. Hell, she could have claimed it would be to help him with potions.

That's not what tumbled out her mouth, "It'll drive Snape insane."

In an instant she saw a mischievous fire light behind his eyes. A smirk carved it's way on to his face. "Hey Neville, seat with Ron and Hermione for me, will ya?" Neville looked taken aback before looking at his dormmates. He saw the two bickering and hung his head before heading to the seat between them.

Lilly watch Harry sit in the middle of the table. Daphne just turned and shook hands with him before showing him the notes she had taken from skiing over the chapter. Lilly, now sitting to the right, followed Harry's lead as he copied down notes as Daphne spoke. He asked questions about vocabulary and received answers from both sides.

The trio ignored the looks and whisperings that swirled around them. As if a barrier was set up around the three children and nothing could break through. Surprisingly Pansy was looking back at their table with a smirk. Typical, that girl craved drama.

Snape barged into the room. It wasn't until he settled at the podium did he take notice of their arrangement. If Lilly had to describe the look he gave it would be a cross between finding a dead fish in his bag and finding out someone had kicked his puppy down the hall.

"Oh, I am living for this," Pansy whispered back towards them. Harry snorted.

Snape started the roll call through gritted teeth. Daphne had a small smile up her lips and arms crossed. It appeared to Lilly that Harry was bitting the inside of cheek to prevent a smirk from appearing.

After roll was called and Snape turned to the blackboard, Pansy leaned back, her hair covering Harry's textbook. "I want in."

Harry raised an eyebrow.

"This game you're playing? I want in. Snape and his friends use to bully my mother in school. If I can give him a brain aneurysm, I would be able to die happy." Daphne overed her laugh with a snort.

Harry seemed to contemplate something before leaning forward. "How about I join you for lunch. I would love to discuss out future dealings."

"I hope this future dealings involves the twin brothers of you best friend," Lilly mentioned while underlining several words in her workbook.

"I think pulling Granger's brain in to this would be beneficial." Daphne whispered on the other side of Harry.

"Honestly? I think Longbottom could be a great underdog here." Harry pointed out.

"5 points from Gryffindor for talking," Snape snarreled towards them.

Pansy, Daphne, and Lilly all narrowed their eyes but didn't say anything. They worked in silence for the rest of the class. Harry managed to get out of the class before the other Gryffindor's. When his friends poured out of the door to the hall, each were grabbed and pulled into a vacant hall. Pansy had grabbed Neville, Daphne was pushing Hermione and Harry was dragging Ron.

"Mate! What-"

"I think it's time to take Snape down a peg." Pansy interrupted. "We'll show him what it means to be a true Slytherin."

"But he's a teacher!" Granger protested.

"So was Agatha Trunchbull but she still deserved what she got," Pansy argued.

Hermione blinked several times, "You've read Matilda?"

"Anyway," Lilly pressed on, "I have some ideas."

"Like what?" Neville asked nervously. Lilly knew that she would have to help build his confidence but that would be a task for later.

"For one, we need to make it long and sufferable."
