By the end of lunch, the new mix match group could see Snape twitching in his seat. Minerva was diving her time from staring at Snape and the Gryffindors that took up space at the Slytherin table. The blended group took up one end of the table with a considerable distance from the rest of the house.

It was such an odd sight that a 5th year Hufflepuff named Annie came to ask if everything was alright. She got a round of nods and some nervous giggles. With a raised eyebrow she wandered back to her table.

"Do any of you have an alarm clock?" Pansy asked peeling the crust of her sandwich before dropping it on her plate.

"I have one that my parents sent me," Hermione spoke up waiting for Harry to pass her the spoon for the cut fruit.

"Is it a muggle one?" Pansy contemplated.

"Uh, yeah."

"Perfect. Next question, do any of you know the doubling charm?"

"Geminio?" Neville answered.

"You know it?" Lilly spoke up surprised.

"I've never used it. I've seen my Gran use it when she runs out of teacup when guests arrive."

"Who wants to learn it?" Pansy pulled the attention back to her.

"What are you planning?" Harry eyed her.

"It's going to be a group effort and some people will need to make sacrifices," Pansy admitted. "That includes getting a detention with Snape on a Friday night."

"Why Friday?" Ron wondered. He was sipping on his second cup of pineapple juice.

"Snape locks himself in the classroom to brew on Saturday mornings until 10 am," Daphne answered. "No one goes in, he never comes out before 10."

"What does a clock have to do with this?" Neville dared to question.

"Picture this," Pansy started moving her plate out of the way to get her hand gestures into the mix without sticking her elbow into anything. "Snape, he's peacefully brewing. Suddenly a ringing starts. He doesn't know where it is or what it is. Five minutes later another one goes off. Five minutes after that there's another one ringing. They are hidden in different spots in his classroom. They are all going off at different intervals. Ringing overlapping until he can find them and turn them off."

"How are we able to hide them in detention? He'll be watching over us." Harry pointed out.

"Ron, are your brothers looking to make some money?" Daphne asked.

"You want them to cause a distraction?" Hermione guessed.

"They'd do it for free," Ron commented.

"Oh, I'm looking to pay for their silence. " Pansy informed him.

"And when are we looking to do this?" Neville asked in a low voice.

Pansy head swayed back and forth as she thought over the question. "Two weeks?"

Harry laughed. "Man, I love this school."
