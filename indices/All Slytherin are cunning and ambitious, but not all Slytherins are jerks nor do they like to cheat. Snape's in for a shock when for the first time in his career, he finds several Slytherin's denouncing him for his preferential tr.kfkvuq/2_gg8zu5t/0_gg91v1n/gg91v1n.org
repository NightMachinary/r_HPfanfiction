I would say, especially in the time of Harry's schooling it is there.

I mean Snape set Slytherin very much apart from the rest and isolate them from 3/4 of the magical community. And that in very troubled times.

If people decide to look at history and see that such crass bigotry as Slytherin portrays isn't going to work out in the long run and often has to pay repeartions or at least with a bad reputation, it makes perfect sense to say ally yourself with the other side.

Or say it is in 5th year and you have some Slytherins that want to be aurors or anything you need good DaDA grades for and has to deal with Umbridge. And then you hear there is a defense club lead by Harry and you can't even get invited, because Snape and co were such asses that Slytherin are not trusted
