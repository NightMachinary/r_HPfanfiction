I think it is a bit unfair to attribute all of Slytherin's problems to Snape. Not saying his actions are excusable or anything, and he doesn't exactly make the situation better, but Slytherins had problems way before Snape became a Head of House. It is known for being prejudiced according to history (Salazar Slytherin leaving Hogwarts comes to mind), had Voldemort himself as part of the house, and was a breeding ground for Death Eaters in the 70s.
