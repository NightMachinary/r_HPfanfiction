This could really work during Harry's first year. The Harry Potter hype was still really big when he entered the wizarding world, people would run up to him to thank him and shake his hand. This somehow disappeared when he went to Hogwarts (how is Draco the only person to search him up?), but it would be amazing if there were were a bunch of first years that still weren't used to sharing a class with Harry and still saw him as this hero like figure, like Ginny did. And are kinda affronted that Snape would dare speak to Harry like that.
