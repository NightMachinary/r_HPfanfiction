Oh yeah, totally. I think what I was getting at is that he'll pop up in that form in a fanfic or the flayed bit of soul will be mentioned, and it doesn't have nearly the same impact as canon does because you haven't been with Harry the way you were in the books.

Also, I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing and what I felt when I read Snape's pensieve chapter in OOTP. It genuinely felt like I was standing next to Harry in the memory.
