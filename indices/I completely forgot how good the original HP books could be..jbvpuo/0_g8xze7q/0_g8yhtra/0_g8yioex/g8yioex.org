While the whole homunculus thing was a pretty cool and creepy, at the same time, idea (assuming to convey how low Voldemort had fallen in his quest for power), what I was trying to point out is that those chapters (31-36 I believe) are so well written that you, as a reader, actually get to feel what Harry is living through in those moments. I remember that I first read that part during a family friends get together and I completely ignored everyone else and could not stop until I was done with those chapters.
