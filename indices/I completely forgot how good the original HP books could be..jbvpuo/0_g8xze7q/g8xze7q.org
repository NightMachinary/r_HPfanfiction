Yeah... I never read a fic that managed to replicate the rollercoaster of emotions that's the night of Voldemort's return in GoF: the enthusiasm before the start of the final task, the eeriness of the maze, the dreadfulness in the cemetery, the fear of imminent death during the duel with Voldemort, the hope when the wands connect, the chaos when Harry returns, the exhaustion and despair when Harry finally realizes what just happened, the fear of what's to come. So many things happen that night and in my opinion that's when the series really peaked.
