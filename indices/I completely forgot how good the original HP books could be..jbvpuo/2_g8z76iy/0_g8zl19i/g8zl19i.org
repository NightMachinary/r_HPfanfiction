No. I'd say you are growing up, maturing and just start noticing how bad lot of the writing actually is. For most part, HP fanfiction is written by teenagers, while there are exceptions, usually people stop writing once they grow out of that phase and move on.

There is however, a proliferation of common tropes. Which sadly make it seem like lot of the stories are variations of the same thing and are annoyingly predictable.
