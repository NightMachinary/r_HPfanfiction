There have been three books that I can remember getting a reaction out of me where I cried and raged and just sat down and stared at the wall with an empty heart. OOTP was one of those. Everything just built up so wonderfully.

Especially with Sirius. You love him because Harry so desperately loves him in the beginning. You become apprehensive with him when you learn about his childhood, just like Harry did. And then when he dies, it's senseless, heartbreaking, and tragic because you wanted to see him grow and heal but instead it's this awful, terrible death.
