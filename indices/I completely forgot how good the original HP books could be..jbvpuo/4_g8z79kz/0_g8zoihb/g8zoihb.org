I feel the opposite of how OP feels. Like you, I didn't like book 4-7 as much as 1-3 even back then, but canon material is just not as good as re-reading The Pureblood Pretense series for me. I've reread that and other fics more often than I have felt the need to go back to canon. Voldemort coming back and having multiple horcruxes felt like a rehash of the older plotline to me, and puts me off from rereading the later books.
