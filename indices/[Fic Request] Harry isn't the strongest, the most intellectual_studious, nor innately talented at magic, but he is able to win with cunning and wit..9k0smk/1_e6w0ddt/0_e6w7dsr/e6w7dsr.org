Yeah, JKR's magic system is ridiculously simple, so it honestly doesn't make sense when authors try to make characters in the series out to either be super weak or super underpowered. Spell casting in HP, when not involving Dumbledore or Voldemort, is basically just throwing spells at one another until either character either tires out or makes a mistake in blocking.

I'm not trying to knock JK's writing, but I really think that she was more interested in the world and the characters than the actual magic.
