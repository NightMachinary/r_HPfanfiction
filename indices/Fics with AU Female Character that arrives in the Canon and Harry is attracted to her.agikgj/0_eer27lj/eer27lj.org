Hmm, I think maybe mine may brush on some of those categories if you wanted to give it a go. Basically instead of a female OC arriving in canon from AU, Harry arrives in AU from canon, and then I eventually develop a romance between him and one of the OCs (you can probably quickly guess which one). She is a "tough fighting woman" as described, and then some other things happen, which fulfill some of your other requirements, but I don't want to go into detail and give you all the spoilers! Haha. But you may like it.

Anyway, it's fully written, and I'm posting about 2 chapters a week, and if you wanted to give it a go I'd totally love that!

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?
