Most of it is slash... and, well, /bad/ slash, isn't it?

Two of these are /tagged/ with a slash relationship but contain no actual pairing. More info below. So. Ones you've missed include:

- Dragon of Moria (pre-slash is kind of sort of implied, but nothing actually happens. It's more of an awkward 'oh! he's pretty!' kind of thing.) - Lotr crossover.

- Incendio - Hobbit crossover, no pairings.

- Hermitage - Vampire. Some anime crossover I've never heard of before. Pre-slash, I guess? Nothing happens, not even in the sequels.

- Emerald Eyes and Black Diamond Scales - a rather unique percy jackson crossover. I /think/ a slash pairing was planned, but it was abandoned before it gets anywhere near that point. So, warning if the author returns from the abyss?

- Birth of a Phoenix - animagus form, wbwl. Writing is a little rough around the edges (but not unreadable). A suprisingly trope-free wbwl, no pairings.
