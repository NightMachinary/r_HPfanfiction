linkao3(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Mother) is an odd one: infant Harry uses accidental magic to apparate away from the Dursleys to a magical creature who blood adopts him and raises him. So he becomes a human/Dragon hybrid. Then he becomes very Scottish. There is bashing of Ron and Dumbledore, Luna is freaking adorable.
