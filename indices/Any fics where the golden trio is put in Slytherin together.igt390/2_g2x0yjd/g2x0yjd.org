Interesting... What their ambitions? Something like

Ron: I will not be overlooked! I'm tired of being just one more Weasley I deserve better. Chess master, politics? Easy everyone is so predictable...

Hermione: I will change the world! Everything is backwards, blood purity? Bullsh*t here biology! Why quills?? Parchment? AND NOW SLAVES? I'm surrounded by idiots.

Harry: I will get my revenge! Fuc*ing Dursleys, Voldpants, Dumb-door monsters all of them! They stole my life and now they gonna pay...
