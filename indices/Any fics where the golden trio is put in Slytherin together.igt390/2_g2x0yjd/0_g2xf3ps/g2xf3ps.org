Basically, Harry is abused by the Dursleys or has suffered in an orphanage like Riddle (canon divergence obviously), Hermione has been bullied all her life for her appearance and her smarts and she's not about to be hexed by a shit ton of blood supremicts because they believe her beneath them, and Ron has ambitions to be different from the rest of the Weasley clan amongst other things. Harry will have already formed a mask to deal with the abuse of home, Hermione would have been used to the bullying as well and she would learn counter curses and hexes to ward off the worst of the racists, and Ron comes from a family from the Sacred Twenty-Eight so he was taught at least some things about politics and he has a wealth of information about the wizarding world that Harry and Hermione don't have. It's a little AU, obviously, but everything could be twisted to fit.
