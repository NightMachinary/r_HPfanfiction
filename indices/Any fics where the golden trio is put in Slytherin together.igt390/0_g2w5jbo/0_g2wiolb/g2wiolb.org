Wait, what? People write fics where Voldemort /apologizes/? I mostly agree with certain Dumbledore bashing fics, though. Like, based on mostly canon reasons and not making Dumbledore evil, just patronizing and so secure in his views that he knows what is right for the "Greater Good" that a little hurt to a little orphaned boy shouldn't mean much to protect the rest of the world.
