The thing is, greater good fics have no bearing in canon Dumbledore. He left that ideology in Nurmengard with Grindelwald. He truly believed keeping Harry Potter at the Dursleys was the only way to keep him alive. If he really was espousing Greater Good mentalities he would have done what a lot of goofy fics do where Dumbledore raises him from birth into a child soldier to throw at Lord Voldemort
