I have a fairly strong HC that Voldemort doesnt support pureblood supremacy and is just trying to kill off all the powerful purebloods through war as he really cant support pureblood supremacy or he'd be a bit out of place as a half blood..

Lestranges? Dead cuz of war, Blacks? Dead cuz of war, a lot of other "dark" pureblood families? Dead cuz of war
