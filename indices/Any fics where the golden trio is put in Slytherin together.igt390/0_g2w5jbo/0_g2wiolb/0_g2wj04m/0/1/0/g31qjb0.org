I personally believe that he was simply using them and their ideals for a means to an end. He believed himself to be a Mudblood originally, and so he allied himself with powerful families who he could rule over to help him with whatever he wanted to do with the wizarding world. Perhaps not killing all Muggles and Mudbloods, but maybe bringing back the "Old Ways" and teaching Mudbloods the ways of the wizarding world, which they should have been doing beforehand. They probably crossed out all rituals and anything that could possibly make Mudbloods differ from purebloods during Grindewald's fascist stupidity to rule over Muggles and Muggleborn.
