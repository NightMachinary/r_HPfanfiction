Ah. Yeah, Voldemort's actions of murder and chaos and whatever else shouldn't be reasoned with, though I don't mind if someone takes his ideals and mentions how he was correct. Like, Harry realizing that what he said about "There is no good or evil, only power or those to weak to seek it" is kinda true. But to make excuses for the way Voldemort went about things? Yeah, that's not gonna slide. Having Harry have some of his ideals (not pureblood supremecy, of course) and using them in a politically or morally grewy way is cool, though. Like Harry realizes that Muggleborn aren't the problem, it's the purebloods who don't teach them the ways of wizards and blah blah blah.
