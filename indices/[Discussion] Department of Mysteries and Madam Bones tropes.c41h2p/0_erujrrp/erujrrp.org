Amelia Bones is just an easy competent member of the ministry that isn't Dumbledore. Amelia Bones is a character that has the potential to be important if written correctly, people just don't do it properly.

The Department of Mysteries having things that Voldemort or Dumbledore don't know about is fine honestly, it is supposed to be a secretive department and it is supposed to be studying things most wizards don't know about.
