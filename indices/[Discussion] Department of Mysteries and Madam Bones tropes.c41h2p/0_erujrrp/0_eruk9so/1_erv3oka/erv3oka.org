  I like viewing them as a bunch of magical researchers. So a bit like scientists than spies and FBI agents.

Magical researchers who - Magical Britain being what it is - got their jobs based on nepotism, and who regard any form of systematic inquiry as a lot of nonsense, and the scientific method as a lot of /muggle/ nonsense. When they make any kind of advance or discovery, it's largely by accident.
