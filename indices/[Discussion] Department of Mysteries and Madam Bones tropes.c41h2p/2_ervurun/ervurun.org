I like the idea of the DOM being mostly just a bunch of researchers, but I also see them as sort of like containment. When something shows up that /really/ shouldn't be in circulation amongst the common populace (things like the Veil or similarly powerful and mysterious things that nobody understands) they have /one/ team that goes and, ah, appropriates these things for the safety of the people.

Seems like the kind of thing the Ministry would do.

It also sort of matches with what we see in Canon. The Time Turners aren't really understood, so they're all stuck in a room where they can be safely watched and kept track of (in addition to the obvious safety issues). The Brains are downright dangerous, the Prophecy room is rather self explanatory (as is the Veil room) and most other rooms are rather similar. They have all of these things for study and containment. It should be noted that the DOM is not intended to keep things (or people) /out/, but rather to keep the experiments and such /in/. If you don't belong to one of the rooms you won't have too much trouble getting back out; if you're an experiment God help your soul.

TL;DR- The DOM is almost entirely researchers, but sometimes research requires fieldwork so they have /one/ field team that collects any artifacts that need collecting and do any fieldwork that is required. They have few outside defenses because their rooms are meant to keep their experiments in, not people out.

As to Madam Bones, had she not been competent and powerful Voldemort wouldn't have killed her personally. If she lives she is useful, but the people in power will still hinder her greatly.
