As often with fanfics, I have nothing about the idea but a lot of problem with the realisation.

The DoM is the closest thing of a research lab in the Hp univers, so it could be understandable they know one or 2 thing Dumbledore never learnt about. But this information doesn't have to be usefull, and should not be over powered. The upper limit for me should be to give them an acient artefact they were studying that could potentially be used to seal/ kill Voldemort even with his Horcruxes (if only they could activate it . . .)\\
Or they could have one of them who studied a lot of soul magic and developed an item/ spell that can be used to locate Voldemort Horcruxe (but only after he has been calibrated to Voldemort's soul thanks to a Horcruxe, and only to a limited radius like km2).\\
In both case, they should not have a team of super agents able to take down anyone they wish to, or a "ritual" to clean a Horcruxe without destroying it.

As for Madam Bones, she is a very high ranked member of the Ministry with a reputation to be tough and honest. She would probably have been a better minister than Scrimeour was (and it's probably is why Voldemort killed her). But she is not a super lady who, had she lived, would have won the war in 3 weeks even without Dumbledore.

The problem of most fic that use them is that some author don't make any difference between a plot device and a plot killer. This 2 idea are nice to create divergence point from canon and create interesting story arcs, but if they do everything in 2 days without any intervention from the hero, then there isn't any story anymore and it's boring.

Also, seriously, Dumbledore and Voldemort are the 2 best wizards around, no one in Britain can compare to them. Rokwood was an unspeakable who became a Death Eater (and not even the most dangerous one), and the whole Battle of the DoM show that its security either suck, or Voldemort has enough influence on it to lower all the securities. If Croaker (or anyone the author put at the head of the DoM) was as strong as Voldemort and Dumbledore, he would have played a role, not stayed invisible for the whole time.
