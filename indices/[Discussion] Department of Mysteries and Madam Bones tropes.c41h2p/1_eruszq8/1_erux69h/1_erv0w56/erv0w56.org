For all his faults, Dumbledore need for secrecy is one of the few things I agree with.

Dumbledore whole plan would have taken one leak to become useless, since while Voldemort is arrogant, he is also not totally stupid. Had he known his secret was compromised, he would have change the hiding place of his horcruxes, or just tried to create another.

Also, one thing Dumbledore learned from the first war was that no secret was completely safe. He himself trusted Petigrew, and he betrayed him. It is also known that Voldemort had people working for him in the Ministry, worse he even managed to infiltrate the Department of Mysteries. And this is without even mentioning that Voldemort is one of the best, if not the best Legilimens in the world, meaning the information could be divulged without betrayal.

So who could he trust? The DoM was infiltred before, it could happen again. Madame Bones may be safe, but the one working under her may not be, and he fairness may also mean she would want to respect the protocole and talk with the Minister. Minister who is a spineless coward who could divulgue the information to "look like he is doing something" (something that his successor could also have done), try to save his hide by selling the information to Voldemort, or just be an idiot and talk about it with "his great friend Lucius". Also the only reason his Undersecretary is not a Death Eater is because she doesn't have his Mark, she is still as bad as them.

Even among the Order, there isn't really anyone whose contribution would be worth the risk to divulgue the plan (hard to search Horcruxe when you are teaching Transfiguration at Hogwarts). In the end, he only told Harry because his is a "sacrifiable pawn". It seem bad but Harry is someone who he is sure would not betray his trust (partly because of he trusts him, partly because he is already marked for death by Voldemort anyways). His friends may be a risk, but he would probably fail without them so they are a necessary risk.\\
And finally, he told Severus. I am convinced Severus was the security of his plan. It was someone he could trust that was high ranked in the enemy rank, able to lie to Voldemort and with most if not all the informations he had.

Had Harry failed, Snape would either have been the one to finish the job, or the one to recruit new pawns.

Dumbledore secrecy may be seem responsible to the death of hundreds, but considering the price of failing, I think is was a worthy sacrifice.
