I think you are vastly underestimating the detrimental effects of Dumbledore's obsession with secrecy. He hoarded all important info on defeating Voldemort and only passed it on to three undertrained teenagers, leading to the unnecessary deaths of hundred if not thousands (depending on how badly you think Rowling depicted the size of Wizarding Britain) of people. The Order does basically nothing in either war. Put in the hands of a group of competent wizards such as Bones in a position to cleanse Voldemort's influence in the Ministry, and a group whose entire purpose includes keeping secrets like the DoM, and yeah I can see the war taking a much shorter time.

Of course, this is all intentional (I would hope) plotting by Rowling. Without Dumbledore's secrecy obsession, the war takes like ten minutes instead of seven books. Then again if Voldemort was actually competent, he'd have made his horcruxes from rocks and dropped them in the ocean.
