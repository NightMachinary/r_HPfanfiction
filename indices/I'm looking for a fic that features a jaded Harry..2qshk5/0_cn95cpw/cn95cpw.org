I'm positive that you're looking for /Anguis: The Snake Within/ by Pseud0 Nymph.

Unfortunately, the fic has since been taken down as the author wasn't happy with a few things, but that was three years ago. You can find the author's FF.Net page [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1218259/Pseud0-Nymph][here]].

If you're feeling particularly nostalgic (or just masochistic) you can read the [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/pseudo_nymph/ATSW.html][first two chapters]] here on Schnoogle.

Hope it comes back one day, to be honest. I rather liked it to, back then.
