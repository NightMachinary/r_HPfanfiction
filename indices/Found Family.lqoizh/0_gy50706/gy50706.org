I forgot it's name, but there's a hp x percy Jackson crossover. Turns out Poseidon is one of his ancestors & the basilisk venom has a bad reaction & he literally starts turning into a male lamia (not sure. Something like Medusa). So Medusa adopts him & when he grows up, he literally makes another place just for all the half blood kids, be they Roman or Greek. A safe place where they aren't trained as soldiers & made to fight monsters. You should find it on fanfiction net.
