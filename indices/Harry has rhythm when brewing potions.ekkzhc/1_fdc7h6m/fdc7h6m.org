I haven't read this one in a while, but could it possibly be linkao3(10588629) Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions? Harry doesn't have any natural gifts in potions in this one, but he got really keen on the subject and eventually convinced Snape to be his mentor. But I do remember Harry being distinctly bad at it, at least at the start.
