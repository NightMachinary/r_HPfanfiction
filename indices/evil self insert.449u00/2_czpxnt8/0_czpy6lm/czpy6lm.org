  People always rant about how awesome it would be to be a Potter. Well, not me. For me, being a Potter meant constant fear and pain, having the whole world placed on your shoulders, being hated and feared because some asshole couldn't kill you as a baby, and it meant being a sacrificial lamb for a hateful world. But with what I know, can I change the rules? Dark self insert.
