I absolutely love blood and chaos! that moment when Jack realizes he doesn't like to kill the homeless because they don't have any stuff to loot afterwards and he likens it to a happy meal without a toy had me in stiches. And that scene in mirror/wish verse where he just casually [[/spoiler][mentions he killed notFaith mid sex and kept going]] was so awesome.
