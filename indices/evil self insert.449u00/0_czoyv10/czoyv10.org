Depending on what brand of evil you want the protagonist to be... I'm possibly writing two, but the one that's further along is not HP.

My Buffyverse SI gets turned into a vampire and is more comedic sociopath or [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil][affably evil]] than he is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz][Evil.]] Jack is less 'conquer the world' and more 'gather all the things of power' but he's slowly starting to butt heads with the other powers of the Buffyverse. He also considers Drusilla to be his mother, Faith his sister, and thinks that trolling Buffy is an excellent way to spend an afternoon.

My HP SI reaches a similar state by suffering a merger with the 16 year old Tom Riddle in the diary horcrux, but it's just starting out and gets written when I have writers block on Blood and Chaos.
