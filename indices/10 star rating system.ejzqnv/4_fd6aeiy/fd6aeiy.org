Star ratings never work. Look at RoyalRoad. People instantly 5star stories they like, and 0.5 star thinks they don't like.

Then you have the people who review bomb enemy stories.

It's just not worth it. I go by a mix of favs + look through the middle of the reviews. AND THEN~ I go to the last chapter and make sure it is actually the end, and not the author marking it as completed even though it is really dropped or abandoned.
